AB The characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater were identified based on its particle size distribution (PSD), biodegradability and acute toxicity. The PSD profiles were determined through physical segregation experiments using membrane discs with varying pore sizes between 2 and 3000 nm. The biodegradability was evaluated using readily biodegradable COD (Ss) and soluble inert COD (S-I) contents in wastewater, and the acute toxicity was assessed based on luminescent bacteria test. Domestic sewage samples were used for control experiments. The results indicated that PSD-based COD fractionation profiles could serve as effective fingerprints for identifying the characteristics of pharmaceutical wastewater. The COD component in pharmaceutical wastewater was found mainly as the S-I with size of below 2 nm, while little SI was found in domestic sewage. The biodegradability characteristics of the domestic and pharmaceutical wastewaters exhibited clear difference. The level of acute toxicity in pharmaceutical wastewater is relatively higher than domestic sewage. Also, the acute toxicity of the wastewater decreased after sewage treatment process.

AB Wastewater was collected from various stages and sewage sludge was collected from sludge bed of Vasant Kunj sewage treatment plant (VK STP) in the post-monsoon season. The treatment plant is based on extended aeration activated sludge (EMS) process. Preliminary analysis of the wastewater and sewage sludge samples revealed 11.5 fold reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) of wastewater after treatment while GC-MS analysis showed the presence of bisphenol P (RT =41.63), certain pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial compounds in effluent and sewage sludge, thus indicating the need for further treatments before their discharge into the environment. One indigenous bacterial strain isolated from sewage sludge of VK STP and identified as Serratia sp. ISTVKR1 was used for biodegradation of wastewater contaminants. Preliminary analysis of bacterial treatment culture showed almost 12 fold COD removal after 240h of treatment while the GC-MS analysis revealed removal of complex organic compounds like phosphoric acid triphenyl ester (RT = 30.017) and 4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- (RT= 45.36) and formation of simpler compounds like alcohols and aliphatic hydrocarbons such as 1-heptacosanol (RT = 32.66), docosane (RT =34.18) and hexadecane (RT= 29.621). Results of the study indicate the efficient removal of wastewater organic contaminants by the isolated Serratia sp. ISTVKR1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent has been implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), including pathogens, as the WWTP environment contains multiple selective pressures that may increase mutation rates, pathogen survivability, and induce gene transfer between bacteria. In WWTPs receiving hospital sewage, this selective effect may be more pronounced due to increased concentrations of antibiotics, ARB, and clinical pathogens from hospital sewage. To determine the extent to which hospital sewage contributes to the microbial community of disinfected wastewater which is released into the environment, we used 16S rRNA sequencing of hospital sewage, WWFP influent, primary effluent, Post-Chlorinated Effluent, and receiving sediments in a combined sewage system to track changes in microbial community composition. We also sequenced the culturable survivor community resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics within disinfected effluent. Using molecular source tracking, we found that the hospital sewage microbiome contributes an average of 11.49% of the microbial community in Post-Chlorinated Effluents, suggesting microorganisms identified within hospital sewage can survive or are enriched by the chlorination disinfection process. Additionally, we identified 28 potential pathogens to the species level, seven of which remained detectable in Post-Chlorinated Effluent and environmental sediments. When Post-Chlorinated Effluents were cultured on media containing beta-lactam antibiotics ceftazidime and meropenem, a diverse antibiotic resistant survivor community was identified including potential human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, and Clnyseobacterium indologenes. Together, these results indicate that although wastewater treatment does significantly reduce pathogenic loads and AREts, their continual presence in disinfected wastewater and receiving sediments suggests additional treatment and microbial tracking systems are needed to reduce human and animal health risks.

AB Environmental concerns have become an important decision-making determinant for consumers. Hundreds of emerging pollutants and their metabolites are listed as present in European aquatic environments and human settlements are blamed as major sources of water pollution. It was assumed that as long as water treatment is not totally effective and it requires a high amount of energy and resources, household's contribution through correct behaviour in relation to the load of waste they discharge in the sewage system can reduce efforts towards wastewater treatment. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to investigate households' perception and behaviour related to wastewater treatment services. Results are based on a random survey with a sample of 125 Romanian consumers of water supply and sewage services. A key finding is that investigated wastewater services consumers perceive the effect of discharging untreated wastewater in the environment as highly negative both on human health and on the environment, thus pointing out the importance associated by them to water treatment. This research argues that understanding wastewater services consumer behaviour enlarges the way toward reducing environmental disturbances.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) has a high detection frequency in soil, rivers, sediments, and organisms, and its ecological risks have attracted substantial attention. In this study, we analyzed the fate of TCC in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Zhengzhou, China, the biodegradation characteristics during the composting process, and the ecological risks of TCC when entering different environmental compartments. The concentration of TCC in the influent was 731.1?812.4 ng/L. More than 53.4% of TCC was biodegraded during the wastewater treatment process, and less than 2.5% was retained in the effluent. TCC was effectively removed through microbial degradation and sewage sludge absorption, and there were only minor differences in the different wastewater treatment processes. It is worth noting that more than 38% of TCC was enriched in sewage sludge (1430.1?1663.8 ng/g). The corresponding biodegradation rates of TCC were 65.7% and 82.8% in sewage sludge after 17 days of composting treatment with sawdust and straw as bulking agents, respectively. The estimated results showed that effluent discharge into the city rivers was safe. Composting could effectively degrade TCC and decrease the ecological risk of TCC when applied to sewage sludge.

AB The occurrence and distribution of eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides, and five macrolides were investigated in sewage sludge from 45 wastewater treatment plants in 23 cities in China. Among all the antibiotics considered, quinolones were the dominant antibiotics detected in all samples [total concentrations up to 8905 mu g/kg, dry weight (dw)], followed by macrolides (85.1 mu g/kg, dw), and sulfonamides (22.7 mu g/kg, dw). High concentrations of quinolones in sewage sludge indicated that antibiotics are widely used and extensive pollutants in China. Significant differences were observed for the total concentrations of antibiotics in sludge samples among the 45 WWTPs. To evaluate the potential factors affecting the antibiotic levels in sewage sludge, wastewater and sludge characteristics, as well as the operational conditions and treatment techniques in WWTPs were investigated. The results indicated that the antibiotic levels in sewage sludge depend to a great extent on wastewater characteristics. Significant correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) and total concentrations of antibiotics was also found in studied WWTPs, indicating that TOC could affect the sludge adsorption capability to the antibiotics to some extent. Moreover, the relation between treatment techniques and the total concentrations of antibiotics in sludge showed that antibiotic levels in sludge increased with longer solid retention time.

AB The discharge of relatively small volumes of untreated sewage is a source of wastewater-derived contaminants in surface waters that is often ignored because it is difficult to discriminate from wastewater effluent. To identify raw sewage discharges, we analyzed the two enantiomers of the popular chiral pharmaceutical, propranolol, after derivitization to convert the enantiomers to diastereomers. The enantiomeric fraction (the ratio of the concentration of one of its isomers to the total concentration) of propranolol in the influent of five wastewater treatment plants was 0.50 +/- 0.02, while after secondary treatment it was 0.42 or less. In a laboratory study designed to simulate an activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment system, the enantiomeric fraction of propranolol decreased from 0.5 to 0.43 as the compound underwent biotransformation. In a similar system designed to simulate an effluent-dominanted surface water, the enantiomeric fraction of propranolol remained constant as it underwent biotransformation. Analysis of samples from surface waters with known or suspected discharges of untreated sewage contained propranolol with an enantiomeric fraction of approximately 0.50 whereas surface waters with large discharges of wastewater effluent contained propranolol with enantiomeric fractions similar to those observed in wastewater effluent. Measurement of enantiomers of propranolol may be useful in detecting and documenting contaminants related to leaking sewers and combined sewer overflows.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) are widely used around the world to maintain human and animal health. There is growing concern that these compounds pass through sewage-treatment plants and enter the environment for potential harmful effects on living things. In this study, the occurrence of nine PACs (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, methyltestosterone, metoprolol, propranolol, stanozolol, and testosterone) in hospital wastewater, sewage wastewater, raw water used for drinking water, and treated water was studied in three sampling events representing different flow conditions, i.e., December, April, and June 2010-2011. Most of the target compounds were detected in both hospital and sewage wastewater samples rather than in drinking water samples. The most frequently detected compounds in the samples were acetaminophen and caffeine with increased concentrations of up to 160 mu g/L in sewage wastewater, while their concentrations were significantly lower in raw water. Generally, a seasonal variation of the test compounds in the samples was significant. All drugs were detected in higher levels during winter as drug use for diseases might increase through this season and a faster degradation and removal might occur during summer. The results showed that water had been polluted with these substances, and although purified by water treatment, reached humans via drinking water.

AB Residue of azole antifungals in the environment is of concern due to the environmental risks and persistence. Distribution, behavior, and fate of frequently used azole antifungal pharmaceuticals were investigated in wastewater at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in China. Fluconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole were constantly detected at 1-1834 ng L-1 in the wastewater. The latter four were also ubiquitously detected in sewage sludge. Fluconazole passed through treatment in the STPs and largely remained in the final effluent. On the contrary, biotransformation and sorption to sludge occurred to the other azoles. Ketoconazole was more readily bio-transformed, whereas clotrimazole, econazole, and miconazole were more likely to be adsorbed onto and persisted in sewage sludge. Lipophilicity plays the governing role on adsorption. The highest concentrations in the raw wastewater were observed in winter for the azole pharmaceuticals except for fluconazole. The seasonal difference was smoothed out after treatment in the STPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of five acidic drugs (Mefenamic acid, Ibuprofen, Ketoprofen, Diclofenac and Clofibric acid) were analysed in three sewage treatment plants (STP) over 4-7 consecutive days. The results point out that the five substances were persistent in wastewater effluents after municipal wastewater treatment. At the most, half of Mefenamic acid was eliminated. Ibuprofen was well removed (80%) by one sewage treatment plant. The removal of Ibuprofen is dependent on the residence time of wastewater in the STPs. A long raining period induce an important decrease of removal of Ibuprofen and Ketoprofen. Removal rates showed a great variability according to sewage treatment plants and types of treatments (e.g. biological, physico-chemical). The concentrations of Ibuprofen, Mefenamic acid and Diclofenac were relatively high in the effluents (150-2000 ng/l), showing a potential contamination of surface water. An environmental risk assessment is presented. Mefenamic acid seems to present a risk for the aquatic environment, with a ratio PEC/PNEC higher than one. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns have emerged regarding the presence of human-use pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. We investigated the status of contamination by 29 human-use pharmaceuticals as well as wastewater indicator compounds, fecal sterols and the synthetic endocrine disruptor nonylphenol, in marine sediments from Masan Bay, one of the most contaminated bays in Korea as a result of untreated and/or treated sewage. Among the 29 pharmaceuticals determined, 10 including antacid, analgesic, antibiotic, and antipruritic compounds, and metabolites of caffeine and nicotine were detected in all sediment samples. Cimetidine, acetaminophen, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals (frequency > 50%), and at high concentrations. The highest concentrations and detection frequencies were at stations located close to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfalls and at the river mouth. The spatial distributions of pharmaceutical were significantly correlated with those of wastewater compounds. These results indicate that occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in marine environments is likely associated with direct sewage inputs, such as WWTP effluents and with other sewage-influenced sources, such as river discharge.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been proposed to act as point sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Hospital sewage may contribute to the spread of ARB and ARGs as it contains the feces and urine of hospitalized patients, who are more frequently colonized with multi-drug resistant bacteria than the general population. However, whether hospital sewage noticeably contributes to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the general sewerage system has not yet been determined.
   Here, we employed culture-independent techniques, namely 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nanolitre-scale quantitative PCRs, to assess the role of hospital effluent as a point source of ARGs in the sewerage system, through comparing microbiota composition and levels of ARGs in hospital sewage with WWTP influent with and without hospital sewage. Compared to other sites, hospital sewage was richest in human-associated bacteria and contained the highest relative levels of ARGs. Yet, the relative abundance of ARGs was comparable in the influent of WWTPs with and without hospital sewage, suggesting that hospitals do not contribute importantly to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the investigated sewerage system.

AB Total adsorbable organic iodine (TAOI) has been used as a surrogate parameter for X-ray contrast media in municipal wastewater. Available methods require specialized equipment for pyrolyzing these compounds to convert the covalently bound iodine into iodide, which is then measured by ion chromatography. In this study we describe a simple method for liberating iodide from these compounds with Cu(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Concentrations of TAOI were measured in wastewater effluent, surface waters that were expected to be impacted by wastewater, and unimpacted surface waters. TAOI concentrations ranged between 1.9 and 16.3 mu g/L 1 in wastewater with a median of 6.5 mu g/L 1. The lowest TAOI concentrations consistently were detected in a wastewater treatment plant that apparently had few hospitals within its collection area. In comparison, TAOI concentrations in surface water that was unimpacted by sewage were between 0.3 and 3.5 mu g/L 1. TAOI concentrations in surface waters that were impacted by sewage were consistent with the expected conservative behavior of TAOI. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behavior of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) during mechanical-biological wastewater treatment was studied by mass flow analysis. In addition, the fate of FQs in agricultural soils after sludge application was investigated. Concentrations of FQs in filtered wastewater (raw sewage, primary, secondary, and tertiary effluents) were determined using solid-phase extraction with mixed phase cation exchange disk cartridges and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. FQs in suspended solids, sewage sludge (raw, excess, and anaerobically digested sludge), and sludge-treated soils were determined as described for the aqueous samples but preceded by accelerated solvent extraction. Wastewater treatment resulted in a reduction of the FQ mass flow of 88-92%, mainly due to sorption on sewage sludge. A sludge-wastewater partition coefficient (log K-d similar to 4) was calculated in the activated sludge reactors with a hydraulic residence time of about 8 h. No significant removal of FQs occurred under methanogenic conditions of the sludge digesters. These results suggest sewage sludge as the main reservoir of FQ residues and outline the importance of sludge management strategies to determine whether most of the human-excreted FQs enter the environment. Field experiments of sludge-application to agricultural land confirmed the long-term persistence of trace amounts of FQs in sludge-treated soils and indicated a limited mobility of FQs into the subsoil.

AB The quality of surface waters in lowland rivers is largely dependent on the efficiency of wastewater treatment. Even in the developed countries, there have been difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of wastewater management and the proportion of wastewater content (WWC) in the river, as well as in estimating the contributing human population. This study aimed to develop a wastewater quality and quantity assessment based on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the receiving waters. A survey of 53 pharmaceuticals in 324 samples (river water and influent and effluent of sewage (wastewater) treatment plants) was carried out in southern England in the River Thames catchment over four years. Carbamazepine was selected as stable marker and from its concentration WWC in the rivers and cumulative human populations along the catchment were estimated. The estimated population had a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.94) with that reported by the local water company. The concentration ratio of the labile marker caffeine to carbamazepine indicated the efficiency of wastewater treatment in the different treatment systems (i.e. trickling filter or activated sludge) and in the receiving waters. The ratio in some river samples revealed unexpected discharges of untreated or poorly treated wastewater, with a total concentration of the analytes (up to 20 mu g/L) five times higher than that in treated wastewater. Such information could be valuable to estimate the discharge or occurrence of not only non-targeted chemicals, but also pathogens within the basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This assessment is important for the sewage epidemiology approach, which uses concentrations of illicit drugs and metabolites in influent wastewater to back-calculate amounts of these substances used by a community or population. The results of this study showed that amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy and EDDP (metabolite of methadone) are stable in wastewater for 12h and longer. For benzoylecgonine and methadone, a modest formation in the course of time was observed (0.2% per h and 0.4% per h, respectively), while for cocaine (40% degradation after 12 h), ecgonine methylester (20% degradation after 12 h), and 6-monoacetylmorphine (20% degradation after 12h), a clear decrease in concentrations in time was seen. These findings suggest that for compounds with a significant stability issue, it is important to take their behavior into account when performing back-calculations in sewage epidemiology. However, this study also highlights the need of future research regarding transformation pathways of the individual compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater compounds are frequently detected in urban shallow groundwater. Sources include sewage or reclaimed wastewater, but origins are often unknown. In a prior study, wastewater compounds were quantified in waters sampled from shallow groundwater wells in a small coastal California city. Here, we resampled those wells and expanded sample analyses to include sewage- or reclaimed water-specific indicators, i.e. pharmaceutical and personal care product chemicals or disinfection byproducts. Also, we developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based model of sanitary sewer exfiltration probability combining a published pipe failure model accounting for sewer pipe size, age, materials of construction, with interpolated depths to groundwater to determine if sewer system attributes relate to wastewater compounds in urban shallow groundwater. Across the wells, groundwater samples contained varying wastewater compounds, including acesulfame, sucralose, bisphenol A, 4-tert-octylphenol, estrone and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Fecal indicator bacterial concentrations and toxicological bioactivities were less than known benchmarks. However, the reclaimed water in this study was positive for all bioactivity tested. Excluding one well intruded by seawater, the similarity of groundwater to sewage, based on multiple indicators, increased with increasing sanitary sewer exfiltration probability (modeled from infrastructure within ca. 300 m of each well). In the absence of direct exfiltration or defect measurements, sewer exfiltration probabilities modeled from the collection system's physical data can indicate potential locations where urban shallow groundwater is contaminated by sewage.

AB Estrogens are known to be potent endocrine disrupting chemicals that are commonly found in wastewater effluents at ng L-1 levels. Yet, we know very little about the distribution and fate of estrogens in coastal oceans that receive wastewater inputs. This study measured a wide range of steroidal estrogens in sewage- impacted seawater using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) together with the method of standard addition. In Massachusetts Bay, we find conjugated, free, and halogenated estrogens at concentrations that are consistent with dilution at sites close to the sewage source. At a site 6 miles down current of the sewage source, we observe estrone (E1) concentrations (520 +/- 180 pg L-1) that are nearly double the nearfield concentrations (320 +/- 60 pg L-1) despite 9- fold dilution of carbamazepine, which was used as a conservative sewage tracer. Our results suggest that background E1 concentrations in Massachusetts Bay (similar to 270 +/- 50 pg L-1) are derived largely from sources unrelated to wastewater effluent such as marine vertebrates.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a cost-effective, comprehensive, and non-invasive technique capable of determining semi-real-time community usage of drugs utilizing the concentration of drug residues in wastewater, wastewater inflow, and the population size served by a wastewater treatment plant. In this study, semi-real-time consumption rates of ten illicit drugs were determined using sewage epidemiology during special events including Independence Day, the 2017 solar eclipse, and the first week of an academic semester in the Midwestern United States. The average per-capita consumption rate of amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and THC were significantly different between two similar-sized communities during Independence Day observation week (p < 0.046) and a typical week (p < 0.001). Compared to a typical day, the consumption rate of amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine, and methadone was significantly higher on Independence Day (p < 0.021) and during solar eclipse observation (p = 0.020). The estimated percentage of the population that consumed cocaine in a community is similar to the conventionally estimated consumption of cocaine; however, the combined estimated population that consumed amphetamine and methamphetamine based on sewage epidemiology was similar to 2 to 4 fold higher than the conventional estimates. This study is the first to compare community use of drugs during special events in the USA using sewage epidemiology. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment has been an issue of growing concern. Conventional wastewater treatment has limited effectiveness with many pharmaceuticals at concentrations of ppb or ppt scale. An intuitive solution would be to treat the pharmaceuticals-contaminated wastewaters at the source sites before dilution in sewer networks. Health institutions with concentrated drug consumption provide logical point sources for pharmaceuticals entering the sewage. This paper describes the pilot-scale removal of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from real wastewaters via gas-phase pulsed corona discharge oxidation. The process was studied for raw sewage from a public hospital and for biologically treated wastewater of a health-care institute. The non-selective oxidation of the observed pharmaceuticals (32 compounds) was effective at reasonable energy cost: 87-% reduction in residual pharmaceuticals (excluding biodegradable caffeine) from raw sewage was attained with 1 kWh m(-3) from the raw sewage and 100% removal was achieved for biologically treated wastewater at only 0.5 kWh m(-3). The impact for affected aquatic environments upon the present solution would be a dramatically reduced load of pharmaceutical accumulation.

AB Reducing pathogenic risks in surface waters impacted by leaking or overflowing sewage requires the ability to detect human excreta in raw sewage, discriminate human excreta from other types of animal excreta, and differentiate between treated wastewater and raw sewage. We used the relative concentrations of a degradable, human-specific pharmaceutical and a persistent artificial sweetener to indicate the presence of human excreta, its degree of environmental degradation, and the amount of dilution by freshwater sources. Samples were collected and analyzed for acetaminophen and sucralose between 2016 and 2018 from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and streams in metropolitan Lexington, Kentucky (USA). Both co-analytes were consistently present in raw sewage, with acetaminophen in higher concentrations than sucralose. The presence of acetaminophen was related primarily to untreated human excreta, with concentrations rapidly decreasing upon treatment to nearly undetectable levels in WWTP effluents and streams. Sucralose in surface waters was related to inputs of both raw sewage and WWTP effluents. The ratio of acetaminophen to sucralose concentrations in raw sewage and spiked river waters exhibited linear decay kinetics with respect to time, with larger decay constants observed at higher temperatures. This co-analyte indicator approach was evaluated at a local site previously suspected of receiving raw sewage. The presence and ratios of the co-analytes indicated the presence of domestic sewage that was not fully treated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are widely used as flame retardants. In this study, the occurrence and distribution of six OPEs were investigated in sewage sludge from 24 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 18 cities of Henan province, Central China. The results indicated that all target OPEs were detected in the sludge samples with the detection rate of 95.8%, except tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate (TDCP). The total concentration of the six OPEs ranged from 38.6 to 508 mu g kg(-1). Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), and tris(2-chloroiso-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) were found to be predominant, with concentrations ranging from 2.50 to 203, 1.60 to 383, and 6.70 -161 mu g kg I, respectively. The potential factors affecting OPE levels in sewage sludge, such as wastewater source, sludge characteristics, operational conditions, treatment techniques, and total organic carbon (TOC) of sludge in WWTPs were investigated. The results indicated that the total concentration of OPEs in sewage sludge has no significant relationship with the individual parameters (p > 0.05). However, significant correlations were found between triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) level and treatment capacity (R = 0.484, p < 0.05), processing volume (R = 0.495, p < 0.05), and serving population (R = 0.591, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the relationship between treatment techniques and the total concentration of OPEs in sewage sludge was also investigated in this study, and the results illustrated that the levels of OPEs in sludge were independent of the solid retention time (SRT).

AB Organic micropollutants (MPs), in particular xenobiotics and their transformation products, have been detected in the aquatic environment and the main sources of these MPs are wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, an additional cleaning step is necessary. The use of activated carbon (AC) is one approach to providing this additional cleaning. Industrial AC derived from different carbonaceous materials is predominantly produced in low-income countries by polluting processes. In contrast, AC derived from sewage sludge by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a regional and sustainable alternative, based on waste material. Our experiments demonstrate that the HTC-AC from sewage sludge was able to remove most of the applied MPs. In fact more than 50% of sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and bezafibrate were removed from artificial water samples. With the same approach carbamazepine was eliminated to nearly 70% and atrazine more than 80%. In addition a pre-treated (phosphorus-reduced) HTC-AC was able to eliminate 80% of carbamazepine and diclofenac. Atrazine, sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate were removed to more than 90%. Experiments using real wastewater samples with high organic content (11.1 g m(-3)) succeeded in proving the adsorption capability of phosphorus-reduced HTC-AC.

AB The present study was under taken to investigate the occurrence of ofloxacin in hospital wastewater, municipal wastewater and in river; water receiving the sewage.; along with the assessment of antibiotic resistant Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhi) in these-waters. Transfer of antibiotic resistance between two different strains of bacteria was also studied. Untreated sewage from the three hospitals (Mayo, Services and Jinnah) directly entering into municipal wastewater and ultimately flows into the river Ravi without any prior treatment. The concentration of ofloxacin in wastewater of the three hospitals was ranged between 10.69 to 30.55 mu g mL(-1). However, before mixing of the hospital wastewater, concentration of ofloxacin in the three municipal wastewater drains (receiving the wastewater) was ranged between 0.26 to 0.43 mu g mL(-1). Downstream to the hospitals, increase in concentration was observed and concentration was ranged between 0.54 to 1.29 mu g mL(-1). The river water was not contaminated with ofloxacin upstream to the city, while a concentration of the antibiotic down-stream to the city was 0.067 mu g mL(-1). All the water samples collected from hospital and municipal wastewater drains were contaminated with S. typhi. It was noted that hospital isolates were more resistant (50%) to ofloxacin as compare to municipal wastewater isolates (16.7%). No S. typhi was-detected from the river water before entering first municipal wastewater drain from the city. Downstream to first municipal: wastewater drain:S. typhi were detected and:33% of them were resistant to ofloxacin. The bacterial isolates isolated from river water downstream to the city were 100% resistant-to the antibiotic: The results of co-culture of ofloxacin resistant S. typhi and ofloxacin sensitive Escherichia coli revealed that the resistant S. typhi were able to transfer the antibiotic resistance to another species.

AB The industrial development, urbanization and agriculture play a major role in the degradation of the global environmental. Thus, the wastewater treatments need to be monitored continuously to ensure efficient operation. This manuscript presents an application of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) associated with chemometric and quantitative analyses to study the wastewater before and after the sewage treatment plant (STP). The concentration of compounds related to organic matter degradation ranged with treatment and seasonality. Anomalous discharges and the influence of stormwater on the sewage composition were further identified. All the variations indicated that the employed procedure might be useful to enhance the effectiveness of STPs, plan prevention actions for equipment protection and preserve the environment.

AB A multi-residue HPLC/UV/Fluorescence method was developed for a screening of the most consumed pharmaceuticals (methotrexate, caffeine, diclofenac, glimepiride, ibuprofen) in Jordan. The analytes were identified (mu g/L concentrations) in wastewater, and identification was confirmed using spiked samples. The separation was done on a RP-C-8 column at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min using H2O/ acetonitrile (1/1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent. Aliquots (200 ml of each sample) were extracted and cleaned-up using C18 cartridges (500 mg). Wastewater samples were gathered from three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Amman/Jordan and two hospital outer drains, and maximum concentrations for methotrexate, caffeine, glimepiride, ibuprofen and diclofenac were found to be 699, 1187, 90, 66 and 65 mu g/L.
   There are differences in the efficiency of removing the studied pharmaceuticals from STPs. This could be referred to the different treatment systems, the nature and the concentration of the drugs in wastewater. In this work, the % removal efficiency of the studied drugs was found to range between 25-100%.

AB Pharmaceuticals (PhCs) are organic contaminants that have been detected in wastewater, surface water, and soils throughout the world. The presence of 10 commonly used PhCs in Spain (azithromycin, benzylpenicillin, citalopram, fluconazole, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, irbesartan, olanzapine, telmisartan, and venlafaxine) was analysed at four wastewater treatment plants, and the changes in their concentrations during treatment were assessed. Although certain some PhCs were degraded in the treated water, their presence in sewage sludge increased in all cases. The sewage sludge was composted using rice straw to degrade the PhCs, and the composting efficiency was modified by changes in the relative C/N ratio of the composting blend. Using a simple microbiological culture process for enrichment, 11 different strains of microorganisms that degraded specific PhCs were identified. Ibuprofen and azithromycin were metabolized by one and four strains, respectively, and both PhCs were used as a carbon source; in addition, six strains used irbesartan as a nitrogen source.

AB We investigated the occurrence of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in Tokyo Bay during dry and wet weather and evaluated the contributions of wastewater effluent, untreated wastewater, and surface runoff by using two sewage markers, caffeine and crotamiton. Sigma 8PFCAs ranged from 11 to 185 ng L(-1). Perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was the major species, followed by perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA). Principal component analysis followed by multiple linear regression revealed that the PFCAs were derived mainly from wastewater effluent during dry weather, and jointly from wastewater effluent (59%) and combined sewer overflow (41%) during wet weather. We used caffeine-to-crotamiton ratios to evaluate the contributions of untreated wastewater and wastewater effluent. Estimated concentrations of wastewater-derived PFCAs were much lower than observed concentrations during wet weather, indicating the contribution of surface runoff to contamination. During a combined sewer overflow, surface runoff had a significant effect on contamination in the bay.

AB Sub-lethal toxicological responses are common occurrences in aquatic animals exposed to sewage wastewater and organic wastewater contaminants. Behavioural alterations are particularly sensitive indicators of sub-lethal toxicological stress in animals exposed to various pollutants, and often correlate with higher-level outcomes. Diurnal activity patterns in many fish species are sensitive to changes in natural biotic factors, but few studies have explored how environmental pollutants influence such rhythms. We investigated diurnal activity patterns in the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), after exposure to UV-treated sewage and a mixture of key contaminants identified through chemical analysis and subsequent risk-based prioritization of the wastewater. Exposure to 50% and 100% wastewater abolished daytime activity levels in male, but not female fish. Chemical analysis identified fluoxetine, diazinon and triclosan above their reported predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PNECs), and fish were thus exposed to a mixture of these compounds at 1, 10 and 100 g l(-1). Behavioural responses were highly consistent between fish exposed to wastewater and the contaminant mixture, indicating that these prioritized contaminants are indeed likely contributing to the observed effects. Effective concentrations of the mixture were considerably lower than those reported as eliciting behavioural effects in previous studies exploring each of these compounds alone. Results warn of the potential for negative higher-level consequences associated with exposures of fish to common organic wastewater contaminants, as altered diurnal activity patterns could conceivably scale-up to influence performance including foraging success and predator avoidance. Further research is necessary to increase our understanding of linkages between alterations to diurnal activities and effects at the population level. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
   Diurnal activity patterns occur in many fish species and are sensitive to changes in natural factors. We exposed the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to treated sewage and a mixture of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) identified in the wastewater, and quantified outcomes on diurnal rhythms. Daytime activity was abolished in male fish exposed to sewage and the mixture, whereas female activity was only significantly reduced with the PPCP mixture. Results demonstrate that diurnal activities provide a sensitive indication of sub-lethal toxicity in fish exposed to environmental pollutants.

AB With the increasing use of drugs in cities, the sewer is becoming the most suitable place for antibiotic accu-mulation and transfer. In order to reveal the occurrence and fate of antibiotic sewage during pipeline migration, we used an anaerobic reactor device to simulate the concentration change of minocycline in the sewer and its impact on the sewage quality. The results showed that 90.8 % of minocycline was removed during sewer transportation. In the presence of minocycline, although the consumption of Chemical Oxygen Demand and total nitrogen in the sewage did not change significantly, the consumption rate of total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen and the growth rate of ammonia nitrogen at the front end of the pipeline were decreased from 29.4 %, 86.3 %, 60.3 % to 3.7 %, 81.5 %, 18.3 % respectively. Minocycline inhibited the reduction of SO42? , while also reducing the production of H2S gas and increasing the release of CH4 gas. Moreover, the decline in the abundance of functional bacteria such as phosphorus accumulating organisms was consistent with the consumption of sewage nutrients. This experiment provides data support for the risk of wastewater leakage of medical and pharmaceutical wastewater into domestic sewage, and will helps to maintain the safe operation of actual sewage pipes.

AB Two multi-residue methods based on off-line solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS have been applied in samples collected from three sewage treatment plants for the identification and quantification of licit and illicit drugs. The occurrence of the drugs in wastewater appears to be influenced by both the operational parameters of each plant and their consumption in the area served by the corresponding plant. Generally, the present study demonstrated that both licit and illicit drugs were found in the effluent wastewater of all urban wastewater treatment plants; a fact suggesting that they are bioresistance. These compounds were determined in relatively high concentrations (licit drugs: below limit of detection (BLD) to 5520 ng/L and illicit drugs: BLD to 5815 ng/L) in all effluent wastewater samples monitored in this study. The major groups of licit drugs detected in the effluents were antibiotics, b-blockers, analgesics, and non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs suggesting that these compounds show a noticeable resistance against the biological treatment applied. The concentrations of antibiotics and b-blockers in the effluents ranged from ca. 4 to 200 ng/L and 40 to 500 ng/L, respectively. Concerning the illicit drugs, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were detected in almost all effluent samples with median values of 1 and 3 ng/L, respectively.

AB Local consumption data of pharmaceuticals were used to study the emission to wastewater and surface waters in two small Dutch water catchments. For nine high consumption pharmaceuticals: metformin, metoprolol, sotalol, losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac and carbamazepine, predicted emissions were compared to wastewater concentrations, removal in sewage treatment plants and recovery in regional surface water. The study shows that local consumption data can be very useful to select pharmaceuticals for monitoring and to predict wastewater concentrations. Measured influent concentrations were on average 78% with a range of 31-138% of predicted influent concentrations. Metformin is the pharmaceutical with the highest concentration in wastewater (64-98 mu g/L) but it is removed with >98% in sewage treatment plants (STP). Guanylurea, a biodegradation product of metformin, was detected in SIP effluents and surface waters at concentrations of 39-56 mu g/L and 1.8-3.9 mu g/L, respectively. The STP removal of the different pharmaceuticals varied strongly. For carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide and sotalol a significant better removal was found at higher temperatures and longer hydraulic retention times while for metoprolol significantly better removal was only observed at higher temperatures. Predicting environmental concentrations from regional consumption data might be an alternative to monitoring of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and surface waters.

AB Concerns over the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) within the environment have been growing with the advent of more precise analytical methods. The discharge of municipal wastewater has been identified as a significant source of these contaminants, particularly where wastewater treatment is minimal. Here we present results from a comprehensive monitoring regime located around Victoria, BC, Canada. Samples were collected between 2009 and 2016 from a variety of sources including marine water, sediment and biota adjacent to two major untreated sewage outfalls, as well as the sewage itself. PPCP concentrations within the untreated sewage were high, and the sediment surrounding the outfalls showed corresponding contamination. However, this contamination dropped quickly with distance from the outfall such that by 800 m distance most PPCPs were below detection limits. Tissue samples of resident Northern Horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus) collected adjacent to one of the major sewage outfalls showed high single sample concentrations of the antimicrobial triclosan (317 ng g(-1) dry weight), the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (176 ng g(-1) dry weight), as well as the antidepressant sertraline (84.1 ng g(-1) dry weight). Reference stations from around the region showed very low concentrations of contamination with almost all PPCP concentrations being below detection limits. Within the sewage, concentrations were largely stable overtime, with the exception of triclosan and triclocarban which both showed declines over the study period.

AB The effectiveness of a sequenced biological-physicochemical reactor system for treating sewage was studied. The biological degradation was conducted in a Sequential Batch Reactor, which had innovative features for simplifying the operation and maintenance of the reactor. The reactor was operated at 4, 6, 8, and 12 hr cycle. Up to 82% removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), 50% removal of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), 45% removal of Total Nitrogen (TN), and 45% removal of Total Phosphorus (TP) were achieved. The treated effluent was further polished in a continuous-flow bipolar-mode electrochemical reactor to remove additional recalcitrant organic matter from the wastewater. The process parameters were optimized using Response Surface Methodology. At the optimum condition (pH = 8.7; Current = 1.0; reaction time = 9.0), up to 90% removal of COD, 67% removal of DOC, 61% removal of TN, and 99.9% removal of TP were achieved in the coupled system. Micropollutants belonging to Pharmaceutically Active Compounds, pesticides, etc., were significantly removed. The coupled system completely removed Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. However, coliforms were detected at the outlet samples. A UV or ozone disinfection treatment is recommended for the safe reuse of the treated water for nonpotable purposes.
   Practioner points
   Sequential sequential batch reactor-electrochemical reactor process (SBR-ECR) technology is effective for micropollutant removal from sewage.
   The coupled SBR-ECR system requires less footprint compared to conventional biological systems for wastewater treatment.
   Carbon material balance study revealed that more than 60% of carbon escapes from wastewater in the form of CO2

AB Discharge of sewage to the environment in the form of treated or untreated wastewater can have serious impacts on human health and quality of life and on ecosystem condition. Since a previous review in 1997, upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities, along with improved source control, have produced successes in reducing loadings of certain pollutants (e.g., mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls) to Canadian waters. However, nationally, loads of phosphorus discharged from wastewater treatment facilities have not changed in recent years (2003-2008), and releases of nitrogen have increased slightly. In some locations, wastewater discharges are contributors to bacterial contamination, toxicity from heavy metals and ammonia, and eutrophication, all of which continue to threaten public and environmental health. An increasing number of studies are also demonstrating developmental, reproductive, and behavioural changes in fish and other aquatic organisms from exposure to pharmaceuticals, personal-care products, or other pollutants in domestic wastewater, even after treatment. Minimizing wastewater discharge and mitigating its effects on the environment and human health will be a challenge. It is critical that gains achieved by improved wastewater treatment and other control measures not be reversed by relaxation of efforts or by failure to keep pace with population growth.

AB The occurrence of quinolone antibiotics (QAs) was investigated in wastewater effluents and surface river/lake waters in the US and Canada by using solid-phase extraction with mixed phase cation exchange disk cartridge and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography fluorescence detection (LC-FLD). Ofloxacin (OFL) was detected in secondary and final effluents of a wastewater treatment plant (WWP) in East Lansing, Michigan, at concentrations of 204 and 100 ng/l, respectively. The mass flow calculation, estimated by multiplying the OFL concentration in the final effluent by the average influent volume of the WWTP. showed that the discharge of OFL to the river was 4.8g/day. The OFL concentrations in wastewater effluents measured in this studs, are comparable to or less than those observed in several European countries. QAs were not detected in river and lake waters analsyed in this studs,. which may due to dilution effects and to the higher detection limits. relative to those reported previously OFL concentrations were approximate to1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the EC50 concentrations for environmental bacterium. However, greater concentrations of other QAs in sewage sludge from WWTPs may result in cumulative effects. Considering that the sewage sludge is applied to the land as fertilizers. soil-dwelling organisms could experience greater exposures to such antibiotics. Monitoring studies of QAs in sewage from WWTPs and in sediment/soil near aquaculture facilities and livestock farms will be necessary for the evaluation of the environmental distribution and risk of these compounds.

AB There has been increasing research focusing on the detection and occurrence of wastewater contamination in urban water systems. To find suitable markers to indicate industrial and domestic sewage flows inappropriately entering storm drains, this study investigated the occurrence and fate of 52 chemical markers through wastewater treatment facilities of manufacturers of agricultural and sideline products, beverage products, and pharmaceutical products, which are also consumed in our daily life. Of the 52 candidate markers, sodium, chloride, potassium, isomalto-oligosaccharide, acesulfame, theanine, glycerol, and clarithromycin were found to be conservative markers, with an average change in concentrations through the wastewater treatment processes of <30%. These markers are useful in identifying industrial and domestic sewage flow contamination in urban sewers. Specially, sodium, chloride, potassium, isomalto-oligosaccharide, acesulfame, and clarithromycin exhibited higher concentrations in blackwater than in greywater, with detected average concentrations of 43.8 mg/L, 189 mg/L, 37.3 mg/L, 123 mu g/L, 37.2 mu g/L and 0.99 mu g/L in blackwater, respectively. In contrast, theanine and glycerol were observed with higher concentrations in greywater than in blackwater (average 10.1 mu g/L and 19.5 mu g/L in greywater, respectively). The benchmark concentrations to discriminate between industrial and domestic sewage were also presented. A study in a storm drainage system of downstream Taihu catchment, China demonstrated the usefulness of the markers as low-cost options to trace and quantify misconnected wastewater entries into storm drains, while denoting priority areas for misconnected entries correction.

AB Many pharmaceuticals are excreted in wastewater as parent substances or metabolites subsequent to therapeutic or diagnostic application in medical care. This includes the antiepileptic carbamazepine, which is not removed during conventional wastewater treatment and was found to be ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Some carbamazepine metabolites have also been found in treated wastewater, but only five of them have been studied to date. However, at least 30 carbamazepine metabolites have been identified in humans, including some pharmacologically active or genotoxic compounds. Oxcarbazepine, an antiepileptic which is increasingly used, generates metabolites common to those of carbamazepine. The present work focuses on the presence of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and seven of their metabolites (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 2-hydroxy-carbamazepine, iminostilbene, acridine, and acridone) at three different treatment plants (conventional activated sludge, trickling filter, and stabilization ponds) selected in France. The main aim of this work was to identify selected compounds in wastewater after therapeutic use and to measure concentrations in influents and effluents at the three wastewater treatment plants. Except for iminostilbene, all of these compounds were detected in wastewater. The metabolite common to carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, i.e., 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine, was detected at a higher concentration than the parent substances in wastewater. The presence of parent molecules was noted in inlet and outlet water samples. Carbamazepine, as expected, was not removed by conventional activated sludge treatment. Nevertheless, in a wastewater treatment plant with a 78-day hydraulic retention time, a 73% decrease in carbamazepine concentration was observed. For the first time, oxcarbazepine was found in environmental samples. A decrease in oxcarbazepine concentrations was observed at the three sewage treatment plants, with removal ranging from 24 to 73%. No metabolite removal was observed after activated sludge treatment. In the two other sewage treatments plants, the fate of the metabolites differed. The concentration of some metabolites, e.g., 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine and acridine, increased, possibly via different processes such as cleavage of glucuronide conjugates or biotic and abiotic degradation of parent compounds. The behavior of the studied substances is discussed in terms of the treatment process and hydraulic retention time.

AB Five parabens used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in sewage sludges collected at 14 U.S. wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in nine states. Detected concentration ranges (ng/g, dry weight) and frequencies were as follows: methyl paraben (15.9 to 203.0; 100%), propyl paraben (0.5 to 7.7; 100%), ethyl paraben (<0.6 to 2.6; 63%), butyl paraben (<0.4 to 43; 42%) and benzyl paraben (<0.4 to 33; 26%). The estrogenicity inherent to the sum of parabens detected in sewage sludge (ranging from 10.1 to 500.1 pg/kg 17 beta-estradiol equivalents) was insignificant when compared to the 10(6)-times higher value calculated for natural estrogens reported in the literature to occur in sewage sludge. Temporal monitoring at one WWTP provided insights into temporal and seasonal variations in paraben concentrations. This is the first report on the occurrence of five parabens in sewage sludges from across the U.S., and internationally, the first on temporal variations of paraben levels in sewage sludge. Study results will help to inform the risk assessment of sewage sludge destined for land application (biosolids). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fluctuation of domestic wastewater characteristic inhibits the current conventional microbial-based treatment. The bioremediation fungi has received attention and reported to be an effective alternative to treat industrial wastewater. Similar efficient performance is envisaged for domestic wastewater whereby assessed performance of fungi for varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in domestic wastewater is crucial. Thus, the performance of pre-grown wild-Serbian Ganoderma lucidum mycelial pellets (GLMPs) was evaluated on four different synthetic domestic wastewaters under different conditions of initial pH (pH 4, 5, and 7) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to nitrogen (COD/N) ratio of 3.6:1, 7.1:1, 14.2:1, and 17.8:1 (C3.6N1, C7.1N1, C14.2N1, and C17.8N1). The COD/N ratios with a constant concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) were chosen on the basis of the urban domestic wastewater characteristics sampled at the inlet basin of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The parameters of pH, COD, and NH3-N were measured periodically during the experiment. The wild-Serbian GLMPs efficiently removed the pollutants from the synthetic sewage. The COD/N ratio of C17.8N1 wastewater had the best COD and NH3-N removal, as compared to the lower COD/N ratio, and the shortest treatment time was obtained in an acidic environment at pH 4. The highest percentage for COD and NH3-N removal achieved was 96.0% and 93.2%, respectively. The results proved that the mycelium of GLMP has high potential in treating domestic wastewater, particularly at high organic content as a naturally sustainable bioremediation system.

AB The problem of the presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment is closely related to municipal wastewater and in consequence to municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) because wastewater is the main way in which these compounds are transferred to the ecosystem. For this reason, the development of cheap, simple but very effective techniques for the removal of such residues from wastewater is very important. In this study, the analysis of the potential of using three new plants: Cyperus papyrus (Papyrus), Lysimachia nemorum (Yellow pimpernel), and Euonymus europaeus (European spindle) by hydroponic cultivation for the removal of 15 selected pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in an MWWTP is presented. In order to obtain the most reliable data, this study was performed using real WWTP conditions and with the determination of the selected analytes in untreated sewage, treated sewage, and in plant materials. For determining the target compounds in plant materials, an Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE)-Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)-GC-MS(SIM) method was developed and validated. The obtained data proved that the elimination efficiency of the investigated substances from wastewater was in the range of 35.8% for diflunisal to above 99.9% for paracetamol, terbutaline, and flurbiprofen. Lysimachia nemorum was the most effective for the uptake of target compounds among the tested plant species. Thus, the application of constructed wetlands for supporting conventional MWWTPs allowed a significant increase in their removal from the wastewater stream.

AB A 5-month monitoring program was undertaken in South Wales in the UK to determine the fate of SS pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) in two contrasting wastewater plants utilising two different wastewater treatment technologies: activated sludge and trickling filter beds. The impact of treated wastewater effluent on the quality of receiving waters was also assessed.
   PPCPs were found to be present at high loads reaching 10 kg day(-1) in the raw sewage. Concentrations of PPCPs in raw sewage were found to correlate with their usage/consumption patterns in Wales and their metabolism. The efficiency of the removal of PPCPs was found to be strongly dependent on the technology implemented in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In general, the WWTP utilising trickling filter beds resulted in, on average, less than 70% removal of all 55 PPCPs studied, while the WWTP utilising activated sludge treatment gave a much higher removal efficiency of over 85%. The monitoring programme revealed that treated wastewater effluents were the main contributors to PPCPs concentrations (up to 3 kg of PPCPs day(-1)) in the rivers studied. Bearing in mind that in the cases examined here the WWTP effluents were also major contributors to rivers' flows (dilution factor for the studied rivers did not exceed 23 times) the effect of WWTP effluent on the quality of river water is significant and cannot be underestimated.

AB Ibuprofen and naproxen are commonly used members of a class of pharmaceuticals known as 2-arylpropionic acids (2-APAs). Both are chiral chemicals and can exist as either of two (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. Enantioselective analyses of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from untreated sewage overflow reveal distinctly different enantiomeric fractions for both pharmaceuticals. The (S)-enantiomers of both were dominant in untreated sewage overflow, but the relative proportions of the (R)-enantiomers were shown to be increased in WWTP effluents. (R)-naproxen was below method detection limits (<1 ng.L-1) in sewage overflow, but measurable at higher concentrations in WWTP effluents. Accordingly, enantiomeric fractions (EF) for naproxen were consistently 1.0 in sewage overflow, but ranged from 0.7-0.9 in WWTP effluents. Ibuprofen EF ranged from 0.6-0.8 in sewage overflow and receiving waters, and was 0.5 in two WWTP effluents. Strong evidence is provided to indicate that chiral inversion of (S)-2-APAs to produce (R)-2-APAs may occur during wastewater treatment processes. It is concluded that this characterization of the enantiomeric fractions for ibuprofen and naproxen in particular effluents could facilitate the distinction of treated and untreated sources of pharmaceutical contamination in surface waters.

AB The occurrence of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds in influent and effluent wastewater and in primary, secondary and digested sludge in one-year period has been evaluated. Solid-water partition coefficients (K-d) were calculated to evaluate the efficiency of removal of these compounds from wastewater by sorption onto sludge. The ecotoxicological risk to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, due to wastewater discharges to the receiving streams and to the application of digested sludge as fertilizer onto soils, was also evaluated. Twelve of the pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater at mean concentrations from 0.1 to 32 mu g/L All the compounds found in wastewater were also found in sewage sludge, except diclofenac, at mean concentrations from 8.1 to 2206 mu g/kg dm. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, gemfibrozil and caffeine were the compounds at the highest concentrations. Log K-d values were between 1.17 (naproxen) and 3.48 (carbamazepine). The highest ecotoxicological risk in effluent wastewater and digested sludge is due to ibuprofen (risk quotient (RQ): 3.2 and 4.4, respectively), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (RQ: 12 and 22, respectively) and 17 beta-estradiol (RQ: 12 and 359, respectively). Ecotoxicological risk after wastewater discharge and sludge disposal is limited to the presence of 17 beta-estradiol in digested-sludge amended soil (RQ: 2.7). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Concentrations of trace substances in sewage sludge have been measured in a survey of 28 wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) in the UK carried out over a period of 12 months. Approximately 250 samples were analysed for more than 40 trace contaminants, including trace metals, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 'emerging' and regulated organic pollutants. All substances investigated were found to be present in at least some of the sludges sampled. Concentrations were relatively homogenous across all the WwTWs, irrespective of the treatment process, influent and effluent concentrations, and the location of the sludge sampling point within each works. Analysis of the results against existing regulatory and proposed thresholds suggested that levels are mostly below the limits set in the Sewage Sludge Directive, and proposed new limits for sludge used in agriculture. Predicted soil concentrations after application of sewage sludge to land were below the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) for all determinands. Predicted concentrations of pharmaceuticals in soil were also below thresholds deemed to indicate negligible environmental risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In extreme situations with a large number of victims, field hospitals are deployed to provide patients with medical treatment. The large number of patients with different types of medications used generates the problem of hospital waste accumulation, including hospital wastewater (HWW). Wastewater is water having compromised characteristics that adversely affect the environment. Many countries do not have strict regulations regarding the disposal of hospital effluent, which contains pathogens, toxic chemicals and radioisotopes. The disposal of such substances poses a serious threat to public health and the environment. This paper discusses the possibilities of field hospital wastewater management development. Micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, are found in different ecosystem elements, like soil, surface and ground water, drinking water as well as treated effluent from conventional wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater discharged from different health facilities, with varying concentrations of pharmaceuticals, is often mixed with municipal sewage, thus remains untreated even after passing through conventional treatment plants. Extensive experience in the application of different types of HWW treatment methods allows the development of an optimal treatment scenario for field hospital wastewater problem resolution, including the combination of Microbiological Reactor and Fenton Process technologies. They are applicable in the case of low wastewater flow rate values, specific for field hospital conditions.

TI Occurrence of pharmaceutical active compounds in sewage sludge from two
   urban wastewater treatment plants and their potential behaviour in
   agricultural soils
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sewage sludge/biosolids are widely used in intensive farming to maintain fertility and enhance crop yields. Therefore, characterization of these matrices is necessary to ensure their safe use, especially regarding the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), namely pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). Little to no studies have ever been conducted in Portugal in this type of matrices, meaning these results may impact the way wastewater sludges are used moving forward. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) coupled to the solid-phase extraction (SPE), and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was optimised for the analysis of 24 PhACs in sewage sludge samples from two Portuguese urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP), Beirolas and Faro. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the PhACs ranged between 1.66 ng g(-1) and 10.5 ng g(-1) and between 5.49 ng g(-1) and 34.5 ng g(-1) in dry weight, respectively. Sixty-seven sewage sludge samples were analysed, with caffeine being the most prevalent compound, with the highest concentration measured in Beirolas and Faro of 4035 ng g(-1) and 129.9 ng g(-1), respectively. Carbamazepine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, naproxen, sulfapyridine, and propranolol were also prevalent, with a percentage of detection higher than 80%. The sewage sludges are indeed efficient in retaining PhACs, and the physico-chemical properties of PhACs and the soil must be evaluated when considering the use of sewage sludge as fertilizers in agriculture. Soils' pH is crucial to PhACs adsorption. Regarding target PhACs, only ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole can potentially be absorbed by plants.

AB We investigated 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) with emphasis on anthelmintics and their metabolites in human sanitary waste treatment plants (HTPs), sewage treatment plants (STPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWTPs), livestock wastewater treatment plants (LWTPs), river water and seawater. PPCPs showed the characteristic specific occurrence patterns according to wastewater sources. The LWTPs and HTPs showed higher levels (maximum 3000 times in influents) of anthelmintics than other wastewater treatment plants, indicating that livestock wastewater and human sanitary waste are one of principal sources of anthelmintics. Among anthelmintics, fenbendazole and its metabolites are relatively high in the LWTPs, while human anthelmintics such as albendazole and flubendazole are most dominant in the HTPs, STPs and HWTPs. The occurrence pattern of fenbendazole's metabolites in water was different from pharmacokinetics studies, showing the possibility of transformation mechanism other than the metabolism in animal bodies by some processes unknown to us. The river water and seawater are generally affected by the point sources, but the distribution patterns in some receiving water are slightly different from the effluent, indicating the influence of non-point sources.

   Environmental management for the use of sewage sludge in rice paddy fields.
   Abstract One of the concerns against the use of sewage sludge for agricultural purposes is emerging contaminants contained in sewage sludge. Most of the studies on biological degradation of pharmaceutically active compounds in agricultural land were carried out with water-unsaturated soils under relatively aerobic conditions. In this study, the degradation of pharmaceuticals mainly including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was investigated in Asian rice paddy soils that are flooded in anaerobic condition. The experimental results showed that the concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals excluding the exception of naproxen were poorly decreased in anaerobic condition. On the other hand, the microbial communities of the soils contained the aerobic degraders of clofibric acid and diclofenac, which are generally persistent in biological wastewater treatment. The higher degradation rates in aerobic condition suggest the possibility of enhanced degradation of pharmaceuticals by supplying oxygen with plowing anaerobic rice fields or with drying the field in off-season for farming.

AB Extracts of wastewater collected from 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) receiving effluents from different sources in South India were investigated for their levels of transcription factor-mediated gene induction in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In addition, the relation between gene induction levels and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wastewater was examined. STP-3, which treats only hospital wastewater, exhibited significantly greater induction potency of all 6 drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes examined, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B15, 3A1, and 3A2, whereas the wastewater at STP-1, which exclusively receives domestic sewage, showed significantly diminished levels of induction of 3 CYP genes when compared to the levels of CYP induction at STP-2, which receives mixed wastewater. Samples collected during the monsoon season showed a significantly altered gene induction capacity compared to that of samples from the pre-monsoon period. The data suggest that the toxicity of wastewater in STPs was not significantly diminished during the treatment process. The chemical-gene interaction data predicted that a vast number of chemicals present in the wastewater would stimulate the genes studied in the rat hepatocytes. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of isolates resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem and streptomycin was significantly correlated with the levels of induction of at least three CYP-isozymes in STP wastewater. In addition, the resistance of isolates in treatment plants was not altered by the treatment steps, whereas the sampling season did have an impact on the resistance to specific antimicrobials. The identification of receptor-mediated gene regulation capacities offers important data not limited to the (synergistic) physiological role of chemicals in biological systems but may provide new insight into the link between the effects of known/unknown drugs and prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in wastewater.

Galaxolide and tonalide were the dominant musks, and the levels were medium compared with those from other regions. Musk concentrations and galaxolide/tonalide ratios were low in warm seasons relative to cold seasons in both water and sludge samples. The removal efficiencies of galaxolide and tonalide ranged in < 14.3%-98.0% and < 18.5%-98.7%, respectively. The discharge of galaxolide and tonalide through effluents into environment were 1.8-685.6 g/d (mean: 70.1 g/d) and 1.6-195.3 g/d (mean: 22.9 g/d), respectively.

AB A charcoal was produced from primary pulp mill sludge and then used for the adsorptive removal of diclofenac, salicylic acid, ibuprofen and acetaminophen. A main aim was to assess the utilization of this material for the tertiary treatment of sewage. For this purpose, the adsorption of the selected pharmaceuticals from the secondary effluent of a sewage treatment plant (STP) was compared with their adsorption from ultrapure water. Differences in the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium were evident between the four pharmaceuticals considered. However, differences between the adsorption from the two aqueous matrixes considered were negligible. It was hypothesized that synergetic microorganism removal compensated the competitive effects in wastewater. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB The occurrence and removal of 42 pharmaceuticals, belonging to different therapeutic groups (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-ulcer agent, psychiatric drugs, antiepileptic drug, antibiotics, beta-blockers, diuretics, lipid regulator and cholesterol lowering statin drugs and anti-histamines), were studied in the wastewater and sewage sludge trains of a full scale integrated treatment plant. The plant employs a biological nutrient removal (BNR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater, and a single-stage mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion for the treatment of wasted activated sludge mixed with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), followed by a short-cut nitrification-denitrification of the anaerobic supernatant in a sequential batch reactor. Influent and effluent wastewater, as well as thickened, digested and treated sludge were sampled and analyzed for the selected pharmaceuticals in order to study their presence and fate during the treatment. Twenty three compounds were detected in influent and effluent wastewater and eleven in sludge. Infiltration of groundwater in the sewer system led to a dilution of raw sewage, resulting in lower concentrations in wastewater (up to 0.7 mu g/L in influent) and sludge (70ng/g d.w.). Due to the dilution, overall risk quotient for the mixture of pharmaceuticals detected in effluent wastewater was less than one, indicating no direct risk for the aquatic environment A wide range of removal efficiencies during the treatment was observed, i.e. <20% to 90%. The influent concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals, as polar compounds, were undoubtedly mostly affected by BNR process in the wastewater train, and less by anaerobic-co-digestion. Mass balance calculations showed that less than 2% of the total mass load of the studied pharmaceuticals was removed by sorption. Experimentally estimated distribution coefficients (<500L/kg) also indicated that the selected pharmaceuticals preferably remain in the aqueous phase, and that biodegradation/transformation is the primary removal mechanism for these compounds during wastewater treatment.

AB An empirical model is presented allowing for the prediction of concentrations of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) prone to accumulate and persist in digested sludge (biosolids) generated during conventional municipal wastewater treatment. The sole input requirements of the model are the concentrations of the individual HOCs entering the wastewater treatment plant in raw sewage, the compound's respective pH-dependent octanol-water partitioning coefficient (D-OW), and an empirically determined fitting parameter (p(fit)) that reflects persistence of compounds in biosolids after accounting for all potential removal mechanisms during wastewater treatment. The accuracy of the model was successfully confirmed at the 99% confidence level in a paired t test that compared predicted concentrations in biosolids to empirical measurements reported in the literature. After successful validation, the resultant model was applied to predict levels of various HOCs for which occurrence data in biosolids thus far are lacking.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine toxicity of wastewater from hospitals in the Czech Republic using traditional and alternative toxicological methods. The pilot study comprised weekly dynamics of sewage ecotoxicity of treated wastewater from one hospital in two different seasons. A detailed investigation of wastewater ecotoxicity, genotoxicity and reprotoxicity followed in five different hospitals.
   METHODS: The seven following bioassays were used in this study: algal growth inhibition test (ISO 8692), Vibrio fischeri test (ISO 11348-2), Daphnia magna acute toxicity test (ISO 6341), Allium cepa assay, Ames test (OECD TG 471), Comet assay and YES/YAS assay.
   RESULTS: The wastewater ecotoxicity during one week showed no differences in separate working days, however, higher toxicity values were recorded in May compared to November. In the following study, samples from two of the five hospitals were classified as toxic, the others as non toxic. Genotoxicity has not been confirmed in any sample. In several cases, wastewater samples exhibited agonist activity to the estrogen and androgen receptors.
   CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated different levels of toxicity of treated hospital wastewater. Variable sensitivity of individual bioassays for tested wastewater samples was recognized. A more extensive study including proposal for improvement of hospital wastewater treatment within the Czech Republic can be recommended with the aim to decrease the discharge of toxic chemicals into the local sewage system and the environment.

AB A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method was optimized for the extraction of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diclofenac and ibuprofen from sewage sludge. Dispersive-solid phase extraction (d-SPE) was employed for sample clean-up. Instrumental analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ecological risk was assessed for four trophic levels: fish, daphnia, algae and bacteria. The method limits of quantification for diclofenac and ibuprofen were 0.43 mu g g(- 1) and 0.45 mu g g(- 1), respectively. Correlation coefficients were above 0.999. Extraction recoveries ranged from 70 to 118 % and satisfactory inter-day reproducibility (% RSD) of < 18 % was obtained. Diclofenac and ibuprofen were measured up to 1.02 mu g g(- 1) and 6.6 mu g g(- 1), respectively in sewage sludge from three Nigerian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Ibuprofen posed high risk to fish, daphnia, algae and bacteria. This work presents the first report on the ecological risk assessment of diclofenac and ibuprofen in sewage sludge from Nigerian WWTPs.

AB The chemical pollution of water resources is a major challenge facing the humanity in this century. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of emerging environmental chemical pollutants distinguished by their bioactivity and high solubility. They may also cause health complications to humans and living organisms. Pharmaceuticals enter the environment, mainly via wastewater and can eventually reach the surface and ground water. Despite this, PPCPs received less attention as environmental pollutants than other chemical pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and pesticides). The purpose of this work was to investigate the presence of some of the most frequently dispensed drugs for the residents of Almadinah Almunawarah, Saudi Arabia in the municipal wastewater before and after treatment. For this purpose, wastewater samples were collected biweekly from the city's sewage treatment plant for a period of 4 months and analyzed the targeted drugs using tandem LC-MS. Out of the 19 investigated drugs, 5 pharmaceuticals have been found in concentrations greater than the limit of detection in both the influents and effluents of the sewage treatment plant. As expected, the concentrations of investigated pharmaceuticals in the wastewater were found to be low. These drugs and their average concentrations (in ng mL(-1)) in the influents were: acetaminophen (38.9), metformin (15.2), norfluoxetine (7.07), atenolol (2.04), and cephalexin (1.88). Meanwhile, the effluents contained slightly lower levels (in ng mL(-1)) than those of influents: acetaminophen (31.2), metformin (3.19), norfluoxetine (7.25), atenolol (0.545), and cephalexin (1.53). The results of this study supported by many other investigations indicate the inefficiency of current conventional wastewater treatment protocols in eliminating such a group of active and potentially hazardous pollutants from the wastewater.

AB This manuscript reports, for the first time, a monitoring study analysing wastewater and associated suspended particulate matter (SPM) to determine the concentration of drugs of abuse and metabolites in wastewater influent. The monitoring of SPM is crucial for target analytes because, depending on their physico-chemical properties, they may partition to particulates; thus, analysis of wastewater only will result in under-reporting of the concentration of target analytes in the sample. A daily one week monitoring study was carried out at a WWTP serving one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic; representing the first comprehensive application of the sewage epidemiology approach in the Czech Republic. In total. 60 analytes were targeted in the monitoring programme including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzo-diazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors and their metabolites. Analysis of SPM determined that significant proportions of some compounds were present on the solids. For example, 21.0-49.8% of the total concentration of EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) in the sample was determined on SPM and 11.2-19.6% of methadone. The highest proportion on SPM was determined for fluoxetine in the range 68.1-79.6%, norfluoxetine 46.6-61.9% and amitriptyline 21.8-51.2%. In contrast, some compounds presented very little partitioning to SPM. Less than 5% was determined partitioned to SPM over the week period for analytes including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol, nortramadol, oxazepam and ephedrine. Determined concentrations in wastewater influent were subsequently utilised in the sewage epidemiology approach to estimate drug consumption, in the community from which the wastewater was derived. This back-calculation was updated for the first time to include the concentration of analytes present on SPM. The consumption of methamphetamine and MDMA was determined to be especially high in the studied community in relation to other European countries, while cocaine and methadone consumption was relatively low. This manuscript shows that in order to apply the sewage epidemiology approach, SPM analysis is required for some compounds; whereas for others the partitioning is small and one may regard this as negligible.

AB Occurrence of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and diclofenac) and three lipid regulators (bezafibrate, clofibric acid and gemfibrozil) was investigated in wastewater, sewage sludge, and river water of the urban section of the Pearl River at Guangzhou in South China. Behavior and fate of the pharmaceuticals during treatment in two sewage treatment plants (STPs) were also studied in depth by determining concentrations in the influents and effluents at major treatment units and the sewage sludge. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the raw wastewater were mostly at ng L(-1) levels except salicylic acid whose concentrations ranged from 9.6 to 23.3 mu g L(-1). No significant amount of the pharmaceuticals was detected in the suspended particulate matter of wastewater and sewage sludge. Salicylic acid, indomethacin, and naproxen were almost completely removed (>99%); gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and bezafibrate were significantly removed (>75%), whereas diclofenac and clofibric acid were removed by 60-70% during treatment in the STPs. Generally, biodegradation was the governing process for elimination of the investigated pharmaceuticals. Anaerobic biodegradation was responsible for most of the removal of diclofenac whereas aerobic biodegradation also played an important role in elimination of the other pharmaceuticals except SA, which was nearly completely removed after the anoxic process. In the Pearl River, the pharmaceuticals were widely detected. Both the concentrations and detection frequency were higher in March 2008 than those in the other seasons, which may be ascribed mainly to less dilution caused by lower precipitation. Besides the STPs, urban canals directly connected with the Pearl River may also be important contributors to the pharmaceutical contamination in the river.

AB A set of human pharmaceuticals enables identification of groundwater that is influenced by sewage and provides information on the time of recharge. As the consumption rates of the investigated pharmaceuticals have changed over time, so too has the composition of the sewage. At the study area, south of Berlin (Germany), irrigation was performed as a method of wastewater clean-up at sewage irrigation farms until the early 1990s. Today, treated wastewater is discharged into the surface-water-stream Nuthegraben. Groundwater and surface-water samples were analyzed for the pharmaceutical substances clofibric acid, bezafibrate, diclofenac, carbamazepine and primidone, the main ions and organic carbon. The pharmaceutical substances were detected at concentrations up to microgram-per-liter level in groundwater and surface-water samples from the Nuthegraben Lowland area and from the former irrigation farms. Concentrations detected in groundwater are generally much lower than in surface water and there is significant variation in the distribution of pharmaceutical concentrations in groundwater. Groundwater influenced by the irrigation of sewage water shows higher primidone and clofibric-acid concentrations. Groundwater influenced by recent discharge of treated sewage water into the surface water shows high carbamazepine concentrations while concentrations of primidone and clofibric acid are low.

AB A new approach for a successful treatment concept of industrial cosmetic wastewater is shown. Splitting the wastewater flow into various material streams based on fundamental characteristics enables distinct adapted treatment and disposal methods, respectively. Industrial wastewater still contains valuable and even recyclable materials that should not be disposed of as waste. A holistic treatment of the total wastewater flow comprising diverse material streams is very challenging due to a frequently changing product range. The developed concept provides a functional and yet simple approach by classifying material and wastewater streams that could be treated by distinct adapted processes. Most of the industrial wastewater achieved a quality that allows a cost-effective discharge via the municipal wastewater system.

AB The number of chemical compounds in sewage and consequently their release into the environment is increasing. Some of them are toxic and many of them are considered endocrine disrupters. Here, the capacity of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove caffeine, hormones and bisphenol-A was investigated. Bisphenol-A and caffeine are highly water-soluble compounds, as opposed to hormones (estradiol, estriol, and ethynilestradiol) which are hydrophobic compounds. In the Sewage Treatment Plant (SWT)1 the sewage is treated by activated sludge process, in the second plant, SWT2, sewage is treated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors followed by dissolved air flotation, and in the third, SWT3 sewage is treated by stabilization lagoons. The first lagoon is 3.5 m deep, thus facultative and polishment processes occur. It was speculated that there was a difference in efficiency between the three plants in removing micropollutants. Small differences were found in the amounts removed, probably accounted for by retention time. The caffeine and bisphenol-A were almost completely removed, higher than 90% for both compounds (bisphenol-A and caffeine) in all WWTPs. The hormones, however, had a smaller rate of removal, between 70% and 87%. It is suspected that retention time is essential for removal efficiency, together with type of treatment. In fact, the hormones, caffeine, and bisphenol-A found in the environment definitely come from untreated sewage.

AB Pharmaceutical residues in water are frequently analysed and discussed in connection with sewage treatment, ecotoxicity and, natural and drinking water quality Among different localities hospitals are suspected, or implied, to be a major and highly variable source of pharmaceuticals that substantially contribute to the total wastewater load In this study, the contribution of pharmaceuticals from a hospital to a sewage treatment plant (STP) serving around 45,000 inhabitants was evaluated Approximately 200 hospital beds result in a hospital bed density of 4 4 beds per 1000 inhabitants, which is a typical value for developed world countries Prior to sampling, a sound systems analysis was performed, and a sophisticated continuous flow-proportional sampling regime was applied Hence, overall experimental uncertainty was reduced to a minimum, and measurements provide clear evidence that, for 28 of 59 investigated substances, over 85% of the pharmaceutical residue loads do not originate from the hospital when applying a conservative error estimation Only for 2 substances, trimethoprim, (18%) and roxithromycin (56%), was the maximum observed contribution of the hospital >15% On average, the contribution of the hospital for the compounds detected in both, hospital effluent and sewage treatment plant influent was small and fairly constant Five compounds were only detected in hospital wastewater, and 24 neither in the hospital wastewater nor in the total wastewater at the influent of the STP For these compounds no experimental contribution could be calculated For the compounds where audit data for both the national consumption and the specific hospital under investigation were available, a prediction of the fraction of pharmaceuticals originating from the hospital was performed Three quarters of the compounds, classified with the existing audit data, were in the same "hospital contribution category" as determined by measurements For most of the other compounds, plausible reasons could be identified to explain the observed deviations (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB Goldfish were exposed to either treated municipal effluent (FE wastewater) or reuse water produced through membrane ultrafiltration (MF reuse water) or membrane ultrafiltration followed by activated carbon filtration (MCF wastewater) for up to 90 days. The xenobiotics present in the wastewater were identified using gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy and the efficacy of their removal by membrane ultrafiltration and activated carbon filtration were determined. At various time points post-exposure to wastewater or reuse water the following biological parameters were assessed: vitellogenin (Vtg) induction, immune gene expression, and mitogen-induced proliferation of blood leukocytes. Membrane ultrafiltration alone did not remove xenobiotics from FE wastewater, while activated carbon filtration efficiently reduced the levels of most xenobiotics. Vitellogenin was induced in fish exposed to both FE wastewater and MF reuse water, but not in fish exposed to MCF reuse water. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of select immune genes (tumor necrosis factor alpha, colony stimulating factor receptor-1) were up-regulated in FE and MF exposed fish on days 7 and 21 post exposure, while Toll-like receptor 22 mRNA level was similar in fish exposed to wastewater or control water. Prolonged exposure of fish to FE and MF wastewaters caused a significant reduction in the mitogen-induced proliferation of blood leukocytes. Our results suggest that goldfish may be used as biosentinels for xenobiotics present in wastewater and reuse water.

AB Ten pharmaceuticals and two consumer products were investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shanghai, China. The concentrations of target compounds in the wastewater influents ranged from below the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 9340 ng/L, with the frequency of detection of 31-100 %, and the removal efficiencies were observed to be -82 to 100 % in the four WWTPs. Concentrations of most target compounds (i.e. diclofenac, caffeine, metoprolol, sulpiride) in the wastewater influents were around three to eight times higher in urban WWTPs than in suburb ones, probably due to the different population served and lifestyles. Mean concentrations of target compounds in the wastewater influent generally decreased by 5-76 % after rainfall due to the dilution of raw sewage by rainwater, which infiltrated into the sewer system. In the WWTPs located in the suburb area, the increased flow of wastewater influent led to a shortened hydraulic retention time (HRT) and decreased removal efficiencies of some compounds. On the contrary, the influence of rainfall was not significant on the removal efficiencies of investigated compounds in urban WWTPs, probably due to the almost unchanged influent flow, good removal performance, or bypass system employed.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze pharmaceuticals in wastewater from eight selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Slovakia. We analyzed 125 pharmaceutical compounds and selected 14 from the most common therapeutic classes, i. e., antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin), antifungal (fluconazole and clotrimazole), antihistaminic (fexofenadine and meclozine), antithrombotic (dipyridamole), hypertension (eprosartan, telmisartan, and valsartan), analgetics (diclofenac), and psychiatric (tramadol and carbamazepine). The results show the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater in concentrations ranging from low ng dm(-3) to a few lg dm(-3). The highest maximum concentrations were detected for cardiovascular pharmaceuticals (32.98 mu g dm(-3) valsartan; 17.10 mu g dm(-3) telmisartan) and antibiotics (25.66 mu g dm(-3) ciprofloxacin, 13.98 mu g dm(-3) clarithromycin). We also analyzed the daily load of pharmaceuticals compounds in Slovak WWTPs. The study shows that telmisartan has the highest median load (2270 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) followed by ciprofloxacin (2210 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) in Piest any town.

AB The presence of 10 anticancer drugs was studied along the entire urban water cycle -from hospital effluents through urban wastewater treatment plant till surface waters- and their potential environmental risk was assessed. Azathioprine, etoposide, docetaxel, paclitaxel, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin were detected in hospital effluent and in the urban influent of the sewage treatment plant although most of them were totally eliminated after WWTP. Only cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin were found in both WWTP effluent and in the receiving river at a concentration range between nd-20 ng L-1, 25-38 ng L-1 and 7-103 ng L-1 respectively. Tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin, commonly used for veterinary practices, were also detected in the river upstream the sewage discharge. In addition, they both were considered to pose a potential risk to the environment based on the levels found in the WWTP effluent together with their ecotoxicological impact in selected organisms.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are being released into the aquatic environment through wastewater discharge around the globe. While there is limited removal of these compounds within wastewater treatment plants, wetland treatment might prove to be an effective means to reduce the discharge of the compounds into the environment. Wetlands can promote removal of these pharmaceutical compounds through a number of mechanisms including photolysis, plant uptake, microbial degradation, and sorption to the soil. We review relevant laboratory research on these various mechanisms and provide data on the few studies that have examined wetland removal. There is a need to document the degree to which various pharmaceutical compounds are removed in full-scale treatment wetlands, as there is a paucity of data on overall pharmaceutical removal rates.

AB Micropollutants as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), residuals of personal care products or endocrine disrupting chemicals are of increasing interest in water pollution control. In this context the removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are of importance, as their effluents are important point sources for the release of those substances into the aquatic environment. Activated sludge based wastewater treatment is the worldwide prevalently used treatment technique. In conventional plants the separation of treated wastewater and sludge occurs via sedimentation. A new development is the application of membrane technology for this separation step. The studies focus on the influence of the solids retention time (SRT) on the removal efficiency, as the SIRT is the most important parameter in the design of STPs. A conventional activated sludge plant (CASP) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR) were operated at different SRTs. The substances selected are the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the analgesics diclofenac and ibuprofen, the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the polycyclic musks tonalide and galaxolide and the contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiole. No significant differences in the removal efficiency were detected. Due to the absence of suspended solids in the MBR effluent, substances with high adsorption potential could be retained to slightly higher amounts.

AB The application of innovative technologies in water management, such as wastewater reuse, requires a deeper understanding of emerging pollutants, including pharmaceuticals. This study presents a unique pilot site at Horni Bekovice in Central Bohemia, where wastewater parameters are significantly influenced by the effluent from a local psychiatric hospital, and where the treated wastewater infiltrates into a shallow aquifer over a long period. The survey compared the quality parameters of local wastewater with those of the wastewater in four other catchments with no sources of concentrated pharmaceutical contamination. A total of 10 pharmaceuticals were detected while monitoring a common sewage system, but their number increased 3-fold at Horni Bekovice. The water quality data revealed the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater at the local sewage treatment plant and tracked the fate of substances that move from the treatment plant into the recharge ponds and then gradually into groundwater. The findings showed a significant decrease in all the monitored micropollutants that remained bound in sediments and in the unsaturated zone. Their passage into groundwater was highly reduced, and they virtually disappear after a few hundred meters in the saturated zone. The only exception is carbamazepine. This substance passes through the treatment technology and unsaturated zone. It systematically appears in the groundwater samples collected about 1 km from the infiltration site.

AB Numerous investigations in different European countries observed various pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in notable concentrations in the aquatic environment. Further determinations found the effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) to be significant sources for the entry of pharmaceutical residuals to rivers, streams and surface waters. Due to those pathways the knowledge about the elimination of these substances and their behaviour in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is elementary for protection of an intact aquatic environment. Since the sludge retention time (SRT) is the most important parameter for the design of STPs, its influence on the reduction rate of these PhACs in the wastewater treatment process was investigated. To study this influence of the SRT on the elimination of PhACs, lab scale plants have been operated with different sludge retention times. The results of the laboratory experiments have been validated analysing various STPs within a wide capacity range and operating at different SRTs. This report describes the determinations observed on the antiepileptic drug Carbamazepine, the two antiphlogistics and analgesics Diclofenac and Ibuprofen and the lipid regulator Bezafibrate.

AB The main objective of this study was the development of simple multi-parameter methods for the analyses of biocides in various environmental matrices (wastewater, surface water, and sewage sludge) for measurement and monitoring activities. Eight target substances (triclosan, methyltriclosan (transformation product of triclosan), cybutryne (Irgarol), and the azole fungicides propiconazole, tebuconazole, imazalil, thiabendazole, and cyproconazole) were chosen for determination in selected sample sets. For surface water and wastewater samples a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and for sewage sludge samples an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) were developed. The extracts were analyzed by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods (GC/MS), and the analytical methods were checked to ensure sufficient sensitivity by comparing the limits of quantification (LOQs) to the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) of the selected biocides. For quality control, recovery rates were determined. Finally, developed methods were checked and validated by application on sample material from various matrices. Sampling took place in seven urban wastewater treatment plants and their corresponding receiving waters. The results revealed that the developed extraction methods are effective and simple and allow the determination of a broad range of biocides in various environmental compartments.

AB Hospital and urban effluents are a source of diverse pollutants such as organic compounds, heavy metals, detergents, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, and microorganisms resistant to antibiotics. Usually, these two types of effluent are mixed in the sewage network, but a pilot site in France now allows studying them separately or mixed to understand more about their characteristics and the phenomena that occur following their mixing. In this study, their ecotoxicity (Daphnia magna mobility, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth, Brachionus calyciflorus reproduction, and SOS Chromotest) and antibiotic resistance (integron quantification) were assessed during mixing and treatment steps. The main results of this study are (i) the ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potentials of hospital wastewater are higher than in urban wastewater and (ii) mixing two different effluents does not lead to global synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potential. The global additivity effect observed in this case must be confirmed by other studies on hospital and urban effluents on other sites to improve knowledge relating to this source of pollution and its management.

AB A conceptual model is presented for determining which currently prescribed pharmaceutical compounds are most likely to be found in sewage, and for estimating their concentrations, both in raw sewage and after successive stages of secondary sewage treatment. A ranking of the "top-50" pharmaceutical compounds (by total mass dispensed) in Australia over the 1998 calendar year was prepared. Information on the excretion ratios and some metabolites of the pharmaceuticals enabled prediction of the overall rates of excretion into Australian sewage. Mass-balance and fugacity modelling, applied to sewage generation and to a sewage treatment plant, allowed calculation of predicted concentrations of the compounds in raw, primary and secondary treated sewage effluents. Twenty nine of the modelled pharmaceutical residuals were predicted to be present in raw sewage influent at concentrations of 1 mugl(-1) or greater. Twenty of the compounds were predicted to remain in secondary effluent at concentrations of 1 mugl(-1) or greater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of caffeine, nicotine and some major metabolites was investigated by wastewater analysis in 13 sewage treatment plants (STPs) across Italy, and their suitability was tested as qualitative and quantitative biomarkers for assessing population size and dynamics. A specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. All these compounds were found widely at the mu g/L level. Mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. Some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of Italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. There were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. Most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. Nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. Caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. This exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater discharges introduce antibiotic residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) into surface waters. Both inputs directly affect the streambed resistome, either by exerting a selective pressure that favour the proliferation of resistant phenotypes or by enriching the resident communities with wastewater-associated ARB. Here, we investigated the impact of raw and treated urban wastewater discharges on epilithic (growing on rocks) and epipsammic (growing on sandy substrata) streambed biofilms. The effects were assessed by comparing control and impact sites (i) on the composition of bacterial communities; (ii) on the abundance of twelve antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) encoding resistance to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides and vancomycin, as well as the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intl1); (iii) on the occurrence of wastewater-associated bacteria, including putative pathogens, and their potential linkage to target ARGs. We measured more pronounced effects of raw sewage than treated wastewater at the three studied levels. This effect was especially noticeable in epilithic biofilms, which showed a higher contribution of wastewater-associated bacteria and ARB than in epipsammic biofilms. Comparison of correlation coefficients obtained between the relative abundance of both target ARGs and operational taxonomic units classified as either potential pathogens or nonpathogens yielded significant higher correlations between the former category and genes intl1, sul1, sul2 and ermB. Altogether, these results indicate that wastewater-associated micro-organisms, including potential pathogens, contribute to maintain the streambed resistome and that epilithic biofilms appear as sensitive biosensors of the effect of wastewater pollution in surface waters.

AB The novel SARS-CoV-2 is expanding internationally. While the current focus is on limiting its transmission from direct contact with infected patients and surfaces during the pandemic, the secondary transmission potential via sewage should not be underestimated, especially in low-income and developing countries with weak wastewater treatment technologies. Recent studies have indicated SARS-CoV-2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients. Therefore, the risk of transmission and infection can be increased into sewage by the fecal-oral way, mainly in some parts of the globe with a high amount of open defecation. This review collected scattered data and recent studies about the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus in the water cycle. The direct impacts of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the presence of the coronavirus and suitable viral removal methods in different phases of treatment in wastewater treatment plants. The indirect effects of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the overuse of cleaning and disinfecting products to protect against viral infection and the overuse of certain drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems and panic to COVID-19 and consequently their presence in wastewater. This unexpected situation leads to changes in the quality of wastewater and brings adverse and harmful effects for the human, aquatic organisms, and the environment. Therefore, applying effective wastewater treatment technologies with low toxic by-products in wastewater treatment plants will be helpful to prevent the increasing occurrence of these extra contaminants in the environment.

AB The Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) is a new tool for the sampling of organic pollutants in water. We tested this device for the monitoring of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater. After calibration, a field application was carried out in a French hospital for six pharmaceutical compounds (Atenolol, Prednisolone, Methylprednisolone, Sulfamethoxazole, Ofloxacin, Ketoprofen).
   POCIS were calibrated in tap water and wastewater in laboratory conditions close to relevant environmental conditions (temperature, flow velocity). Sampling rates (R-s) were determined and we observed a significant increase with flow velocity and temperature. Whatever the compound, the Rs value was lower in wastewater and the linear phase of uptake was shorter.
   POCIS were deployed in a hospital sewage pipe during four days and the estimated water concentrations were close to those obtained with twenty-four hour composite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The big challenge for the detection of pharmaceutical residues in water samples is the type of ionization mode in terms of positive or negative ionization which plays an important role to identify and quantify the analytes using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. An analytical method was applied to analysis of gliclazide (diabetic drug) in surface water and wastewater from sewage treatment plants and hospitals. The proposed analytical method allows simultaneous isolation and concentration procedure using solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB) prior to separation using high-performance liquid chromatography. The detection and confirmation was achieved by applying time-of-flight analyzer. The limits of quantification were as low as 1.4 ng/L (deionized water), 4 ng/L (surface water), 27 ng/L (hospital influent), 10 ng/L (hospital effluent), 6 ng/L (sewage treatment plant effluent) and 21 ng/L (sewage treatment plant influent), respectively. On average, good recoveries of higher than 87% were obtained for gliclazide in the studied samples. The proposed method successfully determined and quantified gliclazide in surface water and wastewater. The results showed that gliclazide is a persistent compound in sewage treatment effluents as well as in the recipient rivers. Gliclazide was detected in all samples and the highest concentration was 130 ng/L in influent of sewage treatment plant.

AB The antibiotic-resistance profiles of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from four different sampling sites of the hospital wastewater at Lucknow city were evaluated. Of the 200 Gram-negative bacterial isolates tested, marked antibiotic resistances (over 90%) were observed for amoxicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and penicillin depending upon the sampling sites. All Gram-negative bacterial isolates also showed multiple resistance patterns (2-13 antibiotics) in different combinations of antibiotics. The MAR index ranges were found (0.01-0.86) indicating the high risk of environmental contamination. The findings indicated that pollution of aquatic environments from different sources of the city may have a significant contribution to the emergence and dissemination of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria as well as other pathogenic bacteria in the hospital wastewater. This overuse of antibiotics as well as other pharmaceuticals in the hospital and their introduction into the aquatic environment may have a potential public health risk.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of emerging contaminants whose fate in the wastewater treatment process has received increasing attention in past years. Acidic pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and diclofenac), caffeine, and the antibacterial triclosan were quantified at four different steps of wastewater treatment from three urban wastewater treatment plants. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples on Waters Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid-phase extraction columns, silylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the chemicals studied, it was found that the majority of the influent load was removed during secondary treatment (51-99%), yielding expected surface water concentrations of 13 to 56 ng/L.

AB This preliminary study evaluated an assessment of the risks arising from environmental exposure to beta-blockers from wastewater of an university hospital (University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM), Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil). Propranolol showed the highest risk quotient (0.56). The occurrence of beta-blockers was evaluated using an analytical procedure SPE-HPLC-FLD (solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection), optimizing the variables sample pH, water pH, and methanol: acetonitrile: formic acid ratio of the elution stage. The average concentrations of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol for a sampling period of one week were 2.45 +/- 1.14, 4.67 +/- 1.63 and 0.70 +/- 0.88 mu g L-1 in the 'Emergence' sewage; 0.95 +/- 0.68, 0.70 +/- 0.33 and 0.315 +/- 0.62 mu g L-1 in the 'HUSM general' sewage and 1.26 +/- 0.47, 1.27 +/- 0.35 and 0.56 +/- 0.47 mu g L-1 in the 'Receiving waters', the receptor stream of the effluents, respectively. Propranolol showed an MEC/PNEC ratio > 1, and thus requires more attention in terms of toxicity. The occurrence of beta-blockers and the associated environmental risks demonstrate the need of a more efficient treatment system for the hospital wastewater.

AB The possible increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in sewage associated with the discharge of wastewater from a hospital and a pharmaceutical plant was investigated by using Acinetobacter species as environmental bacterial indicators. The level of susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents was determined in 385 Acinetobacter strains isolated from samples collected upstream and downstream from the discharge points of the hospital and the pharmaceutical plant. Results indicated that while the hospital waste effluent affected only the prevalence of oxytetracycline resistance, the discharge of wastewater from the pharmaceutical plant was associated with an increase in the prevalence of both single- and multiple-antibiotic resistance among Acinetobacter species in the sewers.

AB New psychoactive substances have become increasingly popular across the globe in recent years, which may cause certain public health issues. In this work, sewage-based epidemiology was applied to examine the use of two synthetic cathinones, mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), and three piperazines, benzylpiperazine (BZP), trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), and 1-(3-Chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP), across China. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 36 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 18 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Effluent samples were also collected from selected STPs to determine removal rates. Mephedrone, TFMPP, and mCPP were below detection limits in all the wastewater samples collected, indicating negligible use of these substances in China. MDPV was detected in wastewater at 13 STPs. However, its loads were <1 mg/1000 inh/d at most of these STPs, indicating low use of this substance. BZP was detected at all the STPs examined, with loads typically falling within the range of 3-10 mg/1000 inh/d. No clear geographic pattern in BZP occurrence in wastewater was identified. Since BZP in wastewater may also come from its legal sources, whether widespread occurrence of BZP means widespread abuse is yet to be confirmed. Apparent removal of MDPV by wastewater treatment was low (<25%), whereas removal of BZP was nearly complete (typically >95%). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Data obtained from the analysis of wastewater from large-scale sewage treatment plants has been successfully applied to study trends in the use of classical illicit drugs such as cocaine, but the dynamic nature of the new psychoactive substances (NPS) market presents a unique set of challenges to epidemiologists. In an attempt to overcome some of the challenges, this paper presents a framework whereby a collection of tools and alternative data-sources can be used to support the design and implementation of wastewaterbased studies on NPS use. Within this framework the most likely and most suitable biomarkers for a given NPS are predicted via (in-silico) Under bar metabolism, biotransformation and sorption models. Subsequent detection and confirmation of the biomarkers in samples of wastewater are addressed via high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
   The proposed framework is applied to a set of test substances including synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones. In general, the (in-silico) Under bar models predict that transformation via N-dealkylation and hydroxylation is likely for these compounds, and that adsorption is expected to be significant for cannabinoids in wastewater. Screening via HRMS is discussed with examples from the literature, and common-fragment searching and mass-defect filtering are successfully performed on test samples such that spectral noise is removed to leave only the information that is most likely to be related to the NPS biomarkers. HRMS screening is also applied to a set of pissoir-sourced wastewater samples and a total of 48 pharmaceuticals and drugs including 1-(2methoxyphenyl)piperazine (oMeOPP) are identified.

AB In this study, biochar was produced from three differently treated sewage sludge biomasses, in three pyrolytic temperatures, 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C, under continuous N-2 supply. The produced samples were physicochemically characterized and their initial metal concentration, along with metal leaching potential, were investigated. Moreover, the application of the biochar samples as adsorbents for the removal of seven emerging organic micro-pollutants from table water and treated wastewater matrices was investigated. The results showed that even though the biochar samples were not especially enriched in terms of physicochemical characterization, they were effective as adsorptive materials in the respective experiments. Pollutant removal was in the range of 67-99% for the table water experiments, while the removal for the wastewater experiments was 35-97%. The results of this study indicate that sewage sludge biochar has the potential to be an effective, low-cost adsorbent, providing, at the same time, a viable and environmentally friendly solution concerning the difficult task of sludge management.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are excreted by humans and animals and released into the aquatic environment through wastewater, which can have potential negative impacts on ecological systems. To conduct a nationwide investigation of the occurrence of PhACs in water resources in China, an analytical procedure based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and LC-MS/MS was used to measure 45 PhACs in surface water samples from a network of 29 rivers across 31 provinces in China in 2014 and 2015. PhACs were prevalent in all sampled streams. The concentrations of commonly detected PhACs were comparable to those detected in other countries. High total concentrations (mean > 1 mu g L-1) of all tested PhACs were primarily detected in areas under extreme water stress, specifically northern and eastern coastal areas. Source apportionment based on the profiles of the target compounds found that 54% of the PhACs in China originated from freshly discharged untreated sewage. Metformin (MET) and its biodegradation product, guanylurea (GUL), were used as a pair of indicators to predict PhAC contamination levels and differentiate between biotreated and unbiotreated wastewater. High MET/GUL can be used to indicate untreated wastewater, whereas low MET/GUL values are a strong indicator of treated wastewater. Furthermore, wastewater biotreatment ratios were calculated. We estimated that the bio-treatment ratios of most of the provinces in China were less than 50%. We conclude that more attention should be paid to untreated sewage water, especially water in rural areas rather than the existing concentration on urban sewage treatment-oriented management.

AB This paper presents the results of a survey of the wastewater effluent and surface waters of the lower river Tyne, UK. Samples were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry following solid phase extraction, for the presence of 13 pharmaceuticals selected from the priority lists of the UK Environment Agency and the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR). The pharmaceutical compounds measured were acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, clofibric acid, clotrimazole, dextropropoxyphene, diclofenac, erythromycin, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, tamoxifen and trimethoprim. Of the wastewater treatment works (WTW) samples (n = 9) analysed, all compounds except sulfametboxazole and acetylsulfamethoxazole were detected at concentrations ranging from 11 to 69,570 ng l(-1) (in raw effluent). In the surface water samples (n = 18), clotrimazole, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin, ibuprofen, propranolol, tamoxifen and trimethoprim were detected at concentrations ranging from 4 to 2370 ng l(-1). Results of this study show that various pharmaceutical compounds are effectively reduced during their passage through a tertiary wastewater treatment works, whilst others are sufficiently persistent to occur in estuarine systems.

AB The occurrence and behavior of beta-blockers, antiepileptic drug carbamazepine and its metabolites, X-ray contrast agent iopromide, natural and synthetic hormones, and several groups of hormone-like personal care products (PCPs), including antiseptics (triclocarban, triclosan, and 2-phenylphenol), parabens and bisphenol A, were investigated in municipal wastewater, sewage sludge, and urban river water of the Pearl River Delta, South China. The pharmaceuticals, natural hormones and PCPs were ubiquitously detected in the raw wastewater from a sewage treatment plant (STP). Only triclocarban and triclosan were detected at significant amounts in the dewatered sludge. Iopromide and the PCPs were greatly removed/transformed from the aqueous phase of the wastewater. The beta-blockers were only moderately removed/transformed. Carbamazepine passed through the STP almost unchanged. Biodegradation was the dominant process for elimination/transformation of the pharmaceuticals, hormones, and most PCPs in the STP. However, sorption also played an important role in the fate of triclocarban with nearly 50% of the mass load entering the STP ended up and persisted in the dewatered sludge. The pharmaceuticals, estrone, and PCPs were also widely detected in the Pearl River at Guangzhou. Bisphenol A had the highest concentration. The pharmaceutical concentrations in the Pearl River were higher in March than in May, most likely due to less dilution by lower precipitation. The omnipresence and high levels of the pharmaceuticals and PCPs in the Pearl River may be associated with direct discharge of untreated wastewater and pose potential risks to the ecological system.

AB Nutrient enrichment and loadings of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals into freshwater systems are common concerns, especially for water bodies receiving wastewater inputs. In the rural communities of Morden and Winkler of Manitoba, Canada, sewage lagoons discharge their wastewater directly into Dead Horse Creek, a small tributary of the Red River that empties into Lake Winnipeg. This lagoon approach to managing rural wastewaters is common across the North American Prairies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the hazards of lagoon treatment releases at this model site. This was done by characterizing the nutrients, organic micropollutants (i.e., pesticides, pharmaceuticals) and standard water quality parameters in the creek prior to and following lagoon discharge events over a number of years (2009-2011). Measured concentrations of nutrients were compared to regulatory expectations and micropollutants were assessed using hazard quotients. As expected, concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species were greatest in sites downstream of the sewage outfall immediately following discharge events. Pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals were detected at concentrations between 0.5 and 90 ng/L Detection frequencies and concentrations matched typical use patterns. Those compounds used predominately for human medicine were detected at downstream sites following discharge events, while those used in an agricultural setting were detected at relatively consistent levels over time at sites both upstream and downstream of the outfall location. Hazard quotients calculated for micropollutants of interest indicated minimal toxicological risk to aquatic biota in the creek, with only erythromycin and diazinon presenting a potential concern to aquatic algae and invertebrates. Concentrations of nutrients exceeded Canadian guideline thresholds during release, but returned to background levels once discharges ceased. Therefore, it is advisable that wastewater treatment and management strategies such as constructed wetlands and/or staggered releases be used in order to minimize the hazard posed by nutrient pulses in Dead Horse Creek and other similar systems.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be a source of environmental contamination by micropollutants, especially from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PCPs). The pathway of those compounds during sewage treatment has been investigated, but data from real-scale WWTPs is still missing (for example, the values of the solid-liquid coefficient (K-d) during treatment). This paper uses the K-d values for some pharmaceuticals and PCPs (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, propranolol, metoprolol, salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, caffeine, triclosan, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben) to describe the micropollutants' behavior in the treatment process. In order to attain this data, an aerobic wastewater treatment plant located in Brazil was studied. Six samplings were carried out and a mass balance was performed, associating the concentrations of the micropollutants in the liquid phase with the solid phase (sludge and suspended solids). Of all the compounds analyzed, caffeine was the most biodegradable pollutant, as almost 98% of its mass was biodegraded. In contrast, triclosan had the highest load in sludge (median of 163.0 mg day(-1)) and adsorbed in SS (median of 0.593 mg day(-1)) at the output. Summing up, each micropollutant had a specific way to be removed during wastewater treatment.

ID REGRESSION TREE
AB Over-standard discharge of enterprise sewage had severely weakened the processing wastewater ability of the wastewater and shortened the service life of the facility in the sewage treatment plant, more importantly, posed a serious threat to the water environment safety in the watershed. Based on the historical daily monitoring data of key monitoring enterprises and sewage treatment plant, temperature and precipitation data, the boosted regression tree (BRT) model was established. The feature variables (discharge flow, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) daily emission and COD daily monitoring concentration) were obtained by BRT model. The total contribution of feature variables accounted for 80.92%. The BRT model prediction accuracy and kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.78, respectively. Then, three single hidden-layer feedforward neural network models were constructed to analyze the importance ranking of enterprises according to each feature variable. The results showed that heavy industry and pharmaceutical enterprises ranked ahead. Last, using generalized extreme studentized deviate test (ESD) algorithm, the anomaly detection analysis was conducted to obtain the proportion of abnormal data and distribution regularities on the suspicious enterprises. Our study may provide scientific evidence and auxiliary decision support in the identification of illegal emission enterprises.

AB Occurrence of diazepam and its metabolites, nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam in the water environment in Beijing was investigated. Samples were collected from four rivers flowing through the city and from all the thirteen sewage treatment plants in the urban area. Average influent concentrations of diazepman, temazepam, and oxazepam in 2013 summer ranged from 0.9 to 7.1, 1.5 to 3.4, and 2.9 to 12.4 ng L-1, respectively, whereas nordiazepam concentrations were below quantification limit on the majority of sampling dates. No significant seasonal variation in influent concentrations was observed. Removal during treatment was low for diazepman (<50%), temazepam (<20%), and oxazepam (<20%), consistent with previous findings reported in the literature. Wastewater-based epidemiology approach was applied to back-calculate population size-normalized diazepam consumption (using temazepam as biomarker) in Beijing, which was found to be at least 3.8 times more of the national average. Diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam were widely detected in surface waters, with concentrations greater than concentrations in sewage influents at many sampling points, strongly indicating direct discharge of wastewater of high diazepam concentrations into the surface waters in the city.

AB The partitioning of steroid estrogens in wastewater treatment and receiving waters is likely to influence their discharge to, and persistence in, the environment. This study investigated the partitioning behaviour of steroid estrogens in both laboratory and field studies. Partitioning onto activated sludge from laboratory-scale Husmann units was rapid with equilibrium achieved after 1 h. Sorption isotherms and Kd values decreased in the order 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol > 17 alpha-estradiol > estrone > estriol without a sorption limit being achieved (1/n > 1). Samples from a wastewater treatment works indicated no accumulation of steroid estrogens in solids from primary or secondary biological treatment, however, a range of steroid estrogens were identified in sediment samples from the River Thames. This would indicate that partitioning in the environment may play a role in the long-term fate of estrogens, with an indication that they will be recalcitrant in anaerobic conditions.

AB Steroid hormones and biocides are regarded as emerging contaminants in rural wastewater in China, owing to their widespread occurrence and adverse effects on both aquatic organisms and humans. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an alternative technology for cost-effective and efficient decentralized rural sewage treatment. In this study, an integrated constructed wetland (ICW) system was built and used to treat a typical rural wastewater mixture composed of domestic sewage and livestock wastewater from a small village. As expected, five steroid hormones (ADD, AED, 19-NTD, T, and P) and four biocides (DEET, TCS, CBD, and MP) were detected in the influent in concentrations ranging from 30.5 +/- 1.25 ng/L to 105 +/- 5.14 ng/L and from 63.4 +/- 2.85 ng/L to 515 +/- 19.7 ng/L, respectively. The ICW system effectively removed the detected steroid hormones (97.4 +/- 0.09%) and biocides (92.4 +/- 0.54%). Based on the measured concentrations, the total pollution loadings of the detected steroid hormones and biocides in the influent were calculated to be 2330 +/- 26.5 mu g/day and 5710 +/- 196 mu g/day, which decreased to 60.8 +/- 1.44 mu g/day and 433 +/- 25.6 mu g/day in the final effluent. The risk quotients for these steroid hormones and biocides in the effluent from the ICW system were lower than those from reported wastewater treatment plants, indicating that CWs are a promising technology for removing contaminants including steroid hormones and biocides in rural wastewater, although additional efforts are required to optimize and improve the design of CWs before the steroid hormones and biocides present in the effluent can be safely and directly discharged into the environment.

AB A rapid method for determination of seven parabens and two chlorinated by-products in sewage sludge was developed based on matrix solid-phase dispersion and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical procedure showed good recoveries that ranged from 80 to 125%, with relative standard deviations lower than 12% and low detection limits, ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 ng g(-1) dry weight. The developed method was applied to the analysis of sewage sludge collected during 2010 in 19 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in various urban, industrial or rural zones in Madrid (Spain). Methylparaben was found in most of the WWTPs sampled (95%) at levels between 5.1 and 26.2 ng g(-1) dry weight and propylparaben was detected in 74% of the WWTPs at levels up to 44.1 ng g(-1) dry weight. In order to study the temporal variation of parabens and two chlorinated parabens during a four-year period, sludge samples were collected from 3 selected WWTPs. The levels of methylparaben encountered were rather constant throughout the sampling period whereas propylparaben levels slightly increased. In one of the WWTPs monitored, isopropylparaben was found at the beginning of the sampling period but its content decreased and was not detected in the 2010 sampling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, it has been demonstrated that sewage-based epidemiology can deliver interesting information on trends in illicit drug consumption. However, until now, no real evidence exists that the measured concentrations of drugs in sewage can be exactly correlated with the amounts of drugs used by a specific population. This study aimed therefore at correlating detailed monthly prescription figures of 11 pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, citalopram, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, losartan, telmisartan, valsartan, carbamazepine, metformin, and tramadol) with measured concentrations of these compounds in influent sewage from five sewage treatment plants in Belgium. For 7 out of the 11 substances, a ratio between loads calculated from the prescription figures and loads calculated from measured concentrations in the range of 0.30-3.00 was observed. For four pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, telmisartan, and venlafaxine), the observed relationship was less pronounced. The manuscript gives an overview of the possible uncertainties that are related with the calculated correlations. This study highlights the need for gathering all the necessary information regarding sewage sampling, stability of substances in sewage, pharmacokinetics, and analytical method performance when sewage-based epidemiology studies are performed.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are potentially effective for the removal of antibiotics, yet the inherent process and mechanism of antibiotic removal remain insufficiently elucidated. This study investigated the removals of eight antibiotics (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, roxithromycin) from domestic sewage in CWs of different flow types, substrates, plants, and hydraulic loading rates in two seasons. The results showed that the CWs performed efficiently for treating antibiotic contaminated urban wastewater. Flow type deciding redox condition is the domain factor of antibiotic removal through affecting methanogenic degradation. Photolysis is significant in half-substrate systems during summer with exposure to strong sunlight, while adsorption is noteworthy in full-substrate systems during winter with cold weather. Furthermore, plant presence may limit the anaerobic processes of antibiotics via radial oxygen loss. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distribution and behavior of selected pharmaceutical chemicals, including analgesics of the phenazone type and the most popular psychomotor stimulant, caffeine, have been determined in raw sewage and sewage effluents from treatment plants of several Croatian cities using gas chromatography with mass selective detection. The concentration of caffeine in untreated municipal sewage was rather high and relatively uniform (40-100 mug L-1). In contrast, the concentration of the most abundant phenazone compound, propyphenazone, was much lower and varied in a wider range (<0.1-1.0 mug L-1). Removal rate of caffeine during biological sewage treatment was very high (95-99%), while the elimination of propyphenazone was rather modest (<44%).

AB Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), a ubiquitous component of human diet has been suggested as a chemical indicator of ecosystem impacts of sewage spills and treated effluent discharges because it is not sufficiently metabolized by wastewater microorganisms. This study identified enzymes responsible for caffeine metabolism in sewage bacteria. Pseudomonas putida biotype A (ATCC 700097) originally isolated as a rare caffeine-degrading organism in domestic wastewater exhibited diauxic growth on caffeine, concomitant with the expression of a P450-type cytochrome and peroxidase enzyme activities. Initial growth phase lasted 13.8 +/- 1.4 h with a growth rate that was five times slower than the secondary growth phase that lasted 5.5 +/- 1.2 h. Molecular and enzymatic characteristics of the cytochrome P450-type enzyme differ from the previously described cytochrome P450 (P450(c)am) of P. putida (ATCC 17453) involved in camphor metabolism. The caffeine-inducible cytochrome P450-type enzyme exhibited a carbon monoxide difference spectrum peak at 450 nm, but does not allow growth on camphor. Caffeine induced production of haem-associated peroxidase activity was confirmed with 3,3', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-H2O2 reaction in polyacrylamide gels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers derived from the gene for cytochrome P450(c)am (camC) of P. putida (ATCC 17453) did not yield an amplification product when DNA extracted from P. putida strain ATCC 700097 was used as template. The data demonstrate that caffeine is metabolized through a specific biphasic pathway driven by oxygen-demanding enzymes.

AB The concentrations and fates of carbamazepine and metabolites (CBMs), nicotine and metabolites (NCTs), estrogenic compounds and metabolites (Es) in various water samples were investigated. Different concentrations were found for water from different sources. The concentrations of these pharmaceuticals and personal care products and their metabolites in human waste treatment plant (HTP) influents (0.08-173 mu g L-1) were higher than in the other influent samples and the lowest levels were observed in hospital wastewater treatment plant influents (0.03-7.33 mu g L-1). The concentrations were higher in HTP effluents (0.01-11.2 mu g L-1) than in the other effluent samples and lowest in sewage treatment plant effluents (0.003-1.26 mu g L-1). The NCTs were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (concentration range 0.05-89.6 mu g L-1) in the wastewater treatment plant influents, but the CBMs were found at the highest concentrations (0.003-6.88 mu g L-1). 10, 11-Dihydro-10, 11-dihydroxycarbamazepine was the most abundant of the CBMs in the wastewater treatment plants and water samples. Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine was dominant in the HTP and hospital wastewater treatment plant influents, whereas the parent NCT was dominant in the sewage treatment plant influents and in all the effluent and other water samples. Estriol was the dominant estrogenic compound in the HTP and hospital wastewater treatment plant influents. Estriol and estrone were found in many of the HTP influents, but estrone was dominant in the effluent and other water samples. The total removal efficiencies for the CBMs, NCTs, and estrogenic compounds for the treatment plants were -101% to 56%, 2.9%-99%, and >98%, respectively. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants contains trace concentrations of a variety of organic compounds. To assess the removal of these compounds in full-scale treatment systems and effluent-receiving waters, approaches are needed for quantifying removal rates and mechanisms. For processes that result in near complete removal of wastewater-derived contaminants, it is reasonable to measure concentrations entering and leaving the treatment system. However, for those compounds that are not completely removed, alternative methods are needed. This paper describes several examples of approaches that combine laboratory and field studies to assess the attenuation of wastewater-derived contaminants.

AB The fast development of laboratory methods has revealed increased amounts of trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) in waste waters in the Czech Republic. This paper focuses on the expected costs to solve this problem by quaternary treatment of waste water based on activated carbon filtration. The one-time investment costs in 155 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with a capacity of over 10 000 population equivalent (PE) would represent an amount of around 300 million EUR. The increase in end-user operating costs would be 0.4 EUR/m(3), which would mean a 15% increase in water and sewage costs. A sociological survey showed that most respondents (65%) would agree with an increase in price but only by 10%. Currently the cost of the quaternary treatment of wastewater is based primarily on estimates. Therefore changes in legislation leading to stricter limits and an increase in the efficiency of wastewater treatment should be preceded by additional applied research.

   REMOVAL; SLUDGE
AB A simple classification scheme is suggested to characterize the biological degradation of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances and estrogens during wastewater treatment. The scheme should be a basis for the discussion about potential removal efficiencies. Hence, the biological degradation of 25 pharmaceuticals, hormones and fragrances was studied in batch experiments at typical concentration levels using activated sewage sludge originating from nutrient-eliminating municipal wastewater treatment plants.
   Since pseudo first-order degradation kinetics was observed for all compounds down to ngL(-1) levels, the removal rates can be predicted for various reactor configurations. Therefore dilution of wastewater (e.g. by extraneous water) is expected to reduce the degree of biological removal. Wastewater segregation and treatment at the source are therefore to be favoured for elimination of persistent micropollutants over centralized end-of-pipe treatment. For reactor configurations typical for nutrient removal in municipal wastewater, the derived formula for predicting removal allows the identification of three groups of micropollutants according to their degradation constant k(biol): compounds with k(biol)<0.1Lg(ss)(-1)d(-1) are not removed to a significant extent (<20%), compounds with k(biol)>10Lg(ss)(-1)d(-1) transformed by >90% and in-between moderate removal is expected. Based on the degradation of a heterogeneous group of 35 compounds (including literature data), state of the art biological treatment schemes for municipal wastewater are not efficient in degrading pharmaceuticals: only 4 out of 35 compounds are degraded by more than 90% while 17 compounds are removed by less than 50%.

AB The occurrence of 14 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in influents, effluents and sludge from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in southem California was studied in winter and summer. All 14 compounds were detected in influent samples from the five WWTPs except for estrone. Paracetamol, naproxen and ibuprofen were the dominant compounds, with mean concentrations of 41.7, 35.7 and 22.3 mu g/L, respectively. The treatment removal efficiency for most compounds was more than 90% and concentrations in the effluents were relatively low. Seasonal variation of the compounds' concentration in the wastewater was significant: the total concentration of each compound in the wastewater was higher in winter than in summer, which is attributed to more human consumption of pharmaceuticals during winter and faster degradation of the compounds in summer. The highest concentrations of triclosan and octylphenol were detected in sewage sludge, with mean concentrations of 1505 and 1179 ng/g, respectively. Risk quotients (RQs), expressed as the ratios of environmental concentrations and the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC), were less than unity for all the compounds except for estrone in the effluents, indicating no immediate ecological risk is expected. However, RQs were higher than unity for 2 EDCs (estrone and octylphenol) and carbamazepine in sludge samples, indicating a significant ecotoxicological risk to human health. Therefore, appropriate treatment of sewage sludge is required before its application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite efforts to upgrade sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the last decades, STPs are still a major source for the contamination of surface waters, including emerging pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Because many of these substances are not completely removed in conventional STPs they are regularly detected in surface waters where they have the potential to affect local macroinvertebrate communities. The objective of the current work was to investigate the impact of an estrogenic wastewater effluent on the key life-history traits of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex. G. pulex was exposed in artificial indoor flow-channels under constant conditions to different wastewater concentrations (0%, 33%, 66%, 100%). In parallel the estrogenic activity of wastewater samples was determined using the yeast estrogen screen (YES). Estrogenic activities in the STP effluent were up to 38.6ng/L estradiol equivalents (EEQ). Amphipods exhibited an increasing body length with increasing wastewater concentrations. Furthermore, we observed a shift of the sex ratio in favour of females, a significantly increased fraction of brooding females and increased fecundity indices with increasing wastewater concentrations. The increased body length is likely to be attributed to the additional nutrient supply while the occurrence of EDCs in the wastewater is the probable cause for the altered sex ratio and fecundity in exposed Gammarus cohorts.

AB The stability of five illicit drug markers in wastewater was tested under different sewer conditions using laboratory-scale sewer reactors. Wastewater was spiked with deuterium labelled isotopes of cocaine, benzoyl ecgonine, methamphetamine, MDMA and 6-acetyl morphine to avoid interference from the native isotopes already present in the wastewater matrix. The sewer reactors were operated at 20 degrees C and pH 7.5, and wastewater was sampled at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h to measure the transformation/degradation of these marker compounds. The results showed that while methamphetamine, MDMA and benzoyl ecgonine were stable in the sewer reactors, cocaine and 6-acetyl morphine degraded quickly. Their degradation rates are significantly higher than the values reportedly measured in wastewater alone (without biofilms). All the degradation processes followed first order kinetics. Benzoyl ecgonine and morphine were also formed from the degradation of cocaine and 6-acetyl morphine, respectively, with stable formation rates throughout the test. These findings suggest that, in sewage epidemiology, it is essential to have relevant information of the sewer system (i.e. type of sewer, hydraulic retention time) in order to accurately back-estimate the consumption of illicit drugs. More research is required to look into detailed sewer conditions (e.g. temperature, pH and ratio of biofilm area to wastewater volume among others) to identify their effects on the fate of illicit drug markers in sewer systems.

AB Tracking sewage wastewater in a large lake is difficult. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals that can be used as indicator compounds are quickly diluted and not easy to measure. In this study, we examined the potential of using medically-derived iodine-131 (I-131, t1/2 = 8.02 d) as a tracer for Milwaukee sewage effluent in Lake Michigan. 131I activities in sewage effluent from two Milwaukee wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were measured in conjunction with 131I activities in water, sediment and biota in the Milwaukee Outer Harbor and Lake Michigan. 131I discharge rates from both WWTPS ranged from 34 +/- 15 to 1807 +/- 24 MBq d(-1), with average and median 131I discharges of 278 and 129 MBq d(-1). A budget of 131I in the Milwaukee Outer Harbor - based on measured sediment and water column inventories - showed that similar to 11% of the 131I discharged to the harbor was scavenged to bottom sediments, similar to 19% decayed in the harbor water column, and similar to 70% was flushed out of the harbor to Lake Michigan. From this budget, we derived a harbor flushing rate of 3.1 days. In Lake Michigan, 131I activity was found in Cladophora algae (undetected to 91 +/- 2 Bq kg(-1)) along similar to 40 km of shoreline. Benthic trawl samples showed 131I activity up to 8 km from shore. Calculated 131I length scales were 30 km alongshore and 3.4 km offshore and corresponded to sewage effluent dispersion rates of similar to 2.6 km d(-1) and similar to 0.3 km d(-1) in along- and offshore directions. Using 131I as a tracer of sewage effluent from other coastal municipalities to the Laurentian Great Lakes appears feasible, particularly for larger (>10(5)) population centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the pollutant removal efficiency of different types of wastewaters by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). A laboratory-scale SBR was used to treat sewage, medical wastewater and industrial wastewater. The effects of different conditions of aeration, stirring and settling on the efficiency of pollutants removal were explored to optimize the performance, especially for the removal of organic matter (COD), ammonia nitrogen(NH4+-N), total nitrogen(TN) and total phosphorus(TP) of different types of polluted water. From the results it was showed that when aeration 6 hours, stirring 4 hours and settling 2 hours in SBR, the removal rates of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus of domestic sewage were 93%, 98% and 83%, respectively; when aeration 5 hours, stirring 5 hours and settling 1 hour in the SBR, the removal rates of COD and nitrogen of pharmaceutical wastewater were 83% and 90%, respectively; when aeration 4 hours, stirring 4 hours and settling 1 hour in the SBR, removal rates of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus of industrial wastewater were 97%, 93% and 97%, respectively.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and removals of micropollutants in the sewage treatment tank (STT) which is a typical private wastewater treatment facility used in the rural communities in Korea, and their impact on receiving water. STTs were selected in eight provinces to examine the regional difference in the composition of micropollutant occurrence. We measured ten selected micropollutants in influents and effluents of STTs, as well as upstream and downstream of its receiving surface water. The dominant micropollutants in the influent of the STTs were caffeine (13,346 ng/L), acetaminophen (11,331 ng/L), ibuprofen (1440 ng/L), and naproxen (1313 ng/L), in agreement with the amounts produced annually in Korea. In the effluent, caffeine (1912 ng/L), acetaminophen (1586 ng/L), naproxen (475 ng/L), and ibuprofen (389 ng/L) were detected in relatively high concentrations. The composition of micropollutants in STT influents showed little regional variation by provinces, suggesting that the consumption pattern of these micropollutants did not show regional variation. The removal efficiencies of the selected micropollutants at the STTs ranged from 12% (carbamazepine) to 88% (acetaminophen), lower than typical removal by sewage treatment plants (STPs). This result is probably due to the automatic operation systems and simple treatment processes in STTs compared with STPs. The concentrations of selected micropollutants upstream of the receiving water were generally lower compared with those observed downstream, indicating that effluent from STTs was the main source. The per capita discharge loads of STTs and annual emissions rates (kg/year) from private wastewater treatment facilities were estimated for the selected micropollutants.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a real-time tool used to monitor tobacco consumption. In this study, we investigated the tobacco consumption in eight cities in Jilin province using sewage epidemiology. We collected influent wastewater samples from ten wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that serve nearly four million people. Mean nicotine (NIC) loads ranged from 1.42 to 14.2 mg/d/capita, whereas mean cotinine (COT) loads showed lower levels with 033 to 2.15 mg/d/capita. Population size was estimated to provide an accurate and real-time population based on ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) concentration in influent. To verify the NH4-N equivalent population, we compared these results with the corresponding population estimated based on the expert knowledge of the local WWTPs operators. Daily consumption of NIC was estimated to be approximately 2.39 +/- 1.47 mg/d/capita. Monte Carlo simulation was used to analyze uncertainty and variability in the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers in the range of 9.8 to 31.4 per day with a median of 16.9. The data of tobacco consumption in this study coordinated strongly with a traditional survey on the consumption of tobacco in China, indicating sewage epidemiology with NH4-N equivalent population estimation may provide a suitable and useful tool for tobacco use monitoring.

AB Enantiomeric compositions and fractions (EFs) of three chiral imidazole (econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole) and one chiral triazole (tebuconazole) antifungals were investigated in wastewater, river water, and bed sediment of the Pearl River Delta, South China. The imidazole pharmaceuticals in the untreated wastewater were racemic to weakly nonracemic (EFs of 0.450-0.530) and showed weak enantioselectivity during treatment in the sewage treatment plant. The EFs of the dissolved azole antifungals were usually different from those of the sorbed azoles in the suspended particulate matter, suggesting different behaviors for the enantiomers of the chiral azole antifungals in the dissolved and particulate phases of the wastewater. The azole antifungals were widely present in the rivers. The bed sediment was a sink for the imidazole antifungals. The imidazoles were prevalently racemic, whereas tebuconazole was widely nonracemic in the rivers. Seasonal effects were observed on distribution and chirality of the azole antifungals. Concentrations of the azole antifungals in the river water were relatively higher in winter than in spring and summer while the EF of miconazole in the river water was higher in summer. The mechanism of enantiomeric behavior of the chiral azole antifungals in the environment warrants further research.

AB An analytical method was developed to separately determine acetaminophen and its Phase II metabolites, acetaminophen glucuronide and acetaminophen sulfate, from wastewater in a single extract. The method developed will serve as a model for screening for the presence of other non-steroidal pharmaceutical compounds and their Phase II metabolites in wastewater. Acetaminophen glucuronide was not present in the wastewater influent tested to verify the analytical protocol, whereas concentrations of acetaminophen and acetaminophen sulfate in the influent were reproducible over time. A Phase I metabolite, p-aminophenol, was also determined to occur in the wastewater influent. Concentrations of the analytes-of-interest, detected in effluent samples collected after secondary treatment, but before UV treatment, were highly variable and were undetectable after UV treatment before release to surface water.

AB Aim of this study was to provide an up-to-date assessment of the antibiotics contaminating the aqueous environment in Italy, for a better understanding of risks for the ecosystem and human health. Antibiotics were first listed in order of their theoretical environmental loads, then were measured in wastewater of some sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in rivers in Italy. Macrolides, particularly clarithromycin and spiramycin, and quinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin and L-floxacin/ofloxacin, were the most abundant antibiotics in untreated wastewater. Several of them were not removed in STPs and still remained in the treated wastewater, and a total estimate of 7-14 tons of active principles were discharged annually into the aqueous environment in Italy through this route. Results of the analysis of rivers in northern Italy agreed with these figures, with an average load of 5 kg/day, or about 1.8 tons/year, of antibiotics flowing in the River Po, at sampling sites covering a basin comprising about one-fifth of the Italian population. In conclusion, antibiotics, particularly macrolides and quinolones, are widespread environmental contaminants, and urban STPs are confirmed a major source of the contamination. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

AB Wastewater samples collected from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Guangzhou, China were acidified, solid-phase extracted (SPE) with Oasis HLB cartridges, followed by instrumental measurement by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a diode array UV detector (DAD) and a fluorescence detector (FLD) for the occurrence and fate of antimicrobial compounds sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ofloxacin (OFX) and chloramphenicol (CAP). Antimicrobials have been detected at 5.10-5,15, 5.45-7.91, 3.52-5.56 and 1.73-2.43 mu g L-1 for SDZ, SMX, OFX and CAP in the raw sewages of the two STPs, respectively. The concentrations of antimicrobials do not show substantial changes after preliminary mechanical sedimentation. No quantifiable sulfionamides and chloramphenicol have been identified, and > 85% of ofloxacin has been removed in the effluents after activated sludge treatment in the two STPs, indicating that activated sludge treatment is effective and necessary to remove antimicrobial substances in municipal sewage.

AB A comprehensive screening of micropollutants was performed in wastewaters from on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) and urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) in Sweden. A suspect screening approach, using high resolution mass spectrometry, was developed and used in combination with target analysis. With this strategy, a total number of 79 micropollutants were successfully identified, which belong to the groups of per-and polyfluoroallcyl substances (PFASs), pesticides, phosphorus-containing flame retardants (PFRs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results from this screening indicate that concentrations of micropollutants are similar in influents and effhients of OSSFs and WWTPs, respectively. Removal efficiencies of micropollutants were assessed in the OSSFs and compared with those observed in WWTPs. In general, removal of PFASs and PFRs was higher in package treatment OSSFs, which are based on biological treatments, while removal of PPCPs was more efficient in soil bed OSSFs. A novel comprehensive prioritization strategy was then developed to identify OSSF specific chemicals of environmental relevance. The strategy was based On the compound concentrations in the wastewater, removal efficiency, frequency of detection in OSSFs and on in silico based data for toxicity, persistency and bioaccumulation potential.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) can reach soil and aquatic environments through land application of wastewater effluent and agricultural runoff. The objective of this research was to assess the fate of PPCPs at field scale. PPCPs were measured systematically in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and in soil and groundwater receiving treated effluent from the WWTP. A land application site in West Texas was used as the study site; it has received treated wastewater effluent from the WWTP for more than 70 years in order to remove additional nutrients and irrigate non-edible crops. Target compounds (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, triclosan, caffeine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin) in wastewater, sewage sludge, soil, and groundwater were determined using HPLC/UV with qualitative confirmatory analyses using GC/MS. Samples were collected quarterly over 12 months for wastewater and sludge samples and over 9 months for soil and groundwater samples. Results indicated that concentrations of PPCPs in wastewater influent, effluent, sludge solid phase, and sludge liquid phase were in the range of non-detected (ND)-183 mu g/L, ND-83 mu g/L, ND-19 mu g/g, and ND-50 mu g/L, respectively. Concentrations in soil and groundwater samples were in the range of ND-319 ng/g and ND-1,745 mu g/L, respectively. GC/MS confirmation data were consistent with the results of HPLC/UV analyses. Overall, data indicate that PPCPs in the wastewater effluent from the WWTP transport both vertically and horizontally in the soil, and eventually reach groundwater following land application of the effluent.

AB Antibiotics consumption has increased worldwide, and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. It is believed that antibiotics reach aquatic water bodies through sewage. Medicine consumed for healthcare practices are often released into sewage, and after sewage treatment plant, it reaches the receiving water bodies of lakes or rivers. In the present study, we determined the fate of some commonly used antibiotics in a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Delhi and the environmental concentration of these antibiotics in the Yamuna River, which receives the sewage and industrial effluent of Delhi. There are many reports on antibiotics occurrences in STP and river water worldwide, but monitoring data from the Indian subcontinent is sparse. Samples were taken from a STP and from six sampling sites on the Yamuna River. Several antibiotics were tested for using offline solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array analysis. Recoveries varied from 25.5-108.8 %. Ampicillin had the maximum concentration in wastewater influents (104.2 +/- 98.11 mu g l(-1)) and effluents (12.68 +/- 8.38 mu g l(-1)). The fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins had the lower concentrations. Treatment efficiencies varied between 55 and 99 %. Significant amounts of antibiotics were discharged in effluents and were detected in the receiving water body. The concentration of antibiotics in the Yamuna River varied from not detected to 13.75 mu g l(-1) (ampicillin) for the compounds investigated.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of both natural estrogens, estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3), and a synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), were investigated in sewage treatment plant in Centre Eastern Tunisia employing simple activated sludge process. Concentrations of target estrogens were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer. Among the estrogens studied, E3 was found as the dominant compound detected in wastewater samples with average concentration up to 300 +/- 4 ng/L in influent and up to 36 +/- 2 in effluent. High aqueous phase removals (>85%) were achieved for E3, while only low to moderate removals for E1, E2, and EE2 (<75%). Based on the mass balance analysis, sorption onto sludge played a dominant role in the removal of estrogens in warm season, especially for E1 and E2 (69.5 and 66.3%, respectively), while biological degradation played a significant role in hot season (61%).

AB Sewage sludge applied to soil may be a valuable fertiliser but can also introduce poorly degradable and highly adsorptive wastewater-born residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) to the soil, posing a potential risk to the receiving environment Three azole antimycotics (climbazole, ketoconazole and fluconazole), and one quaternary ammonium compound (benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride, BDDA) that are frequently detected in municipal sewage sludge and/or treated wastewater were therefore characterised in their toxicity toward terrestrial (Brassica napus) and aquatic (Lemna minor) plants. Fluconazole and climbazole showed the greatest toxicity to B. napus, while toxicity of ketoconazole and BDDA was by one to two orders of magnitude lower. Sludge amendment to soil at an agriculturally realistic rate of 5 t/ha significantly reduced the bioconcentration of BDDA in B. napus shoots compared to tests without sludge amendment, although not significantly reducing phytotoxicity. Ketoconazole, fluconazole and BDDA proved to be very toxic to L minor with median effective concentrations ranging from 55.7 mu g/L. to 969 mu g/L. In aquatic as well as terrestrial plants, the investigated azoles exhibited growth-retarding symptoms presumably related to an interference with phytohormone synthesis as known for structurally similar fungicides used in agriculture. While all four substances exhibited considerable phytotoxicity, the effective concentrations were at least one order of magnitude higher than concentrations measured in sewage sludge and effluent Based on preliminary hazard quotients, BDDA and climbazole appeared to be of greater environmental concern than the two pharmaceuticals fluconazole and ketoconazole.

AB In this study, residues of the neuropsychiatric and illicit drugs including stimulants, opioids, hallucinogens, anti-schizophrenics, sedatives, and antidepressants were determined in influent and effluent samples from a small wastewater treatment plant, a receiving creek, and river waters in the Four Rivers region of the Midwestern United States. Nineteen neuropsychiatric drugs, eight illicit drugs, and three metabolites of illicit drugs were detected and quantitated in the water samples using HPLC-MS/MS. Residual concentrations of the drugs varied from below the detection limit to sub-mu g/L levels. The source of residual cocaine and benzoylecgonine in wastewater is primarily from human consumption of cocaine rather than direct disposal. Wastewater based epidemiology is utilized to estimate the community usage of drugs based on the concentration of drug residues in wastewater, wastewater inflow, and the population served by the centralized wastewater treatment plant. The per-capita consumption rate of methamphetamine (1740 mg/d/1000 people) and amphetamine (970 mg/d/ 1000 people) found in this study were the highest reported per-capita consumption rates in the USA. Antidepressant venlafaxine found to have the highest environmental emission from the WWTP (333 +/- 160 mg/d/1000 people) followed by citalopram (132 +/- 60.2 mg/d/1000 people), methamphetamine (111 +/- 43.6 mg/d/1000 people), and hydrocodone (108 +/- 90.1 mg/d/1000 people). Bee Creek, an immediate receiving water body, is found to be a source of several neuropsychiatric and illicit drugs including methamphetamine, methadone, alprazolam, oxazepam, temazepam, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram, sertraline, oxycodone, and hydrocodone (p < 0.036) in the Clarks River.

AB Aquatic toxicity of municipal wastewater was evaluated in an acute toxicity test using water flea, Daphnia magna as an freshwater aquatic experimental animal model. Toxicity test were performed on samples of both untreated (raw) and treated wastewaters were collected Manisa municipal effluents. Undiluted untread and treated effluents were very toxic to D. magnaand cause to death of all exposed daphnids. Dilution of wastewaters was observed to decrease percentage of influence of biological toxicity based on dilutional rate. Acute toxic effect of untreated wastewater on D. magnawas more than that of treated wastewater. In addition, the longer the period of exposure to D. magna, the more significantly toxic effect increased.

AB Ozonation as advanced wastewater treatment method is an effective technique for micropollutant removal. However, the application of this method carries the inherent danger to produce toxic oxidation by products For an ecotoxicological assessment conventionally treated wastewater, wastewater after ozonation and ozonated wastewater after sand filtration were evaluated in parallel at an operating treatment plant via the fish early life stage toxicity test (FELST) using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
   The FELST revealed a considerable developmental retardation of test organisms exposed to ozonated WW This was accompanied by a significant decrease in body weight and length compared to reference water, to the conventionally treated WW and to the ozonated water after sand filtration Hence sand filtration obviously prevents from adverse ecotoxicological effects of ozonation
   An additional test with yolk-sac larvae resulted in a significant reduction of vitellogenin levels in fish exposed to ozonated wastewater compared to fish reared in conventionally treated wastewater This demonstrates the effective removal of estrogenic activity by ozonation
   Adverse ozonation effects may have been a result of the conversion of chemicals into more toxic metabolites However, sand filtration reduced toxication effects indicating that these oxidation by products are readily degradable or adsorbable The results indicate that in any case ozonation should not be applied without subsequent post treatment appropriate for oxidation by products removal (e g sand filtration).

AB Environmental analytical studies show that trace concentrations of antibacterial agents (antibiotics) occur in hospital and municipal wastewaters and in the aquatic environment. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides, two important human-use antibiotic classes, were studied in detail. The results are discussed regarding input sources and behavior in wastewater treatment and rivers. The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are substantially eliminated in wastewater treatment (80-90%) by sorption transfer to sewage sludge. In digested sludges the fluoroquinolones occur at mg/kg levels. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are further removed in the Glatt river by 66 and 48%, respectively. The most abundant macrolide clarithromycin was detected at 57 to 330 ng/l concentrations in treated wastewater effluents. Different compositions of the macrolides (clarithromycin and erythromycin-H2O) determined in treated effluents of three wastewater treatment plants can be explained by distinct consumption patterns, in one case due to an international airport located in the catchment area. Residual levels of clarithromycin in the Glatt river were up to 75 ng/l with no apparent removal in the river. These results provide important information on environmental exposures, which can be incorporated into environmental risk assessments of the particular chemicals.

AB The aerobic biodegradability of four antimicrobials (sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole, and trimethoprim) was investigated in sewage collected at four treatment stages (primary treatment, activated sludge treatment, aerobic nitrification process, and after disinfection of treated sewage) of a municipal sewage treatment plant. The biodegradability tests were conducted in aerated batch reactors by spiking the sewage with 20 mu g/L of each of the test substance. Concentration profiles of the assayed compounds were monitored during a 54-d period using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. Substantial differences in the degradation curves were observed between trimethoprim and the three sulfonamides. The behavior of the latter was characterized by a general biodegradability in the primary and secondary treatment. The highest degradation rates were obtained in the sewage from the activated sludge treatment, where no adaptation phase was observed. On the other hand, the onset of biodegradation in the sewage from the primary treatment was preceded by a lag phase ranging from 10 to 15 d. In contrast, trimethoprim displayed high resistance to microbial degradation in the sewage from the primary treatment and the activated sludge treatment. However, primary degradation of this compound was completed within only 3 d in the sewage from the nitrification process.

ID DRUG-USE; ILLICIT; BIOMARKERS; SEWAGE; TRENDS
AB An important uncertainty when estimating per capita consumption of, for example, illicit drugs by means of wastewater analysis (sometimes referred to as "sewage epidemiology") relates to the size and variability of the de, facto population in the catchment of interest. In the absence of a day-specific direct population count any indirect surrogate model to estimate population size lacks a standard to assess uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study associated uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collect wastewater samples at a unique opportunity, that is, on a census day, as a basis for a model to estimate the number of people contributing to a given wastewater sample. Mass loads for a wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were quantified in influents of ten sewage treatment (STP) serving populations ranging from approximately 3500 to 500 000 people. Separate linear models for population size were estimated with the mass loads of the different chemical as the explanatory variable: 14 chemicals showed good, linear relationships, with highest correlations for acesulfame and gabapentin. De facto population was then estimated through Bayesian inference, by updating the population size provided by STP staff (prior knowledge) with measured chemical mass loads. Cross validation showed that large populations can be estimated fairly accurately with a few chemical mass loads quantified from 24-h composite samples. In contrast, the prior knowledge for small population sizes cannot be improved substantially despite the information of multiple chemical mass loads. In the future, observations other than chemical mass loads may improve this deficit, since Bayesian inference allows including any kind of information relating to population size.

AB Treatment of wastewater is often inadequate or completely lacking in Arctic regions. Wastewater contains different kinds of substances that can be harmful for the environment and human health, including residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Bioaccumulation and biomagnifications of chemicals in the food web are of concern. This can affect fishery that is a significant industry in many Arctic coastal regions. Wastewater from human settlements may also contain antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens that can cause negative impacts on human health and the environment. In the Arctic, especially, the direct release of untreated sewage may have severe consequences for the receiving environment due to low biological diversity, low ambient temperatures and consequently high vulnerability of the Arctic ecosystem to environmental contaminants.
   Bucket toilets are common in remote settlements but are also used in towns. In settlements having inadequate sanitary facilities the risk of contracting diseases, such as hepatitis A, is unacceptably high. Conventional centralized wastewater collection systems and treatment plants are a challenge to build in the Arctic and expensive to operate. Thus alternative methods are needed. Possible solutions are improved dry or low flush toilets with collection of toilet waste at the household level and subsequent centralized treatment by dry composting or anaerobic digestion. Both treatment methods facilitate co-treatment of wastewater along with other organic waste fractions and provide a by-product that is environmentally safe and easy to handle. Combining the above with decentralized greywater treatment will reduce the costs for expensive infrastructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study evaluates the presence of nine hormones and their conjugates and 20 pharmaceuticals such as anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, and antibiotics among others in sewage sludge from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Tarragona area (Spain) for the period March 2007 until March 2008. Target analytes have been determined using different methods involving pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography (electrospray ionization) tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Most of the pharmaceuticals and hormones were found at low micrograms per kilogram dry weight levels in the sewage sludge samples analyzed. Some compounds were present in all samples, such as acetaminophen. caffeine, carbamazepine, and ibuprofen, among others. Other compounds, such as estriol, were found only in the. STP of Reus. The compounds that showed the highest concentration in both STPs were roxithromycin and tylosin (1,446 and 1,958 mu g/kg dry wt, respectively). The presence of these compounds in sewage sludge demonstrated that they are partially or totally removed from the influent wastewater by sorption into the sewage sludge. Environ. Toxicol.

AB In this work graphene was used for evaluation of its adsorption behavior and performance in removing phthalate esters and pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater. Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), acetaminophen (ACE), caffeine (CAF), cephalexin (CLX), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were emerging contaminants (ECs) with detection frequencies over 92% in a one-year monitoring of the occurrence of ECs in influent samples of a sewage treatment plant in Taiwan. Thus, these ECs were selected as the target contaminants for removal by graphene adsorption process. Experimental results showed that the adsorption isotherm data were fitted well to Langmuir model equation. It was also found that the adsorption process obeyed the pseudosecond-order kinetics. A graphene dosage of 0.1 g/L and adsorption time of 12 h were found to be the optimal operating conditions for the ECs of concern in model solutions in a preliminary study. By using the determined optimal operating conditions for removal of such ECs in actual municipal wastewater, removal efficiencies for various ECs were obtained and given as follows: (1) DnBP, 89%, (2) DEHP, 86%, (3) ACE, 43%, (4) CAF, 84%, (5) CLX, 81%, and (6) SMX, 34%.

AB We studied the removal of 61 emerging micropollutants, including illicit drugs, in a biofilter wastewater treatment plant located in the French Indies (Martinique). Raw wastewater concentrations were the highest for paracetamol followed by caffeine, naproxen, ibuprofen, its metabolite 2-hydroxyibuprofen, atenolol, ketoprofen, furosemide, methylparaben, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and 11-nor-delta-9-carboxytetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). The calculated removals were better than those reported in the literature, while the cumulative removal efficacy (i.e., removal of the total mass load) was estimated to be 92 +/- 4%. However, this good performance may be partly explained by the removal of paracetamol (also named acetaminophen) and caffeine, which represented 86.4% of the total mass load. Our results point to the adsorption of some molecules on sludge, thus raising the question about local soil pollution from sludge spreading.

AB The application of sewage sludge in soils can bring benefits to agricultural productivity, however, the risks arising from this application must be measured and carefully evaluated. Persistent organics compounds and drugs can be present in the sewage sludge and if applied to the soil, they can cause severe risks to the soil biota and contamination of groundwater. This work determined 174 persistent organic compounds and drugs in sludge samples from a wastewater treatment plant using chromatographic methods. The drugs ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and diclofenac were quantified, and values varied according to sampling period. For persistent organic compounds, cresols were the most abundant compounds in sewage sludge. With the analyses made of both the elutriate and the filtrate, it was possible to verify the potential for soil retention or leaching that each compound can present with the application of sewage sludge in the agriculture.

AB Pharmaceutical residues, which pass naturally through the human body into sewage, are in many cases virtually unaffected by conventional wastewater treatment. Accumulated in the environment, however, they can significantly impact aquatic life. The present study indicates that many pharmaceutical residues found in wastewater can be removed with activated carbon in a cost-efficient system that delivers higher resource utilisation and security than other carbon systems. The experiment revealed a substantial separation of the analysed compounds, notwithstanding their relatively high solubility in water and dissimilar chemical structures. This implies that beds of activated carbon may be a competitive alternative to treatment with ozone. The effluent water used for the tests, performed over 20 months, originated from Stockholm's largest sewage treatment plant. Passing through a number of different filters with activated carbon removed 90-98% of the pharmaceutical residues from the water. This paper describes pilot-scale tests performed by IVL and the implications for an actual treatment plant that has to treat up to several thousand litres of wastewater per second. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages and costs of the method are discussed. This includes, for example, the clogging of carbon filters and the associated hydraulic capacity limits of the activated carbon.

AB The detection of pharmaceuticals and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in ground water and surface-water bodies has raised concerns about the possible ecological impacts of these compounds on nontarget organisms. On-site wastewater treatment systems represent a potentially significant route of entry for organic contaminants to the environment. In this study, effluent samples were collected and analyzed from conventional septic systems and from systems using advanced treatment technologies. Six of 13 target compounds were detected in effluent from at least one septic system. Caffeine, paraxanthine, and acetaminophen were the most frequently detected compounds, and estrogenic activity was detected in 14 of 15 systems. The OWC concentrations were significantly lower in effluent after sand filtration (p < 0.01) or aerobic treatment (p < 0.05) as compared with effluent that had not undergone advanced treatment. In general, concentrations in conventional systems were comparable to those measured in previous studies of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent, and concentrations in systems after advanced treatment were comparable to previously measured concentrations in WWTP effluent. These data indicate that septic Systems using advanced treatment can reduce OWCs in treated effluent to similar concentrations as municipal WWTPs.

AB Wastewater treatment plants in large urban agglomerations are worldwide among the main sources of emerging contaminants in aquatic systems. The present study is a first comprehensive characterization of potentially harmful emerging contaminants in sewage of a Chinese urban area. The study area Haikou City is located at the coast of tropical Hainan Island. A GC/MS based non-target screening approach for the identification of a wider range of lipophilic to semi-polar organic sewage constituents was applied. Pollution originating from sewage was tracked in the urban coastal waters by using selected source-specific indicators.
   A set of sewage constituents with a high structural diversity was identified comprising both, industrial and household chemicals. Ingredients of personal care products, pesticides and pharmaceuticals were found, that were rarely reported from other regions of the world. This observation might be attributed to different environmental legislation and consumption habits in China. Exceptionally high concentrations of the illegal drug ketamine with up to 1100 ng L-1 were detected, suggesting its high popularity and consumption rate. Noteworthy, sewage constituents reported here for the first time were the pharmaceuticals marmesin, oxolamine and ansimar also with high concentrations of up to 1200 ng L-1.
   Elevated concentrations of sewage indicators in the main city area suggest the overflow of the sewage system, in particular in the period of a typhoon event. Tracing the sewage contamination in the surface water system of the coastal urban area of Haikou revealed a lower level of pollution. The concentration ranges point to no acute risks for the coastal ecosystem due to sewage inputs from the city area.
   Generally, the detected spectrum of municipal emerging contaminants has to be considered for the testing and technical improvement of wastewater treatment techniques, for regular monitoring of the surface water quality and for environmental impact assessment in China. Furthermore, the compound spectrum reported here is a good reference point for the composition of municipal sewage in other emerging economies.

AB Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was used to measure the concentrations of 14 pharmaceuticals, 6 hormones, 2 antibiotics, 3 personal care products (PCPs), and 1 flame retardant in surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents in South Korea. Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), iopromide, naproxen, carbamazepine, and caffeine were quite frequently observed (> 80%) in both surface waters and effluents. The analytes of greatest concentration were iopromide, TCEP, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine. However, the primary estrogen hormones, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol, were rarely detected, while estrone was detected in both surface water and wastewater effluent. The elimination of these chemicals during drinking water and wastewater treatment processes at full- and pilot-scale also was investigated. Conventional drinking water treatment methods were relatively inefficient for contaminant removal, while efficient removal (approximate to 99%) was achieved by granular activated carbon (GAC). In wastewater treatment processes, membrane bioreactors (MBR) showed limited target compound removal, but were effective at eliminating hormones and some pharmaceuticals (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and caffeine). Membrane filtration processes using reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration. (NF) showed excellent removal (> 95%) for all target analytes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study shows that ozonation of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is likely to be a future treatment solution to remove estrogens and xeno-estrogens. The required ozone dose and electrical energy for producing the ozone were determined in two WWTP effluents for removal of 17 estrogenic chemicals. The estrogenic compounds included parabens, industrial phenols, sunscreen chemicals, and steroid estrogens. The obtained values of Electrical Energy per Order (EEOs) for the treatment of the estrogens were in the range 0.14-1.1 kWh/m(3) corresponding to 1.7-14 g O(3)/m(3). It is furthermore suggested that UV-absorbance is a useful parameter for online control of the ozone dose in a full scale application since the absorbance of the WWTP effluents and the remaining concentration of the estrogens and xeno-estrogens correlated well with the applied ozone dose.

In this paper pharmaceuticals were investigated as potential chemical indicators of water contamination with sewage. The monitoring program carried out in Wales revealed that some pharmaceuticals are particularly persistent and/or ubiquitous in contaminated river water and therefore might be considered as potential conservative or labile wastewater indicators. In particular, these include some anti-inflammatory/analgesics, antiepileptics, beta-blockers, some H2-receptor antagonists and antibacterial drugs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During 8 sampling campaigns carried out over a period of two years, 72 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, and sludge samples from three conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), were analyzed to assess the occurrence and fate of 43 pharmaceutical compounds. The selected pharmaceuticals belong to different therapeutic classes, i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid modifying agents (fibrates and statins), psychiatric drugs (benzodiazepine derivative drugs and antiepileptics), histamine H2-receptor antagonists, antibacterials for systemic use, beta blocking agents, beta-agonists, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and anti-diabetics. The obtained results showed the presence of 32 target compounds in wastewater influent and 29 in effluent, in concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few mu g/L (e.g. NSAIDs). The analysis of sludge samples showed that 21 pharmaceuticals accumulated in sewage sludge from all three WWTPs in concentrations up to 100 ng/g. This indicates that even good removal rates obtained in aqueous phase (i.e. comparison of influent and effluent wastewater concentrations) do not imply degradation to the same extent. For this reason, the overall removal was estimated as a sum of all the losses of a parent compound produces by different mechanisms of chemical and physical transformation, biodegradation and sorption to solid matter. The target compounds showed very different removal rates and no logical pattern in behaviour even if they belong to the same therapeutic groups. What is clear is that the elimination of most of the substances is incomplete and improvements of the wastewater treatment and subsequent treatments of the produced sludge are required to prevent the introduction of these micro-pollutants in the environment.

AB Senior residences are health-care facilities that are socially-accepted for the assistance of elderly people. Since the elderly account for the foremost pharmaceutical-consuming age-group, senior residences become a hot-spot for pharmaceuticals discharge to the sewage grid. The objectives of the present study were to identify the bioactive pharmaceuticals in sewage waters from senior residences and to propose an on-site monitoring strategy for their control. In this study, we have studied the presence of 43 pharmaceuticals highly consumed by the elderly population in six senior residences located in Spain, France and Portugal. Wastewater was sampled directly from the water-chest in each residence during different times of the day throughout one week. Main compounds detected at the high mu g L-1 level were analgesic and antipyretic drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen; antibiotics such as amoxicillin and sulfamethoxazole; compounds for the treatment of neuropathies as gabapentin, trazodone and valsartan; pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diabetes (vildagliptin) and anticancer drugs. The daily loads discharged were estimated and their fate was evaluated. The final objective of this study is to highlight the need to implement at-source waste water treatment procedures in senior residences, which have been identified as a point source pollution of pharmaceuticals.

AB The ecological threat associated with emerging pollutants detected in wastewater was estimated in country level. Treated wastewater was analyzed for pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs; whereas the concentrations of all emerging contaminants determined in Greek Sewage Treatment Plants were recorded through literature review. Toxicity data was collected after literature review or using ECOSAR and risk quotients (RQs) were calculated for treated wastewater and 25 Greek rivers, for 3 different aquatic organisms (fish, daphnia magna, algae). According to the results, monitoring data was available for 207 micropollutants belonging to 8 different classes. RQ > 1 was calculated for 30 compounds in secondary treated wastewater. Triclosan presented RQ > 1 (in algae) for all studied rivers; decamethylcyclopentasilane (in daphnia magna), caffeine (in algae) and nonylphenol (in fish) presented RQ > 1 in rivers with dilution factors (OF) equal or lower to 1910, 913 and 824, respectively. The class of emerging contaminants that present the greatest threat due to single or mixture toxicity was endocrine disrupters. The mixture of microcontaminants seems to pose significant ecological risk, even in rivers with DF equal to 2388. Future national monitoring programs should include specific microcontaminants that seem to possess environment risk to surface water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations and retention of pharmaceutically active substances are crucial for assessing the environmental risk of medication of humans. We hypothesize that environmental introduction concentrations (EICs) of drugs in the Mexico City-Mezquital Valley wastewater irrigation system can be estimated using information on water consumption, sales data, and excretion rates. EICs of six acidic and five basic drugs were calculated and compared with concentrations measured in wastewater, irrigation water, soil drainage, and springs by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). EICs of trimethoprim, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in sewage equaled or exceeded the US FDA action limit of 1 mu g/L for detailed environmental risk assessment (ERA). Concentrations of clarithromycin, clindamycin, metoprolol, sulfasalazine, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil were smaller. Calculated EICs of all compounds except metoprolol and clarithromycin were comparable to measured concentrations if excretion rates were considered. Whereas concentrations of basic compounds with positive or neutral charges were effectively reduced during reservoir storage and soil passage, acidic, anionic compounds were hardly retained. Though realistic EICs can be predicted for most substances, large deviations between EICs and measured concentrations in the case of metoprolol illustrate that estimated concentrations cannot substitute for monitoring programs.

AB Pharmaceuticals such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics have been detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents, surface and ground waters and even in drinking waters all over the world. These compounds of concern may induce toxic effects in aquatic organisms and disturb the ecological balance on their way from wastewater to drinking water treatment via surface water and bank filtration. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective in removing such pollutants. This paper evaluates the treatment of wastewater containing three NSAIDs (acetaminophen. ketoprofen and naproxen) and three antibiotics (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) in two MBRs with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 15 (MBR-15) and 30 (MBR-30) days over a period of 4 weeks. It was observed for both MBRs that the NSAIDs were removed with higher efficiency than the antibiotics, and the MBR-30 presented higher removal efficiencies than the MBR-15 for all compounds studied. Biological transformation products of acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen produced by wastewater biocoenosis were identified in permeates from both MBRs. Further research in this field is required to assess the environmental risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products in the environment.

AB Japanese strategies for the management of livestock waste suggest effluent discharge from livestock farms as major pathways of entry of veterinary antibiotics into surface waters. To aid control of their sources, we devel-oped a model for predicting annual loads of antibiotics discharged into surface waters as effluent from livestock farms, sewage treatment plants, and households, using population, usage, excretion, removal, and fraction of live -stock waste treated as wastewater. To verify the model, we monitored three antibiotics which are much used for livestock in Japan and are stable during river transport & mdash;i.e., sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and lincomycin (LCM)& mdash;over one year in the Oyodo River, which has the most active swine farming area in Japan in its catchment. Concentrations and mass flows of SMM and SMX showed a sharp peak in winter, and those of LCM were also higher in winter than in summer in the river. Annual mass flows observed in the river and reported in three other Japanese rivers were within a range of Ife to 2 times the model estimates. Effluent from swine farms contributed largely to mass flows of SMM and LCM in the rivers, while human wastewater from sewage treatment plants and households contributed partly to substantially to those of SMX. Estimated contributions of surface runoff from agricultural land to the annual mass flows in the rivers were < 1%, in agree-ment with the prediction made by limiting sources to effluent. Although other locations and antibiotics should be studied in the future, this first attempt at modeling the load of veterinary antibiotics discharged from livestock farms provides a new perspective on how to reduce movement of these compounds into surface waters in catch -ments where wastewater treatment is or could be used in managing livestock waste.

AB The authors conducted a survey of small streams to evaluate the effects of centralized and onsite wastewater treatment on the occurrence of selected traditional and emerging contaminants in small streams in the upper Neuse River basin, North Carolina. An undeveloped site was included to assess effects of residential land use activities on stream quality. Concentrations of nutrients and ions were higher in samples from streams in residential sites than from the stream in an undeveloped area. Overall, streams draining residential areas showed relatively small differences with respect to type of wastewater treatment. Two sites, however one in an area of centralized wastewater treatment apparently near a suspected sewer line leak, and the second in an area of onsite wastewater treatment showed effects of wastewater. Organic wastewater compounds were detected more frequently in samples from these two sites than from the other sites. Optical brighteners levels were correlated (r(2) = .88) with the number of organic wastewater and pharmaceutical compounds detected at the residential sites and could potentially serve as a screening method to assess wastewater effects on small streams.

AB Water treated in advanced wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could be reused as potable water to address water shortages. Furthermore, sludge from WWTPs can be used to recover nutrients, energy and chemicals. Thus, the role of WWTPs could change from traditional pollution control facilities to sources of freshwater and other valuable resources. However, the economic viability of advanced wastewater and sludge treatment methods aimed at production of potable water and recovery of other resources is currently unknown. To address this gap and inform their future development, this paper considers life cycle costs of the following four wastewater treatment methods: granular activated carbon, nano filtration, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation. For recovery of resources from sludge, the following options are examined: agricultural application of anaerobically-digested and composted sludge, incineration, pyrolysis and wet air oxidation. Ozonation has the lowest life cycle costs, averaging 112 per 1000 m(3) of water treated, followed by nanofiltration at 134. Solar photo-Fenton is the most expensive option with 238/1000 m(3). These costs are significantly lower than water desalination and could be competitive in the future with conventional potable water production. For resource recovery from sludge, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and wet air oxidation can operate at a profit with the negative overall life cycle costs (-65 pound, -291 pound and -26 pound/1000 kg dry matter, respectively) if all their recovered products are fully utilised. The next best option is composting with the total life cycle costs of 35 pound/1000 kg dry matter. Incineration is the least preferred alternative with the cost of nearly 54 pound/1000 kg dry matter. Advanced wastewater and sludge treatment would increase the costs of conventional wastewater treatment by 1.5-2.1 times. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment contributes significantly to protect human health and ecological safety. With sustainable development of wastewater treatment, recovery of resources and energy from wastewater has been the focus for conventional contaminants, while reduction and control of ecological toxicity is the focus for emerging compounds. Under anaerobic conditions, especially with the enhancement of direct interspecies electron transfer, methanogenesis and/or nitrous oxide production could be achieved separately or simultaneously, and the removal efficiency of some types of emerging compounds could be improved. During nitritation, both nitrogen and emerging compounds removal could be achieved simultaneously. Therefore, a new wastewater treatment concept based on recovery of energy and control of emerging compounds was proposed, including the anaerobic treatment process by incorporating directly electron transfer enhancement and nitritation-based nitrogen removal. The proposed strategy provided a new technology concept for advancing the sustainable development of wastewater treatment through recovery of energy and control of emerging compounds.

AB It is well established that a global sanitation crisis threatens humans. By comparison, much less attention has been given to address the effects of this crisis on the health of ecosystems. We provide examples of how sewage can affect natural ecosystems and where hotspots in sewage contamination commonly overlap with these habitats. We highlight these issues for some of the major ecosystems spanning across terrestrial, aquatic, and coastal realms. Recent studies reveal that untreated and poorly treated sewage elevates concentrations of nutrients, pathogens, endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals in natural ecosystems. We show many large areas (10,000's of km(2)) across the globe with high levels of sewage contamination and that these contamination hotspots overlap extensively in occurrence with coral reefs, salt marshes, and fish-rich river systems. Given the global extent of sewage pollution in and near natural habitats, conservation biologists and managers must address this threat. However, because of its size, conservationists cannot solve this problem alone. We therefore argue that conservation must combine forces with the human health sector to create cross-disciplinary synergisms in innovation and efficiency. New sewage management solutions are emerging, such as waste-free toilets and resource recovery to generate fuel and drinking water; but more innovation is needed - a demand that will most effectively be reached through cross-sector collaboration.

AB The release of pharmaceutically active compounds to the soils through the application of sewage sludge and the irrigation with wastewater, or even with surface water, is constant. The adsorption of these compounds onto the soil is one of the key factors affecting their fate in the environment and their potential environmental risks. In this work, the adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its metabolites, 3-hydroxy-carbamazepine (3OH-CBZ), carbamazepine-10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxide (EP-CBZ), and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (10OH-CBZ), in three Mediterranean soils was evaluated using single-solute and four-solute experiments. The highest adsorptions were measured for 3OH-CBZ, followed by CBZ, EP-CBZ, and 10OH-CBZ, in that order. A high influence of the physicochemical characteristics of the compounds, pH, and soil characteristics in the adsorption of the studied compounds was observed and corroborated by the statistical analysis of the results. Moreover, a good fit was observed in the three isotherm models evaluated (linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir) in single-solute experiments (R-2 > 0.90). However, a decrease of the measured adsorptions and a worse fit to the isotherm models were observed in the case of multiple-solute experiments. This could be mainly due to the competition established between the studied compounds for the active sites of the soils.

AB Antimicrobial compounds, such as biocides and antibiotics, are widely used in society with significant quantities of these chemicals ending up in sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, mass flows and removal efficiency in different treatment steps at three Swedish STPs were evaluated for eleven different biocides and antibiotics. Mass flows were calculated at eight different locations (incoming wastewater, water after the first sedimentation step, treated effluent, primary sludge, surplus sludge, digested sludge, dewatered digested sludge and reject water). Samples were collected for a total of nine days over three weeks. The STPs were able to remove 53-> 99% of the antimicrobial compounds and 0-64% were biodegraded on average in the three STPs. Quaternary ammonium compounds were removed from the wastewater N99%, partly through biodegradation, but 38-96% remained in the digested sludge. Chlorhexidine was not biodegraded but was efficiently removed from the wastewater to the sludge. The biological treatment step was the most important step for the degradation of the studied compounds, but also removed several compounds through the surplus sludge.

AB The current investigation of marine water from 30 sites adjacent to stormwater outlets across the entire Sydney estuary is the first such research in Australia. The number of analytes detected were: 8/59 pharmaceutical compounds (codeine, paracetamol, tramadol, venlafaxine, propranolol, fluoxetine, iopromide and carbamazepine), 7/38 of the pesticides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 3,4-dichloroaniline, carbaryl, diuron, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), mecoprop and simazine) and 0/3 of the personal care products (PCPs) analysed. An artificial sweetener (acesulfame) was detected, however none of the nine antibiotics analysed were identified. Sewage water is not discharged to this estuary, except infrequently as overflow during high-precipitation events. The presence of acesulfame (a recognised marker of domestic wastewater) and pharmaceuticals in water from all parts of the estuary after a dry period, suggests sewage water is leaking into the stormwater system in this catchment. The pesticides are applied to the environment and were discharged via stormwater to the estuary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the occurrence and fate of ritalinic acid - the main human metabolite of the psychostimulant drug methylphenidate - in the aquatic environment, a HPLC-electrospray-MS/MS method for the quantification of ritalinic acid in wastewater. surface water and bank filtrate was developed Carbamazepine known as very stable in the aquatic environment was analyzed as anthropogenic marker in parallel Furthermore, the removal of ritalinic acid was studied in a sewage treatment plant using an activated sludge system during a field study and in lab-scale plants In good agreement between lab-scale and field studies a low removal rate of 13% and 23%, respectively, was determined As a consequence, the concentration of ritalinic acid in the wastewater effluents were in the range of <50-170 ng L-1 which corresponds to a mean specific load per capita of 177 mu g d(-1).
   Ritalinic acid has further been detected in German rivers at concentrations of 4-23 ng L-1 and in bank filtrate samples in 100-850 m distance from the river up to 5 ng L-1 demonstrating the widespread occurrence of this stable metabolite in the aquatic environment A comparison to available sales data shows that a significant amount of methylphenidate applied can be found in waters as ritalinic acid (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB A basic environmental risk assessment was carried out for the top 10 dispensed pharmaceuticals in Melbourne, Australia, in contrast to the more commonly assessed measure of the most used drugs by physical mass. This allowed for the evaluation of compounds that had not previously been the subject of risk assessment. Estimations of the possible fate and behaviour of the target pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants were also made. The predicted removal rates of most drugs within standard sewage treatment were expected to be low, with the exception of the statins, which had high removal rates. Each pharmaceutical was predicted to be present in Melbourne wastewater at the nanogram per litre range or lower. All compounds were predicted to be of low toxicity risk, although it was not possible to model mixture effects. Atorvastatin and Irbesartan were also found to possess the potential to possibly bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain but not to the extent that would require regulation or labelling.

ID SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANTS; DRUGS
AB Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-Blockers) are frequently prescribed medications in the United States and have been identified in European municipal wastewater effluent, however no studies to date have investigated these compounds in United States wastewater effluent. Municipal wastewater effluent was collected from treatment facilities in Mississippi, Texas, and New York to investigate the occurrence of metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol. Propranolol was identified in all wastewater samples analyzed (n = 34) at concentrations less than or equal to 1.9 mug/l. Metoprolol and nadolol were identified in greater than or equal to 71% of the samples with concentrations of metoprolol less than or equal to 1.2 mug/l and nadolol less than or equal to 0.36 mug/l. Time course studies at both Mississippi plants and the Texas plant indicate that concentrations of propranolol, metoprolol, and nadolol remain relatively constant at each sampling period. This study indicates that beta-Blockers are present in United States wastewater effluent in the ng/l to mug/l range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater transport along sewers favors the colonization of inner pipe surfaces by wastewater-derived microorganisms that grow forming biofilms. These biofilms are composed of rich and diverse microbial communities that are continuously exposed to antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) from urban wastewater. Sewer biofilms thus appear as an optimal habitat for the dispersal and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, the concentration of antibiotics, integron (intI1) and antibiotic resistance genes (qnrS, sul1, sul2, bla(TEM), bla(KPC), ermB, tetM and tetW), and potential bacterial pathogens were analyzed in wastewater and biofilm samples collected at the inlet and outlet sections of a pressurized sewer pipe. The most abundant ARGs detected in both wastewater and biofilm samples were sul1 and sul2 with roughly 1 resistance gene for each 10 copies of 16s RNA gene. Significant differences in the relative abundance of gene intI1 and genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and betalactams (bla(TEM)) were only measured between inlet and outlet biofilm samples. Composition of bacterial communities also showed spatial differences in biofilms and a higher prevalence of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with high sequence identity (>98%) to well-known human pathogens was observed in biofilms collected at the inlet pipe section. Our study highlights the role of sewer biofilms as source and sink of ARB and ARGs and supports the idea that community composition rather than antibiotic concentration is the main factor driving the diversity of the sewage resistome.

AB The enantioselective degradation of ibuprofen and naproxen enantiomers was evaluated in five different wastewater treatment systems, including three constructed wetlands (vertical- and horizontal-flow configurations), a sand filter and an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. In addition, injection experiments were carried out with racemic ibuprofen at microcosm- and pilot-scale constructed wetlands. Ibuprofen and naproxen have an asymmetric carbon atom and, consequently, two enantiomeric forms (i.e. S and R). The enantiomeric fraction (EF = S/(S + R)) in the raw sewage and effluents of various wastewater treatments were found to be compound-dependent (i.e. ibuprofen: EFinfluent = 0.73-0.90, EFeffluent = 0.60-0.76; naproxen: EFinfluent = 0.88-0-90, EFeffluent = 0.71-0.86). Of the two chiral pharmaceuticals, naproxen was the only one whose effluent EF correlated with its removal efficiency (p < 0.05). The lack of correlation found for ibuprofen was attributable to the fact that its enantioselective degradation kinetics were different under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Injection experiments of ibuprofen in constructed wetlands at microcosm and pilot-scale followed similar trends. Hence, under prevailing aerobic conditions, S-ibuprofen degraded faster than R-ibuprofen, whereas under prevailing anaerobic conditions, the degradation was not enantioselective. In summary, the naproxen EF measurements in wastewater effluents show that naproxen is a suitable alternative for evaluating the removal efficiency of treatment systems because its enantioselective degradation is similar under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB Sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents are significant sources of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters, where high concentrations of the antiepileptic drug Carbamazepine have been detected. The solids retention time (SRT) is the most important parameter for the design of STPs. It relates to the growth rate of microorganisms and to effluent concentrations. The influence of SRT on the removal of Carbamazepine was studied on lab-scale plants. The results from these tests were then validated on several full-scale plants. Due to the lack of suitable receiving waters and groundwater resources, one of these STPs has to infiltrate the treated wastewater into unsaturated soil. Here, groundwater samples at equal distances from the infiltration point were taken to estimate the behaviour of Carbamazepine during soil passage and within the groundwater. This antiepileptic drug seems to be very persistent in the environment, therefore qualifying as a suitable marker for anthropogenic influences in the aquatic environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results indicate that methamphetamine is one of the most commonly used illegal drugs in all the regions of Slovakia monitored in this study. Compared with the international results, the Slovak cities of Dunajska Streda (479 mg/day/1000inh) and Trnava (354 mg/day/1000inh) are among the cities with the largest numbers of methamphetamine users in Europe. These results indicate an increase in the incidence of drugs in big cities and in the satellite cities (Trnava and Dunajska Streda) near Bratislava. These results also confirm the police statistics about production and use of illicit drugs in Slovakia. The highest specific loads of cocaine were found in Bratislava (112 mg/day/1000inh), followed by PetrA3/4alka (74 mg/day/1000inh). Compared with other European cities, Bratislava and the other Slovak cities in this study have a relatively low number of COC consumers. The ecstasy load in wastewater from larger cities also significantly increased over the weekend and during music festivals. The highest 2-year mean concentrations of THC-COOH, a cannabis biomarker, were observed in the sewage from BA-PetrA3/4alka and BA-Central (191 and 171 ng/L, respectively). A first complex monitoring of pharmaceuticals in all therapeutic groups was also realized in selected Slovak WWTPs. Occurrence of wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals with very high concentrations as well as consumptions were observed mainly in small Slovak cities. Considering all 120 monitored pharmaceuticals, Valsartan had the highest concentrations: 6000 ng/L, on average.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is widely used as an antibacterial disinfectant in personal care products, especially in rapidly-urbanizing countries, such as China. Almost all TCS enters wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), but the fate of the TCS in the WWTPs is unclear. TCS may be present in sewage sludge or in effluent, and the discharge of TCS into an ecosystem can pose environmental risks. In the present study, influent, effluent, and sewage sludge were collected from four typical urban WWTPs, and the fate of TCS in the plants was investigated. The study was conducted in Zhengzhou, a city in the middle reaches of the Yellow River in China. The sewage sludge was used for aerobic composting to study the influences of different ventilation treatments on the biodegradation effects of TCS and the changes in the microbial community during the composting process. The results showed that the mean concentration of TCS in the influent of the four typical WWTPs was 397.1 ng/L. The mean level of TCS in the effluent was 8.0 ng/L. The mean concentration of TCS in the sewage sludge was 814.4 ng/g. For the four WWTPs, the percentages of TCS removal were 97.6% (Nansanhuan), 97.6% (Xinzheng), 98.8% (Wulongkou), and 97.9% (Chenyu), respectively. The sewage sludge enrichment rates for TCS ranged between 36.4% and 49%. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the environmental risks from sewage sludge. During aerobic composting, the TCS was effectively degraded under three ventilation strategies. Thus, improved ventilation could enhance the degradation rate of TCS. Moreover, TCS degradation occurred in the mesophilic period and in the early stage of the thermophilic phase period. Finally, the degradation rates of TCS in sewage sludge samples composted with low-, medium-, and high-ventilation treatments were 48.1%, 59.0%, and 59.5%, respectively. Thus, high ventilation could provide enough oxygen for the pile and enhanced microorganism activity, benefiting the degradation of TCS. In addition, the microbial communities change during the composting process, and a diversity index of the changes can help explain the composting process.

AB Purpose Some of the pharmaceuticals that are not extensively investigated in the aquatic environment are the anesthetic lidocaine (LDC), the analgesic tramadol (TRA), and the antidepressant venlafaxine (VEN). LDC metabolizes to 2,6-xylidine (2,6-DMA) and monoethylglycinexylidine (MEGX), TRA to O-desmethyltramadol (ODT), and VEN to O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV). Within this study, the distribution and behavior of these compounds in German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated.
   Methods Samples of influents and effluents from WWTPs in Hesse, Germany were collected between January and September 2010. Analytes were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and from solid samples by sonication. Extracts were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   Results LDC, TRA, VEN, ODT, and ODV were detected in all analyzed influent and effluent samples. 2,6-DMA could not be identified. MEGX was not detected. TRA and ODV were present in untreated wastewater at the highest concentrations (max, 1,129 (TRA) and 3,302 ng L-1 (ODV)), while the concentrations of LDC and VEN were all significantly lower (mean, 135 (LDC) and 116 ng L-1 (VEN)). All of the analytes were only partially removed in the WWTPs. The mean ratios between the concentrations of the metabolites and their respective parent compounds in influents were 4.7 (ODV/VEN) and 0.7 (ODT/TRA). These values remain approximately constant comparing influents and effluents.
   Conclusions LDC, TRA, VEN, ODT, and ODV are only partially removed from sewage water by WWTPs and thus are continuously discharged in respective recipient rivers. A further transformation of TRA and VEN into the known metabolites during treatment in the WWTPs is not observed.

AB In the present work, the effectiveness of conventional wastewater treatments (activated sludge and oxidation ditches) and low-cost wastewater treatments (trickling filter beds, anaerobic lagooning and constructed wetlands) in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds has been studied. To evaluate the efficiency of removal, 16 pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups (anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, beta-blockers, nervous stimulants, estrogens and lipid regulators) have been monitored during 1-year period in influent and effluent wastewater from 11 wastewater treatment plants of Spain. Mean removal rates of pharmaceutically active compounds achieved in conventional wastewater treatments were slightly higher than those achieved in low-cost treatments, being 64% and 55%, respectively. Ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid and caffeine were the pharmaceutical compounds most efficiently removed, regardless the wastewater treatment applied, with removal rates up to 99%. Anaerobic lagooning was the less effective treatment for the removal of the most persistent compounds: carbamazepine and propranolol.

AB Exposure to micropollutants can pose a serious risk to both the environment and human health. Although sewage treatment works (STWs) aim to reduce levels of pollutants in municipal wastewater discharges, they have become a significant point source of dangerous substances to the aquatic environment. With increasing regulation on pollution prevention, it has become essential to assess STW source inputs in order to control pollutant discharge into the environment. This paper has therefore focussed on developing calculations to estimate micropollutant levels in STW influents. The analysis was carried out using information from published literature, the Water Industry, and monitored influent data. Results demonstrated that, where monitoring data were available for metals and organic pollutants, STW influent could be adequately estimated and validated, with accuracy between 77% and 100%. In addition, based on these calculations and using data for over 600 STWs in England, our analysis showed that compounds such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, lead and linear alkylbenzenesulfonate could reach influent levels that could be challenging for conventional wastewater treatment removal.

AB Jakarta is an Indonesian coastal megacity with over 10 million inhabitants. The rivers flowing through the city receive enormous amounts of untreated wastewaters and discharge their pollutant loads into Jakarta Bay. We utilized a screening approach to identify those site-specific compounds that represent the major contamination of the cities' water resources, and detected a total number of 71 organic contaminants in Jakarta river water samples. Especially contaminants originating from municipal wastewater discharges were detected in high concentrations, including flame retardants, personal care products and pharmaceutical drugs. A flame retardant, a synthetic fragrance and caffeine were used as marker compounds to trace the riverine transport of municipal wastewaters into Jakarta Bay. These markers are also appropriate to trace municipal wastewater discharges to other tropical coastal ecosystems. This application is in particular useful to evaluate wastewater inputs from land-based sources to habitats which are sensitive to changing water quality, like coral reefs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater can provide a wealth of epidemiologic data on common drugs consumed and on health and nutritional problems based on the biomarkers excreted into community sewage systems. One of the biggest uncertainties of these studies is the estimation of the number of inhabitants served by the treatment plants. Twelve human urine biomarkers 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), acesulfame, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, cotinine, creatinine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), naproxen, salicylic acid (SA) and hydroxycotinine (OH COT) were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to estimate population size. The results reveal that populations calculated from cotinine, 5-HIAA and caffeine are commonly in agreement with those calculated by the hydrochemical parameters. Creatinine is too unstable to be applicable. HCTZ, naproxen, codeine, OH COT and carbamazepine, under or overestimate the population compared to the hydrochemical population estimates but showed constant results through the weekdays. The consumption of cannabis, cocaine, heroin and bufotenine in Valencia was estimated for a week using different population calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sensitive and highly selective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for triclosan, one of the most common bactericides in personal care products, which is also considered as an emerging contaminant, given its presence in the effluents of sewage and wastewater treatment plants. From synthesized haptens, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against triclosan were raised. The best ELISA immunoassay was based on an antibody-coated format, yielding a detection limit of 0.03 mu g L-1, an l(50) of 3.85 mu g L-1, and a dynamic range from 0.22 to 42.16 mu g L-1, with little or no cross-reactivity (< 10%) to similarly structured compounds, including its metabolite methyltriclosan (CR < 6%). The assay was applied as a screening method to quantify triclosan in surface water and in wastewaters. After C18 solid-phase extraction, nanogram per liter concentrations were determined in effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants. The satisfactory recoveries achieved as well as the agreement between immunochemical and chromatographic methods (GC-MS) indicate its potential for either screening or laboratory quantification.

AB The beneficial use of sewage sludge for valorization of carbon and nutrients is of increasing interest while micropollutants in sludge are of concern to the environment and human health. This study investigates the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sewage sludge in a continuous flow pilot scale reactor at conditions expected to reflect future industrial installations. The processing is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency, bio-crude yields and quality. The raw sludge and post-HTL process water and solid residues were analyzed extensively for micropollutants via HPLC-MS/MS for target pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, blood pressure medicine, antidepressants, analgesics, x-ray contrast media, angiotensin II receptor blockers, immunosuppressant drugs and biocides including triazines, triazoles, carbamates, a carboxamide, an organophosphate and a cationic surfactant. The results show that a positive energy return on investment was achieved for all three HTL processing temperatures of 300, 325 and 350 degrees C with the most beneficial temperature identified as 325 degrees C. The analysis of the HTL by-products, process water and solids, indicates that HTL is indeed a suitable technology for the destruction of micropollutants. However, due to the large matrix effect of the HTL process water it can only be stated with certainty that 9 out of 30 pharmaceuticals and 5 out of 7 biocides products were destroyed successfully (over 98% removal). One compound, the antidepressant citalopram, was shown to be moderately recalcitrant at 300 degrees C with 87% removal and was only destroyed at temperatures >= 325 degrees C (>99% removal). Overall, the results suggest that HTL is a suitable technology for energy efficient and value added sewage sludge treatment enabling destruction of micropollutants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics have been detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents, surface and ground water and even in drinking water all over the world, and therefore have developed as compounds of concern. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment has gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective for an advanced removal of these pollutants. This paper evaluates the treatment of wastewater containing three NSAIDs (acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen) and three antibiotics (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) performed in two MBRs with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 15 (MBR-15) and 30 (MBR-30) days over a period of four weeks. It was observed that NSAIDs were removed with higher efficiencies than the antibiotics for both MBRs, and the MBR-30 presented higher removal efficiencies for all the compounds than obtained by MBR-15. Removal rates ranged from 55% (sulfamethoxazole) up to 100% (acetaminophen, ketoprofen). Besides mineralisation biological transformation products of ketoprofen and naproxen produced by wastewater biocoenosis were identified in both MBR permeates using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results indicated the importance of investigating the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products reaching the environment.

AB The consumption of drugs of abuse has been recently investigated in Martinique using the back-calculation approach, also called the "sewage epidemiology" method. Results demonstrated a very high consumption considering the international data. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are located just behind the Martinique island shoreline, and effluents could impact the vulnerable corals and marine seagrass ecosystem. The present article aims to determine a WWTP's efficiency by comparing the influent and effluent of two WWTPs, with different residence times and biological treatments, located either outdoors or indoors. In parallel, a degradation study is conducted using spiked wastewater exposed to tropical and ambient temperatures. Results demonstrate the consistent efficiency of the two processes, especially for the outdoor WWTP which uses the activated sludge process. The positive effect of the tropical temperature is showed by the increase of cocaine degradation at 31 degrees C. Thus, low illicit drug residue concentrations in effluent would indicate that wastewater treatment is efficient and even enhanced under tropical context. This fact should be confirmed with others molecules. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for subsequent studies of sludge contamination because of their local recycling as compost.

AB Currently, many articles report on pharmaceutical residues detected in various compartments of the environment. A major pathway into the aquatic environment is municipal wastewater. This article discusses the relevance of yellowwater (urine) as pharmaceutical source within this wastewater stream. Literature data about concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical residues detected in raw wastewater are compared to their theoretically calculated concentrations in urine. The study shows that these pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are excreted predominantly via urine although some substances show reasonable excretion via faeces. It is demonstrated that the influence of pharmacokinetic activities is one important issue affecting the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, only a weak correlation between concentrations of pharmaceuticals calculated in yellowwater and analysed in raw wastewater was observed. This is due to environmental effects taking place between the excretion of urine and the entrance of sewerage into the wastewater treatment plant. The data show that urine separation and separate handling/treatment of this wastewater stream represents a promising approach to protect the aquatic environment safely from human pharmaceuticals.

AB The use of anaerobic biomass attached to a support has been recently presented as a good prospect in the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds, such as sulfamethazine (SMZ). SMZ has been found in swine wastewater and sewage treatment plants, which motivates assessing their degradation by new wastewater treatment technologies. Thus, this paper describes the use of a continuous fixed structured bed bioreactor for the purpose of evaluating SMZ removal kinetics present in lab-made wastewater. The analysis of SMZ used online solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (SPE online-LC-MS/MS). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also monitored to evaluate the organic matter removal. The bioreactor was operated under mesophilic conditions (30C), with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h. In order to evaluate SMZ removal, four different concentration levels were studied: 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng L-1. COD removal efficiency obtained for filtered effluent kept at 91.01% and there was no interference due to the increase of SMZ concentration. For SMZ, the removal efficiencies were of for 200 ng L-1 concentration level; for 400 ng L-1; for 600 ng L-1, and for 800 ng L-1. COD removal kinetics presented a first-order apparent removal rate constant () of h(-1). SMZ also showed a first-order apparent removal rate constant of h(-1) for the following concentrations levels: 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng L-1.

AB The occurrence and fate of five drugs of abuse in raw influent and treated effluent wastewater were investigated over a period of 1 year in the Adelaide region of South Australia. Four wastewater treatment plants were chosen for this study and monitored for five drugs which included cocaine in the form of its metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE), methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and two opioids (codeine and morphine) during the period April 2016 to February 2017. Alongside concentrations in raw sewage, the levels of drugs in the treated effluent were assessed and removal efficiencies were calculated. Drug concentrations were measured by mixed-mode solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Drug concentrations detected in the raw wastewater ranged from 7 to 6510 ng/L and < LOD to 4264 ng/L in treated effluent samples. Drug removal rates varied seasonally and spatially. The mass loads of drugs discharged into the environment were in descending order: codeine > methamphetamine > morphine > MDMA > BE. Results showed that all the targeted drugs were on average incompletely removed by wastewater treatment, with removal performance highest for morphine (94%) and lowest for MDMA (58%). A screening-level environmental risk assessment was subsequently performed for the drugs based on effluent wastewater concentrations. Based on calculated risk quotients, overall environmental risk for these compounds appears low, with codeine and methamphetamine likely to pose the greatest potential risk to receiving environments. Given the recognised limitations of current ecotoxicological models and risk assessment methods for these and other pharmaceutical drugs, the potential for environmental impacts associated with the continuous discharge of these compounds in wastewater effluents should not be overlooked.

AB The fate of 14 antidepressants along with their respective N-desmethyl metabolites and the anticonvulsive drug carbamazepine (CBZ) was studied in 5 different sewage treatment plants (STPs) across Canada. Using two validated LC-MS/MS analytical methods, the concentrations of the different compounds were determined in raw influent, final effluent and treated biosolids samples. Out of the 15 compounds investigated, 13 were positively detected in most 24-h composite raw influent samples. Analysis showed that venlafaxine (VEN), its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (DVEN), citalopram (CIT), and CBZ were detected at the highest concentrations in raw influent (up to 4.3 mu g L-1 for DVEN). Cumulated results showed strong evidence that primary treatment and trickling filter/solids contact has limited capacity to remove antidepressants from sewage, while activated sludge, biological aerated filter, and biological nutrient removal processes yielded moderate results (mean removal rates: 30%). The more recalcitrant compounds to be eliminated from secondary STPs were VEN, DVEN and CBZ with mean removal rates close to 12%. Parent compounds were removed to a greater degree than their metabolites. The highest mean concentrations in treated biosolids samples were found for CIT (1033 ng g(-1)), amitriptyline (768 ng g(-1)), and VEN (833 ng g(-1)). Experimental sorption coefficients (K-d) were also determined. The lowest K-d values were obtained with VEN, DVEN, and CBZ (67 -490 L kg(-1)). Sorption of these compounds on solids was assumed negligible (log K-d <= 2). However, important sorption on solids was observed for sertraline, desmethylsertraline, paroxetine and fluoxetine (log K-d > 4). Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and organic tracers (OTs) were conducted in the community wastewater of Chennai city and the suburbs, South India, during partial and post lockdown phases (August-September 2020) as a response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Wastewater samples were collected from four sewage treatment plants (STPs), five sewage pumping stations (SPSs) and at different time intervals from a suburban hospital wastewater (HWW). Four different methods of wastewater concentrations viz., composite (COM), supernatant (SUP), sediment (SED), and syringe filtration (SYR) were subjected to quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Unlike HWW, STP inlet, sludge and SPS samples were found with higher loading of SARS-CoV-2 by SED followed by SUP method. Given the higher levels of dissolved and suspended solids in STPs and SPSs over HWW, we suspect that this enveloped virus might exhibit the tendency of higher partitioning in solid phase. Cycle threshold (C-t) values were < 30 in 50% of the HWW samples indicating higher viral load from the COVID-19 infected patients. In the STP outlets, a strict decline of biochemical oxygen demand, >95% removal of caffeine, and absence of viral copies reflect the efficiency of the treatment plants in Chennai city. Among the detected OTs, a combination of maximum dynamic range and high concurrence percentage was observed for caffeine and N1 gene of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we suggest that caffeine can be used as an indicator for the removal of SARS-CoV-2 by STPs. Our predicted estimated number of cases are in line with the available clinical data from the catchments. Densely distributed population of the Koyambedu catchment could be partly responsible for the high proportion of estimated infected individuals during the study period. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study focused on 11-nor-9carboxy-Delta 9-THC (THC-COOH) and Benzoylecgonine (BE), the most common metabolites of cannabis and cocaine, respectively, present in the domestic sewage entering the wastewater treatment plants. The aims of the study were: (1) to validate the analytical method of detection in wastewater and sludge; (2) to determine contribution of biodegradation and other processes to the removal in the biological reactor of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the response of biomass to different drug concentrations. The Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry method showed to be repeatable and reliable (recovery>75%; repeatability<10-15%; bias uncertainty<10) for measurements in wastewater; the ultrasound assisted extraction (USE) demonstrated to be reliable as pre-treatment of activated sludge solid phase. Both drugs were fully removed from the liquid phase in the lab-scale biological reactor within 24 h. Biodegradation was the main BE removal mechanism, and the first order kinetic model provided the best fitting of the experimental data. THC-COOH was mainly removed due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation; adsorption was better described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm. Both drugs at the higher concentrations caused inhibition of nitrogen oxidation and carbon removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) based on ozone treatments, assisted by ultrasounds, have been investigated at a pilot-plant scale in order to evaluate the removal of emerging contaminants in sewage water. Around 60 emerging contaminants, mainly pharmaceuticals from different therapeutically classes and drugs of abuse, have been determined in urban wastewater samples (treated and untreated) by LC-MS/MS. In a first step, the removal efficiency of these contaminants in conventional sewage water treatment plants was evaluated. Our results indicate that most of the compounds were totally or partially removed during the treatment process of influent wastewater. Up to 30 contaminants were quantified in the influent and effluent samples analysed, being antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and angiotensin II receptor antagonists the most frequently detected. Regarding drugs of abuse, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were the most frequent. In a second step, the effectiveness of AOP in the removal of emerging contaminants remaining in the effluent was evaluated. Ozone treatments have been proven to be highly efficient in the removal, notably decreasing the concentrations for most of the emerging contaminants present in the water samples. The use of ultrasounds, alone or assisting ozone treatments, has been shown less effective, being practically unnecessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper, inspired by Sven Erik Jorgensen's academic life, takes a systems ecology perspective on sustainability in wastewater sludge management. First, an overview identifies the indicators and methods currently used to assess sustainability and sustainable development in the area of wastewater sludge. Second, two systems ecology conceptual models are presented. Third, the indicators and methods are discussed in the perspective of these systems ecology models. Four methods were found common in assessing wastewater sludge sustainability: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Exergy Analysis (ExA), Emergy Analysis (EmA), and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was added since it was found to be used in the larger wastewater treatment context, and complements the other four methods. When comparing the indicators and methods with the systems ecology models it was found that no method covered every aspect of the models. ExA, EmA and ERA covered the full extent of the models but not from every aspect interesting from a sustainability point of view. LCA and CBA had a lower reach at the ecosystem side of the models, but produced deeper knowledge regarding environmental impacts for LCA, and economic flows and storages for CBA. The investigation concludes that a complementary approach of methods and indicators is needed to assess sustainability, and they are suggested to be used in an integrated way, in the spirit of Sven Erik Jorgensen's findings.

AB The reuse of treated municipal sewage ('biosolids') on land is an effective method to divert waste away from landfill and to use an alternative, low cost method of fertilisation. While legislation has mainly focused on the control of nutrient and metal application rates to land, other potentially harmful emerging contaminants (ECs) may be present in biosolids. Up to 80% of municipal sewage sludge is reused in agriculture in Ireland, which is currently the highest rate of reuse in Europe. However, unlike other countries, no study has been conducted on the presence of ECs across a range of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in this country. This study evaluated the concentrations of two ECs in sewage sludge, the antimicrobials triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC), and their presence in surface runoff following land application in controlled rainfall simulation studies. In 16 WWTPs, concentrations of TCS and TCC were 0.61 and 0.08 mu g g(-1), which is at the lower end of concentrations measured in other countries. The concentrations in runoff post land application were also mainly below the limits of detection (90 ng L-1 for TCS, 6 ng L-1 for TCC), indicating that runoff is not a significant pathway of entry into the environment.

AB In order to solve the problems of poor biodegradability and high concentrations of non-biodegradable substances from pharmaceutical wastewater after preliminary treatment, the organic components of the tail water (effluent from the preliminary treatment devises of the pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment station) were analyzed and the method of ozonation-hydrolysis acidification was used to treat tail water from the pharmaceutical factory. The ozone dosage, the reaction time and the changes of biodegradability were studied. The results measured by GC-MS showed that there were 51 types of organic substances in tail water which reduce the biodegradability. The results of the tests showed that 30 mg/L of ozone and 60-minutes of oxidation time were suitable conditions. In the ozonation-hydrolysis acidification process the COD removal rate ranged from 20% to 50%. The test results showed that the ozonation-hydrolysis acidification method could effectively improve the biodegradability of wastewater and provide the foundation for the follow treatment in urban sewage treatment plant using biological methods.

AB During the 2009 influenza type A(H1N1) pandemic, the antiviral drug oseltamivir (OP, Tamiflu (R)) was extensively used for treatment and prophylaxis after recommendation from World Health Organisation (WHO). Previous studies have indicated that the pharmaceutically active metabolite of OP, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is not readily degraded in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and therefore will be released into receiving waters in elevated concentrations during a pandemic outbreak of influenza. A method for analyzing OP and OC in wastewater by UPLC-TOF has been developed and validated. This analytical method has been used to study the release of OP and OC from a sewage treatment plant outside Oslo, Norway during the 2009 pandemic. Daily flow-proportional influent and effluent samples from 11 weeks covering the main wave of the influenza pandemic were analyzed, and the observed trend in OP and OC concentrations closely followed the trend in percentage of medical consultations caused by influenza-like illness. Concentrations in wastewater influent were in the range of 5-529 ng/L and 28-1213 ng/L for OP and OC, respectively. Concentration data from the 54 influent/effluent sample sets suggest STP removal in the range of -0.8% to 8% for OP and -14% to 0.6% for OC. Statistical analysis of the data sets was inconclusive in determining a removal rate different from 0. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is the point source of antibiotic contamination, yet the removal of antibiotics from WWTP effluent has not been given necessary attention. In this study, subsurface constructed wetlands (SCWs) were used to investigate the removal, distribution, and biotransformation of sulfonamides (SAs) and their N-4-acetyl sulfonamides (Ac-SAs) from wastewater effluent. The results showed that SCWs was demonstrated as capable for removing SAs with their Ac-SAs efficiently from WWTP effluent. The removal of SAs was significantly impacted by the occurrence of biotransformation behavior of SAs, not only SAs degraded into Ac-SAs, but also some Ac-SAs converted into SAs. Microbial aerobic degradation is the major removal pathway of SAs and Ac-SAs in the SCWs. SCW configuration such as vertical flow is conductive to the oxygen transport inside system and therefore promote the aerobic process of contaminants. Plants also play an important role on affecting the temporal and spatial variation of SAs through rhizosphere effect, i.e. accumulating SAs in the vegetation biomass by plant uptake and transpiration, concentrating SAs in the root zone by rhizosphere sorption and interception, and enhancing microbial influence on their aerobic decomposition by root oxygen release. The knowledge obtained in this study will be helpful for advanced purification of WWTP discharge and bioremediation of antibiotic contamination.

AB Oxidation kinetics of selected pharmaceutical compounds and their degradation during ozonation of secondary treated municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) was investigated. The apparent second-order rate constants for the reaction between chlorotetracycline (CTC), enrofloxacin (ENR), gemfibrozil (GEM) and ozone ranged between 6.82 - 52.7 x 10(4) M(-1)s(-1). The measured second-order hydroxyl radical rate constants were several orders of magnitude higher at 8.4 x 10(9) - 13.1 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) with a reactivity sequence of GEM > CTC > ENR. Overall degradation of CTC, ENR and GEM in secondary treated municipal wastewater effluent was >76 % at ozone doses of 0.33 mg O-3/mg DOC or higher.

AB Water scarcity is one of the main problems faced by many countries. In order to increase water supply in some regions, reuse of wastewater is proposed. With the purpose of obtaining safe water, more treatment has to be used. Among other pollutants, pharmaceutically active compounds and their metabolites are frequently detected in water subjected to conventional treatments. To remove them, advanced treatments should be used. Some of them are still at lab scale while others are used already at real scale. Here we review the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants with conventional treatment and also in advanced treatments applied at lab and real scale to treat wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been widely detected in the aquatic environment and demonstrated to be potential risks to humans and the environment. Understanding emission pathways of pharmaceuticals is essential to the control of pharmaceutical contamination for environmental management. The present study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that non-wastewater pathway is also significant to the emission of pharmaceuticals into the environment. To this end, we compared the actual production with the amount of 12 antibiotics obtained by back calculation from sewage concentrations in Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing. The results showed that for over a half of investigated antibiotics, the emission through non-wastewater pathways accounted for approximately 30-80% of the total emission, varying with individual antibiotics. It was revealed that non-wastewater emission pathways could be of significance for pharmaceuticals emitted into the environment, of which disposed by household waste could be among the most important non-wastewater pathways.

AB Bed sediment samples from 79 coastal New York and New Jersey, USA sites were analyzed for 75 compounds including wastewater associated contaminants, PAHs, and other organic compounds to assess the post-Hurricane Sandy distribution of organic contaminants among six regions. These results provide the first assessment of wastewater compounds, hormones, and PAHs in bed sediment for this region. Concentrations of most wastewater contaminants and PAHs were highest in the most developed region (Upper Harbor/Newark Bay, UHNB) and reflected the wastewater inputs to this area. Although the lack of pre-Hurricane Sandy data for most of these compounds make it impossible to assess the effect of the storm on wastewater contaminant concentrations, PAH concentrations in the UHNB region reflect pre-Hurricane Sandy conditions in this region. Lower hormone concentrations than predicted by the total organic carbon relation occurred in UHNB samples, suggesting that hormones are being degraded in the UHNB region. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cytostatic drugs are pharmaceutically active compounds used in chemotherapy to prevent or disrupt cell division. Only a few environmental studies have been focused on cytostatic drugs, in spite of their toxicity, their increasing consumption, and their discharge into municipal sewage. This fact can be mainly due to the lack of methods for their simultaneous analysis. This research describes the occurrence of 14 cytostatic drugs in influent and effluent wastewater from four wastewater treatment plants located in Seville (Spain) during 1-year period. A preliminary environmental risk assessment was also carried out. Five cytostatic drugs (cytarabine, etoposide, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, and methotrexate) were detected in influent wastewater at concentration levels up to 464 ng L-1 (cytarabine). Six of them (cytarabine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine) were detected in effluent wastewater at concentration levels up to 190 ng L-1 (cytarabine). Most of the detected cytostatic drugs are not significantly removed during wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, neither ecotoxicological nor genotoxical risks are expected to occur at the measured concentrations on the aquatic environment.

ID ADVANCED OXIDATION; PHARMACEUTICALS
AB The pharmaceuticals present in the municipal sewage reach the municipal sewage treatment plants, but most often fail to be completely removed in there. Therefore, in the case where they constitute a substantial part of the sewage stream (hospitals, clinics, pharmacological production plants) their chemical pretreatment seems justifiable. A method based on the modification of Fenton's reaction has been suggested. It consisted in replacing peroxide hydrogen with compressed air and enhancing the reaction by UV rays and copper cations CU+2 as catalysts. All the process parameters have been determined experimentally. The possibility of implementing the method in industry has been taken into consideration, therefore the values of the parameters such as pH and aeration intensity were established on a lower level despite the fact that their higher values were more effective.

AB Limited drinking water resources and water pollution are one of the main worldwide problems. To reduce the consumption of fresh water resources, the use of treated wastewater has been proposed. The farmlands have been irrigated with wastewater for centuries, but the composition of used sewage has changed over the years. Recent research has revealed the presence of hundreds of new organic contaminants in many environmental waters, including wastewaters and their receivers. For this reason, wastewater profiling and monitoring are of high importance and urgent need. In this study, the HPLC-Q-TOF-MS has been used for the profiling of wastewater composition and evaluation of the water pollution markers belonging to emerging contaminants. Three different solid-phase extraction approaches were applied to obtain the best results. Compounds such as acesulfame-K, caffeine, carbamazepine, cyclamate, ibuprofen, methyl paraben, paracetamol, or saccharin were detected in raw wastewater samples, whereas only acesulfame-K, carbamazepine, and sucralose were found in effluent samples. It seems that these particular compounds might be chosen as water pollution marker specific to Polish communal sewages.

AB Pharmaceuticals and other anthropogenic trace contaminants reach wastewaters and are often not satisfactorily eliminated in sewage treatment plants. These contaminants and/or their degradation products may reach surface waters, thus influencing aquatic life. In this study, the behavior of five different antihypertonic pharmaceuticals from the sartan group (candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan and valsartan) is investigated in lab-scale sewage plants. The elimination of the substances with related structures varied broadly from 17% for olmesartan up to 96% for valsartan. Monitoring data for these drugs in wastewater effluents of six different sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Bavaria, and at eight rivers, showed median concentrations for, e.g. valsartan of 1.1 and 0.13 mu g L-1, respectively. Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) were calculated and are mostly consistent with the measured environmental concentrations (MEC). The selected sartans and the mixture of the five sartans showed no ecotoxic effects on aquatic organisms in relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment should be reduced to minimize the risk of their distribution in surface waters, ground waters and bank filtrates used for drinking water.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of chemicals whose fate in the environment has received increasing attention in the past few years. A quantitative method was developed for the determination of acidic pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and diclofenac), caffeine and the antibacterial triclosan in wastewater effluent. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples on Waters Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction columns, derivatized with N,O-bis [Trimethylsilyl] trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Estimated method detection limits ranged from 6 to 45 ng/L based on replicate analyses (n = 10). This method was applied to the analysis of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant and compounds were detected at concentrations of 18-72 ng/L.

AB Many scientific studies reveal the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments. Pharmaceutical industry and sewage are the main sources of these compounds in the receiving environments. In this study, we investigate the fate of a simultaneous release of three drugs (antifungal, antibiotic, and antihistamine) in municipal wastewaters. To achieve this objective, a set of physical and chemical analysis is carried out. The obtained results show that releasing individual and concurrent drugs have a direct impact on the quantity and the quality of different constituent materials of waste water.

AB The fates of several macrolide, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim antibiotics contained in the raw sewage of the Tel-Aviv wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated after the sewage was treated using either a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) system coupled with a subsequent ultrafiltration (UF) step or a pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) system. Antibiotics removal in the MBR system, once it achieved stable operation, was 15-42% higher than that of the CAS system. This advantage was reduced to a maximum of 20% when a UF was added to the CAS. It was hypothesized that the contribution of membrane separation (in both systems) to antibiotics removal was due either to sorption to biomass (rather than improvement in biodegradation) or to enmeshment in the membrane biofilm (since UF membrane pores are significantly larger than the contaminant molecules). Batch experiments with MBR biomass showed a markedly high potential for sorption of the tested antibiotics onto the biomass. Moreover, methanol extraction of MBR biomass released significant amounts of sorbed antibiotics. This finding implies that more attention must be devoted to the management of excess sludge.

AB This work deals with the environmental distribution of nonionic surfactants (nonylphenol and alcohol ethoxylates), their metabolites (NP, nonylphenol; NPEC, nonylphenol ethoxycarboxylates; and PEG, polyethylene glycols) and a selection of 64 pharmaceuticals in the Long Island Sound (LIS) Estuary which receives important sewage discharges from New York City (NYC). Most target compounds were efficiently removed (>95%) in one wastewater treatment plant monitored, with the exception of NPEC and some specific drugs (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide). Concentrations of surfactants (1.4-4.5 mu g L-1) and pharmaceuticals (0.1-0.3 mu g L-1) in seawater were influenced by tides and sampling depth, consistent with salinity differences. Surfactants levels in suspended solids samples were higher than 1 mu g g(-1), whereas only most hydrophobic or positively charged pharmaceuticals could be found (e.g., tamoxifen, clarithromycin). Maximum levels of target compounds in LIS sediments (PEG at highest concentrations, 2.8 mu g g(-1)) were measured nearest NYC, sharply decreasing with distance from major sewage inputs.

AB The distribution of pharmaceutically active compounds in the environment has been reported in several works in which wastewater treatment plants have been identified as the main source of these compounds to the environment. The concentrations of these compounds in influent wastewater can vary widely not only during the day but also along the year, because of the seasonal-consumption patterns of some pharmaceuticals. However, only few studies have attempted to assess the hourly variability of the concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds in wastewater. In this work, the distribution and seasonal and hourly variability of twenty-one pharmaceuticals, belonging to seven therapeutic groups, have been investigated in urban and industrial wastewater. The highest concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds, except salicylic acid, were found in urban wastewater, especially in the case of anti-inflammatory drugs and caffeine. The highest concentrations of salicylic acid were measured in industrial wastewater, reaching concentration levels up to 3295 mu g L-1. The studied pharmaceutically active compounds showed different distribution patterns during winter and summer periods. Temporal variability of pharmaceutically active compounds during a 24-h period showed a distribution in concordance with their consumption and excretion patterns, in the case of urban wastewater, and with the schedule of industrial activities, in the case of industrial wastewater.

AB Hospital effluents are loaded with pathogenic microorganisms, partially metabolized pharmaceutical substances, radioactive elements, and other toxic substances. Such effluents if not treated properly can damage the natural environment and create a biological imbalance.
   This paper points out the areas of concern for hospital wastewater disposal and reports the findings of a limited physico-chemical study of treatment options for hospital effluents conducted at Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The effluent collected was checked for conventional parameters and subjected to coagulation experiments. The raw and settled effluents were coagulated with FeCl3, filtered and disinfected. Physico-chemical treatment seems to be an attractive option for the cost-effective disposal of hospital effluents. The results of this study call for further detailed study in this area.

AB Pharmaceutical residues, and other organic micropollutants that pass naturally through the human body into sewage, are in many cases unaffected by treatment processes at conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Accumulated in the environment, however, they can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems. The present study provides an evaluation of a treatment system for the removal of pharmaceutical residues and other micropollutants. The system is based on a Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), including ultrafiltration (UF), followed by a biofilter using granulated active carbon (GAC) as filter material. It was found that all investigated micropollutants, such as pharmaceutical residues, phenolic compounds, bacteria and microplastic particles, present in wastewater, could be removed by the treatment system to below detection limits or very low concentrations. This shows that the combination of filtration, adsorption and biodegradation provides a broad and efficient removal of micropollutants and effects. The tested treatment configuration appears to be one of the most sustainable solutions that meets today's and future municipal sewage treatment requirements. The treatment system delivers higher resource utilization and security than other advanced treatment systems including solely GAC-filters without biology.

DE chemicals of emerging concern; Great Lakes; wastewater
ID TREATMENT PLANTS
AB The Great Lakes and their connecting channels form the largest fresh surface water system on earth. Over the past 10 years, focus on environmental monitoring has shifted to an array of recently discovered compounds known as 'chemicals of emerging concern' (CEC). These chemicals are found in products used daily in households, businesses, agriculture and industry, such as flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides. Wastewater treatment plants are among the important pathways by which CEC enter the Great Lakes, with concentrations highest in the vicinity of wastewater discharges. Treated sewage is often discharged into the nearshore waters, which also provide a source of drinking water to the public. In 2009-2011, the International Joint Commission addressed the need to assess the effectiveness of existing wastewater treatment technologies in the basin to remove CEC, as well as to gain insight on potential advanced technologies to improve their removal. This assessment encompassed three major activities, development of an inventory of municipal wastewater treatment plants that discharge in the basin; a survey of detailed operational data for selected wastewater facilities; and a comprehensive literature review and analysis of the effectiveness of various wastewater treatment technologies to remove chemicals of emerging concern.

AB Increasing residential development in watershed recharge areas increases the likelihood of groundwater and surface water contamination by wastewater effluent, particularly where on-site sewage treatment is employed. This effluent contains a range of compounds including those that have been demonstrated to mimic or interfere with the function of natural hormones in aquatic organisms and humans. To explore whether groundwater contaminated by discharge from on-site septic systems affects water quality in surface water ecosystems, we measured steroidal hormones, pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) in water collected from six aquifer-fed ponds in areas of higher and lower residential density on Cape Cod ( Massachusetts, USA). We detected both a greater number and higher concentrations of OWCs in samples collected from ponds located in higher residential density areas. Most often detected were the steroidal hormones androstenedione, estrone, and progesterone and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, pentoxifylline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Of particular concern, estrogenic hormones were present at concentrations approaching those that induce physiological responses in fish. While a number of papers have reported on surface water contamination by OWCs from wastewater treatment plants, our results show that surface water ecosystems in unconfined aquifer settings are susceptible to contamination by estrogenic and other biologically active OWCs through recharge from aquifers contaminated by residential septic systems.

AB A simple method using direct sample injection combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of six alkaloid compounds in environmental samples. The target list includes two psychostimulants (nicotine and caffeine), three metabolites (cotinine, nicotinic acid and paraxanthine) and a coffee chemical (trigonelline). The analytical method was evaluated in three different matrices (surface water, influent and effluent wastewater). The method developed showed an adequate sensitivity, below 0.6 mu g L-1 for wastewater and 0.1 mu g L-1 for river matrices, without any prior treatment of the samples. Finally, the methodology was applied to real samples for evaluation of their removal from a sewage treatment plant and their persistence/fate in the aquatic environment. All compounds studied in this work were detected at all sampling points collected along the Henares River. However, nicotinic acid was only detected three times in treated sewage samples at levels above its detection limit. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been widely used as a complementary method for estimating consumption of illicit drugs in the population. Temporal drug consumption estimates derived from WBE can provide important information for law enforcement and public health authorities in understanding changes in supply and demand of illicit drugs, but currently lacking in China. In this study, influent wastewater samples from a municipal sewage treatment plant in Guangzhou, China were collected for 8weeks to investigate the temporal change in consumption of six illicit drugs in the catchment. The results indicated that methamphetamine and ketamine were the dominant illicit drugs in Guangzhou with the per capita use of 14.7-470.7mg/day/1000 people and 64.9-673.7mg/day/1000 people, respectively. No distinct weekly patterns were observed for illicit drug consumption in Guangzhou, indicating that drug users are likely to be regular ones. Further assessment about the impact of public holidays on the consumption behavior of drugs showed little impact for ketamine (p=0.689), but higher consumptions of methamphetamine (p=0.003) and cocaine (p=0.027) were observed during public holidays than the control period. The considerable decrease in drug consumption observed in October 2017 compared with January and May 2017 was possibly the consequence of law enforcement action.

AB To remove organic contaminants from wastewater using cost-efficient and currently existing methods, our study investigated char-fortified filter beds for on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) in a long-term field setting. OSSFs are commonly used in rural and semi-urban areas worldwide to treat wastewater when municipal wastewater treatment is not economically feasible. First, we screened for organic contaminants with gas chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based targeted and untargeted analysis and then we developed quantitative structure-property relationship models to search for key molecular features responsible for the removal of organic contaminants. We identified 74 compounds (24 confirmed by reference standards) including plasticizers, UV stabilizers, fragrances, pesticides, surfactant and polymer impurities, pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, and many biogenic compounds. Sand filters that are used as a secondary step after the septic tank in OSSFs could remove hydrophobic contaminants. The addition of biochar significantly increased the removal of these and a few hydrophilic compounds (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, alpha = 0.05). Besides hydrophobicity-driven sorption, biodegradation was suggested to be the most important removal pathway in this long-term field application. However, further improvements are necessary to remove very hydrophilic contaminants as they were not removed with sand and biochar-fortified sand.

AB A feasible method has been optimized to simultaneously determine multiclass antibiotic residues, including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol in urban riverine water and wastewater by off-line solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array ultraviolet detector and a fluorescence detector. Internal standard and standard addition methods were used in combination to identify and quantify these antibiotics to compensate for the matrix interference. The method quantification limits (MQLs) were determined to be 0.035 to 0.100 mu g/L and 0.100 to 0.300 mu g/L for the riverine water and wastewater, respectively. Recoveries of the investigated antibiotics ranged from 63 to 126%. Sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently detected antibiotic residue in Guangzhou section of the Major Pearl River, South China, with a maximum level of 0.510 mu g/L. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were relatively less detected with a maximum level of 0.459 mu g/L. The maximum concentration of sulfamethoxazole reached 5.597 mu g/L in the raw wastewater from a large-scale sewage treatment plant in Guangzhou city. Around 30% of sulfamethoxazole might survive the primary clarification and biotreatment processes in the sewage treatment plant. None of the investigated antibiotics have been found above MQLs in the final effluent after chlorine disinfection.

AB A quantitative approach for calculation of the percentage of water of domestic wastewater origin in contaminated water wells is presented. The article is an extension of a reported approach to quantify leakage from a wastewater recharge facility to nearby water wells pumping predominantly from a pristine aquifer. The relative contamination from a specific source, a wastewater recharge basin, and the contamination from unspecified domestic wastewater sources under near steady state conditions are calculated for several water wells in the vicinity of a wastewater recharge system. Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug whose refractory behaviour was reported before is evaluated as a tracer. It is demonstrated that CBZ fulfils the requirements of source-specific as well as non-specific wastewater tracer, under Israeli conditions. In addition to being biodegradation-resistant, a survey of the effluents of domestic wastewater treatment plants in Israel revealed that the CBZ level is roughly constant, 1407 +/- 204 ng/L in a wide range of water treatment facilities all over Israel. As such, at least for specific sites (e.g. Israel) CBZ can be used as a quantitative tracer for estimation of the fraction of effluent-originated water in water wells, and the uncertainty involved in such estimates can be calculated.

AB Irrigation of crops with treated wastewater has the potential to introduce effluent-derived organic microcontaminants into surface waters through agricultural runoff. To determine whether compounds indicative of the presence of treated effluent in irrigation water could be identified in agricultural runoff, surface runoff samples collected from effluent-irrigated and rain-fed cultivated fields were analyzed for a broad spectrum of organic compounds. A variety of compounds was identified that appeared to be associated with irrigation with treated wastewater. These compounds included human pharmaceuticals (e.g., carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, carisoprodol), personal care product ingredients (e.g., insect repellent, polycyclic musks), and alkyl phosphate flame retardant chemicals. Most of these compounds appear not to have been previously reported in agricultural runoff. These compounds were present at concentrations below the few published aquatic toxicology data available; however, their potential to elicit more subtle effects in aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. None of these compounds were detected by broad-spectrum analysis in samples from the same fields during runoff-producing rain events.

AB Water quality and safety of tailwater is crucial to achieve sustainability of water resources. However, the traditional monitoring method based on chemical and physical indicators cannot reflect the actual biological effects. The objective of this study was to provide effective biological indicators in water quality monitoring and the safe discharge of sewage. The influent, secondary effluent, and tailwater were sampled from three sewage treatment plants with different advanced-treatment processes (wetland, ozone + ultraviolet, and filter + ultraviolet), and the removal efficiencies of the tail water on acute toxicity and genotoxicity were assessed by Vicia faba micronucleus test, acute comprehensive evaluation (TU), and genotoxicity test. The results showed that physical and chemical indicators could meet the national standards of pollutant discharge in urban sewage treatment plants, and the biological toxicity of the tail water after each treatment process significantly reduced. According to TU method, the biological acute toxicity of the treated effluent had obvious decrease by 25.49%, 30.43%, and 30.85% in the deep treatment process of wetland, ozone + ultraviolet, and filter + ultraviolet respectively, and Selenastrum capricornutum was not suitable for the comprehensive acute toxicity evaluation. The treated effluents by ozone + ultraviolet had the highest degree of genetic toxicity reduction (35.9%) compared to undercurrent wetland (33.63%), and filter + ultraviolet (11.19%). Correlation analysis demonstrated that TP concentration was significantly negative correlation with the toxicity of Selenastrum capricornutum and the growth inhibition of Selenastrum capricornutum, which can act as indicator species represented by TP concentrations.

AB Hospital wastewater contains several micro and macro pollutants that cannot be removed efficiently by conventional treatment processes. Thus, generally hybrid and multistage treatment methods are suggested for the treatment of hospital wastewater. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a promising method for the removal of emerging organic pollutants from hospital wastewater in one step and a very short reaction time. In this study, supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) process was used for the removal of pharmaceuticals in addition to conventional pollutants from real hospital wastewater. As a result of a series of preliminary studies, the optimum conditions were selected as 450 degrees C, 60 s, and 1:1 for temperature, reaction time, and oxidant ratio (H2O2/COD), respectively, for the treatment of hospital wastewater at 25 +/- 1 MPa. The removal rates were determined above 90% for COD, BOD, TOC, TN, and SS from hospital wastewater. Phosphorus removal was greater than 90%, while the removal rates were around 80% for phenol, AOX, and surfactants in hospital wastewater. A total of 9 pharmaceuticals were observed in the real hospital wastewater samples. The highest removal rate was obtained for Paracetamol as 99.9%, while the lowest removal rate was obtained for Warfarin as 72% after SCWO treatment of hospital wastewater. As a result, it can be concluded that SCWO process is sufficient for the treatment of hospital wastewater without the need of additional treatment steps, with high removal rates in a short reaction time.

AB A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the determination of selected pharmaceutical residues ( carbamazepine, salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and triclosan) in sewage influent and roughly primary-treated effluent. The method involved solid-phase extraction (SPE) with polymeric sorbents, and two SPE cartridges were compared for the extraction and elution of the targeted compounds in complex matrices. A successful chemical derivatization of carbamazepine and acidic compounds using N,O-bis( trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide +10% trimethylchlorosilane is also described. The quantification limits of the analytical procedure ranged from 30 to 60 ngL(-1) for 500 mL of wastewater. The best recovery rates (72-102%) in spiked effluent samples were obtained with Phenomenex Strata-X(TM) cartridges. Detection limits (S/N=3) were estimated at between 1 and 18 ng L-1. The reported GC-MS/MS method significantly reduces the strong matrix effects encountered with more expensive LC-MS/MS techniques. Application of the developed method showed that most selected analytes were detected at concentrations ranging from low mu g L-1 to trace level ng L-1 in Montreal's wastewater treatment plant effluent and influent, as well as in the receiving waters at more than 8 km downstream of the effluent outfall. The rugged alternative analytical method is suitable for the simultaneous analysis of carbamazepine and pharmaceutical acidic residues in wastewater samples from influents and effluents that have undergone rough primary treatment.

AB Sewage sludge/biosolids are by-wastes of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. As sources of nutrients (C, N, P) they are widely used in intensive farming where large supplementation of organic matter to maintain fertility and enhance crop yields is needed. However, according to the report of European Commission published in 2010, only 39% of produced sewage sludge is recycled into agriculture in the European Union. This situation occurs mainly due to the fact, that the sewage sludge may contain a dangerous volume of different contaminants. For over decades, a great deal of attention has been focused on total concentration of few heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The Sewage Sludge Directive (86/278/EEC) regulates the allowable limits of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg and pathogens and allows for recovery of sludge on land under defined sanitary and environmentally sound conditions. In this paper, a review on quality of sewage sludge based on the publications after 2010 has been presented. Nowadays there are several papers focusing on new serious threats to human health and ecosystem occurring in sewage sludge-both chemicals (such as toxic trace elements-Se, Ag, Ti; nanoparticles; polyaromatic hydrocarbons; polychlorinated biphenyl; per fluorinated surfactants, polycyclic musks, siloxanes, pesticides, phenols, sweeteners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, benzotriazoles) and biological traits (Legionella, Yersinia, Escherichia coli 0157:H7).

AB Sorptive removal of six phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-butylphenol (4tBP) by functionalized biochar (fBC) through competitive interactions was investigated. EDC sorption was pH dependent with the maximum sorption at pH 3.0-3.5 due to hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions as the principal sorptive mechanism. Sorption isotherm of the EDCs was fitted to the Langmuir model. Sorption capacities and distribution coefficient values followed the order E1 > E2 >= EE2 > BPA > 4tBP > E3. The findings suggested that EDC sorption occurred mainly through pseudo-second order and external mass transfer diffusion processes, by forming H-bonds along with pi-pi electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions at different pH. The complete removal of similar to 500 mu g L-1 of each EDC from different water decreased in the order: deionised water > membrane bioreactor (MBR) sewage effluent > synthetic wastewater. The presence of sodium lauryl sulphonate and acacia gum in synthetic wastewater significantly suppressed sorption affinity of EDCs by 38-50%, hence requiring more fBC to maintain removal efficacy.

AB Despite an increasing number of studies on pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), data on their concentrations in the environment are still scant. This is due to many factors, including great variability in usage and physicochemical properties of these compounds, which contribute to their widespread presence and complex behaviour, particularly in the aquatic environment. The main pathway for their discharge into the waterways is through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are inefficient in removing many of PPCP compounds. Therefore, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the role that WWTPs play in the presence of PPCPs in the environment, this paper proposes a new method for estimating the expected concentrations of these compounds in WWTP influents, effluents and sludge, as well as their expected discharge and related concentrations in freshwaters. The proposed method can assist with future eco-toxicological and environmental risk assessments as well as the development of policies and regulation related to PPCP compounds. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Wastewater samples were collected from 16 wastewater treatment plants across Southwest Nova Scotia including the Annapolis Valley, South Shore, and Metropolitan Halifax. Samples were also collected between 100 and 200 m downstream of effluent outflows. Seven pharmaceuticals were found above mu g/L levels with their highest concentrations as follows: metformin (10.6 mu g/L), acetaminophen (28.9 mu g/L), paraxanthine (18.2 mu g/L), cotinine (3.10 mu g/L), caffeine (115 mu g/L), naproxen (29.1 mu g/L), and venlafaxine (2.65 mu g/L). Metformin, paraxanthine, caffeine, naproxen, ramipril, and venlafaxine were detected in every wastewater effluent sample. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in pharmaceutical occurrence by treatment methods, weak dependence of pharmaceutical concentrations on populations, and the co-occurrence of some pharmaceuticals. Experimental results might indicate the limitation of primary only treatment methods in breaking down pharmaceuticals.

AB The influence of antibiotics, namely doxycycline, gentamicin, penicillin, nitrofurantoin, and rifampicin, on wastewater treatment was assessed. The presence of 100-300 mu g/L of antibiotics (63.52-134.41 mg/g.d.w.d) marginally influenced organic matter degradation, without impacting nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations. However, a significant increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was observed, which varied with different antibiotics. The largest number of bacteria became resistant to nitrofurantoin and penicillin. After the process, some multi-resistant strains were isolated from the sludge. Two of them revealed the activity of carbapenamase, the enzyme directly related to resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB The antimicrobial agent triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol; TCS) is a member of a larger group of polychlorinated binuclear aromatic compounds frequently associated with adverse environmental and human health effects. Whereas the structure and function of TCS would suggest significant resistance to biotransformation, biological wastewater treatment currently is considered the principal destructive mechanism limiting dispersal of and environmental contamination with this compound. We explored the persistence of TCS in a typical full-scale activated sludge US sewage treatment plant using a mass balance approach in conjunction with isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ID-LC-ESI-MS) for accurate quantification. Average influent and effluent concentrations (mean +/- SD) of 4.7 +/- 1.6 and 0.07 +/- 0.06 mu g l(-1), respectively, revealed an apparent (liquid-phase) removal efficiency of 98 +/- 1%. However, further analyses demonstrated that the particle-active TCS (80 +/- 22% particle-associated in influent) was sequestered into wastewater residuals and accumulated in dewatered, digested sludge to concentrations of 30000 +/- 11000 mu g kg(-1). Overall, 50 +/- 19% (1640 +/- 610 g d(-1)) of the disinfectant mass entering the plant (3240 +/- 1860 g d(-1)) remained detectable in sludge, and less than half of the total mass (48 +/- 19%) was biotransformed or lost to other mechanisms. Thus, conventional sewage treatment was demonstrated to be much less effective in destroying the antimicrobial than the aqueous-phase removal efficiency of the plant would make believe. Furthermore, study findings indicate that the common practice of sludge recycling in agriculture results in the transfer of substantial quantities of TCS to US soils used, in part, for animal husbandry and crop production.

AB Accurate quantification of organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) is essential for assessing their removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and for calculating discharge rates into effluent-receiving surface waters. In this study, we undertook a theoretical evaluation of the effect of sorption and sample filtration on data quality. Filtration of samples, while commonly practiced, may preclude a potentially significant fraction of chemical mass from both chemical measurements and mass flow analyses for WWTPs. Sorption theory dictates that analyte losses from sample filtration are notable for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) featuring a pH-dependent logarithmically transformed organic carbon-water distribution coefficient (log D-OC) of >= 3.0. Among a total of 33 organic wastewater compounds considered, the extent of sorption to filterable materials ranged from 22% for bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) to 99% for di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). Sample filtration also was demonstrated to have a profound impact on the outcome of chemical fate and behavior studies. When the chemical mass residing on filterable particulates was considered, the concentration spread ( range) doubled between maximum and minimum concentrations reported for raw wastewater. Furthermore, removal efficiencies of WWTPs calculated for HOCs increased by as much as 62% just by changing the method of accounting. We conclude that some of the data spread reported in the literature concerning chemical mass loadings, contaminant concentrations in raw sewage, and removal efficiencies of similarly designed WWTPs is driven not by actual differences in sewage composition, geographic locations and treatment units but by sample processing protocols and the method of mass accounting.

AB Concern over exposure to endocrine disruptors (EDs) and impacts on wildlife and human has gradually increased in importance in recent years. Wastewater systematically receives most if not all of these chemicals, so a deeper understanding of the fate of EDs in environment is sorely needed. We evaluated EDs concentration in the affluent and effluent from the Sludge Wastewater Treatment Plants (SWTPs) Penha and Ilha do Governador. It was used as evaluation parameter the determination of some target compounds, such as: alkylphenols, 17 beta-estradiol, bisphenol A; complementing with measures of physical and chemical parameters: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, and total chemical oxygen demand. Samples were collected along the line of treatment of each SWTP, and after laboratory procedures, analyzed by LC-MS/MS and ELISA techniques. In some samples, we verified concentrations of chemical compounds with potential to disrupt the endocrine system of living organisms. Therefore, the release of this effluent, even within the effluent discharge standards (BRASIL, 2005) or in condition to be purified by the water course, may lead to physiological changes in the organisms of the receptor water body.

AB The anti-gout agent allopurinol is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in Germany and is widely metabolized into oxypurinol (80%) as well as the corresponding riboside conjugates (10%) within the human body. To investigate the occurrence of allopurinol and oxypurinol in the urban water cycle an analytical method was developed based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   In raw wastewater concentration levels of oxypurinol ranged up to 26.6 mu g L-1, whereas allopurinol was not detected at all. In wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, concentrations of allopurinol were <LOQ, whereas oxypurinol concentrations ranged from 2.3 mu g L-1 to 21.7 mu g L-1. Elevated concentrations of oxypurinol in biologically treated wastewater originate from the transformation of allopurinol as well as the cleavage of allopurinol-9-riboside, which was confirmed by laboratory experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal WWTP.
   Further tracking of oxypurinol in the urban water cycle revealed its presence in rivers and streams (up to 22.6 mu g L-1), groundwater (up to 0.38 mu g L-1) as well as in finished drinking water (up to 0.30 mu g L-1). Due to the high biological stability and the almost ubiquitous presence in the urban water cycle at elevated concentrations, oxypurinol might be used as marker for domestic wastewater in the environment. This was confirmed by correlation analysis to other wastewater markers with strong correlations of the concentrations of oxypurinol and carbamazepine (r(2) = 0.89) as well as of oxypurinol and primidone (r(2) = 0.82).

AB Recently, there have been growing concerns about pharmaceuticals including antibiotics as environmental contaminants. Antibiotics of concentrations commonly encountered in wastewater have been suggested to affect bacterial population dynamics and to promote dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Conventional wastewater treatment processes do not always adequately remove pharmaceuticals causing environmental dissemination of low levels of these compounds. Using constructed wetlands as an additional treatment step after sewage treatment plants have been proposed as a cheap alternative to increase reduction of wastewater contaminants, however this means that the natural microbial community of the wetlands becomes exposed to elevated levels of antibiotics. In this study, experimental surface-flow wetlands in Sweden were continuously exposed to antibiotics of concentrations commonly encountered in wastewater. The aim was to assess the antibiotic removal efficiency of constructed wetlands and to evaluate the impact of low levels of antibiotics on bacterial diversity, resistance development and expression in the wetland bacterial community. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and the effect on the bacterial diversity was assessed with 16S rRNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Real-time PCR was used to detect and quantify antibiotic resistance genes and integrons in the wetlands, during and after the exposure period. The results indicated that the antibiotic removal efficiency of constructed wetlands was comparable to conventional wastewater treatment schemes. Furthermore, short-term treatment of the constructed wetlands with environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 100-2000 ng x 1(-1)) of antibiotics did not significantly affect resistance gene concentrations, suggesting that surface-flow constructed wetlands are well-suited for wastewater treatment purposes.

Over 70% of the target compounds were detected in at least one sample of S-sludge and L-sludge. The total concentration of the target pharmaceutical compounds detected in S-sludge was 2.622-422.8 mg kg(-1) and the most dominant compound was acetylsalicylic acid (ASA: 0.374-367.0 mg kg(-1)) whereas in L-sludge, the total concentration was 43.87-156.8 mg kg(-1) and the most abundant compound was oxytetracycline (OTC: 34.54-86.39 mg.kg(-1)). Cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups: group A, which were S-sludge samples including ASA, carbamazepine (CBM), and others, and group B were L-sludge samples, dominated by antibiotics (CTC, OTC, LIN). The total daily load amount of the target pharmaceuticals in S-sludge was 0.010-268.9 kg day(-1) while the L-sludge was 0.021-0.529 kg day(-1). The estimated amounts of the target pharmaceutical discharged from S-sludge and L-sludge into the Korean environment were 150.2 +/- 47.94 ton yr(-1) and 15.05 +/- 5.671 ton yr(-1) respectively, but the discharged amount of antibiotics from S-sludge (6.945 ton yr(-1)) was lower than that from L-sludge (9.234 ton yr(-1)).

AB It is important to determine the behavior of constituents in treated sewage during soil aquifer treatment for water recycling. A collaborative project with Herman Bouwer published in 1984 documented the fate and occurrence of Priority Pollutants during groundwater recharge using wastewater with application to water reuse and agricultural systems. New compounds are continually being manufactured and released to the environment. The interest today has shifted to the behavior of emerging contaminants. One important class of emerging contaminants is pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The hazards to the environment and human health of trace levels of PPCPs in water supplies are poorly understood. A multi compound method using solid phase extraction and chemical derivatization with pentafluorobenzylbromide, followed by analysis via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to study the occurrence and removals of 18 PPCPs in a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Overall, 16 out of the 18 selected PPCPs, which span a range of therapeutic classes and some commonly used personal care products, were detected in raw sewage samples collected from the Baltimore Back River WWTP. Ten of the 18 selected PPCPs were detected in the treated sewage effluent, signifying incomplete removal for the majority of the PPCPs during the wastewater treatment processes. The majority of the target analytes were detected in both the influent and effluent WWTP samples at mu g/L levels, although some PPCPs (e.g., naproxen and ibuprofen) were encountered at mu g/L levels. Biodegradation is an important process for wastewater and soil aquifer treatment. Aerobic batch biodegradation (using activated sludge as microbial inocula) experiments were conducted to gain insight into the biodegradation behavior of our target PPCPs at initial concentrations of 50, 10, and 1 mu g/L Sterile control studies showed no loss of our target PPCPs during the entire incubation period, and sorption to the biomass was found to be negligible for all testing conditions. Biodegradation results were not sensitive to the initial concentration and showed that 13 of the 18 PPCPs tested exhibited biotransformations greater than 80% after 50 days of incubation. Phenytoin, 5-fluorouracil, and diclofenac were the only three compounds with removals less than 60%. The occurrence study revealed the presence of PPCPs in sewage effluents, and the biodegradation study suggests that biotransformation is a possible removal mechanism for PPCPs during groundwater recharge or soil aquifer treatment for water recycling.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of bacteria and detect the presence of quinolone resistance gene (qnrA) and integrons (intI1, intI2) in a habitat polluted by pharmaceutical sewage. The bacteria were isolated by nutrient agar and nutrient broth from waste water and sludge collected from the sewage outfall of a pharmaceutical factory. The bacteria were identified by Gram staining and biochemical tests, and the bacterial community diversity was analyzed by Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Pielou evenness index (J) and Simpson's diversity index (D). The occurrence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) were detected by Real-time PCR assays. The results showed that 90 strains were isolated from water samples and sludge samples including 22 genera and 26 species. Types of bacteria in water samples contained 18 genera and 20 species, while 13 genera and 14 species were detected in sludge samples. Fifty-five Enterobacteriaceae isolates (61.11 %, 55 of 90) were the predominant bacteria in water and sludge samples. Bacterial species richness and evenness in water samples were higher than in sludge samples. The resistance genes of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) with the total DNA and single isolate plasmid DNA were detected. There were a variety of bacterial species and the presence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) genes in pharmaceutical wastewater habitats, in which Enterobacteriaceae strains were the dominant bacteria. These results suggested that pharmaceutical wastewater had potential risks to public health.

AB The occurrence and fate of 50 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in the surface water of Jiulong River estuary in the southeast of China in spring, wet season, summer, autumn and winter. Results demonstrated a wide distribution of PPCPs in Jiulong River estuary, where 34 PPCPs were detected at least once and 5 PPCPs were detected in all the samples, including caffeine, diclofenac, metoprolol, methyl paraben, and propyl paraben. Spatial and seasonal variations were observed. Special emphasis was placed on the PPCP fate in the estuary. Most PPCPs showed a non conservative behavior in the estuary, while the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bisphenol A showed a pseudo-conservative behavior. The non-conservative and pseudo-conservative behavior was attributed to the combination of the seawater dilution, the introduction of PPCPs via the sewage water, and the physical, chemical, or biological removal processes. Furthermore, PPCP concentrations showed drastic variations in the turbidity maximum zones. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to indicate the pseudo-conservative behavior of PPCPs in the estuary, and to show the drastic variations of PPCPs in the turbidity maximum zone. In addition, the ratio of labile to conservative PPCPs was calculated to track the source of untreated sewage contamination. Results showed a significantly higher ratio compared to the average value in WWTP effluents, indicating the ubiquitous discharge of untreated domestic wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. In addition, the high ratio of bisphenol A to conservative PPCPs implied the potential input of untreated industrial wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data were collected at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Burlington, Vermont, USA, (serving 30,000 people) to assess the relative contribution of CSO (combined sewer overflow) bypass flows and treated wastewater effluent to the load of steroid hormones and other wastewater micropollutants (WMPs) from a WWTP to a lake. Flow-weighted composite samples were collected over a 13 month period at this WWTP from CSO bypass flows or plant influent flows (n = 28) and treated effluent discharges (n = 22). Although CSO discharges represent 10% of the total annual water discharge (CSO plus treated plant effluent discharges) from the WWTP, CSO discharges contribute 40-90% of the annual load for hormones and WMPs with high (>90%) wastewater treatment removal efficiency. By contrast, compounds with low removal efficiencies (<90%) have less than 10% of annual load contributed by CSO discharges. Concentrations of estrogens, androgens, and WMPs generally are 10 times higher in CSO discharges compared to treated wastewater discharges. Compound concentrations in samples of CSO discharges generally decrease with increasing flow because of wastewater dilution by rainfall runoff By contrast, concentrations of hormones and many WMPs in samples from treated discharges can increase with increasing flow due to decreasing removal efficiency.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are used for many beneficial purposes in the modern society, but they also contaminate surrounding environment during their exposure. They may enter the environment through numerous routes e.g. treated wastewater discharge, sewage from landfills, sewer lines, runoff from animal wastes and land application of manure fertilizers. The pharmaceutical wastewater consists of high concentration of organic matter, microbial toxicants, high salt concentration and non-biodegradable compounds. Due to limited water resources, it is essential to understand and develop the methodologies for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. Trace amounts of suspended solids and dissolved organic matter still persist even after secondary treatment, therefore, advanced treatment is prerequisite in order to improve the quality of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this chapter, the emphasis is mostly on best available technologies to remove and recycle the pharmaceutical wastewater. Effluents arising from different sectors of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), bulk drugs and related pharmaceutics, consuming a bulk amount of water are evaluated and the strategies are destined to recover valuable compounds upto a larger extent, and finally wastewater treatment is discussed. The complete removal of pharmaceutics from wastewater is not feasible with a single technology. The hybrid wastewater treatment appears to be the best comprising conventional treatment plans in conjunction with biological and advanced post-treatment methods. The recommendations provided in this analysis will be useful for the treatment of wastewater resulting from the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Effluents front three wastewater treatment plants with varying wastewater treatment technologies and design were analyzed for six antibiotics and caffeine on three sampling occasions. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and clindamycin were detected in the effluents at concentrations rari-im, from 0.090 to 6.0 mu g/L. Caffeine was detected in all effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.19 to 9.9 mu g/L. These findings indicate that several conventional wastewater management practices are not effective in the complete removal of antibiotics. and their discharges have a large potential to affect the aquatic environment. To evaluate the persistence of antibiotics coming from the wastewater discharges on the surrounding surface waters, samples were collected from the receiving streams at 10-, 20- and 100-m intervals. Ciprofloxacin. sulfamethoxazole. and clindamycin (0.043 to 0.076 mu g/L) were found as far as 100 in front the discharge point, which indicates the persistence of these drugs in surface waters.

AB Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides, but minimal information has been published on their presence in municipal wastewater in the United States. Pyrethroids in wastewater from the Sacramento, California, USA, area consisted of permethrin, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and cyhalothrin, with a combined concentration of 200ng/L to 500ng/L. Sampling within the wastewater collection system leading to the treatment plant suggested pyrethroids did not originate primarily from urban runoff, but could be from any of several drain disposal practices. Wastewater from residential areas was similar in pyrethroid composition and concentration to that from the larger metropolitan area as a whole. Secondary treatment removed approximately 90% of pyrethroids, but those remaining exceeded concentrations acutely toxic to sensitive species. Toxicity to the amphipod, Hyalella azteca, was consistently evident in the final effluent. The large river into which this particular plant discharged provided sufficient dilution such that pyrethroids were undetected in the river, and there was only slight toxicity of unknown cause in 1 river sample, but effects in receiving waters elsewhere will be site-specific.

AB A series of sodium bentonite and thiamine were used as raw materials to prepare a new adsorbent - thiamine-modified bentonite. The adsorbent was applied in the pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. The optimum preparation conditions of thiamine-modified bentonite were studied. The experiments showed that the removals of COD (chemical oxygen demand) reached 47.98 % under optimal condition. The FTIR results indicated that bentonite has been modified by thiamine. The X-ray diffraction result showed that the inter-planar distance of modified bentonite was increased by intercalating thiamine. From the analyses of the SEM photographs, it can be clearly observed that the bentonite, after thiamine insertion reaction, loses its foliated structure and exhibits a rougher surface. Among several isotherm equations, Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were investigated. They were widely used to describe equilibrium data for water and wastewater treatment applications. Adsorption isotherms correlate well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Detailed isothermal and kinetic studies show that the modified bentonite removes organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater by physical adsorption processes.

AB Aqueous chlorination kinetics of the lipid regulator gemfibrozil and the formation of reaction products were investigated in deionized water over the pH range 3 to 9, and in two wastewater matrices. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil was found to be highly dependent on pH. No statistically significant degradation of gemfibrozil was observed at pH values greater than 7. Gemfibrozil oxidation between pH 4 and 7 was best represented by first order kinetics. At pH 3, formation of three reaction products was observed. 4'-ClGem was the only reaction product formed from pH 4-7 and was modeled with zero order kinetics. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil in two wastewater matrices followed second order kinetics. 4'-ClGem was only formed in wastewater with pH below 7. Deionized water rate kinetic models were applied to two wastewater effluents with gemfibrozil concentrations reported in literature in order to calculate potential mass loading rates of 4'ClGem to the receiving water.

AB The present study determines removal rates (RR) of 56 pharmaceuticals and metabolites, respectively, in an urban sewage treatment plant using mass flow analysis by comparing influent and effluent loads over a consecutive ten-day monitoring period. Besides well investigated compounds like carbamazepine and metoprolol, less researched targets, such as topiramate, pregabalin, telmisartan, and human metabolites of pharmaceuticals were included. Another aim was to determine the ratio of pharmaceuticals and corresponding metabolites in raw wastewater.
   Valsartan and gabapentin were detected at the highest average concentrations in influent (c(val) = 29.7 (+/- 8.1) mu g/L, c(gab)= 13.2 (+/- 3.3) mu g/L) and effluent (c(val)= 22.1 (+/- 5.1) mu g/L, c(gab)= 12.1 (+/- 2.6) mu g/L) samples. The comparison of mass loads in influent and effluent showed a significant removal (p < 0.1) for 20 compounds but only enalapril, eprosartan, losartan, pregabalin, and quetiapine were removed from the aqueous phase by more than 50%. Another 20 compounds were determined without significant difference and for five compounds (clindamycin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, O-desmethyl venlafaxine, triamterene), a significant higher mass load in the effluent than in the influent was observed.
   It has to be noticed that metabolites like 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy carbamazepine (MHD) are found in higher mass loads than the corresponding parent compound in the sewage samples. Furthermore, metabolites and parent compound behave differently in the sewage treatment process. While MHD (RR= 15.1%) was detected with lower mass load in the effluent than in the influent, oxcarbazepine (RR=-73.2%) showed the contrary pattern. When comparing expected and measured ratios of parent compound and metabolite in raw sewage, citalopram/N-desmethyl citalopram for example, showed good results. However, a major problem exists due to insufficient data regarding metabolism and excretion of many pharmaceuticals. This complicates the prediction of relevant metabolites and further efforts are needed to overcome this problem. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Source-specific elucidation of domestic sewage pollution caused by various effluent sources in an urban river water, as conducted for this study, demands knowledge of the relation between concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular indicators (caffeine, carbamazepine, triclosan) and water quality concentrations of total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorous (T-P). River water and wastewater samples from the Asahikawa River Basin in northern Japan were analyzed using derivatization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Caffeine, used as an indicator of domestic sewage in the Asahikawa River Basin, was more ubiquitous than either carbamazepine or triclosan (92-100 %). Its concentration was higher than any target compound used to assess the basin: < 4.4-370 ng/L for caffeine, < 0.6-3.9 ng/L for carbamazepine, and < 1.1-13 ng/L for triclosan. Higher caffeine concentrations detected in wastewater effluents and the strongly positive mutual linear correlation between caffeine and T-N or T-P (R (2) > 0.759) reflect the contribution of septic tank system effluents to the lower Asahikawa River Basin. Results of relative molecular indicators in combination with different molecular indicators (caffeine/carbamazepine and triclosan/carbamazepine) and cluster analysis better reflect the contribution of sewage than results obtained using concentrations of respective molecular indicators and cluster analysis. Relative molecular indicators used with water quality parameters (e.g., caffeine/T-N ratio) in this study provide results more clearly, relatively, and quantitatively than results obtained using molecular indicators alone. Moreover, the caffeine/T-N ratio reflects variations of caffeine flux from effluent sources. These results suggest strongly relative molecular indicators are also useful indicators, reflecting differences in spatial contributions of domestic sources for PPCPs in urban areas.

AB The influents/effluents from Calgary's water resource recovery facilities and the surface water were analyzed for pharmaceuticals in the present study. The median concentrations in the effluents for the 15 targeted pharmaceuticals were within the range of 0.006 to 3.32 ppb. Although the wastewater treatment facilities were not designed to remove pharmaceuticals, this study indicates that the wastewater treatment processes are effective in removing some of the pharmaceuticals from the aqueous phase. The removal rate estimated can be 99.5% for caffeine, whereas little or no removal was observed for carbamazepine. Biodegradation, chemical degradation, and sorption could be some of the mechanisms responsible for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The drug residues in downstream surface water could be associated with incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals during the treatment process and may lead to concerns in terms of potential impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. However, this study does not indicate any immediate risks to the downstream aquatic environment.

AB Aims: To discuss the need to develop ethical guidelines for researchers using sewage epidemiology to monitor drug use in the general population and specific precincts, including prisons, schools and workplaces.
   Method: Describe current applications of sewage epidemiology, identify potential ethical risks associated with this science, and identify key means by which these risks may be mitigated through proportionate ethical guidance that allows this science to be fully developed.
   Results: A rapidly advancing field of research is sewage epidemiology (SE) - the analysis of wastewater samples to monitor illicit drug use and other substances. Typically this research involves low ethical risks because individual participants cannot be identified and, consequently, review has been waived by human research ethics committees. In the absence of such oversight, ethical research guidelines are recommended for SE teams, peer reviewers and journal editors; guidelines will assist them to mitigate any risks in general population studies and studies of prisons, schools and workplaces. Potential harms include the stigmatisation of participants and, in the prison setting, austere policy responses to SE data that impact negatively upon inmate-participants. The risk of harm can be managed through research planning, awareness of the socio-political context in which results will be interpreted (or, in the case of media, sensationalised) and careful relations with industry partners. Ethical guidelines should be developed in consultation with SE scholars and be periodically amended. They should include publication processes that safeguard scientific rigour and be promulgated through existing research governance structures.
   Conclusions: Guidelines will assist to promote an ethical research culture among SE teams and scholars involved in the publication process and this will work to protect the reputation of the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a significant source for the input of micro pollutants as endocrine disruptors (EDs) or pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) into the aquatic environment. Treatment efficiency of WWTPs often is reported, taking into account only inflow and effluent concentrations without further specification of the WWTP investigated. In order to allow comparison and evaluation of the removal efficiency of different layouts and concepts in wastewater treatment, additional information like the sludge retention time (SRT) and sludge load (F/M ratio) are necessary. Presented results from different WWTPs show correlation of removal of EDs and PhACs to the SRT. Compared to WWTPs with high F/M ratio implementation of the nitrification process on WWTPs results in a significant increase of the removal efficiency for EDs and PhACs. This paper describes an approach to determine comparable removal rates for different activated sludge systems based on mass balance and SRT.

AB Effluents from four healthcare facilities were characterized for the concentration of 16 common active pharmaceutical ingredients. The sampled facilities included a hospital, nursing care, assisted living, and independent living facility located within a single municipal wastewater system in Texas. Eleven of the 16 monitored pharmaceuticals were detected in at least 1 healthcare facility effluent and 2 measured antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were detected in all 4 facility effluents. Active pharmaceutical ingredient concentrations ranged from non-detectable levels for several corticosteroids in all facility effluents to 180 mu g/L sulfamethoxazole in the nursing care wastewater effluent. The mass of active pharmaceutical ingredients discharged to the municipality's wastewater conveyance system was determined by combining individual facility concentration data and daily wastewater flow. The estimated daily mass loading of all 16 pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.16 g/day to 23 g/day in the assisted living facility and nursing wastewater effluents, respectively. The combined active pharmaceutical ingredient mass loading for all four facilities was 42.6 g/day. These findings provide source characterization data for 16 common pharmaceuticals in healthcare facility wastewater and provide a basis for risk assessment of pharmaceuticals present in healthcare facility wastewaters.

AB Wastewater is increasingly being used to irrigate agricultural land in many countries around the world. However, limited research has examined the occurrence of antibiotics in soil irrigated with wastewater and their accumulation in plants. This study aimed to determine the distribution of various types of antibiotics in different environmental matrices in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region and to evaluate their accumulation and translocation in edible crops. Samples were collected from six sites in the PRD where either domestic wastewater or fishpond water was used for irrigation. Results showed that fishpond water irrigated soils had higher concentrations of antibiotics than wastewater-irrigated soils. Different trends were observed in the accumulation of antibiotics in the different edible parts of various crops. Despite the low human annual exposure to antibiotics through the consumption of edible crops (1.10 to 7950 mu g/y), the potential adverse effects of antibiotics along the food chain should not be neglected.

AB Novel media-ultra-lightweight sludge ceramics (ULSC) employed in an upflow lab-scale biological aerobic filter (BAF) were investigated for pharmaceutical advanced wastewater treatment. The influences of the volume ratio of pharmaceutical wastewater to domestic wastewater (PW/DW), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and air-liquid ratio (A/L) on chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) and ammonium (NH4+-N) of the effluent were investigated. When PW/DW of 4:1, HRT of 6 h, and A/L of 5:1 were applied, the mean effluent concentration of NH4+-N was 6.2 mg L-1, and the maximum CODCr concentration in the effluent was 96 mg L-1. Both NH4+-N and CODCr did not exceed the limits of the national discharge standards (NH4+-N <= 15 mg L-1, CODCr <= 100 mg L-1). In addition, the BAF system showed a strong capacity of further removal from NH4+-N of the effluent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of almost 40 pharmaceuticals: including antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, analgesics, hypolipidemics, alpha- and beta-blockers, an anti cancer drug, anti-fungal agents, an opiate, an antibiotic, an anti-coagulant, a diuretic, an anti-anginal and an anti-diabetic compound. This was used to assess the contribution of pharmaceuticals originating from hospital effluents to one of Oslo city's wastewater treatment works. Some pharmaceuticals were found to contribute to more of the wastewater loading than others. 11% of the propranolol entering the wastewater treatment works stems from hospital effluent, approximately 2% of the atenolol, carbemazepine, metaprolol and atorvastatin, and for several other compounds the contribution is less than 1%.
   This assessment shows that point sources discharges from hospitals typically make a small contribution to the overall pharmaceutical load when compared to municipal areas. however this varies from substance to substance and is not the case when a drug's use is primarily hospital based.

AB The occurrence of 43 pharmaceuticals and 2 metabolites of ibuprofen was evaluated at the inlet and the outlet of a pressure sewer pipe in order to asses if in-sewer processes affect the pharmaceutical concentrations during their pass through the pipe. The target compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few mu g/L, which are in the range commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i.e. from -10 to 10%. A higher decrease in concentrations (25-60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (-66 +/- 15%) and irbesartan (-58 +/- 25%), which may be due to the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer. The results show that microbial transformation of pharmaceuticals begins in sewer, albeit to different extents for different compounds. Therefore, the in-sewer transformation of pharmaceuticals should be assessed especially when their concentrations are used to estimate and refine the estimation of their per capita consumption in a catchment of interest in the sewage epidemiology approach.

The target compounds were 10 antibiotics, 4 antidepressants, 3 psychiatric drugs, 2 antihistamines and 2 lipid regulators. 272 Wastewater samples (136 influents and 136 effluents) were collected from March 2011 to February 2012 and analyzed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. All studied pharmaceuticals were frequently detected in both the influent and the effluent wastewater samples, except for meclozine, which was only found in the influent. The mean concentration of pharmaceuticals varied from 0.006 mu g L-1 to 1.48 mu g L-1 in the influent and from 0.003 mu g L-1 to 0.93 mu g L-1 in the effluent. The concentration of most pharmaceuticals was higher during winter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Xenobiotic cannabinoids (phyto and synthetic) are highly lipophilic compounds and have been shown to accumulate within the particulate fraction of wastewater. Limited research has been conducted to investigate the occurrence of cannabinoids in sewage sludge and/or biosolids. The analysis of excreted cannabinoids from sewage sludge or biosolids can provide information about community health, as well as potentially long-term environmental impacts. In this study, a liquid-liquid extraction method was developed for the extraction and detection method for 50 cannabinoids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, including the cannabis urinary biomarker 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and a variety of different generation synthetic cannabinoids and their respective metabolites. Method validation assessed criteria including linearity, selectivity, recovery, and matrix effects. The method was applied to samples collected from a conventional activated sludge reactor treatment facility from various stages of the treatment process. Three cannabinoids were abundant in primary sludge including THC, THC-COOH, and CBD, where THC was the most ubiquitous with concentrations up to 3200 mu g kg(-1). Only THC and THC-COOH were detectable in aged biosolids. The detection of some cannabinoids in biosolids demonstrated that these compounds are stable throughout the treatment process.

AB The extensive use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) leads to a continuous increase of their presence in urban wastewater. These pollutants are discharged into natural waters and pose a threat to human health and the ecological environment. This study focused on five sewage treatment plants in three cities of China's Yangtze River Delta as research sites to study the distribution and degradation of drugs and their conversion products in wastewater. The concentration of target compounds in the water ranged from 0 to 510.8 ng/L, and both positive and negative removal rates occurred during the treatment. Acetaminophen (ACE) and ibuprofen (IPF) can be completely removed in the biological treatment stage. The addition of flocculants and sand filtration has a positive effect on the removal of naproxen (NPX) and bezafibrate (BZB). Ultraviolet disinfection is beneficial for the removal of antipyrine (ATP) and diclofenac (DCF). A small amount of PPCPs were found in the sludge and particulate matter, which had little effect on removal. Finally, the risk quotients were used to evaluate the harmfulness of the PPCPs detected in the effluent to the ecological environment, and the results showed that there was little hazard.

DE Sewage effluent quality; Trace chemicals; Data distributions
ID WATER TREATMENT WORKS
AB It is important to understand the statistical distribution of monitoring data for them to be of value in determining the parameters of environmental models. No such distributional information has been available for many trace contaminants in sewage effluents. This paper applies the data of a major UK sewage works' effluent monitoring programme to determine the validity of the common assumption that data are lognormally distributed. Effluent quality was monitored at 162 wastewater treatment works over 1 year, generating over 3,000 results for each of over 40 substances, including metals, trace organic substances and pharmaceuticals. It is demonstrated that the lognormal assumption is clearly justified for the great majority of substances in the spatial case-for annual average effluent concentrations across different treatment works. In the site-specific, temporal case-for individual determinations of concentration at a single site over an annual period-lognormality is generally supported but not demonstrated so unequivocally for all site/substance combinations. The principal source of uncertainty was lack of sufficient numbers of observations reported to adequately low reporting limits.

AB Despite the high consumption of pharmaceuticals, mass loading and removal of these compounds in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in India have not been investigated. In this study, 43 pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as 13 of their metabolites were analyzed in five domestic STPs (wastewater influent, effluent, and sludge) and in raw domestic sewage collected in open sewerage channels in residential areas in India. The mean concentrations of amphetamine in two of the five STPs (mean: 4300 ng/L and 4720 ng/L) were the highest ever reported for wastewater influents, globally. Among artificial sweeteners, saccharin was the most abundant compound in influents (mean: 303,000 ng/L, df: 100%), followed by cyclamate [ 3460 ng/L, detection frequency (df): 75%] and sucralose (1460 ng/L, df: 100%). Elevated mean concentrations of an antimicrobial (triclocarban = 6180 ng/L), analgesic (ibuprofen = 2320 ng/L), antihypertensive (atenolol = 3180 ng/L), illicit drug (amphetamine = 984 ng/L), and saccharin (419,000 ng/L) were found in the Cooum River in Chennai. The median removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) ranged from 5% (norcocaine) to 100% (triclosan) for the five STPs. On the basis of the concentrations measured in influents, the mass loadings of PPCPs were estimated to range from 0.1 (norquetiapine) to 77,800 (saccharin) mg/d/1000 people. An estimated 2.55 kg of triclocarban, 3.24 kg of carbamazepine, 6.93 kg of amphetamine, and 252 kg of saccharin were discharged from a typical STP with an average flow rate of 20.7 million liters per day (serving a population of 325,000) in India.

AB The occurrence of four anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine) and a nervous stimulant (caffeine) in influent and effluent samples from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Seville was evaluated. Removal rates in the WWTPs and risk assessment of the pharmaceutically active compounds have been studied. Analytical determination was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array (DAD) and fluorescence (Fl) detectors after sample clean up and concentration by solid phase extraction. All pharmaceutically active compounds, except diclofenac, were detected not only in wastewater influents but also in wastewater effluents. Mean concentrations of caffeine, carbamazepine, ketoprofen and naproxen ranged between 0.28-11.44 mu g l(-1) and 0.21-2.62 mu g l(-1) in influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. Ibuprofen was present in the highest concentrations in the range 12.13-373.11 mu g l(-1) and 0.78-48.24 mu g l(-1) in influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. Removal rates of the pharmaceuticals ranged between 6 and 98%. Risk quotients, expressed as ratios between the measured environmental concentration (MEC) and the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) were higher than 1 for ibuprofen and naproxen in influent wastewater and for ibuprofen in effluent wastewater.

AB Hospital wastewater is loaded with pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), which sometimes end up in the environment unaltered due to the lack of effective and specific treatments. The use of white rot fungi, specifically Trametes versicolor, as a biological treatment has proven to be an effective and environmentally friendly technology to tackle this problem. However, only a few studies have dealt with the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater by immobilizing white rot fungi in a lignocellulosic substrate. In this work, two bioreactor configurations are utilized to treat both synthetic and real hospital wastewater by the use of T. versicolor. The stirred tank bioreactor (STB) was able to remove to a great extent 16 pharmaceuticals spiked in the synthetic wastewater (95.7%) and those naturally present in the hospital wastewater (85.0%). Nonetheless, acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna and germination index with Lactuca sativa showed an increase in the general toxicity of both wastewater matrices after the treatment. On the other hand, a trickle-bed bioreactor (TBB), using fungal biomass immobilized on rice husks, achieved an elimination of 88.6% and 89.8% in synthetic and real wastewater, respectively. However, 73.3% of the removal was ascribed to adsorption to the bed's biomass. Additionally, toxicological tests showed a decrease in the hospital wastewater's toxicity after the treatment in the TBB. These findings suggest that the fungal fixed-bed reactor could be more suitable than the stirred tank reactor to remove pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater, since it was able to remove PhACs to a great extent and simultaneously detoxify real wastewater.

AB Hospital effluents represent an important source for the release of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment. This study aims to determine concentrations of various antibiotics in wastewater before and after wastewater treatment in a rural hospital (60 km from the center of Hanoi) and in an urban hospital (in the center of Hanoi) in Vietnam, and it aims to explore the relationship between antibiotic concentrations in wastewater before wastewater treatment and quantities of antibiotics used in the rural hospital, over a period of one year in 2013. Water samples were collected using continuous sampling for 24 h in the last week of every month. The data on quantities of antibiotics delivered to all inpatient wards were collected from the Pharmacy department in the rural hospital. Solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used for chemical analysis. Significant concentrations of antibiotics were present in the wastewater both before and after wastewater treatment of both the rural and the urban hospital. Ciprofloxacin was detected at the highest concentrations in the rural hospital's wastewater (before treatment: mean = 42.8 mu g/L; after treatment: mean = 21.5 mu g/L). Metronidazole was detected at the highest concentrations in the urban hospital's wastewater (before treatment: mean = 36.5 mu g/L; after treatment: mean = 14.8 mu g/L). A significant correlation between antibiotic concentrations in wastewater before treatment and quantities of antibiotics used in the rural hospital was found for ciprofloxacin (r = 0.78; p = 0.01) and metronidazole (r = 0.99; p < 0.001).

AB A sewage lagoon serving the small municipality of Lakefield in Ontario, Canada was monitored in the summer, fall and winter to determine removals of carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, triclosan, sucralose, HHCB and AHTN. Concentrations of these compounds in untreated and treated wastewater were estimated by deploying POCIS and SPMD passive samplers in the sewage lagoon. Passive samplers were also deployed at several points upstream and downstream of the point of discharge from the lagoon into the Otonabee River. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS were utilized to determine the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and sucralose, an artificial sweetener. Among PPCPs sampled by POCIS, the highest estimated concentration in untreated wastewater was ibuprofen sampled during the fall, at an estimated concentration of 60.3 ng/L. The estimated average concentration of sucralose was 13.6 ng/L in the untreated wastewaters. Triclosan, HHCB and AHTN in SPMDs were highest during fall season, at 30, 1677 and 109 ng/L, respectively. For all compounds except gemfibrozil, carbamazepine and sucralose, removals were highest in the summer (83.0 to 98.8%) relative to removals in the fall (48.4 to 91.4%) and winter (14.0 to 78.3%). Finally, the estimated concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan and HHCB were compared with predicted values obtained through application of the WEST (R) modeling tool, with a new model based on the River Water Quality Model No. I and extended with dynamic mass balances describing the fate of chemicals of emerging concern subject to a variety of removal pathways. The model was able to adequately predict the fate of these four compounds in the lagoon in summer and winter, but the model overestimated removals of three of the four test compounds in the fall sampling period. This lagoon was as effective at removing PPCPs as many conventional WWTPs, but removals were better during the summer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are an emerging environmental problem. It is strongly confirmed that pharmaceuticals are present in soils and environmental waters (surface, marine and even groundwater), and that wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are the main source of pharmaceuticals in the watershed. The aim of this study was to recognize the spatial distribution and seasonal changes of selected pharmaceuticals in conventional WWTP with Sludge Treatment Reed Beds (STRBs) technology used for dewatering and stabilization of sewage sludge, because these systems have never been studied in terms of pharmaceuticals distribution or removal potential.
   The research was conducted in conventional WWTP in Gniewino, where raw wastewater was treated using mechanical, biological and chemical removal of the organic matter and nutrients, and sewage sludge was treated with STRB. Determinations of pharmaceuticals (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - ibuprofen, paracetamol, flurbiprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and its metabolites) and basic parameters were carried out in samples of influent and effluent from WWTP and in the liquid phase of surplus activated sludge (SAS) as well as reject water from STRB.
   The potential of removal varied among target pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen and naproxen were completely removed by the standard applied technology of the Gniewino WWTP. Diclofenac and its metabolites were the chemicals with the lowest removal potential in wastewater and the highest detection frequency. These pharmaceuticals were also detected in the liquid phase of SAS as well as in reject water. However, removal potential when using STRB was higher than 94% (mostly higher than 99%), independent of the season. Indeed, the STRB technology is not only efficient in sludge dewatering and nutrient removal (primary purpose), but also elimination of polar pollutants. Nevertheless, removal in STRB did not mean that pharmaceuticals were totally eliminated because these compounds could be "trapped and stored" in beds (by the process of sorption) or transformed into other products. This study is a starting point for further exploration of STRB technology for elimination of emerging pollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biologically based wastewater treatment systems are considered a sustainable, cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment systems. These systems have been used and studied for the treatment of urban sewage from small communities, and recently, it has been reported that they can also effectively remove emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). EOCs are a new group of unregulated contaminants which include pharmaceutical and personal care products, some pesticides, veterinary products, and industrial compounds among others that are thought to have long-term adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. This review is focused on reporting the ability of biologically based wastewater treatment systems to remove EOCs and the main elimination mechanisms and degradation processes (i.e., biodegradation, photodegradation, phytoremediation, and sorption) taking place in constructed wetlands, ponds, and Daphnia and fungal reactors.

AB Groundwater and surface water are in many cases closely linked components of the water cycle with respect to both quantity and quality. Bank filtrates may eventually be impacted by the infiltration of wastewater-derived micropollutants from surface waters. Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame have recently been reported as a novel class of potentially valuable tracers to study the fate of wastewater-derived substances in groundwater and, in particular, to determine the (bio)degradability of micropollutants. In this paper, a model-based analysis of a field experiment within the hyporheic and riparian zone of a highly polluted German stream was performed to assess the physical and chemical behavior of the artificial sweetener acesulfame. In the first part of this study, a reliable flow and transport model was established by jointly using hydraulic heads, temperatures, and acesulfame concentrations as inverse model calibration constraints. The analysis confirmed the conservative behavior of acesulfame and, therefore, its usability as an indicator of sewage flux provenance. However, a comparison of the appropriateness of hydraulic head, temperature, and acesulfame concentrations revealed that the characterization of the surface water-groundwater flux data indicated diurnal temperature fluctuations are the best indicator in terms of characterizing the flow and transport behavior in the groundwater system.

AB A comprehensive gas chromatographic-high-resolution mass spectrometric (GC-HRMS)-based method was developed that permitted the simultaneous determination of 30 estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and related compounds. including surfactants, biogenic and synthetic steroids, fecal sterols, phytoestrogens, and plasticizers, in wastewater. Features of the method include low sample volume (similar to 40 ml), optimized Florisil(R) cleanup to minimize matrix interferences and optimized analyte derivatization to improve sensitivity via GC-HRMS. Detection limits were in the low- to mid-ng/L range, and recoveries were greater than 60% for most target analytes. This new method allows for high throughput analysis of many organic wastewater contaminants in a complex matrix with relative standard deviation of less than 15% for most measurable compounds. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by examining wastewater samples from different origins. Compounds such as di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, cholesterol, cholestanol, and other cholesterol derivatives were measured in much higher concentrations in untreated sewage and were reduced substantially in concentration by the treatment process. However, steroidal compounds, particularly estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), as well as plant sterols (except stigmastanol), were greater in the treated municipal wastewater versus the untreated effluent. Plant and fungi sterols, stigmastanol and ergosterol, were found largely associated with bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME) as compared to the municipal effluents.

AB This study attempts to provide an improved approach for the analysis of antibiotics, which normally exist at low concentration in complex matrices such as receiving streams of wastewater treatment plant discharge. The analytical method developed in this study combines an existing pretreatment technique of solid-phase extraction (SPE) with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MSD) through on-line connection. The on-line connection suppressed the target loss by keeping the cartridge from drying, which resulted in improvement of the recovery and saving of the analytical time. For the on-line solid-phase extraction of 10 ml water samples, recoveries were between 74.3% and 116.5% and average LOQ was 0.11 mu g l(-1) for the sulfonamide antibiotics (SA) and 0.09 mu g l(-1) for the tetracycline antibiotics (TA). Application of the developed method for the analysis of fourteen antibiotics revealed that several antibiotics were detected at concentrations above the LOQ in ARW. Treated and untreated sewage and agricultural wastewater were mostly responsible for the antibiotics contamination of the river. Antibiotics were detected at much higher concentrations in the agricultural wastewater sample than in the sewage sample, implying substantial use of antibiotics in the agricultural industry. Wastewater treatment was generally effective in separation of the antibiotics tested in this study. The extent of the treatment depended on the type of antibiotics. Hydrophobic antibiotics were more effectively separated from the solution than hydrophilic antibiotics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Each year, large quantities of pharmaceuticals are consumed worldwide for the treatment and prevention of human and animal diseases. Although the drugs and the metabolites observed in the wastewaters and in the environment are present at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations required to exert their effects in humans or animals, their long-term impact on the environment is commonly not known. In this study, the occurrence of six antihistamines, which are used for the relief of allergic reactions such as hay fever, was determined in sewage treatment plants wastewaters and in recipient river waters.
   The occurrence of the antihistamines cetirizine, acrivastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine in sewage treatment plants wastewaters and in recipient river waters was studied. The analytical procedure consisted of solid-phase extraction of the water samples followed by liquid chromatography separation and detection by a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction mode.
   Cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine were detected in both influent and effluent wastewater samples at concentration levels ranging from about 80 to 220 ng/L, while loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine could not be detected in any samples. During sewage treatment, the concentration of the antihistamines dropped by an average of 16-36%. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of antihistamines were observed in samples collected during the season of most intensive plant pollen production, i.e. in May. In the river water samples, the relative pattern of occurrence of cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine was similar to that in the wastewater samples; although the concentration of the compounds was substantially lower (4-11 ng/L). The highest concentrations of the studied drugs were observed near the discharging point of the sewage treatment plant.
   The highest concentrations of antihistamines in STP wastewaters correlate with the outbreak of allergic reaction caused by high amounts of plant pollens in the air. The analysis results of the river water samples show that the antihistamines are carried far away from the effluent discharge points. They may account for a part of the mix of pharmaceuticals and of pharmaceutical metabolites that occur downstream of STPs.
   Antihistamines are poorly degraded/eliminated under the biological treatment processes applied in the wastewater treatment plants and, consequently, they are continuously being discharged along with other drugs to the aquatic environment.
   As a huge quantity and variety of drugs and their metabolites are continuously discharged to rivers and the sea, the compounds should be considered as contaminants that may possess risks to the aquatic ecosystem. Further studies are urgently needed on the environmental fate of the antihistamines and other pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. These studies should be concerned with the stability of the compounds, their transformation reactions and the identity of the transformation products, the distribution of drugs and their uptake and effects in organisms. On the basis of these studies, the possible environmental hazards of pharmaceuticals may be assessed.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) and its major metabolites, hydroxyibuprofen (OH-IBU) and carboxyibuprofen (CA-IBU) were monitored from November 2015 to March 2017 at four full-scale constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow treating municipal wastewater in the Czech Republic. During the seven sampling campaigns, all three compounds were identified in high concentrations in the inflowing raw wastewater. The average inflow concentrations of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU amounted to 14.6, 18.3 and 36.4 mu g l(-1). The ratio between IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU is in agreement with the previously published results indicating that the ibuprofen metabolites occur in higher concentration in the raw wastewater than the parent compound with CA-IBU exhibiting the highest concentrations. The outflow concentrations off studied compounds decreased and removal amounted to 44.7%, 29.3% and 47.5% for IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU, respectively. The results are in line with general fact that ibuprofen and its metabolites are not removed with high efficiency in anoxic or anaerobic conditions and that OH-IBU is the least removed compound. The areal loadings of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU averaged 0.425, 0.574 and 0.999 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The annual loads of all forms of ibuprofen varied between 458 and 958 g year(-1) among four studies constructed wetlands.

AB In the last years, a lot of emerging contaminants, such as, endocrine disruptors compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in wastewater. Because of their toxicity and possible adverse effects on the environment and humans, their release from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) effluents should be minimized, particularly when a wastewater reuse for crops irrigation is expected. Many processes have been investigated for advanced treatment of UWWTP effluents as well as for emerging contaminant degradation; among these, adsorption process was successfully used to remove EDCs and PPCPs from wastewater. This article shortly reviews EDCs and PPCPs removal from UWWTP effluents by adsorption process using conventional and non-conventional adsorbents. The fate of EDCs and PPCPs in UWWTPs and the implications for agricultural wastewater reuse has been addressed too. In spite of the adsorption process looking to be a valuable alternative to other advanced technologies for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater, some gaps still remain to evaluate the actual feasibility at full scale. However, according to a few studies available in scientific literature on the use of both powdered activated carbon and granular activated carbon at full scale, adsorption process by activated carbon is a promising, potentially effective, and economically feasible solution for producing safe wastewater for agricultural reuse.

AB Facing the increase of environmental concern in the water treatment field, stakeholders need reliable decision support tools to assess environmental performances of urban and industrial wastewater systems. To discuss how life cycle assessment (LCA) can be applied to wastewater treatment projects, such an assessment has been performed through a case study on a full-scale plant. Methodological issues that had to be dealt with are briefly exposed. Five life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods have been used: CML 2000, Eco Indicator 99, EDIP 96, EPS and Ecopoints 97. Consistent assessment between these methods has been obtained for greenhouse effect, resources depletion and acidification. Eutrophication is correctly estimated if one looks at the potential impact of a treatment scenario but not at the characterization of the eutrophication state of a specific receiving stream. Work is needed concerning human toxicity as large discrepancies are noticed between the impact assessment methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal wastewaters contain many organic compounds, among them active ingredients as pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products, which are used in large quantities throughout the world. Most of these compounds come either from domestic sewage or from hospital or industrial discharges and enter municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). Modem STPs can effectively accomplish carbon and nitrogen removal, as well as microbial pollution control. However, these plants have not been specifically designed to remove these trace polluting compounds.
   The dynamics of 12 micropollutants in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) have been studied when treating synthetic sewage. These selected substances correspond to different therapeutic groups such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine), tranquillisers (diazepam), analgesics (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), antibiotics (roxithromycin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) and three polycyclic musk fragrances (galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide). These micropollutants are spiked into the synthetic wastewater fed to the reactor at environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 mu g/L.
   Taking into account previous researches, the MBR is operated at a sludge retention time (SRT) of 44-72 days, since a high value of this parameter is considered as crucial for the removal of these micropollutants. Under these conditions, different fates are observed depending on pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) characteristics. Hydrophobic organic substances, like musk fragrances, are partially sorbed onto the sludge. This explains the partial removal observed in the reactor, with an overall efficiency around 50%. Other substances, like the anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen, are not sorbed but they are eliminated almost completely (98% and 84% of removal, respectively). On the other hand, substances like carbamazepine or diclofenac show a recalcitrant character and their elimination from the effluent is very limited, below 9%.

AB Three United Kingdom (UK) wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)-rotating biological contactor (RBC), trickling filter (TF) and oxidation ditch (OD)-were analyzed for their triclosan contents at different treatment stages. Furthermore, selected wastewater and biomass parameters were determined to draw correlations between the biological treatment, biomass make-up and the removal efficiency of triclosan. Within this study, triclosan bound to the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of sludge flocs in the oxidation ditch seemed to have an adverse effect on the effluent quality, reducing the triclosan overall removal due to re-balancing effects within the final clarifier. Within this study of the three examined WWTPs, temperature and pH of the bulk phase and as well the lipid content of the biomass seemed to have the most significant effects on the triclosan removal. The triclosan overall removal for each site was shown to be significantly high, ranging on average between 81% (RBC) and 96% (OD). The most efficient plant regarding the triclosan overall removal was found to be the oxidation ditch, which can be explained due to high hydraulic retention times. Primary settling points were found to have a significant impact on the triclosan overall loss rate, which was associated with the high fat content of primary sludge and the hydrophobic properties of triclosan. Besides the fat content of sludge or biomass, the pH and temperature showed a significant impact on triclosan loss rates as well.

AB Polar anthropogenic organic micropollutants are frequently detected in freshwater and discharged on large scale into marine systems. In this work the results of 153 samples collected from the shorelines of the Baltic Sea (Germany), Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy), Aegean Sea and Dardanelles (Greece & Turkey), San Francisco Bay (USA), Pacific Ocean (USA), Mediterranean Sea (Israel), and Balearic Sea (Spain) are presented. The samples were analyzed for various classes of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and stimulants. Caffeine, paraxanthine, theobromine, tolyltriazole, 1H-benzotriazole, and atrazine were detected in >50% of all samples. The detection frequencies of carbamazepine, iopamidol, diuron, sulfamethoxazole, paracetamol, theophylline, and atenolol were between 20% and 32%. As caffeine is linked to untreated wastewater, the widespread occurrence of raw sewage in marine environments and thus potentially elevated nutrient concentrations and risk for the presence of wastewater-related pathogens is remarkable.

AB Herein, a sponge membrane bioreactor (Sponge-MBR) combined with ozonation process was performed to remove the antibiotics which frequently existed in the hospital wastewater. Whilst seven antibiotics i.e., norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim were widely used in medications, this integration was applied for the evaluation of treatment performance under different fluxes. As the results, whilst the antibiotics were eliminated about 4593%, the tetracycline was completely removed (100%) using Sponge-MBR operated at the flux of 10 LMH. For enhancement of antibiotics removal, the ozonation process was introduced to treat the membrane permeate. Overall efficiencies were 97 +/- 2% (trimethoprim), 92 +/- 4% (norfloxacin), 90 +/- 1% (erythromycin), 88 +/- 4% (ofloxacin), 83 +/- 7 (ciprofloxacin) and 66 +/- 1% (sulfamethoxazole). These results demonstrated Sponge-MBR coupled with ozonation could be a prospective technology for the hospital wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Five acidic drugs (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac) were chosen in order to determine their behavior in a sewage treatment plant (STP). An analytical method using solid phase extraction (SPE) and a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used. The results show that four pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac) are not well removed by treatment in Swiss STPs. Maximum concentration in the effluent was determined for mefenamic acid up to 1.0 mug/L. This component seems to be relevant in Swiss STPs effluents and we can expect its presence in surface waters.

AB Exposure to antibiotics, biocides, chemical preservatives, and heavy metals in different settings such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may apply selective pressure resulting in the enrichment of multiple resistant, co- and cross-resistant strains of bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize potentially pathogenic triclosan (TCS) - and/or, chloroxylenol (PCMX) tolerant bacteria from sewage and river water in the North-West, Potchefstroom, South Africa. Several potential pathogens were identified, with Aeromonas isolates being most abundant. Clonal relationships between Aeromonas isolates found at various sampling points were elucidated using ERIC-PCR. Selected isolates were characterized for their minimum inhibitory concentrations against the biocides, as well as antibiotic resistance profiles, followed by an evaluation of synergistic and antagonistic interactions between various antimicrobials. Isolates were also screened for the presence of extracellular enzymes associated with virulence. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of both biocides in the wastewater, but fingerprinting methods did not reveal whether the WWTP is the source from which these organisms enter the environment. Isolates exhibited various levels of resistance to antimicrobials as well as several occurrences of synergy and antagonisms between the biocides and select antibiotics. Several isolates had a very high potential for virulence but further study is required to identify the specific virulence and resistance genes associated with the isolates in question.

The results indicated that the MLWs may be assessed as strong domestic wastewater and also have highly toxic properties. Furthermore, statistical optimization of toxicity removal through ozonation was investigated using the central composite design. COD, BOD5, AOX, and Toxicity unit (TU) removals were determined to be 50.6%, 43.2%, 48.9%, and 99.9%, respectively. The TU value of the MLW decreased from 163 to 0.16. The results of the study indicated that the ozonation process is an effective treatment option for COD, BOD5, AOX, and TU removal from MLW.

AB This work is an exploratory study about the application of Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) in the treatment of sanitary sewage, for reuse purposes. The removal of organic matter in terms of TOC, the elimination of micro pollutants (caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and the production of hydrogen and alkanes were evaluated. Batch reactors were employed for the treatment of synthetic sewage using a Pt catalyst supported on a commercial carbon black. APR was found to be suitable to remove TOC and micro pollutants from sewage. Total removal was achieved for carbamazepine and diclofenac, whereas for caffeine and ibuprofen, the removal levels exceeded 90 %. Removal of TOC was also observed in tests where only the metal-free carbon support was used, most probably due to adsorption and hydrothermal carbonization, which could be considered as a route for organic matter removal, although low production of valuable gases was observed. In the catalysed experiment in addition to TOC, removal significant production of H-2 and CH4 was achieved. The application of APR to wastewater makes possible to remove pollutants and micro pollutants and simultaneously valorize organic matter to valuable gases.

AB An ultra-performance liquid chromatography method using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was developed and validated for the determination of steroid oestrogens in wastewater matrices. To date, analytical methods established in the literature for 17-ethinylestradiol have been unable to achieve the proposed predicted no effect concentration of 0.1ngl(-1). The extensive sample pretreatment and analytical methodology proposed herein enable 17-ethinylestradiol to be determined at very low background concentrations with a theoretical method detection limit of 0.06ngl(-1) which has been applied in real environmental matrices. During the validation process, a trickling filter wastewater treatment works was monitored to demonstrate the method's application. Oestrogen removal across the filters demonstrated good removals of natural free oestrogens (62.0%) with lower removals of the synthetic oestrogen 17-ethinylestradiol (29.2%) from wastewaters at 10 degrees C. The method's application illustrates its capability of detecting oestrogen concentrations in real wastewater samples comprising complex organics of comparatively high concentration. Furthermore, a complete process mass balance for 17-ethinylestradiol is now attainable which has previously posed a challenge owing to the low environmental concentrations typically exhibited, but more significantly as a result of the lower sensitivity inherent in previously reported analytical methods.

AB Many xenobiotics entering wastewater treatment plants are known to be persistent during wastewater treatment and tend to adsorb to sewage sludge. The application of sewage sludge as fertilizer in agriculture may pose the risk of an incorporation of xenobiotics in the cultivated plants and, finally, an inclusion into the food chain. This study was performed to investigate the uptake of common sewage sludge contaminants, galaxolide, tonalide, and triclosan, by plants used for human consumption and livestock feeding. Barley, meadow fescue, and four carrot cultivars were sown and grown in spiked soils under greenhouse conditions. After harvesting the plants, roots and leaves were analyzed separately, and the respective bioconcentration factors were calculated. In carrots, a concentration gradient of the xenobiotics became evident that decreased from the root peel via root core to the leaves. A significant influence of the differing root lipid contents on the uptake rates cannot be supported by our data, but the crucial influence of soil organic carbon content was confirmed. Barley and meadow fescue roots incorporated higher amounts of the target substances than carrots, but translocation into the leaves was negligible. The results indicated that an introduction of persistent semi- and nonpolar xenobiotics into the food chain via edible plants like carrots could be of certain relevance when sludge is applied as fertilizer. Due to low rates found for the translocation of the xenobiotics into the aerial plant parts, the entrance pathway into food products via feeding livestock is less probable.

AB Life Cycle Assessment has been used to compare different scenarios involving wastewater reuse, with special focus on toxicity-related impact categories. The study is based on bench-scale experiments applying ozone and ozone in combination with hydrogen peroxide to a wastewater effluent from a Spanish sewage treatment plant. Two alternative characterisation. models have been used to account for toxicity of chemical substances, namely USES-LCA and EDIP97. Four alternative scenarios have been assessed: wastewater discharge plus desalination supply, wastewater reuse without tertiary treatment, wastewater reuse after applying a tertiary treatment consisting on ozonation, and wastewater reuse after applying ozonation in combination with hydrogen peroxide. The results highlight the importance of including wastewater pollutants in LCA of wastewater systems assessing toxicity, since the contribution of wastewater pollutants to the overall toxicity scores in this case study can be above 90%. Key pollutants here are not only heavy metals and other priority pollutants, but also non-regulated pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Wastewater reuse after applying any of the tertiary treatments considered appears as the best choice from an ecotoxicity perspective. As for human toxicity, differences between scenarios are smaller, and taking into account the experimental and modelling uncertainty, the benefits of tertiary treatment are not so clear. From a global warming potential perspective, tertiary treatments involve a potential 85% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when compared with desalination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Little information exists on the occurrence and the ultimate fate of pharmaceuticals in the water bodies in India despite being one of the world leaders in pharmaceutical production and consumption. This paper has reviewed 19 published reports of pharmaceutical occurrence in the aquatic environment in India [conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), hospital WTPs, rivers, and groundwater]. Carbamazepine (antipsychoactive), atenolol (antihypertensive), triclocarban and triclosan (antimicrobials), trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (antibacterials), ibuprofen and acetaminophen (analgesics), and caffeine (stimulant) are the most commonly detected at higher concentrations in Indian WTPs that treat predominantly the domestic sewage. The concentration of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin in Indian WTPs were up to 40 times higher than that in other countries in Europe, Australia, Asia, and North America. A very few studies in Indian rivers reported the presence of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ketoprofen, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and enrofloxacin. Similar compounds were reported in rivers in China, indicating a similar usage pattern in both of these developing countries. In a study reported from an open well in southern India, the groundwater showed the presence of cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, citalopram and terbinafine, which was close to a WIT receiving effluents from pharmaceutical production.

AB Municipal sewage and WWTP effluents are considered to be a major source of pollution, regarding the occurrence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment. Although removal potential of many EDCs by conventional WWTPs is recognised, literature data are not easily comparable. Besides, in order to reach very low concentrations, a further treatment might be sometimes required. Positive results can be achieved by tertiary chemical oxidation; nevertheless, technical-economic suitability is still to be fully demonstrated. In this work, two estrogen-like susbstances were considered: nonylphenol (NP) (and its parent compounds) and bisphenol A (BPA). The experimental work was conducted at Verona (Northern Italy) WWTP (370,000 p. e.): after a 15 days sampling campaign, which was carried out in order to calculate mass balance of target compounds, chemical oxidation tests were performed on effluent by means of UV/H(2)O(2) process and ozonation. Technical-economic feasibility of these solutions is discussed.

AB Rural communities in the United States usually use a series of aerated lagoons to treat domestic wastewater. Effluents from these systems are typically discharged to receiving watersheds, which leads to a potential transfer of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and steroid hormones from sanitary sewage to the environment. The primary objectives of this study are to identify and quantify PPCPs and steroid hormones in rural sewage treatment lagoons, to investigate the removal efficiency of these emerging contaminants in the treatment processes, and to monitor their occurrence in the surrounding watershed. In this study, a method has been developed to analyze thirteen PPCPs and eight steroid hormones in various water samples. Among all of the PPCPs considered, ten chemicals were detected in sewage influents, lagoon waters of different treatment stages, or effluents at concentrations in the ng/L to low mu g/L range. Three hormones were observed in the influents at total concentrations as high as 164 ng/L, but no hormone residues were detected in the effluents. This indicates that the aerated lagoons may effectively remove hormone conthminants. With the exception of carbamazepine, removal rates for the other detected PPCPs were relatively high in the range of 88 to 100% in September with average air temperature equal to 20 degrees C. However, the removal efficiency of nine PPCPs in the rural wastewater treatment plant exhibited large temporal variability. The concentrations of PPCPs in the lagoon waters and effluents collected in November, with average air temperature equal to 4.4 degrees C, were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those samples collected in September. Occurrence of these PPCP contaminants in the surrounding watershed was also monitored. The discharge of effluents significantly elevated the PPCP concentrations in the receiving creek and increased their occurrence in the adjacent river. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of the combined process of biofiltration with ozonation to improve the quality of secondary effluent. The secondary effluent from the Dinapur Sewage Treatment Plant Varanasi, India was used in this work. The process of biofiltration with the plant species of Eichornia crassipes and Lemna minor, at a flow rate of 262 ml min(-1) and plant density of 30 mg L(-1) for 48 h, in combination with the process of ozonation with ozone dose of 10 mg L(-1) and contact time of 5 min was applied. Results revealed that combined process was statistically most suitable for the highest degradation of physico-chemical and microbial parameters with improving BDOC value. The biofiltration process is able to remove highest percentage of toxic heavy metals from the secondary effluent without production of toxicity. This technique is highly recommendable for tropical wastewater where sewage is mixed with industrial effluents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and phenolic utility chemicals in sewage water are considered to be an emerging problem because of increased use and observed adverse effects in the environment. The study provides knowledge on the removal efficiency of micropollutants with a range of physical and chemical properties in three commercially available onsite wastewater treatment facilities (OWTFs), tested on influent wastewater collected from 2500 person equivalents in Bildchen, Germany. A longer hydraulic retention time would in theory be expected to have a positive effect, and this study presents results for three different OWTFs in full-scale comparable tests under natural conditions. A range of 24 different pharmaceuticals, five phenols and three hormones were analyzed. Flow-proportional consecutive sampling was performed in order to determine the removal efficiency. Twenty-eight substances were detected in the effluent wastewater out of 32 substances included. Average effluent concentrations of Simvastatin, Estrone, Estradiol and Ethinylestradiol were above the indicative critical-effect concentration of pharmacological effect on fish in all facilities. Average effluent concentrations of both Diclofenac and Estradiol were higher than the Environmental Quality Standards applied in Sweden (190-240 times and 9-35 times respectively). The removal efficiency of micropollutants was high for substances with high logK(ow), which enhance the adsorption and removal with sludge. Low removal was observed for substances with low logK(ow) and acidic characteristics, and for substances with stabilizing elements of the chemical structure. Facilities that use activated sludge processes removed hormones more efficiently than facilities using trickling filter treatment technique. Moreover, longer hydraulic retention time increased the removal of pharmaceuticals, hormones, turbidity and total nitrogen. Removal of Caffeine, Ibuprofen, Estrone, Naproxen and Estradiol, was strongly correlated to the sludge and particles removal. Thus, the efficiency of the tested OWTFs could be improved by adjusting the technical methods and increasing the hydraulic retention time. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are widely used in human society and are consequently found in sewage treatment plants. However, information regarding the fate of antibiotics in decentralised sewage treatment plants is limited. Therefore, this study monitored and compared four frequently prescribed antibiotics (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole) in each stage of four conventional treatment plants (three extended aerations and one conventional activated sludge) and two decentralised treatment plants (two Imhoff tanks) in Johor Bahru district between December 2018 and August 2019. The findings revealed that ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole were detected in most wastewater samples, including influent, secondary effluent, final effluent and sewage sludge samples. The antibiotic concentrations in the aqueous and sludge phases ranged from 4.2 to 2690 ng/l and 1.7 to 317.4 ng/g, respectively. Ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole were effectively removed by extended aeration and conventional activated sludge plants (> 75% reduction), erythromycin was effectively removed in IT plants (> 85% reduction) and ciprofloxacin could not be removed effectively by any systems (< 30% reduction). Statistical analysis showed that the approximate relationships between the removal of antibiotics and several wastewater parameters existed. A detailed antibiotic mass flow was conducted in extended aeration and Imhoff tank plants. An estimate of 115.72 g, 202.25 g, 170.55 g and 213.21 g of ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, were discharged annually. The mass balance analysis indicated that biodegradation was the major route for the removal of all antibiotics studied. Meanwhile, sorption was only responsible for minor removal of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole.

AB Chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) is an emerging sewage treatment strategy due to its high efficiency and small land requirement. CEPT sludge can be easily dewatered and used for energy recovery through incineration. However, with large amount of reusable nutrients (40% organic carbon, 23% lipids, and 17% protein), the value of CEPT sludge may have been underestimated. In this study, the biorefinery potential of CEPT sludge has been proven via production of 28.9 g/L ethanol or 50.3 g/L lactic acid (LA) or 1.43 filter paper unit (FPU)/mL cellulase from 10 g of CEPT sludge experiment. Inhibition on cell growth and potential inhibitors from plasticizers, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants were determined. Nevertheless, production titer was not affected or performed even better than the non-inhibitors controls. CEPT sludge showed significant potential in biochemical conversion, and the related products may offer an opportunity to support wastewater treatment toward sustainability and carbon neutrality.

AB The mass flows and removal of 20 antibiotics of seven classes in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Hong Kong were investigated in different seasons of a whole year, using bihourly 24 h flow proportional composite samples. Antibiotics were detected at concentrations of 3.2-1718, 1.3-1176 and 1.1-233 ng L(-1) in influents, secondary and disinfection effluents. Total daily discharges of all the detected antibiotics from effluents of Shatin and Stanley WWTPs were 470-710 and 3.0-5.2 g d(-1), respectively. Ampicillin, cefalexin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, chlortetracycline and vancomycin were effectively (52-100%) eliminated by activated sludge process while ampicillin and cefalexin were effectively (91-99%) eliminated by disinfection. Bihourly variation analysis showed that concentrations of the major antibiotics in influents varied more significantly in Stanley WWTP which served small communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sewage treatment plants (STPs) and pharmaceutical manufactories (PMFs) are recognized as important reservoirs for aquatic pollution with antibiotics. Although the occurrence of multiple classes of antibiotics has been mostly reported for STPs and PMFs, knowledge on the effects of wastewater treatment processes on the removal of antibiotics is not well documented. In this study, wastewaters were collected from different treatment points of two STPs and two PMFs in eastern China. Thirty-seven antibiotics within the four classes of fluoroquinolones (FQs), macrolides (MACs), sulfonamides (SAs) and tetracyclines (TCs) were analyzed. Among the investigated antibiotics, 19-33 out of 37 target compounds were detected at least once in the STPs wastewaters ranging from low ng/L to approximately 12.7 mu/L. In the wastewater samples collected from PMFs, up to 34 antibiotics were present with detection frequencies up to 100%, showing generally higher concentrations (up to 19.0 mu/L) than those at the STPs. FQs and SAs were the dominant antibiotic families, which accounted for more than 90% of the total antibiotic concentration in the wastewaters. Moreover, the removal of antibiotics by anaerobicanoxic-oxic (A(2)O), membrane bioreactor (MBR) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems was evaluated. The MBR system exhibited the best performance, mainly due to the processes of biodegradation and sorption during biological treatments. Notably, several SAs (SMP, SMZ) and FQs (CIN, ENO) antibiotics were consistently detected at concentration levels of mu/L in the effluent samples. The culturable antibiotic-resistance tests and risk assessment indicated that the antibiotic-contaminated effluents would facilitate the development of resistant bacteria and pose high toxicity to non-target organisms in the aquatic environment. Overall, the findings sug-gested an urgent need for improving the wastewater treatment technologies for simultaneous removal of different classes of antibiotics.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) are impacted by down-the-drain influents of anthropogenic chemicals. These chemicals are in consumer products and include the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and antimicrobial triclosan (TCS). Characterization of the distribution of TBBPA, TCS and the TBBPA product tribromobisphenol A (tri-BBPA) was determined at five stages along the treatment process of a typical Canadian MWTP facility. Overall, the TCS concentrations for both liquid (influents, primary effluents and final effluents (FEs)) and solid samples (primary and waste activated sludges) were similar to reported ranges in the literature. In contrast to TCS, both TBBPA and tri-BBPA concentrations were scarcely available in the literature. The TBBPA concentrations were within literature ranges for both influents and sludges, while the tri-BBPA sludge concentrations were markedly higher than a single available previous study. Mass balances for TCS, TBBPA and tri-BBPA indicated 7, 9 and 42%, respectively, of each chemical remaining in the FEs. The resultant annual mass loadings into the Detroit River were estimated to be 3.3 kg, 6.57 g, and 21.5 g for TCS, TBBPA and tri-BBPA, respectively.

AB As irrigation with untreated wastewater often leads to an accumulation of contaminants in soils, nowadays, treated wastewater is increasingly used for irrigation. Here, we investigated whether and to which degree irrigation with treated wastewater might cause desorption of antibiotics from three soils (Leptosol, Phaeozem, Vertisol) and a sediment (Endh reservoir) of the Mezquital Valley, Mexico, that were exposed to untreated wastewater in the past.
   We performed sequential batch desorption experiments with treated wastewater, artificial wastewater with anionic surfactants, and artificial wastewater without surfactants.
   We observed no desorption, but net sorption of ciprofloxacin in contact with treated wastewater containing 3.475 mu g L-1 of ciprofloxacin. Sulfamethoxazole was desorbed from the Leptosol, the Phaeozem, and the Vertisol in a similar degree with and without surfactant, but not from sediment, where no sulfamethoxazole was detected. In contact with treated wastewater containing 1.045 mu g L-1 of sulfamethoxazole, it was desorbed from the Leptosol and the Phaeozem with low clay, Fe oxide, and organic matter contents, whereas the Vertisol and sediment showed a net sulfamethoxazole sorption. Desorption could be described with a bi-phasic kinetic desorption model, with most sulfamethoxazole being desorbed via a rate-limited process from poorly accessible binding sites, where it had been accumulated during the long-term irrigation in the past.
   We conclude that a potential release of pharmaceuticals as a result from changes in wastewater irrigation is soil specific: Leptosols and Phaeozems of the Mezquital Valley might act as long-term sources of the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole, though not of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin.

AB In the present study, wastewater samples acquired from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), located in western India were characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy, and resin-based fractionation was conducted to fractionate DOM into hydrophobic and hydrophilic base, acid, and neutral fractions. Among several fractions, the hydrophilic acid (HIA) and hydrophilic neutral (HIN) fractions were present in higher abundance (more than 50% of DOC) compared to the hydrophilic base (HIB) fraction in both influent and effluent wastewater stream obtained from WWTPs. Tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances were also abundant in the influent and effluent stream of WWTPs. Further, LC-MS/MS analysis could identify 235 and 288 DOM proteins in the influent and effluent stream of WWTP-1, respectively. These proteins revealed varying percentage of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The tryptophan residues primarily contributed to protein-like fluorescence in wastewater. The proteins were further classified based on their role in biological processes, location in the cell, and molecular function. Among several proteins, Alzheimer's and Huntington disease biomarkers were identified at WWTP-1. Their presence in the surface water can serve as an early warning system for wastewater-based epidemiology.

AB In this study, the performance of activated sludge derived granular activated carbon (SGAC) was investigated for ciprofloxacin (CPX) removal from synthetic and simulated wastewaters in a fixed-bed adsorption column operated in continuous mode. The adsorbent was synthesized using chemical activation using ZnCl2 as activating agent. Its surface area and pore volume were found comparable to that of the commercial granular activated carbon (CGAC). The maximum saturation adsorption capacities for CPX were similar to 16 mg/g and similar to 14 mg/g, respectively, with SGAC column under identical operating conditions (CPX concentration = 50 mg/L, bed height = 4 cm and wastewater flow rate = 1.5 mL/min) for synthetic and simulated wastewaters. The presence of other organics reduced CPX adsorption capacity of SGAC. The breakthrough curve data for both wastewaters could be adequately fit in Thomas and Yoon-Nelson kinetic models. The addition of H2O2 in wastewater showed no considerable improvement in CPX removal. However, H2O2 oxidation of spent adsorbent exhibited better results compared to thermal treatment for adsorbent regeneration. The results showed that sewage sludge can be recycled as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from wastewater.

AB Wastewater contains a large range of biological and chemical markers of human activity and exposures. Through systematic collection and analysis of these markers within wastewater samples it is possible to measure the public health of whole populations. The analysis of effluent and biosolids can also be used to understand the release of chemicals from wastewater treatment plants into the environment. Wastewater analysis and comparison with catchment specific data (e.g. demographics) however remains largely unexplored. This manuscript describes a national wastewater monitoring study that combines influent, effluent and biosolids sampling with the Australian Census. An archiving program allows estimation of per capita exposure to and consumption of chemicals, public health information, as well as per capita release of chemicals into the environment. The paper discusses the study concept, critical steps in setting up a coordinated national approach and key logistical and other considerations with a focus on lessons learnt and future applications. The unique combination of archived samples, analytical data and associated census-derived population data will provide a baseline dataset that has wide and potentially increasing applications across many disciplines that include public health, epidemiology, criminology, toxicology and sociology.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of fifteen pharmaceuticals were investigated in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant in Michigan. Concentrations of these pharmaceuticals were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by a high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer. Detailed mass balance analysis was conducted during the whole treatment process to evaluate the contributing processes for pharmaceutical removal. Among the pharmaceuticals studied, demeclocycline, sulfamerazine, erythromycin and tylosin were not detected in the wastewater treatment plant influent. Other target pharmaceuticals detected in wastewater were also found in the corresponding sludge phase. The removal efficiencies of chlortetracycline, tetracycline, sulfamerazine, acetaminophen and caffeine were >99%, while doxycycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine and lincomycin exhibited relatively lower removal efficiencies (e.g., <50%). For sulfamethoxazole, the removal efficiency was approximately 90%. Carbamazepine manifested a net increase of mass, i.e. 41% more than the input from the influent. Based on the mass balance analysis, biotransformation is believed to be the predominant process responsible for the removal of pharmaceuticals (22% to 99%), whereas contribution of sorption to sludge was relatively insignificant (7%) for the investigated pharmaceuticals.

AB Although wastewater-derived chemical contaminants undergo transformation through a variety of mechanisms, the relative importance of processes such as biotransformation and photolysis is poorly understood under conditions representative of large rivers. To assess attenuation rates under conditions encountered in such systems, samples from the Trinity River were analyzed for a suite of wastewater-derived contaminants during a period when wastewater effluent accounted for nearly the entire flow of the river over a travel time of approximately 2 weeks. While the concentration of total adsorbable organic iodide, a surrogate for recalcitrant X-ray phase contrast media in wastewater, was approximately constant throughout the river, concentrations of ethylenediamine tetraacetate, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, metoprolol, and naproxen all decreased between 60% and 90% as the water flowed downstream. Comparison of attenuation rates estimated in the river with rates measured in laboratory-scale microcosms suggests that biotransformation was more important than photolysis for most of the compounds. Further evidence for biotransformation in the river was provided by measurements of the enantiomeric fraction of metoprolol, which showed a gradual decrease as the water moved downstream. Results of this study indicate that natural attenuation can result in significant decreases in concentrations of wastewater-derived contaminants in large rivers.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent used in many personal care and cleaning products. It has been detected in most environmental compartments and the main entry pathway is wastewater effluents and biosolids. TCS was analyzed in 300 samples of raw influent, final effluent, and biosolids from 13 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Canada representing five types of typical wastewater treatment systems. TCS was almost always detected in influent (median 1480 ng/L), effluent (median 107 ng/L), and biosolids (median 8000 ng/g dry weight) samples. Removals of TCS from lagoons as well as secondary and advanced treatment facilities were significantly higher than primary treatment facilities (p < 0.001). TCS removal was strongly correlated with organic nitrogen removal. TCS removals at most lagoons and plants that use biological treatment were higher during summer compared with winter. However, no seasonal or temperature effects were observed at the two primary facilities, likely due to the absence of biological activity. Aerobically digested solids contained the lowest levels (median 555 ng/g) while anaerobically digested primary solids contained the highest levels of TCS (median 22,700 ng/g). The results of this large comprehensive study demonstrate that TCS is consistently present in wastewater and biosolids at relatively high concentrations and that removal from wastewater and levels in biosolids are strongly influenced by the wastewater and solids treatment types.

AB The long-term effects on soil microorganisms from 40 years of irrigating soil with reclaimed wastewater was investigated by determining the quantity, composition, and inter-species connection of microorganisms. No significant difference in microbial quantity and composition were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. The dominant bacterial phylum in both irrigation water sources and soils was Proteobacteria, which commonly exists in soil. From the analysis of four (4) alpha diversity metrics, including the observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity, there was no significant difference between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. Three zones (shallow, medium and deep) were identified in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils based on the taxonomic networks and clusters generated by graphical lasso and random walk algorithm. The cluster profiles (shallow, medium and deep zones) appear to be different in the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils. Soil irrigated with reclaimed wastewater showed less depth of clustered profile in medium zone than that in soil irrigated with groundwater (20-60 cm of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil compared to 20-100 cm of groundwater-irrigated soil), although the significance of such a variance (the depth of medium zone of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated soil decreased 40 cm than that of groundwater-irrigated soil) is not clear at this time. Positive influence has been identified in the growth and yield of eggplant, tomato and cucumber between the reclaimed wastewater- and groundwater-irrigated soils, suggesting that reclaimed wastewater irrigation can potentially substitute groundwater irrigation, despite the variance in inter-species clustering profiles in soil microbes in certain soil zones. Nevertheless, the possible negative influence of pathogens, organic compounds and pharmaceuticals should be seriously considered during the reclaimed wastewater irrigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The concentrations of eighteen perfluorinated compounds (PFCs: C5-C14 carboxylates, C4, C6-C8 and C10 sulfonates and 3 sulfonamides) were determined in wastewater and sludge samples originating from two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (dissolved phase) or sonication followed by solid phase extraction (solid phase). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by LC-MS/MS. According to the results, perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were dominant in wastewater and sludge samples from both plants. The average concentrations in the raw and treated wastewater ranged up to 75.7 ng L-1 (perfluorotridecanoic acid, PFTrDA) and 76.0 ng L-1 (PFPeA), respectively. Concentrations of most PFCs were higher in effluents than in influents, indicating their formation during wastewater treatment processes. In sewage sludge, the average concentrations ranged up to 6.7 ng g(-1) dry weight (PFOS). No significant seasonal variations in PFCs concentrations were observed, while higher concentrations of PFOA, PFOS and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were determined in the WWTP receiving municipal and industrial wastewater. Significantly different distribution coefficient (K-d) values were determined for different PFCs and different type of sludge, ranging between 169 L kg(-1) (PFHxS) to 12,922 L kg(-1) (PFDA).

AB Quantitative criteria for selection of tracers for assessment of mixing of wastewater and pristine water are proposed and evaluated for leakage from a wastewater effluent recharge system to nearby pristine water wells and the dilution of the effluents in a reclamation well by pristine water from the surrounding aquifer. Two molecular tracers were compared: carbamazepine, an organic drug whose refractory behavior was evaluated on-site, and chloride, a widely used conservative tracer. The mixing ratios and the corresponding uncertainty levels in their calculation were evaluated using actual field data. Uncertainty level analysis illuminates the effects of the analytical errors in the determination of trace micropollutants on one hand and the high level of chloride in the background on the other. Uncertainty level calculations revealed that chloride is a somewhat better tracer for the estimation of the dilution of wastewater by flow from a pristine aquifer, whereas carbamazepine is a much better tracer for the calculation of wastewater contamination of nearby drinking water wells. Surprisingly, we show that even when carbamazepine degrades to a large and unknown extent, it can still be used to estimate accurately the probability that a site is contaminated by a wastewater stream.

AB There is a lack of knowledge in environmental pollution of the anthropogenic contaminants in wastewater and surface water. Several organic compounds merit special attention, because of their potential risk to the aquatic environment. Therefore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based screening analyses were performed in order to identify anthropogenic organic contaminants and to reveal information on the structural diversity of individual compounds and to characterize their environmental behavior. Wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants in Germany, representing various capacities, and surface water samples from corresponding receiving waters were analyzed. Numerous substances were identified in the samples. Several compounds were treated inadequately during wastewater treatment, and their identification in surface waters highlights their potential impact on the aquatic environment. Contaminants were selected according to available information about their environmental relevance (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential), their possible application or usage and their occurrence within the environment. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that non-target screening analyses be undertaken to identify the structural diversity of anthropogenic organic contaminants and that further investigations of specific anthropogenic compounds be undertaken as a high priority.

AB This study evaluates aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability and toxicity of a real pharmaceutical wastewater, which focuses on antibiotics production. Zahn-Wellens and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) methodologies were applied in order to verify the wastewater's biodegradability and Microtox (R) analysis was performed for toxicity tests. Tests achieved more than 89% and 63% of Total Organic Carbon reduction, showing 80% and 50% of antibiotic removal, for aerobic and anaerobic processes, respectively. Moreover, acute ecotoxicological tests revealed that both techniques decreased the toxic character of real pharmaceutical wastewater. Desorption tests showed that the antibiotic was not degraded, but, in fact, adsorbed onto the sludge. Since biological treatment is the most widely used method for industrial wastewater treatment, this study indicates that this kind of treatment is probably unable to mineralize antibiotics present in pharmaceutical wastewaters, which may induce the development of resistant pathogens. Therefore, efforts must be taken to elucidate the main mechanisms of biological antibiotic removal from wastewaters since the presence of antibiotics in the environment is considered to be an emerging environmental issue.

AB The hazardous chemical contamination of untreated wastewater and secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Zagreb, Croatia was comprehensively characterized using large-volume solid-phase extraction (SPE) and silica gel fractionation, followed by a detailed analysis of the resulting extracts by a combination of chemical and bioassay methods. Over 100 individual contaminants or closely related-contaminant groups were identified by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Ecotoxicity profiling of the investigated samples, including cytotoxicity, chronic toxicity and EROD activity; inhibition of the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR), genotoxicicity and estrogenic potential, revealed the most significant contribution of toxic compounds to be present in polar fractions. Wastewater treatment using conventional activated sludge process reduced the initial toxicity of raw wastewater to various extents, ranging from 28% for algal toxicity to 73.2% for an estrogenic activity. The most efficient toxicity removal was observed for the polar compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater contains large amounts of high concentration refractory organic intermediates, which have got potential hazards to human health and the environment. It has attracted great attention from the governments, the public and the researchers. In this context, understanding current state of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment research can help guide future research. A bibliometric analysis based on the science citation index expanded from web of science (WoS) was carried out to assess the research pattern and tendencies of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment from 1994 to 2013. Study emphases herein included performance of publication covering annual outputs, mainstream journals, WoS categories, leading countries, institutions, research tendencies and hotspots. The results showed that the annual output of related scientific articles had increased steadily, with approximately 88 % of all articles on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment during 1994-2013 published since 2003. Water research, chemosphere and environmental science and technology were the three most common journals in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment research. The United States takes the dominant position in this field, followed by Spain and Germany. A summary of the most frequently used keywords obtained from words in paper title analysis, author keyword analysis and keywords plus analysis provided the clues to discover current research emphases. The mainstream research related to pharmaceutical wastewater was on wastewater treatment methods and the related contaminants. Adsorption, ozonation and photocatalysis were common treatment techniques and are getting popular. The commonly researched pharmaceutical wastewater contaminants were carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and triclosan, which have emerged as the frequently studied contaminants in recent years.

AB This study assessed seasonal and regional trends of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) detected in monthly samples from two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, over the period of one year. Surface water of Charleston Harbor was also analyzed to examine environmental distribution in an estuarine ecosystem. Of the 19 compounds examined, 11 were quantified in wastewater influent, 9 in effluent, and 7 in surface water. Aqueous concentrations of many PPCPs were reduced by >86% in wastewater effluent compared with influent, though some compounds showed low removal and greater effluent concentrations compared with influent (e.g. estrone and fluoxetine). Differences in effluent concentrations and estimated removal between facilities were likely related to variations in the facilities' operating procedures. Surface water concentrations were generally reduced by >90% for those chemicals found in effluent. Additionally, there were seasonal trends that indicate reduced degradation in colder months in wastewater and surface water. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining PPCPs in the South Atlantic Bight. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants (ECs), including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), steroid hormones and pesticides, in municipal wastewater as well as in the aquatic environment has been an issue of concern from an environmental and human health point of view. These ECs have been found in municipal wastewater in the concentration range of several mu g/L. Considering the importance assumed by many of ECs, it is not possible to ban their usage. Therefore, it is essential to effectively remove these contaminants to protect the environment and drinking water resources. There is evidence that conventional treatment methods are not able to completely remove many ECs, therefore, advanced processes are demanded in order to degrade these ECs and protect both water environment and human health. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs), coupling biological degradation with membrane filtration, are one possible option due to the advantages that characterize this technology. The present chapter discusses the occurrence and fate of pesticides and hormones in wastewater and proposes a comparison between removal efficiency of conventional activated sludge treatments and MBRs, also defining common concentrations at which these ECs are found in wastewater.

AB Antimicrobial compounds are widely used in human and veterinary medicine to protect human and animal health, to prevent economic losses, and to help to ensure a safe food supply. After administration, the antibiotics and their transformant products (TPs) may pass through the sewage system and end up in the environment, mainly in the water bodies. Apart from antibiotics and their TPs, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which have been identified as emerging pollutants of concern, enter ecosystems with treated wastewater and livestock manure. In the environment altered by human activity, the occurrence of bacteria resistant to almost all known antibiotics has been confirmed. Despite being universally considered relatively important, land runoff, drainage and seepage are not the sites with the most striking occurrence of the transfer of resistance genes among different species of bacteria. The most significant hot-spots are wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Together with treated wastewater which is released from WWTPs, antibiotics, their TPs, ARB, and ARGs can penetrate the surface water, rural groundwater supplies, drinking water, soil, and plants growing in soil irrigated with contaminated water. It creates a direct risk to human and animal health because drugs, ARGs, and ARB transported to the environment can be transferred back to people and animals. The authors of this article aim to familiarize readers with the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance in Poland: its occurrence, ranges of antibiotic concentration, and the number of ARB and ARGs occurring in Polish surface waters as well as main sources of these contaminants.

AB The current study is aimed to introduce a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach for the first time on the African continent where substance abuse data is limited. The study included the quantification of several drugs of abuse (DOA) in raw wastewater samples. Quantification of urinary metabolites as drug target residues (DTR), as well as enantiomeric profiling of chiral DOA was performed to distinguish between consumption and direct disposal into sewage. Monitoring campaigns were undertaken at two South African wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) located within two provinces of the country. The presence of non-racemic 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine, as well as the metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BEG), confirmed their consumption within the areas investigated. Enantiomeric profiling further pointed to the abuse of methamphetamine as the primary DOA with use estimates calculated between 181.9 and 1184.8 mg "day i" 1000 inhabitants(-1). Population-normalised mass loads for MDMA and cocaine confirmed their status as secondary DOA within the study sites. Use estimates for the new psychoactive substance (NPS) mephedrone were performed for one WWTVV. The minor metabolite of heroin, 0-6-monoacetylmorphine (06-MAM), was also detected at one VVWT1N and served as a qualitative indicator for heroin abuse within the area. These findings provide a novel comparison of the WBE approach in a developing-country with other global studies, with the aim to strengthen this approach as a tool to inform drug prevention strategies in countries where substance abuse data is limited due to financial constraints and lack of government structures to facilitate conventional monitoring.

AB Due to the increase in pharmaceuticals and antibiotics in surface water and wastewater, it is giving a place for the bacteria to become antibiotic resistant to a particular antibiotic or to a group of antibiotics by the mutation of their genes. In this study, minimum inhibition concentrations correspond to 50% inhibition (IC50) of two bacteria, E. coli and S. aureus were tested. The bacteria were collected from surface water and wastewater at different locations of Kolkata and Howr ah. Among the fluoroquinolone antibiotics, the concentration value of ciprofloxacin has been detected in its highest contamination level, so the IC50 values of bacteria were tested against this antibiotic. While checking for the IC50 values for bacteria against ciprofloxacin, it was found that the E. coli and S. aureus isolated from wastewater and surface water were found to be 26 times and 30 times more resistance against pure E. coli and S. aureus. Along with this, bacteria present in wastewater was found to be more resistant than the bacteria found in surface water.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) can evade degradation in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and can be chronically discharged into the environment, causing concern for aquatic organisms, wildlife, and humans that may be exposed to these bioactive chemicals. The ability of a common STP process, conventional activated sludge (CAS), to remove PPCPs (caffeine, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, naproxen, 4-nonylphenol, tonalide, triclocarban and triclosan) from a synthetic wastewater was evaluated in the present study. The removal of individual PPCPs by the laboratory-scale CAS treatment plant ranged from 40 to 99.6%. While the efficiency of removal for some compounds was high, remaining quantities have the potential to affect aquatic organisms even at low concentrations. Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to influent recreated model wastewater with methanol (IM, solvent control) or with PPCP cocktail (IC), or CAS-treated effluent wastewater with methanol (EM, treated control) or with PPCP cocktail (EC). Alterations in hepatic gene expression (evaluated using a quantitative nuclease protection plex assay) and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) protein concentrations occurred in exposed fish. Although there was partial PPCP removal by CAS treatment, the 20% lower VTG transcript levels and 83% lower plasma VTG protein concentration found in EC-exposed fish compared to IC-exposed fish were not statistically significant. Thus, estrogenic activity found in the influent was retained in the effluent even though typical percent removal levels were achieved raising the issue that greater reduction in contaminant load is required to address hormone active agents.

AB In recent years, the occurrence of micropollutants (MPs) in sewage-, surface-, ground-and drinking water, and their removal processes are widely discussed. The content of various chemical organic/inorganic pollutants (pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, hormones, heavy metals etc.) has increased over the years. Most of these compounds are not eliminated or biotransformed in traditional wastewater treatment plants. Several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of resistant micropollutants from water sources have been studied. Ferrate (VI) has aroused interest as an alternative oxidizing agent in drinking water pre-oxidation treatment. Electrochemically prepared potassium ferrate was used to remove the studied organic micropollutants. The effect of ferrate on two widely occurring organic micropollutants in water sources, carbamazepine and caffeine, was investigated. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for sample analysis.

The sorption of four PhACs (carbamazepine, diclofenac, iopromide and venlafaxine) by 6 different fungi was first evaluated in batch experiments. Concentrations of PhACs in both liquid and solid (biomass) matrices from the fungal treatment were measured. Contribution of the sorption to the total removal of pollutants ranged between 3% and 13% in relation to the initial amount. The sorption of 47 PhACs in fungi was also evaluated in a fungal treatment performed in 26 days in a continuous bioreactor treating wastewater from a veterinary hospital. PhACs levels measured in the fungal biomass were similar to those detected in conventional wastewater treatment (WWTP) sludge. This may suggest the necessity of manage fungal biomass as waste in the same manner that the WWTP sludge is managed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pulse electro-coagulation (PE) technology was applied to the treatment of refractory berberine hydrochloride (BH) wastewater. It showed that with Fe electrode the removal efficiencies of pollutants were significantly higher than that with Al electrode. By using Fe electrode and simulated wastewater, the effects of pulse duty cycle, current density, pulse frequency, electrode distance and electrolysis time on the removal efficiencies of BH and COD were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of reaction time of 3.5 h, pulse duty cycle of 0.3, pulse frequency of 1.0 kHz, current density of 19.44 mA/cm(2), and electrode distance of 2.0 cm, the removal efficiencies of BH and COD reached 72.8% and 69.6%, respectively. The raw BH wastewater was then treated with PE process, and 90.1% BH and 62.6% COD could be removed. Finally, the energy costs of PE and traditional electro-coagulation (EC) were compared and it showed that PE saved 90% energy than EC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pilot-scale tests were run with ozonation for reduction of 24 pharmaceuticals at 10 full-scale wastewater treatment plants in southern Sweden. Reduction was evaluated based on doses of 3, 5 and 7 g O-3/m(3) at all plants. The reduction of pharmaceuticals reached on average 65% at 3 g O-3/m(3), 78% at 5 g O-3/m(3) and 88% for 7 g O-3/m(3) in terms of total concentration of pharmaceuticals. Specific ozone dose (ratio O-3: TOC) was found to be highly influential on pharmaceutical removal. At two WWTPs, the pharmaceutical removal was severely reduced.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior of eight fluoroquinolones (FQs) on aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic sludge, under different adsorpiton time, pH, and temperature conditions. Results indicated that adsorption of FQs onto all sludge was a physical sorption process. The relationship of the partitioning coefficient (K-d) and the octanol/water partition coefficient ( K-ow) for each FQ was established. The adsorbed fraction of FQs on sludge could then be predicted with the K-d. It was calculated that about 50-72% of the FQs were adsorbed on the sludge. Therefore, the adsorption effect must be considered when studying the fate and occurrence of FQs in wastewater treatment systems.

AB We measured 25 pharmaceuticals in ten municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), one hospital WWTP and five rivers in Korea. In the municipal WWTP influents, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine showed relatively high concentrations. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater seems to be influenced by production and consumption of pharmaceuticals. The hospital WWTP influent showed higher total concentrations of pharmaceuticals than the municipal WWTPs, and caffeine, ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen were dominant. In the rivers, caffeine was dominant, and the distribution of pharmaceuticals was related to the inflow of the wastewater. In the municipal WWTPs, the concentrations of acetaminophen, caffeine, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and gemfibrozil decreased by over 99%. The decrease of these pharmaceuticals occurred mainly during the biological processes. In the physico-chemical processes, the decrease of pharmaceuticals was insignificant except for some cases. In the hospital WWTP, ciprofloxacin, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen and carbamazepine showed the decrease rates of over 80%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation is foreseen as a possible strategy to mitigate the pressure on water resources in dry regions. However, there is the risk of potential accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the edaphic environment, their percolation and consequently contamination of aquifers. In the present study, we measured the levels of a wide range of commonly used pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in sewage from a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in soils irrigated with treated wastewater. Analysis of target compounds showed total concentrations between 73 and 372 mu g L-1 in WWTP influents, and from 3 to 41 mu g L-1 in effluents. The total concentrations of PhACs detected in surface soil samples were in the range of 2 and 15 ng g(-1), with predominance of analgesics and anti-inflammatories (maximum concentration = 10.05 ng g(-1)), followed by antibiotics and psychiatric drugs (maximum concentration = 5.45 ng g(-1) and 3.78 ng g(-1), respectively). Both effluent samples and irrigated soils shared similar compositional patterns, with compounds such as hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac being predominant. Additionally, PhAC5 were also detected in soil samples at a depth of 150 cm, indicating that these chemical undergo leaching associated with heavy rain episodes. Their occurrence in soils was affected by temperature too, as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months (up to 14 ng g(-1)), indicating higher persistence at lower temperatures. Finally, the ecotoxicological risk of PhAC5 in soil was evaluated by calculating their risk quotients (RQs). The risk was very low as RQ values ranged between <0.01 and 0.07. However, this initial assessment could be improved by future works on toxicity using specific terrestrial organisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are thought to be a "seedbed" and reservoirs for multi-antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria which can be transmitted to the air environment through aeration. We quantified airborne multi-antibiotic resistance in a full-scale plant to treat antibiotics-producing wastewater by collecting bioaerosol samples from December 2014 to July 2015. Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (GNOPB) were isolated, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against 18 commonly used antibiotics, including 11 beta-lactam antibiotics, 3 aminoglycosides, 2 fluoroquinolones, 1 furan and 1 sulfonamide, were conducted. More than 45% of airborne bacteria isolated from the pharmaceutical WWTP were resistant to three or more antibiotics, and some opportunistic pathogenic strains were resistant to 16 antibiotics, whereas 45.3% and 50.3% of the strains isolated from residential community and municipal WWTP showed resistance to three or more antibiotics. The calculation of the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index demonstrated that the air environment in the pharmaceutical WWTP was highly impacted by antibiotic resistance, while the residential community and municipal WWTP was less impacted by antibiotic resistance. In addition, we determined that the dominant genera of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria isolated from all bioaerosol samples were Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Kiebsieiia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas. Collectively, these results indicate the proliferations and spread of antibiotic resistance through bioaerosols in WWTP treating cephalosporin-producing wastewater, which imposed a potential health risk for the staff and residents in the neighborhood, calling for administrative measures to minimize the air-transmission hazard.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a rapidly expanding field that can provide information on illicit drug usage in communities, based on the measured concentrations in samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, select illicit drugs (six drugs and eight metabolites) were determined on a daily basis for a week in wastewater, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge from two WWTPs in the Albany area in New York State. The WWTP that served a larger population (similar to 100 000, with a flow rate of 83 300 m(3)/d) showed 3.2 (methadone) to 51 (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; MBA) times higher mass flows of illicit drugs than did the WWTP that served a smaller population (similar to 15 000, with a flow rate of 6850 m(3)/d). The consumption rate of target illicit drugs in the communities served by the two WWTPs was estimated to range from 1.67 to 3510 mg/d/1000 people. Between the dissolved and particulate phases, the fraction of methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), amphetamine, and MDA sorbed to SPM ranged from 34.3% to 41.1% of the total mass in the waste stream. The removal efficiencies of illicit drugs from the two WWTPs ranged from 4% (norcocaine) to 99% (cocaine); however, methamphetamine, methadone, and EDDP showed a negative removal in WWTPs. The environmental emission of illicit drugs from WWTP discharges was calculated to range from 0.38 (MDEA) to 67.5 (EDDP) mg/d/1000 people. Other markers such as caffeine, paraxanthine, nicotine, and cotinine were found to predict the concentrations of select illicit drugs in raw wastewater (r(2) = 0.20-0.79; p <= 0.029).

AB Every day more than 500 million cubic meters of treated wastewater are discharged into rivers, estuaries, and oceans, an amount slightly less than the average flow of the Danube River. Typically, wastewaters have high organic carbon [OC) concentrations and represent a large fraction of total river flow and a higher fraction of river OC in densely populated watersheds. Here, we report the first direct measurements of radiocarbon (C-14) in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. The radiocarbon ages of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC) in effluent are old and relatively uniform across a range of WWTPs in New York and Connecticut. Wastewater DOC has a mean radiocarbon age of 1630 +/- 500 years B.P. and a mean delta C-13 of -26.0 +/- 1 parts per thousand. Mass balance calculations indicate that 25% of wastewater DOC is fossil carbon, which is likely derived from petroleum-based household products such as detergents and pharmaceuticals. These findings warrant reevaluation of the "apparent age" of riverine DOC, the total flux of petroleum carbon to U.S. oceans, and OC source assignments in waters impacted by sewage.

AB Antibiotics and antidepressants are among the most successful drugs used for human therapy. Their concentration in influent on WWTP is relative high and there can be removed by biodegradation or sorption. The aim of this study was to define the amounts of sorbed pharmaceuticals on digested sludge from WWTP Bratislava Petrzalka. The amounts of sorbed pharmaceuticals were calculated from knowing partition coefficients for selected pharmaceuticals and from analytically measured pharmaceutical's concentrations in sludge liquor. From this calculation were estimated the one-year sorbed amount of pharmaceutical onto sludge from wastewater treatment plant Petrzalka (26,066 g/y for ciprofloxacin, 756 g/y for azithromycin, 647 g/y for clarithromycin, 445 g/y for venlafaxine and 148 g/y for citalopram).

AB This paper presents, for the first time, community-wide estimation of drug and pharmaceuticals consumption in England using wastewater analysis and a large number of compounds. Among groups of compounds studied were: stimulants, hallucinogens and their metabolites, opioids, morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and others. Obtained results showed the usefulness of wastewater analysis in order to provide estimates of local community drug consumption. It is noticeable that where target compounds could be compared to NHS prescription statistics, good comparisons were apparent between the two sets of data. These compounds include oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, methadone, tramadol, temazepam and diazepam. Whereas, discrepancies were observed for propoxyphene, codeine, dosulepin and venlafaxine (over-estimations in each case except codeine). Potential reasons for discrepancies include: sales of drugs sold without prescription and not included within NHS data, abuse of a drug with the compound trafficked through illegal sources, different consumption patterns in different areas, direct disposal leading to over estimations when using parent compound as the drug target residue and excretion factors not being representative of the local community. It is noticeable that using a metabolite (and not a parent drug) as a biomarker leads to higher certainty of obtained estimates. With regard to illicit drugs, consistent and logical results were reported. Monitoring of these compounds over a one week period highlighted the expected recreational use of many of these drugs (e.g. cocaine and MDMA) and the more consistent use of others (e.g. methadone).

AB Micropollutants as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) or pharmaceuticals are of increased interest in water pollution control. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are relevant point sources for residues of these compounds in the aquatic environment. The solids retention time (SRT) is one important parameter for the design of WWTPs, relating to growth rate of microorganisms and to effluent concentrations. If a specific substance is degraded in dependency on the SRT, a critical value for the sludge age can be determined. In WWTPs operating SRTs below this critical value, effluent concentrations in the range of influent concentrations or a distribution according to the adsorption equilibrium have to be expected, whereas in WWTPs operating at SRTs higher than the critical value degradation will occur. Critical SRTs were determined for different micropollutants, indicating that the design criteria based on the sludge age allows an estimation of emissions. Different treatment technologies as conventional activated sludge systems and a membrane bioreactor were considered and no significant differences in the treatment efficiency were detected when operated at comparable SRT. The results of the investigations lead to the conclusion that low effluent concentrations can be achieved in WWTPs operating SRTs higher than 10 days (referred to a temperature of 10degreesC). This corresponds to the requirements for WWTPs situated in sensitive areas according to the urban wastewater directive of the European Community (91/271/EEC) in moderate climatic zones.

AB A pilot study for the qualitative detection of methamphetamine at sites within a sewage collection system adjacent to locations suspected to harbor illegal drug activities was investigated and preliminary findings are reported. Sewage samples were collected over a time interval of four weeks using a Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) deployed directly into the sewer line. The POCIS sorbent was extracted and analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Methamphetamine was found in sewage from one of three sampling sites at a concentration greater than the HPLC-MS/MS method detection limit (MDL) of 3 ng/mL. The goal of this research was to establish proof-of-concept of the feasibility for sampling and analysis using POCIS devices in the sewage collection system. The data encourage further testing and research. The ability to pinpoint the presence of methamphetamine in the sewer may in the future be used as a forensic tool in law enforcement.

AB The distribution coefficient (K-d) and the organic carbon distribution coefficient (K-oc) were determined for four Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs) to three different types of sludge taken from a conventional Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Batch experiments were performed in six different environmental relevant concentrations (200 ng L-1 to 5 mu g L-1) containing 1 g L-1 sludge. K-d values ranged from 330 to 6015, 329 to 17432 and 162 to 11 770 L kg(-1) for primary, secondary and digested sludge, respectively.
   The effects of solution's pH, ionic strength and cation types on PFCs sorption were also evaluated. Sorption capacities of PFCs significantly decreased with increased pH values from 6 to 8. Furthermore, the divalent cation (Ca2+) enhanced PFCs sorption to a higher degree in comparison with the monovalent cation (Na+) at the same ionic strength.
   The obtained K-d values were applied to estimate the sorbed fractions of each PFC in different stages of a typical STP and to calculate their removal through treated wastewater and sludge. In primary settling tank, the predicted sorbed fractions ranged from 3% for Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) to 55% for Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), while in activated sludge tank and anaerobic digester sorption was more than 50% for all target compounds. Almost 86% of initial PFOA load is expected to be detected in treated wastewater; while Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), PFUdA and Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) can be significantly removed (>49%) via sorption to primary and excess secondary sludge. In anaerobic digester, the major part (>76%) of target PFCs is expected to be sorbed to sludge, while almost 3% of initial PFOA load will be detected in sludge leachates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A standardized protocol is demonstrated for bioluminescent strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYES, BLYAS and BLYR as high-throughput screening tools to monitor the estrogenic, androgenic and toxic potencies in wastewater. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay in wastewater monitoring was evaluated for 7 day semi-continuous batch reactor using activated sludge with hormones spiked raw sewage. Yeast bioluminescent assay successfully captured the rapid removal of estrogenic and androgenic activities in the bioreactors, and demonstrated rapid response (a parts per thousand currency sign4 h) with good reproducibility. This standardized protocol was then applied in a 12 months monitoring of the effluent of a WWTP located at Powell, TN, USA featuring parallel-operated full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) and traditional activated sludge (TAS) treatment. Monitoring results showed that estrogenic activity was persistent in all TAS and most MBR effluent samples, while residual androgenic activity was non-detectable throughout the monitored period. The estrogenic equivalents (EEQ) in TAS effluent ranged from 21.61 ng/L to 0.04 pg/L and averaged 3.25 ng/L. The EEQ in MBR effluent ranged from 2.88 ng/L to 0.0134 pg/L and averaged similar to 10 fold less (0.32 ng/L) than TAS. Despite the large temporal variation, MBR effluent EEQ was consistently lower than TAS on any given sampling date. Most MBR effluent samples also exhibited less cytotoxicity than TAS. Further analysis did not demonstrate significant correlation between effluent EEQ level and WWTP operational parameters including MLSS, SRT, HRT and BOD.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including antibiotics, hormones, and several other miscellaneous pharmaceuticals (analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics, antihypertensives, antiseptics, and stimulants) were investigated in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Ulsan, the largest industrial city of Korea. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that acetaminophen, atenolol and lincomycin were the main individual pollutants usually found in concentrations over 10 mu g/L in the sewage influent. In the WWTPs, the concentrations of analgesic acetaminophen, stimulant caffeine, hormones estriol and estradiol decreased by over 99%. On the contrary, the antibiotic sulfamethazine, the antihypertensive metoprolol, and the antiepileptic carbamazepine exhibited removal efficiencies below 30%. Particularly, removal of antibiotics was observed to vary between -11.2 and 69%. In the primary treatment (physicochemical processes), the removal of pharmaceuticals was insignificant (up to 28%) and removal of majority of the pharmaceuticals occurred during the secondary treatment (biological processes). The compounds lincomycin, carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol, and triclosan showed better removal in WWTPs employing modified activated sludge process with co-existence of anoxic-oxic condition. Further investigation into the design and operational aspects of the biological processes is warranted for the efficient removal of PPCPs, particularly antibiotics, to secure healthy water resource in the receiving downstream, thereby ensuring a sustainable water cycle management.

AB The main objective of the current study was to estimate the potential environmental risks associated with human consumption of antimicrobials in Greece. Consumption data was collected for the 24 most often used antimicrobials for the years 2008-2010, and their predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in raw and treated wastewater were calculated using mass balances and literature data on human excretion and elimination efficiency during wastewater treatment. The ecotoxicological risk was estimated by calculating the ratio of PEC to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for three categories of aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids, and fish). PNEC values were calculated based on experimental ecotoxicity data and data originated from the Ecological Structure Activity Relationship (ECOSAR). PEC values in raw sewage ranged between 0.02 mu g L-1 (erythromycin) and 27 mu g L-1 (amoxicillin), while in treated wastewater, the highest concentration was predicted for cefuroxime axetil (6.6 mu g L-1). Based on acute toxicity data for algae, risk quotient (RQ) values higher than 1 were obtained for 7 out of the 24 target antimicrobials in raw and treated wastewater, while no significant risk was estimated for daphnids and fish. Regarding the possible risk due to the chronic toxicity of antimicrobials, RQ values higher than 80 were obtained for amoxicillin and clarithromycin in algae. The use of baseline toxicity data from ECOSAR showed that the environmental risk from exposure to mixtures of antimicrobials was low for all three aquatic species. However, further studies on toxicity of mixtures should be performed as calculation of toxicity ratio (TR) values showed that 90 % of the target antimicrobials seem to exhibit a specific mode of toxic action when present in mixtures rather than baseline toxicity. As a result, an underestimation of toxicity based on the ECOSAR model is possible for the mixture of target antimicrobials. For Greek rivers where low (dilution factor, D < 10) and medium (D = 10-100) dilution of wastewater occurs, moderate to high risk is expected due to the existence of individual antimicrobials such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and levofloxacin in discharged treated wastewater.

AB The distribution of Triclosan within the Hudson River Estuary can be explained by a balance among the overall effluent inputs from municipal sewage treatment facilities, dilution of Triclosan concentrations in the water column with freshwater and seawater inputs, removal of Triclosan from the water column by adsorption to particles, and loss to photodegradation. This study shows that an average water column concentration of 3 +/- 2 ng/l (in the lower Hudson River Estuary) is consistent with an estimate for dilution of average wastewater concentrations with seawater and calculated rates of adsorption of Triclosan to particles. An average Triclosan sediment concentration of 26 +/- 11 ng/g would be in equilibrium with the overlying water column if Triclosan has a particle-to-water partitioning coefficient of k(d) similar to 10(4), consistent with laboratory estimates.

AB Three organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) were evaluated in theory and practice for their potential to trace sewage-derived microbial contaminants in surface waters. The underlying hypothesis was that hydrophobic OWCs outperform caffeine as a chemical tracer, due to their sorptive association with suspended microorganisms representing particulate organic carbon (POC). Modeling from first principles lab initio) of OWC sorption to POC under environmental conditions suggested an increasing predictive power: caffeine (0.2% sorbed) < triclosan (9-60%; pH 6-9) < triclocarban (76%). Empirical evidence was obtained via analysis of surface water from three watersheds in a rural-to-urban gradient in Baltimore, MD. Mass spectrometric OWC detections were correlated to microbial plate counts for 40 monitoring sites along 14 streams, including multiple chronic sewage release sites and the local wastewater treatment plant. Consistent with ab initio calculations, correlation analyses of 104 observations for fecal coliforms, enterococci, and Escherichia coli in natural surface waters showed that the particle-active antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban (R-2 range, 0.45-0.55) were indeed superior to caffeine (0.16-0.37) for tracking of microbial indicators. It is concluded that chemical monitoring of microbial risks is more effective when using hydrophobic OWCs such as triclosan and triclocarban in place of, or in conjunction with, the traditional marker caffeine.

AB Artificial sweeteners (ASs), as a new emerging pollutant, the fate from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to sea is growing concerned. In this study, the distribution and polluted loading of six typical ASs were analyzed based on the measurement in influent, primary effluent, secondary effluent, tertiary effluent, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge from four WWTPs and receiving waters near the coast of Shenzhen city, China. Elevated levels of ASs were detected in WWTPs located near a highly populated area (about 14,000 people km-2). Sucralose was predominant in all water samples (0.1-22.2 mu g L-1), and had a 1.6-704.0 times higher concentration than the means of other ASs detected. Aspartame were mainly distributed in SPM and sludge, and the fractions in offshore water exceeded 45%. Acesulfame, sucralose, cyclamate and saccharin could be effectively removed by secondary biochemical treatment. The average daily loading (4.2 g d-1 1000people-1) and discharge loading (0.4 g d-1 1000people-1) of sucralose in WWTPs was higher than those of the other ASs. Dissolved organic carbon and UV254 can affect the fate of ASs, and SPM mainly affects the distributions of aspartame and neotame. As a potential sewage indicator, neotame deserves further attention.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen which forms during chloramination of wastewater-impacted drinking waters. Municipal wastewater effluents are considered as major sources of NDMA precursors affecting downstream water quality. To evaluate the deactivation mechanisms and effi-ciencies of NDMA precursors during secondary treatment with the activated sludge (AS) process, NDMA formation potentials (FPs) of selected model precursor compounds and sewage components (i.e., black waters and greywaters) were monitored in batch AS treatment tests. After 24-h incubation with four different types of AS (i.e., domestic rural, domestic urban, textile and lab-grown AS), NDMA FP of trimethylamine (TMA) and minocycline (MNCL) decreased by 77-100%, while there was only 29-46% reduction in NDMA FP of sumatriptan (SMTR). The reduction in NDMA FP associated with ranitidine (RNTD) varied between 34% and 87%. The decrease in NDMA FP of RNTD depended on the AS type, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solids retention time (SRT). The domestic AS (rural and urban) achieved higher decreases in NDMA FPs of the tested model precursors than the textile AS or lab-grown AS. Increasing the HRT or SRT enhanced NDMA FP decrease for RNTD. Among different processes tested (i.e., biodegradation, biosorption and volatilization), biosorption was the major mechanism responsible for the NDMA FP decrease of RNTD, MNCL and SMTR, while biodegradation was the major NDMA FP reduction mechanism for TMA. The reduction in NDMA FP of RNTD via biodegradation depended on the AS activity which may vary with sampling seasons and SRT. NDMA FPs in all tested sewage components (i.e., blackwaters and greywaters) decreased after 24-h AS treatment. Urine in blackwater was the predominant (i.e., > 90%) contributor to NDMA FP in domestic sewage and AS-treated effluents. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is barely studied in India despite being one of the largest global producers and consumers of pharmaceuticals. In this study, 29 pharmaceuticals and six metabolites were determined in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Udupi (STPu: population served similar to 150,000) and Mangalore (STPM: population served similar to 450,000); the measured mean concentrations ranged from 12 to 61,000 ng/L and 5.0 to 31,000 ng/L, respectively. Atorvastatin (the most prescribed antihypercholesterolemic in India), mefenamic acid, and paraxanthine were found for the first time in wastewater in India at the mean concentrations of 395 ng/L, 1100 ng/L, and 13,000 ng/L, respectively. Select pharmaceutical metabolites (norverapamil and clopidogrel carboxylic acid) were found at concentrations of upto 7 times higher than their parent drugs in wastewater influent and effluent. This is the first study in India to report mass loading and emission of PPCPs and their select metabolites in STPs. The total mass load of all PPCPs analyzed in this study at STPU (4.97 g/d/1000 inhabitants) was 3.6 times higher than calculated for STPM. Select recalcitrant PPCPs (carbamazepine, diazepam, and clopidogrel) were found to have negative or no removal from STPU while additional treatment with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor at STPM removed (up to 95%) these PPCPs from STPM. Overall, 5.1 kg of caffeine, 4.1 kg of atenolol, 2.7 kg of ibuprofen, and 1.9 kg of triclocarban were discharged annually from STPU.

AB The occurrence of cashmerane (DPMI), celestolide, phantolide, traesolide (ATII), galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) in sewage and surface waters and their fate during wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion is investigated. AHTN and HHCB are the most important representatives and influent concentrations of 0.41-1.8 and 0.9-13 mu g L(-1) are observed. DPMI is detected in influent and effluent samples but in notably lower concentrations than AHTN and HHCB. Major sources of polycyclic musks are households, whereas industrial emitters seem to be of minor importance. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of selected industrial wastewaters (metal, textile and paper industry). Specific emissions of 0.36 +/- 0.19 and 1.6 +/- 1.0 mg cap(-1) d(-1) for AHTN and HHCB are calculated. Overall removal efficiencies between approx 50% and more than 95% are observed during biological wastewater treatment and removal with the excess sludge is the major removal pathway. Log K(D) values of 3.73-4.3 for AHTN, 3.87-4.34 for HHCB and 2.42-3.22 for DPMI are observed in secondary sludge. During sludge digestion no or only slight removal occurred. Mean polycyclic musk concentrations in digested sludge amounted to 1.9 +/- 0.9 (AHTN), 14.2 +/- 5.8 (HHCB), 0.8 +/- 0.4 (ATII) and 0.2 +/- 0.09 (DPMI) mg kg(-1) dry matter. In the receiving water systems a comparable distribution as during wastewater treatment is observed. AHTN, HHCB and DPMI are detected in surface waters (ND (not detected) - <0.04, ND - 0.32 and ND - 0.02 mu g L(-1)) as well as AHTN and HHCB in sediments (ND - 20, ND - 120 mu g kg(-1)). For HHCB an apparent K(OC) value of 4.1-4.4 is calculated for sediments. Major source for polycyclic musks in surface waters are discharges from wastewater treatment plants. For HHCB and DPMI 100% of the load observed in the sampled surface waters derive from discharges of treated wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as well as BOD5, TSS and NH4+ were evaluated for the first time in thirteen onsite household secondary wastewater treatment systems, including two compact biofilters followed by Filtralite-P filter units, two biological sand filters, five horizontal subsurface flow and four vertical flow constructed wetlands. As expected, all systems removed TSS and BOD5 efficiently (>95% removal). The PPCP removal efficiencies exceeded 80% with the exception of carbamazepine, diclofenac and ketoprofen because of their more recalcitrant characteristics. Despite no statistical differences in the PPCP removal were observed between the different systems evaluated, the vegetated vertical flow constructed wetlands which had unsaturated flow and hence better oxygenation, appeared consistently to perform better in terms of PPCP removal efficiency. The combined effects of vegetation and unsaturated water flow provide a higher tolerance to variations in loading rate and a consistent removal rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concern over the occurrence of artificial sweeteners (ASWs) as well as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment is growing, due to their high use and potential adverse effects on non-target organisms. The data for this study are drawn from a nationwide survey of ASWs in sewage sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that receive domestic (WWTPD), industrial (WWTP1), or mixed (domestic plus industrial; WWTPM) wastewaters in Korea. Five ASWs (concentrations ranged from 7.08 to 5220 ng/g dry weight [dw]) and ten PPCPs (4.95-6930 ng/g dw) were determined in sludge. Aspartame (concentrations ranged from 28.4 to 5220 ng/g dw) was determined for the first time in sewage sludge. The median concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge from domestic WWTPs were 0.8-2.5 and 1.0-3.4 times, respectively, the concentrations found in WWI'Ps that receive combined domestic and industrial wastewaters. Among the five ASWs analyzed, the median environmental emission rates of aspartame through domestic WWTPs (both sludge and effluent discharges combined) were calculated to be 417 mu g/capita/day, followed by sucralose (117 mu g/capita/day), acesulfame (90 pg/capita/day), and saccharin (66 pg/capita/day). The per-capita emission rates of select PPCPs, such as antimicrobials (tridocarban: 158 pg/capita/day) and analgesics (acetaminophen: 59 mu g/capita/day), were an order of magnitude higher than those calculated for antimycotic (miconazole) and anthelmintic (thiabendazole) drugs analyzed in this study. Multiple linear regression analysis of measured concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge revealed that several WWTP parameters, such as treatment capacity, population-served, sludge production rate, and hydraulic retention time could influence the concentrations found in sludge.

AB Estradiol is known as the indicator of the presence of hormones as Endocrine Disruptor Compounds (EDCs) in water and wastewater. The entrance of these compounds into water resources through daily liquid wastes of societies as well as pharmaceutical industries, ranching, and pathology laboratories leads to an increase in their concentrations in these resources. Consequently, due to the metabolic properties of these substances they can cause adverse effects on consumers and aquatics. The main purpose of this research is to determine the occurrence and the fate of estradiol as indicator of endocrine-disrupting compounds in drinking water, surface water, and wastewater in Ahvaz, Iran. 17 beta-estradiol was detected in 37.5% of samples obtained from drinking water and 68.75% of samples from the Karun River. In the urban drinking water and Karun River, the mean concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol were 2.96 and 13.66 ng l(-1), respectively.
   In the domestic and industrial wastewater, the concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol were higher than that detected in the drinking and surface waters. The mean concentrations of this hormone in these wastewaters were 57.46 and 70.6 ng l(-1), respectively. The highest amount of 17 beta-estradiol was measured in the hospital wastewater. The fate of 17 beta-estradiol in the slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plant, in which a septic tank, an anaerobic pond, and an aerobic tank were used for wastewater treatment, was higher than 75%. The highest level of removal in the aerobic stage was also obtained by breaking estradiol down to other metabolites.

AB The occurrence and fate of eight pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) during sewage treatment has been studied in a pilot-scale treatment plant, comprising a primary settler (2.85 m(3)), an aeration tank (1.845 m(3)) and a secondary clarifier (0.5 m(3)), placed on site at a wastewater treatment works in the north west of the UK. It was fed both with raw sewage and the return liquor produced after sludge centrifugation, thus representing the most common configuration for a municipal sewage treatment plant based on the activated sludge process. Samples were taken at six different locations, including the return liquor stream, and analysed for musk fragrances and pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to various therapeutic groups such as anti-inflammatory drugs, tranquillisers and antiepileptics. Mass balances were conducted for those PPCPs that were quantifiable. The fate of the PPCPs was found to differ according to their physical-chemical characteristics. Anti-inflammatories underwent a degradation process and were almost completely removed from sewage during the biological treatment step. Musk fragrances were only partially removed, through adsorption onto the primary suspended solids and the biomass in the aerobic process, due to their strong lipophilic characteristics. The results of this study provide increasing evidence that the partial removal of these substances through the sewage treatment process contribute to the environmental occurrence of PPCPs. Consequently, existing STPs should be upgraded in order to attenuate the release of these substances into the aquatic environment.

AB Concentrations of pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, were studied in the aqueous and solid phase of municipal sewage sludge, collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in central Finland. The samples included untreated municipal sludge from the biological wastewater treatment, digested sludge and sludge before and after composting. First, samples were taken as grab samples to study the bioavailable part in aqueous phase but also the part in solid fraction. Later, the long-term concentrations were studied by passive sampling with styrene divinylbenzene-reverse phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS) disks. In the untreated solid sludge, the concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen were 0.5 ng g(-1), 26 ng g(-1), 29 ng g(-1), 250 ng g(-1), and 13 ng g(-1), while in liquid phase they were 5.6 ng L-1, 200 ng L-1, 210 ng L-1, 35 ng L-1, and 55 ng L-1, respectively. Concentrations decreased with the treatment steps but substantial amounts still occured even after the final stage. The results show that current sludge treatment cannot fully remove pharmaceuticals, leaving varying concentrations after each stage. Additionally, the results suggest that SDB-RPS disks are suitable for sampling and quantification of the bioavailable fraction of pharmaceuticals in municipal sludge.

AB The eicosapentaenoic acid rich marine eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis oceanica was grown in wastewaters sampled from four different industries (i.e. pesticides industry, pharmaceutical industry, activated sludge treatment plant of municipality sewage and petroleum (oil) industry). Under the wastewater based growth conditions used in this study, the biomass productivity ranged from 21.78 +/- 0.87 to 27.78 +/- 0.22 mg L (1) d (1) in relation to freeze dried biomass, while the lipid productivity varied between 5.59 +/- 0.02 and 6.81 +/- 0.04 mg L (1) d (1). Although comparatively higher biomass, lipid and EPA productivity was observed in Conway medium, the % EPA content was similarly observed in pesticides industry and municipal effluents. The results highlight the possibility of selectively using wastewater as a growth medium, demonstrating the elevated eicosapentaenoic acid content and biodiesel properties, that complies with the European standards for biodiesel.

AB This study examined the performance of 16 wastewater treatment works to provide an overview of trace substance removal in relation to meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WED). Collection and analysis of over 2400 samples including sewage influent, process samples at different stages in the treatment process and final effluent has provided data on the performance of current wastewater treatment processes and made it possible to evaluate the need for improved effluent quality. Results for 55 substances, including metals, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals are reported. Data for sanitary parameters are also provided. A wide range of removal efficiencies was observed. Removal was not clearly related to the generic process type, indicating that other operational factors tend to be important. Nonetheless, removals for many substances of current concern were high. Despite this, current proposals for stringent water quality standards mean that further improvements in effluent quality are likely to be required. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage samples from 4 hospitals, 1 nursery, 1 slaughter house, 1 wastewater treatment plant and 5 source water samples of Chongqing region of Three Gorge Reservoir were analyzed for macrolide, lincosamide, trimethoprim, fluorouinolone, sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics by online solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that the concentration of ofloxacin (OFX) in hospital was the highest among all water environments ranged from 1.660 mu g/L to 4.240 mu g/L and norfloxacin (NOR, 0.136-1.620 mu g/L), ciproflaxacin (CIP, ranged from 0.011 mu g/L to 0.136 mu g/L), trimethoprim (IMP, 0.061-0.174 mu g/L) were commonly detected. Removal range of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant was 18-100% and the removal ratio of tylosin, oxytetracycline and tetracycline were 100%. Relatively higher removal efficiencies were observed for tylosin (TYL), oxytetracycline (OXY) and tetracycline (TET)(100%), while lower removal efficiencies were observed for Trimethoprim (IMP, 1%), Epi-iso-chlorotetracycline (EICIC, 18%) and Erythromycin-H2O (ERY-H2O, 24%). Antibiotics were removed more efficiently in primary treatment compared with those in secondary treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin during the treatment of real wastewater using high rate algal ponds (HRAP). When spiked at 2 mg/L into primary domestic wastewater, ciprofloxacin (CPX) was efficiently removed from laboratory scale photobioreactors continuously operated under various durations of artificial illumination and hydraulic residence times. Subsequent batch tests conducted with reactor microcosms showed CPX removal was mainly caused by photodegradation during daytime, and sorption to biomass during night time. These findings were confirmed during an experiment conducted in a 1000 L pilot HRAP operated outdoors, as well as during outdoor batch assays conducted using pilot HRAP microcosms. While these results highlight a potentially interesting treatment capacity in comparison to conventional biological treatment, further research must confirm these findings at relevant pollutant concentration (ng-mu g/L) and determine the fate and potential toxicity of degradation products.

AB Caffeine has been associated with wastewater pollution in temperate and subtropical locations, but environmental caffeine concentrations in tropical locations have not been reported. The objectives of this study were to measure caffeine and agricultural pesticide (carbaryl, metalaxyl, and metribuzin) concentrations in environmental waters on the tropical north shore of Kauai (Hawaii, USA) and assess whether patterns in caffeine concentration were consistent with a wastewater caffeine source. Groundwater, river, stream and coastal ocean samples were collected in August 2006 and February 2007. Caffeine was detected in all August 2006 samples and in 33% of February 2007 samples at concentrations up to 88 ng L-1. Metribuzin was detected in five samples collected in February 2007. Carbaryl and metalaxyl were not detected in any sample. Caffeine was not detected in offshore ocean samples or river samples upstream of human development. A positive correlation between caffeine and enterococci suggested a possible wastewater caffeine source. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the latest years there has been a growing level of concern related to the adverse effects of chemical compounds on the environment. Pharmaceuticals is one of the categories of pollutants that during the last 20 years have drawn the attention of the scientific community as they are ubiquiteously present in wastewater effluents at trace levels, and several of them may have adverse effects oil aquatic organisms and human health. Their transformation pathways during wastewater treatment are the Subject of a growing current research, while many gaps still exist in the knowledge of the degree into which they are decomposed during wastewater treatment, as well as their degradation products. Analytical techniques for the determination of pharmaceuticals are being optimized and applied in order to provide answers regarding their behaviour during water treatment and their degradation products. Current research and obtained results on this Subject are summarized and discussed in ththis chapter.

AB Previous work revealed genotoxic effects in the wastewater of a large university hospital using a bacterial short-term genotoxicity assay, based on a umuC::lacZ fusion gene (umuC assay). These studies ruled out disinfectants and detergents as main causative agents of the genotoxic effects. This paper focuses on specific hospital-related drugs as the cause. The ratio of theoretical mean wastewater concentrations (derived from consumption data) and lowest observable effect concentrations of selected pharmaceuticals were used to calculate umuC induction probabilities. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics Ciproxin(R) and Noroxin(R) showed the highest induction probabilities and exceeded all other investigated drugs by at least one order of magnitude in significance. Antineoplastic drugs, originally thought to be the main effecters, were found to be of marginal significance using the umuC assay. These findings were further supported by investigation of urine samples of hospital patients with the umuC assay. The determination of ciprofloxacin in native hospital wastewater by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection revealed concentrations from 3 to 87 mu g/L. umuC induction factor and ciprofloxacin concentrations in 16 hospital wastewater samples showed a log-linear correlation (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the previously measured umuC genotoxicity in the wastewater of the hospital under investigation is caused mainly by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, especially by ciprofloxacin. On the basis of these findings, the role of the umuC assay as a screening tool for wastewater genotoxicity assessment is discussed.

AB This study reports the presence of fossil organic carbon in wastewater and its fate in wastewater treatment plants. The findings pinpoint the inaccuracy of current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines which defines all organic carbon in wastewater to be of biogenic origin. Stable and radiocarbon isotopes (C-13 and C-14) were measured throughout the process train in four municipal wastewater treatment plants equipped with secondary activated sludge treatment. Isotopic mass balance analyses indicate that 4-14% of influent total organic carbon (TOC) is of fossil origin with concentrations between 6 and 35 mg/L; 88 -98% of this is removed from the wastewater. The TOC mass balance analysis suggests that 39-65% of the fossil organic carbon from the influent is incorporated into the activated sludge through adsorption or from cell assimilation while 29-50% is likely transformed to carbon dioxide (CO2) during secondary treatment. The fossil organic carbon fraction in the sludge undergoes further biodegradation during anaerobic digestion with a 12% decrease in mass. 1.4-6.3% of the influent TOC consists of both biogenic and fossil carbon is estimated to be emitted as fossil CO2 from activated sludge treatment alone. The results suggest that current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines, which assume that all CO2 emission from wastewater is biogenic may lead to underestimation of emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence of 17 antibiotics belonging to sulfonamides, beta-lactams, macrolides and aminoglycosides classes, and trimethoprim in raw hospital wastewater, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and surface water was determined. Residual antibiotics were quantified by LC/MS/MS. Residues of antibiotics in hospital wastewater were 3-10 times higher than that detected in WWTP and surface water. Trimethoprim, spectinomycin, ampicillin, and oxacillin were detected in all the sampled water. Sulfamethoxazole was detected at the highest concentration of 20.6, 7.8, and 6.8 mu g L-1 in hospital wastewater, WWTP and in surface water, respectively. Other detected sulfonamides were sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, and sulfanilamide at a concentration range of 0.4-15.7 mu g L-1. Detected trimethoprim ranged from 0.4-6.6 mu g L-1, the rest of the detected antibiotics were up to 1.0 mu g L-1. The speciation of the sulfonamides at pH values relevant to sampled water was evaluated by use of pKa values. These compounds existed largely as anionic and neutral species indicating high mobility as these speciation forms are less sorbed in environmental matrices. Continuous monitoring of antibiotics residues in wastewater, surface water, and other environmental matrices is very important due to their adverse health and environmental effects. The information is useful in designing strategies for antibiotics pollution control and also in policy formulation.

AB The concentrations of some important endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals after various stages of wastewater treatment were investigated. The endocrine disrupting chemicals included natural and synthetic estrogenic and androgenic steroids. The pharmaceuticals included a series of sulfonamide antibiotics and trimethoprim. The removal efficiency of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated and compared with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that the MBR and CAS systems effectively removed steroidal estrogens and androgens, but only partially eliminated the target antibiotics from wastewater. The MBR was shown to be more effective than the CAS system which was possibly attributed to the high solid retention time and concentration of biosolids in the MBR. The results highlight the potential wider application of MBRs for the removal of trace chemical contaminants in wastewater and their potential for use as decentralised wastewater treatment systems.

TI Consumption-based approach for assessing the contribution of hospitals

AB Hospitals are considered as major sources of pharmaceutical residues discharged to municipal wastewater, but recent experimental studies showed that the contribution of hospitals to the loads of selected, quantifiable pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plant (STP) influents was limited. However such conclusions are made based on the experimental analysis of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater which is hindered by a number of factors such as access to suitable sampling sites, difficulties in obtaining representative samples and availability of analytical methods. Therefore, this study explores a refined and extended consumption-based approach to predict the contribution of six selected Australian hospitals to the loads of 589 pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater. In addition, the possibility that hospital-specific substances are present at levels that may pose a risk for human health was evaluated. For 63 to 84% of the pharmaceuticals investigated, the selected hospitals are not a major point source with individual contributions likely to be less than 15% which is in line with previous experimental studies. In contrast, between 10 and 20% of the pharmaceuticals consumed in the selected hospitals are exclusively used in these hospitals. For these hospital-specific substances, 57 distinct pharmaceuticals may cause concerns for human health as concentrations predicted in hospital effluents are less than 100-fold lower than effect thresholds. However, when concentrations were predicted in the influent of the corresponding STP, only 12 compounds (including the antineoplastic vincristine, the antibiotics tazobactam and piperacillin) remain in concentration close to effect thresholds, but further decrease is expected after removal in STP, dilution in the receiving stream and drinking water treatment. The results of this study suggest that risks of human exposure to the pharmaceuticals exclusively administered in the investigated hospitals are limited and decentralised wastewater treatment at these sites would not have a substantial impact on pharmaceutical loads entering STPs, and finally the environment. Overall, our approach demonstrates a unique opportunity to screen for pharmaceuticals used in hospitals and identifying priority pollutants in hospital wastewater explicitly accounting for site-specific conditions. Being based on consumption and loads discharged by hospitals into municipal wastewater, it is not limited by 1) the big effort to obtain representative samples from sewers, 2) the availability of sensitive chemical analysis or 3) a pre-selection of consumption data (e.g. consumption volume).

AB Nervous system active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including anti-depressants and opioids, are important clinically administered pharmaceuticals within healthcare facilities. This study provides source characterization data describing the composition and magnitude of nervous system APIs present in healthcare facility wastewaters. Concentrations and mass loadings of ten nervous system APIs and three nervous system API metabolites are reported for wastewaters from a hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility within a single municipality. Concentrations of nervous system APIs ranged from non-detectable levels for alprazolam in all four facility wastewaters to a high of 290 ng/L amitriptyline in nursing facility wastewater. The summed mean concentration of all thirteen analytes ranged from 402 ng/L in independent living facility wastewater to 624 ng/L in assisted living facility wastewater. Wastewater flow rates from each facility were combined with concentration data to estimate the daily mass loading of nervous system APIs leaving each facility through wastewater discharge to the municipal sewer system. The total mass loading of all thirteen analytes for the hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility was 228, 44, 29.5, and 28.1 mg/day, respectively. The total mass loading of nervous system APIs contributed to the municipality's wastewater from all four facilities was 330 mg/day. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are important sources of emerging contaminants at environmentally-relevant concentrations. In this study, water samples were collected from a river downstream of two WWTPs to identify practical tracers for tracking wastewater. The results of the study indicate elevated concentrations of Cl-, nutrients (NH3-N and NO2-), the artificial sweetener acesulfame-K (ACE-K), and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ibuprofen (IBU), gemfibrozil (GEM), and naproxen (NAP) in the river close to the WWTPs that decreased with distance downstream. A correlation analysis using the Spearman Rank method showed that ACE-K, CBZ, GEM, NAP, and Cl- were strongly correlated with each other over a 31 km stretch of the river in the study area. The strong correlations of these target compounds indicate that the artificial sweetener ACE-K and the pharmaceuticals CBZ, GEM, and NAP can potentially be used as co-tracers to track wastewater.

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) using highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a promising strategy for indirect potable water reuse. Treated wastewater effluent can contain a number of residual contaminants that could have adverse effects on human health, and some jurisdictions have regulations in place to govern these. For those that do not, but where reuse may be under consideration, it is of crucial importance to develop a strategy for identifying priority contaminants, which can then be used to understand the water treatment technologies that might be required. In this study, a multi-criteria approach to identify critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for MAR was developed and applied using a case study site located in southern Ontario, Canada. An important aspect of this approach was the selection of representative compounds for each group of contaminants, based on potential for occurrence in wastewater and expected health or environmental impacts. Due to a lack of MAR regulations in Canada, the study first proposed potential recharge water quality targets. Predominant contaminants, potential additional contaminants, and potential emerging contaminants, which together comprise critical contaminants for MAR with reclaimed water, were then selected based on the case study wastewater effluent monitoring data and literature data. This paper proposes an approach for critical contaminant selection, which will be helpful to guide future implementation of MAR projects using wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB Organic chemicals discharged in urban wastewater from industrial and domestic sources, or those entering through atmospheric deposition onto paved areas via surface run-off, are predominantly lipophilic in nature and therefore become concentrated in sewage sludge, with potential implications for the agricultural use of sludge as a soil improver. Biodegradation occurs to varying degrees during wastewater and sludge treatment processes. However, residues will probably still be present in the resulting sludge and can vary from trace values of several micrograms per kilogram up to approximately 1 per cent in the dry solids for certain bulk chemicals, such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, which is widely used as a surfactant in detergent formulations. However, the review of the scientific literature on the potential environmental and health impacts of organic contaminants (OCs) in sludge indicates that the presence of a compound in sludge, or of seemingly large amounts of certain compounds used in bulk volumes domestically and by industry, does not necessarily constitute a hazard when the material is recycled to farmland. Furthermore, the chemical quality of sludge is continually improving and concentrations of potentially harmful and persistent organic compounds have declined to background values. Thus, recycling sewage sludge on farmland is not constrained by concentrations of OCs found in contemporary sewage sludges. A number of issues, while unlikely to be significant for agricultural utilization, require further investigation and include: (i) the impacts of chlorinated paraffins on the food chain and human health, (ii) the risk assessment of the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a bulk chemical present in large amounts in sludge, (iii) the microbiological risk assessment of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms in sewage sludge and sludge-amended agricultural soil, and (iv) the potential significance of personal-care products (e.g. triclosan), pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds in sludge on soil quality and human health.

AB Ozonation applied for advanced (waste)water treatment has a great potential to form polar transformation products (TPs) with often unknown toxicity. The antiviral drug acyclovir is transformed during biological wastewater treatment into carboxy-acyclovir. Ozone further transforms carboxy-acyclovir into N-(4-carbamoyl-2-imino-5-oxoimidazolidin)formamido-n-methoxy-acid (COFA). Both TPs have been detected in environmental samples and finished drinking water. Here, carboxyacyclovir and COFA were produced at bench scale using treated wastewater and sewage sludge and were tested for aquatic toxicity in parallel with acyclovir. Carboxy-acyclovir was found to significantly reduce the level of reproduction of Daphnia magna (by 40% at 102 mg L-1), and COFA inhibited the growth of green algae (ErC10 of 14.1 mg L-1); no toxicity was observed for acyclovir up to 100 mg L-1. The predicted genotoxicity was not increased compared to that of the parent compound. In summary, the results highlight the importance of assessing the ecotoxicity of TPs formed during wastewater treatment, particularly in the case of ozonation.

AB A new analytical method utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been developed to determine 16 pharmaceuticals from 8 therapeutic classes in wastewater: bezafibrate, clofibric acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, chloramphenicol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, indomethacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, metoprolol, nalidixic acid, N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide, propranolol, sulpiride and trimethoprim. Key parameters of MS/MS, UPLC and solid phase extraction (SPE) were optimized. In general, recovery of target pharmaceuticals was over 70% for the wastewater effluent samples and 50% for the influent samples. The effects of matrix suppression, loss during the pretreatment as well as instrument variability were successfully pcorrected by two internal standards, and acceptable relative recovery was obtained. Target compounds were quantitatively analyzed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and the detection limits ranged from 0.3 to 20 ng/L. A detailed study, matrix effect in effluent wastewater was also present. The method was applied to detecting pharmaceuticals in the wastewater from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Beijing, China and the results demonstrated that most target compounds were detectable in both the influent and effluent, with the mean concentrations ranging from 20.5 to 5775.6 ng/L and 4.6 to 418.6 ng/L, respectively.

AB Wastewater-derived contaminants (WWDCs), such as steroid hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, have been detected in surface waters at concentrations that pose potential risks to aquatic ecosystems. To assess the factors controlling biotransformation of these compounds in effluent-dominated surface waters (i.e., surface waters containing a high proportion of wastewater effluent), microcosm experiments were conducted with 10 pharmaceuticals and five steroids typically detected in wastewater effluent. Some of the compounds underwent rapid biotransformation under all conditions (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone and triclosan), while carbamazepine was always resistant to biotransformation. For the remaining compounds, the rate of biotransformation was related to the amount and type of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). The rates of biotransformation of these WWDCs increased as the initial concentration of wastewater BDOC increased, indicating a relationship between microbial activity and biotransformation rate. Furthermore, BDOC derived from aquatic plants resulted in a better ability to remove certain recalcitrant compounds (gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole) as compared to that derived from wastewater effluent. These observations indicate that for each source of BDOC, it may be possible to use BDOC for predicting the rate of biotransformation of WWDCs in surface waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Shanghai, the antibiotics in the receiving rivers of direct-discharge sources of sewage (aquaculture farms, cattle farms and wastewater treatment plants) were investigated. Water and sediment samples from the receiving rivers of these sources were collected, and were screened for 19 typical antibiotics. The concentration of the antibiotics in the water and sediment ranged from not detected (ND) to 530.05 ng L-1 and ND to 1039.53 ng g(-1), respectively, and sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were identified as the main antibiotics in the water and sediment, respectively. According to principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR), source contributions were estimated: wastewater treatment plants (66.8%) > aquaculture farms and cattle farms (21.2%), indicating that the contribution of human antibiotics was higher than veterinary antibiotics. Based on the risk quotients, ciprofloxacin was identified as the main antibiotic that causes medium risk in the aquatic ecosystem. This work systematically reflected the profile and source apportionment of antibiotics in Shanghai, which is helpful for antibiotic contamination control and environmental management.

AB A study was carried out to assess the removal efficiency of odorous compounds from the wastewater of hospitals in Kuwait using aeration with activated sludge technique. Samples were collected from the outlet of wastewater from Maternity Hospital. The collected samples were transferred to the laboratory of Sulaibiya Research Plant (SRP) of KISR. Each sample was divided into three parts: the first part of the sample was analyzed to obtain characteristic of hospital wastewater, while the second and third samples were mixed with activated sludge from Kabd wastewater treatment plant and underwent aerobic treatment for 12 and 24 h periods in two bioreactors using a different intensity of aeration. In the first bioreactor, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was kept on the level of 2 mg/L, while in the second 4 mg/L. Wastewater and effluents samples were analyzed for the examination of the following parameters: temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, organic nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN) and sulfides. Based on obtained results of analyses, the removal efficiency of wastewater parameters were calculated mainly for COD, NH4-N, sulfides and TN. The laboratory results indicated that after a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h, the mean values of sulfide removal efficiency increased from 82.54% to 93.85%, when DO increased from 2 to 4 mg/L, respectively. Under the same previous operating conditions, the mean value of ammonium removal efficiency was increased from 85.96% to 97.44%. To obtain the best effluents the biological process should be extended aeration type with HRT 24 h at DO 4 mg/L. The obtained results will be recommended as the base for treating wastewater from hospitals in package units before discharging to sewage network.

AB In this study, a screening of 26 selected antimicrobials using liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry method in two Polish wastewater treatment plants and their receiving surface waters was provided. The highest average concentrations of metronidazole (7400 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (4300 ng/L), vancomycin (3200 ng/L), and sulfamethoxazole (3000 ng/L) were observed in influent of WWTP2. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were the most dominant antimicrobials in influent and effluent of both WWTPs. In the sludge samples the highest mean concentrations were found for ciprofloxacin (up to 28 mu g/g) and norfloxacin (up to 5.3 mu g/g). The removal efficiency of tested antimicrobials was found to be more than 50% for both WWTPs. However, the presence of antimicrobials influenced their concentrations in the receiving waters. The highest antimicrobial resistance risk was estimated in influent of WWTPs for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and trimethoprim and in the sludge samples for the following antimicrobials: azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, and tetracycline. The high environmental risk for exposure to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole to both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic species in effluents and/or receiving water was noted. Following the obtained results, we suggest extending the watch list of the Water Framework Directive for Union-wide monitoring with sulfamethoxazole.

AB In this paper we report on the performances of full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment and two pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in eliminating various pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) belonging to different therapeutic groups and with diverse physico- chemical properties. Both aqueous and solid phases were analysed for the presence of 31 pharmaceuticals included in the analytical method. The most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water were analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (14.6-31.3 mu g/L) and acetaminophen (7.1-11.4 mu g/L), antibiotic ofloxacin (0.89-31.7 mu g/l.), lipid regulators gemfibrozil (2.0-5.9 mu g/L) and bezafibrate (1.9-29.8 mu g/L), beta-blocker atenolol (0.84-2.8 mu g/L), hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide (0.12-15.9 mu g/L) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (2.3-4.8 mu g/L). Also, several pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, ofloxacin and azithromycin were detected in sewage sludge at concentrations up to 741.1, 336.3, 380.7, 454.7 and 299.6 ng/g dry weight. Two pilot-scale MBRs exhibited enhanced elimination of several pharmaceutical residues poorly removed by the CAS treatment (e.g., mefenamic acid, indomethacin, diclofenac, propyphenazone, pravastatin, gemfibrozil), whereas in some cases more stable operation of one of the MBR reactors at prolonged SRT proved to be detrimental for the elimination of some compounds (e.g., beta-blockers, ranitidine, famotidine, erythromycin). Moreover, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and diuretic hydrochlorothiazide by-passed all three treatments investigated.
   Furthermore, sorption to sewage sludge in the MBRs as well as in the entire treatment line of a full-scale WWTP is discussed for the encountered analytes. Among the pharmaceuticals encountered in sewage sludge, sorption to sludge could be a relevant removal pathway only for several compounds (i.e., mefenamic acid, propranolol, and loratidine). Especially in the case of loratidine the experimentally determined sorption coefficients (KdS) were in the range 2214-3321 L/kg (mean). The results obtained for the solid phase indicated that MBR wastewater treatment yielding higher biodegradation rate could reduce the load of pollutants in the sludge. Also, the overall output load in the aqueous and solid phase of the investigated WWTP was calculated, indicating that none of the residual pharmaceuticals initially detected in the sewage sludge were degraded during the anaerobic digestion. Out of the 26 pharmaceutical residues passing through the WWTP, 20 were ultimately detected in the treated sludge that is further applied on farmland. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethazine (SMZ) is an antibiotic from sulfonamides class widely used in veterinary medicine and reported in wastewater and sewage. Thus, it is essential to study technologies to reduce SMZ present in the aquatic environment. Anaerobic bioreactors are a low-cost technology applied for wastewater treatment. The objective of this paper is to study kinetics parameters related to SMZ removal using a horizontal flow-anaerobic immobilized biomass reactor (HAIR) and to evaluate its transformation products formed during this treatment. The bioreactor was operated at mesophilic condition with a hydraulic retention time of 12 h. The removal of SMZ was evaluated at three different concentrations: 200 ng L-1 (phase I), 400 ng L-1 (phase II) and 600 ng L-1 (phase III). The apparent first-order removal constant obtained for chemical oxygen demand was 0.885 +/- 0.094 h(-1) while SMZ showed a removal constant of 0.356 h(-1). SMZ was removed with an efficiency of 56.0 +/- 13.0 % (phase I); 62.0 +/- 12.0 % (phase II) and 62.0 +/- 6.00 % (phase III). Seven transformation products were detected and one of these with m/z 233 is reported for the first-time. The HAIB bioreactor has a potential to assist in wastewater treatment to remove contaminants at ng L-1 concentration level.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are a major source of human pharmaceutical residues (PR) in the aquatic environment, which are considered to be of emerging concern. The microalga Chlamydomonas acidophila has shown to be a promising technology to recover the nutrients from wastewater and therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of this species to also remove PRs commonly present in wastewaters (atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, lidocaine, propranolol and simvastatin). Batch assays were carried out (50 mL, 90 rpm, 43 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), 22 degrees C) comprising the wastewater with the pharmaceutical mixture M three concentrations: CHigh, CModerate and CEnv. The results demonstrated that this microalga does not seem to be affected by pharmaceuticals in wastewater M concentrations well above those detected in urban effluents; additionally it is able to degrade the antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin better than other microalgae species and enhances their removal from wastewater by 93-65 % and 64-50 %, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibited a high assimilation of ammonium and phosphates reaching values of around 9 mgNH(4)L(-1)d(-1) and 3 mgPO(4)L(-1) d(-1) compared to other species. Therefore, Chlamydomonas acidophila appears to be a promising agent for urban wastewater treatment.

AB The occurrence of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its metabolites in German and Portuguese wastewater was investigated. A total of 46 samples from influent and effluent wastewater were analyzed by liquid-chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry. The five metabolites 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (DiOH-CBZ), 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-CBZ (10-OH-CBZ), 10,11-epoxy-10,11-dihydro-CBZ, 2-hydroxy-CBZ and 3-hydroxy-CBZ were very persistent with little to no removal during wastewater treatment. The highest concentrations were found for CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, and 10-OH-CBZ, with up to 5.0, 4.8 and 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, the related pharmaceutical oxcarbazepine and the metabolites 9-hydroxymethy1-10-carbamoylacridan, 1-hydroxy-CBZ (1-OH-CBZ) and 4-hydroxy-CBZ (4OH-CBZ) were detected. Explicit care was taken to achieve a good chromatographic separation of the numerous isomers that were difficult to distinguish by mass spectrometry alone. A phenylether stationary phase provided the best separation. In combination with high resolution mass spectrometry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange, this LC column enabled us to identify 1-OH-CBZ and 4-OH-CBZ in wastewater for the first time.

AB The project DemO(3)AC (demonstration of large-scale wastewater ozonation at the Aachen-Soers wastewater treatment plant, Germany) of the Eifel-Rur Waterboard contains the construction of a large-scale ozonation plant for advanced treatment of the entire 25 million m(3)/yr of wastewater passing through its largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In dry periods, up to 70% of the receiving water consists of treated wastewater. Thus, it is expected that effects of ozonation on downstream water biocoenosis will become observable. Extensive monitoring of receiving water and the WWTP shows a severe pollution with micropollutants (already prior to WWTP inlet). (Eco-)Toxicological investigations showed increased toxicity at the inlet of the WWTP for all assays. However, endocrine-disrupting potential was also present at other sampling points at the WWTP and in the river and could not be eliminated sufficiently by the WWTP. Total cell counts at the WWTP are slightly below average. Investigations of antibiotic resistances show no increase after the WWTP outlet in the river. However, cells carrying antibiotic-resistant genes seem to be more stress resistant in general. Comparing investigations after implementation of ozonation should lead to an approximation of the correlation between micropollutants and water quality/biocoenosis and the effects that ozonation has on this matter.

AB Many rivers and streams worldwide are impacted by pharmaceuticals originating from sewage. The hyporheic zone underlying streams is often regarded as reactive bioreactor with the potential for eliminating such sewage-born micropollutants. The present study aims at checking the elimination potential and analyzing the coupling of hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and micropollutant processing. To this end, two sites at the lowland stream Erpe, which receives a high sewage burden, were equipped and sampled with nested piezometers. From temperature depth profiles we determined that at one of the sites infiltration of surface water into the aquifer occurs while exfiltration dominates at the other site. Biogeochemical data reveal intense mineralization processes and strictly anoxic conditions in the streambed sediments at both sites. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were high in the surface water and also in the subsurface at the infiltrating site. The evaluation of the depth profiles indicates some attenuation but due to varying surface water composition the evaluation of subsurface processes is quite complex. Borate and non-geogenic gadolinium were measured as conservative wastewater indicators. To eliminate the influence of fluctuating sewage proportions in the surface water, micropollutant concentrations are related to these indicators. The indicators can cope with different dilutions of the sewage but not with temporally varying sewage composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prospects for wastewater irrigation in Brazil look promising, in light of the fact that agriculture plays an essential role in the country's economy and, furthermore, freshwater for irrigation is scarce in some parts of the country. However, irrigation with effluents still represents a new practice, and most available data related to the benefits and risks of effluent irrigation are based on short-term experiments. The present paper provides an overview of the potential of water reuse in Brazil; it describes the main results concerning effects of effluent irrigation on soil/plant interactions in Brazil, and discusses some important issues that require further investigation. So far, research in Brazil has been mainly focused on soil chemical changes that follow effluent application, while investigations concerning the occurrence and fate of trace contaminants, and the potential risks they present, remain to be carried out. Such contaminants include heavy metals and pharmaceutically active products. Effluent irrigation of agricultural crops intended for biofuel production represents a strategic issue, of increasing importance for the national and international market. For a consistent evaluation of long-term benefits and risks of effluent irrigation in this country, major needs are: improvement of the sewage collection and treatment infrastructure; establishment of legal regulations to control water reuse in agriculture; and permanent monitoring of areas already under wastewater irrigation.

TI Thermal plasma activation and UV/H2O2 oxidative degradation of
   pharmaceutical residues

ID LIQUID
AB The aquatic environment becomes increasingly contaminated by anthropogenic pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues. Due to poor biodegradation and continuous discharge of persistent compounds in sewage water samples, pharmaceutical residues might end up in surface waters when not removed. To minimize this pollution, onsite wastewater treatment techniques might complement conventional waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). Advanced oxidation processes are useful techniques, since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are used for the degradation of unwanted medicine residues. In this paper we have studied the advanced oxidation in a controlled laboratory setting using thermal plasma and UV/H2O2 treatment. Five different matrices, Milli-Q water, tap water, synthetic urine, diluted urine and synthetic sewage water were spiked with 14 pharmaceuticals with a concentration of 5 mu g/L. All compounds were reduced or completely decomposed by both 150 W thermal plasma and UV/H2O2 treatment. Additionally, also hospital sewage water was tested. First the concentrations of 10 pharmaceutical residues were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The pharmaceutical concentration ranged from 0.08 up to 2400 mu g/L. With the application of 150 W thermal plasma or UV/H2O2, it was found that overall pharmaceutical degradation in hospital sewage water were nearly equivalent to the results obtained in the synthetic sewage water. However, based on the chemical abatement kinetics it was demonstrated that the degree of degradation decreases with increasing matrix complexity. Since reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are continuously produced, thermal plasma treatment has the advantage over UV/H2O2 treatment.

AB Serious shortage of water resources is one of the major factors restricting the sustainable development of cropland and pasture land in northern and northwestern China. Although the reuse of wastewater for agricultural irrigation becomes a well established practice in these regions, many contaminants have been also introduced into the soil-groundwater systems such as persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). To study the influence of long-term sewage irrigation on the distribution of OCPs in soil-groundwater systems, the groundwater flow field was investigated and 31 topsoil samples, 9 boreholes, 11 sewage effluents and 34 groundwater samples were collected in Xiaodian, Taiyuan city, one of the largest sewage irrigation districts, China. During sampling, three representative types of regions were considered including effluent-irrigated area, groundwater-irrigated area served as the control field and no-irrigated area as reference "background". The results showed over-exploitation of groundwater had changed the flow field of groundwater and wherever in soil or in groundwater, the concentration of OCPs in effluent-irrigation area presented the highest value, which indicated that the sewage irrigation had a strong influence on the distribution of OCPs in soil-groundwater systems. Principal component analysis for OCPs content in groundwater showed that the major influence factors on the occurrence and distribution of OCPs in groundwater systems attribute to the flow field of groundwater and to the current pesticide use.

AB This work reports a systematic survey of over seventy individual pollutants in a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) receiving urban wastewater The compounds include mainly pharmaceuticals and personal care products, as well as some metabolites The quantification in the ng/L range was performed by Liquid Chromatography-QTRAP-Mass Spectrometry and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. The results showed that paraxanthine, caffeine and acetaminophen were the main individual pollutants usually found in concentrations over 20 ppb N-formyl-4-amino-antipiryne and galaxolide were also detected in the ppb level A group of compounds including the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol, the lipid regulators bezafibrate and fenofibric acid, the antibiotics erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, the antiinflammatories diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen and mefenamic acid, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antiacid omeprazole exhibited removal efficiencies below 20% in the STP treatment Ozonation with doses lower than 90 mu M allowed the removal of many individual pollutants including some of those more refractory to biological treatment A kinetic model allowed the determination of second order kinetic constants for the ozonation of bezafibrate, cotinine, diuron and metronidazole. The results show that the hydroxyl radical reaction was the major pathway for the oxidative transformation of these compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Wastewater generated from industries contains numerous contaminants, among which heavy metals (HMs) are non-degradable. This research work highlights the use of commonly used ornamental plants, Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L., with compost (C) and peat moss (M), and rhizospheric bacterial augmentation using Pseudomonas japonica, for the phytostabilization of HMs from synthetic wastewater. After plant-soil acclimatization, plants were exposed for 6 weeks to synthetic wastewater, containing cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc concentrations (based on the HMs level of wastewaters collected from textile and pharmaceutical industry). Physiological response, biochemical status, and enzymatic fluctuations of plants and the distribution of HMs in plant parts and soil, were quantified. With the combined use (5% each v/v conditioner/soil) of C and M, in bio-augmented soil, physiological response and enzymatic status of both plants improved, with decreased stress injury due to HMs. Further, the plant HMs uptake was reduced, with better stabilization of HM in soil. For better phytostabilization of HMs in wastewater, the use of compost, peat moss, and bacterial augmentation is recommended with Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L.

AB This study presents an estimation of the urine volume in the wastewater from a real, private clinic in Crete, Greece, during a seven-month period (01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018). Separate estimates were obtained for the volume of urine belonging to patients receiving antibiotics. It was found that the clinic disposed into the local municipal sewage network on the average 3,263 L/month of urine, from which 1,331 L/month (40.8%) belonged to patients receiving antibiotics. According to the pharmacy department of the private clinic, during the period of the study, the most frequently administered groups of antibiotics were on the average 779 g/month cephalosporins (68.1%), 108 g/month fluoroquinolones (9.5%) and others (11.2%), with various active substances including cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and doxycycline. These active substances act like pollutants when disposed via the municipal sewer network into the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB N-nitrosamines and their precursors are significant concerns for water utilities exploiting wastewater-impacted water supplies, particularly those practicing potable reuse of wastewater. Previous efforts to identify specific precursors in municipal wastewater accounting for N-nitrosamine formation have met with limited success. As an alternative, we quantified the relative importance of greywater (i.e., shower, kitchen sink, bathroom washbasin, and laundry) and blackwater (i.e., urine and feces) streams in terms of their loadings of ambient specific and total N-nitrosamines and chloramine-reactive and ozone-reactive N-nitrosamine precursors to domestic sewage. Accounting for the volume fractions of individual greywater and blackwater streams, laundry water represented the most significant source of N-nitrosamines and their precursors, followed by shower water and urine. Laundry water was particularly important for ozone-reactive N-nitrosamine precursors, accounting for,similar to 99% of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors and similar to 69% of precursors for other uncharacterized N-nitrosamines. For the other greywater streams, consumer products contributed additional N-nitrosamines and precursors, but the remarkable uniformity across different products suggested the importance of common macroconstituents. The consumption of a standard dose of the antacid ranitidine substantially increased NDMA and its chloramine-reactive precursors in urine. Nevertheless, nearly 40% of the American population would need to consume ranitidine daily to match the NDMA loadings from laundry water.

AB This work summarized all results obtained during almost two-years of a monitoring programme carried out in five municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) located in the north, centre and south-east of Spain. The study evaluated the occurrence and persistence of a group of 100 organic compounds belonging to several chemical groups (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and metabolites). The average removal efficiencies of the STPs studied varied from 20% (erythromycin) to 99% (acetaminophen). In analysed samples, we identified a large number of compounds at mean range concentrations between 7-59,495 ng/L and 5-32,720 ng/L for influent and effluent samples, respectively. This study also identified 20 of the mostly detected and persistent compounds in wastewater effluent, of which hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, gemfibrozil, galaxolide and three metabolites (fenofibric acid, 4-AAA and 4-FAA), presented the highest average contribution percentages, in relation to the total load of contaminants for the different STPs effluent studied.

AB The mass flows of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were studied in the aqueous compartment of the river Somes in Romania. PPCPs were measured in wastewater treatment effluents and in the receiving river water. The analytical method for the determination of PPCPs in river water was based on solid phase extraction and GC-ITMS. Carbamazepine, pentoxyfylline, ibuprofen, diazepam, galaxotide, tonalide and triclosan were determined in wastewater effluents with individual concentrations ranging from 15 to 774 ng L-1. Caffeine was measured at concentrations up to 42 560 ng L-1. Due to the high contamination of WWTP effluents, the receiving river was also polluted. The most abundant PPCPs measured in the Somes were caffeine, galaxolide, carbamazepine and triclosan. They were present at all the 15 sampling sites along the Somes, the concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 ng L-1. The concentrations in the effluents of the different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) varied considerably and the differences are due to different elimination efficiencies of the studied PPCPs during sewage treatment. Only one of 5 WWTPs studied, the WWTP in Cluj-Napoca, was working properly, and therefore technical measures have to be taken for upgrading the WWTPs and reducing the environmental load of micropollutants. This study is the first overview of PPCPs along on Romanian part of river Somes.

AB We present a second-generation wastewater treatment inventory model, WWLCI 2.0, which on many fronts represents considerable advances compared to its previous version WWLCI 1.0. WWLCI 2.0 is a novel and complete wastewater inventory model integratingWWLCI 1.0, i.e. a complete life cycle inventory, including infrastructure requirement, energy consumption and auxiliary materials applied for the treatment of wastewater and disposal of sludge and SewageLCI, i.e. fatemodelling of chemicals released to the sewer. The model is expanded to account for different wastewater treatment levels, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary treatment, independent treatment by septic tanks and also direct discharge to natural waters. Sludge disposal by means of composting is added as a new option. The model also includes a database containing statistics on wastewater treatment levels and sludge disposal patterns in 56 countries. The application of the new model is demonstrated using five chemicals assumed discharged to wastewater systems in four different countries. WW LCI 2.0 model results shows that chemicals such as diethylenetriamine penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP) and Diclofenac, exhibit lower climate change (CC) and freshwater ecotoxicity (FET) burdens upon wastewater treatment compared to direct discharge in all country scenarios. Results for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen (more readily degradable) show that the CC burden depends on the country-specific levels of wastewater treatment. Higher treatment levels lead to lower CC and FET burden compared to direct discharge. WWLCI 2.0 makes it possible to generate complete detailed life cycle inventories and fate analyses for chemicals released to wastewater systems. Our test of the WWLCI 2.0 model with five chemicals illustrates how the model can provide substantially different outcomes, compared to conventional wastewater inventory models, making the inventory dependent upon the atomic composition of the molecules undergoing treatment as well as the country specific wastewater treatment levels.

AB The spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance (due to over and non-judicious use of antibiotics) is an apprehensive subjects matter and the role of wastewater treatment plants has been attracting particular interest. These stations are a reservoir of resistant bacteria, and the amount of bacteria released into the environment is very high and dangerous. The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a practical solution for surmounting scarcity of water, but there are several health-related and environmental risks associated with this practice. It may increase antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in soil and water. Wastewater treatment plant effluents have been recognised as significant environmental AR reservoirs due to selective pressure generated by antibiotics that are frequently discharged in water. It also enhanced the possibility of horizontal gene transfer by increasing the abundance of the resistance gene. This review focuses on the emergence of antibiotic resistance in waste water, waste water treatment, challenges and their impact on human health. Based on the current state of the art, we conclude that the improvements in wastewater treatment technologies are required that not only remove solids, organic matter, and nutrients but also they could remove AR element and bacteria.

AB Permethrin entered use in the 1970s as an insecticide in a wide range of applications, including agriculture, horticultural, and forestry, and has since been restricted. In the 21st century, the presence of permethrin in the aquatic environment has been attributed to its use as a human and veterinary pharmaceutical, in particular as a pedeculicide, in addition to other uses, such as a moth-proofing agent. However, as a consequence of its toxicity to fish, sources of permethrin and its fate and behavior during wastewater treatment are topics of concern. This study has established that high overall removal of permethrin (approximately 90%) was achieved during wastewater treatment and that this was strongly dependent on the extent of biological degradation in secondary treatment, with more limited subsequent removal in tertiary treatment processes. Sources of permethrin in the catchment matched well with measured values in crude sewage and indicated that domestic use accounted for more than half of the load to the treatment works. However, removal may not be consistent enough to achieve the environmental quality standards now being derived in many countries even where tertiary treatment processes are applied.

AB Predicted environmental concentrations for five commonly used pharmaceuticals were calculated using data from the UK Department of Health according to risk assessment guidelines proposed by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Surface waters from the South-East of England were analysed and results were compared with predicted concentrations and findings from other studies from the UK and Europe. it was found that the efficacy of these predictions varied and was hampered by a shortage of data for many of the drugs. Ibuprofen, paracetamol and salbutamol were detected and quantified in all locations sampled. Ibuprofen was consistently found at the highest concentrations (up to 3 mu g1(-1)). Levels up and downstream of two wastewater treatment works were compared in order to investigate the link between sewage discharge and environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals. Results from one site demonstrated a considerable increase in concentrations of ibuprofen, salbutamol and paracetamol downstream from the treatment works; however, no link was established for a second works.

ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE; IFOSFAMIDE; WATER; FATE
AB In this study a number of analytical procedures are described to determine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites during sewage treatment. The work shows that PPCPs occur in sewage influent and are removed by various wastewater treatment processes. PPCPs include a wide range of chemicals such as prescription drugs as well as diagnostic agents, fragrances, sun-screen agents, and various other compounds commonly present in household items (e.g. detergents, cleaners, toothpastes etc.). During this study a number of PPCPs including painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen), cholesterol control medication (clofibric acid), antibacterial agents (triclosan), musks (including galaxolide and tonalide), X-ray contrast media (diatrizoate), cancer treatment drugs (cyclophosphamide) and anti-depressant drugs (fluvoxamine) were investigated. Analysis was carried out using a number of techniques. Samples were extracted using solid phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction and the extracts analysed using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with selected ion monitoring or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or LC-MS-MS. The results obtained show that aspirin, clofibric acid, diatrozate, fluvoxamine and cyclophosphamide were not detected in any of the crude sewage or sewage effluent samples above the limit of detection of the applied methods. Ibuprofen was detected in all crude sewage samples as well as in all effluent samples with one exception. Removal of ibuprofen by the different STWs was generally between 80-100%, with the exception of one STW where removal was poor (14.4 to 44%). Triclosan was also detected in all crude sewage samples and in all sewage effluent samples. The highest concentration of triclosan detected was 3100 ng l(-1). A high removal efficiency was observed in effluent samples taken on two occasions (average removal 95.6%). The concentrations of musks detected in the crude sewage were generally low except for galaxolide and tonalide. The results from STW effluent samples showed significant removal of galaxolide (70-83% removal) except at one STW (STW 1) where removal was low (57% and 39%). Similar removal efficiencies for tonalide were achieved at these STWs (73-96%) except at STW 1 where removal was poor (53%).

AB Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors have been widely used for treatment of industrial wastewater. In this study, performance of a lab-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, was evaluated under different operating conditions. A (P.E) pipe with a diameter of 250 mm and total height of 120 cm and effective height of 100 cm with approximate volume of 49 liter was used as a reactor. The loading rates on reactor were increased in steps to assess the maximum loading capacity of the reactor to study the performance of reactor at different loading rates. The COD concentrations used in the present investigation ranges between 1850 mg/L to 15170 ing/L. The performance of the reactor up to 10.81 kg COD/m(3.)d was evaluated and the hydraulic retention times were examined. During this study, which lasted for 120 days, the temperature of the wastewater entering the reactor ranged from 30 to 35 degrees C and no heat exchanger was used. Finally the removal ratio of COD with hydraulic retention time of 33.7 hours and organic loading rate of 10.81 kg COD/m(3).day were 54 percent respectively.

AB Quaternary alkylammonium compounds (QAACs) are used as disinfectants and surfactants worldwide, with their usage currently increasing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. QAACs are released into the environment with manure, sewage sludge and wastewater. The fate of QAACs in soils is poorly understood, although QAACs are inflicted in the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We studied the temporal accumulation of QAACs in soils of the Mezquital Valley that have been irrigated with Mexico City wastewater from 0 to 88 years. Concentrations of 16 QAACs, including alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (ATMACs), dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs) and benzylalkyldimethylethylammonium compounds (BACs), were determined using HPLC-MS/MS after ultrasonic extraction. The most abundant QAAC-homologues in the soils were BACs > ATMACs > DADMACs. The concentrations of QAACs increased linearly and slowly during the first years of irrigation ( n-ary sumation QAAC: 2-23 mu g kg(-1)), but after 40 years of wastewater irrigation we observed an exponential increase in QAAC concentrations (up to 155 mu g kg(-1)). QAACs accumulate in soils of the Mezquital Valley during long-term wastewater irrigation. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, no apparent 'steady state' concentration is reached after decades of wastewater irrigation.

AB Unintentional indirect potable water reuse, where wastewater effluent is used as a part of a downstream drinking water source, has become a great concern. In this case, a variety of organic micro-pollutants contained in wastewater effluent could create problems. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective in removing such organic micro-pollutants. Available information on the performance of MBRs regarding removal of micro-pollutants, however, is currently limited. This study examined the ability of submerged MBRs to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Experiments were conducted at an existing municipal wastewater treatment facility, and the performance of the MBRs was compared with that of the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. Six acidic PhACs (clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen) and one acidic herbicide (dichloprop) were investigated. Compared with CAS, MBRs exhibited much better removal regarding ketoprofen and naproxen. With respect to the other compounds, comparable removal was observed between the two types of treatment. Removal efficiencies of the PhACs were found to be dependent on their molecular structure such as number of aromatic rings or inclusion of chlorine.

AB The knowledge on the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from animal food production industry for the removal of both hormones and antibiotics of veterinary application is still very limited. These compounds have already been reported in different environmental compartments at levels that could have potential impacts on the ecosystems. This work aimed to evaluate the role of activated sludge in the removal of commonly used veterinary drugs, enrofloxacin (ENR), tetracycline (TET), and ceftiofur, from wastewater during a conventional treatment process. For that, a series of laboratory-controlled experiments using activated sludge were carried out in batch reactors. Sludge reactors with 100 mu g/L initial drug charge presented removal rates of 68 % for ENR and 77 % for TET from the aqueous phase. Results indicated that sorption to sludge and to the wastewater organic matter was responsible for a significant percentage of drugs removal. Nevertheless, these removal rates still result in considerable concentrations in the aqueous phase that will pass through the WWTP to the receiving environment. Measuring only the dissolved fraction of pharmaceuticals in the WWTP effluents may underestimate the loading and risks to the aquatic environment.

AB Pharmaceutical substances are synthetic compounds with very widespread usage due to their therapeutic biological effects. These compounds and their bioactive metabolites are continually introduced into the aquatic environment as complex mixtures via sewage treatment plants (incomplete destruction), animal farms or leaching from landfills. In this study, an analytical procedure involving solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed to determine pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine, diclofenac, ketoprofen and ibuprofen) in aqueous samples (wastewater and surface water). The results demonstrated the suitability of the method at trace levels (ng . L-1) for multi-residue analysis of different types of water matrices.

AB This research surveyed influent and effluent concentration of pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants to analyze detection state. On the basis of analysis results, lab experiments were carried out to improve treatment rate and the result was proposed as a water quality control guideline of wastewater treatment plants. According to monthly pharmaceuticals concentration analysis result, antiinflammatory analgesic drug and antibiotics including Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, and Trimethoprim were detected in high concentration in the winter while antiepileptics including Carbamazepine were detected similar regardless of season. Existing biological treatment processes removed little of 4 pharmaceuticals except for the acetaminophen so they may be exposed to the surface water. In a lab experience to improve removal rate of pharmaceuticals, the compromise was not effect in removing pharmaceuticals while the ozonation was effective to remove 99% or more of pharmaceuticals. In addition, the activated carbon adsorption process showed high removal efficiency. Therefore, the biological treatment process and combined physicochemical oxidation process of ozone or AOP are effect in removing pharmaceuticals and it is proposed as the base data for water quality control so as to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals at wastewater treatment plants.

AB GUMS-screening analyses of water samples from the Lippe River, Germany, revealed the presence of a wide spectrum of low-molecular weight organic compounds ranging from non-polar constituents like aliphatic hydrocarbons to polar constituents like n-carboxylic acids and phenols. Most of the identified compounds could be attributed to anthropogenic input and are used as plasticizers, flame retardants, pharmaceutical drugs or fragrances. Some of them had rarely been noticed as organic pollutants of aquatic environments before. These are, among others, 9-methylacridine, the plasticizer 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentandioldiisobutyrate (TXIB), the surfactant 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (TMDD), triphenylphosphinoxide and the flame retardant tris(chloropropyl)phosphate. On the other hand, most of the identified trialkyl phosphates, pharmaceutical drugs and synthetic fragrances have been reported in surface waters by several authors so far.
   Input pathways of the detected compounds were traced back by sampling various input sources of organic matter such as discharges of wastewater and Lippe River tributaries. Several contaminants were ubiquitous in Lippe River water and also occurred in sewage effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant and in samples from the tributaries. This observation suggests that they are typical sewage derived contaminants and have the potential to be used as anthropogenic molecular markers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel configuration of an osmotic anaerobic membrane bioreactor coupled with membrane-assisted distillation (OMBR-MD) in a single submerged module was proposed for domestic sewage treatment and potabilization. A steady permeate flux was achieved after the 22nd day of monitoring, in which the draw solution (DS) was diluted by the forward osmosis (FO) permeate at the same rate in which it was concentrated by the membrane distillation (MD). Salinity build-up inside the bioreactor contributed to fouling in the FO membrane since it increases the production of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances. In addition, organic matter accumulated in DS, due to the closed-loop system, may be the main cause for fouling in MD membranes at the latter stages. The OMBR-MD presented great removal for organic matter (91%), phosphorous (95%) and ammonium nitrogen (71%). Alkalinity accumulation within the bioreactor prevented a significant change in bulk solution pH (8.0 ? 8.4), reducing the effects of volatile fatty acids production on methanogenic performance. The OMBR-MD removal efficiencies were higher than 96% for all 7 selected pharmaceutical drugs. Additionally, the MD distillate attained eight out of the nine parameters assessed for potable water standards established in Brazilian legislations and recommendations from US EPA, including Escherichia coli. Therefore, the novel OMBRMD proved to be a feasible alternative for treating municipal wastewater, generating a high-quality distillate.

AB Currently, there is increasing awareness regarding the effect of antibiotics on various organisms in the ecosystem even though they may occur at relatively low concentration. Thus, their concentration needs to be quantified precisely in various matrices including ground water, surface water, and municipal wastewater. The use of liquid chromatography together with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-LC-MS/MS) has enhanced the reliability, accessibility, and accuracy with which antibiotics can be detected. In the present study, a HR-LC-MS/MS-based method was developed for four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, azithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole). Initially, various mobile phases and LC columns were evaluated. The effect of solution pH, drying time of cartridge, and solvent used in the concentration step on recovery of antibiotics during solid-phase extraction (SPE) was also evaluated. Subsequently, the recovery of antibiotics from influent and effluent wastewater samples, obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in India, was determined based on the matrix spike method. The results revealed that for these wastewater samples even the use of structurally similar, isotopically labelled (deuterated) standards could not adequately improve the recovery of target antibiotics.

AB The occurrence of various antibiotics in wastewater treatment systems continues to arouse extensive attention. However, the effects of low concentration of antibiotics on wastewater treatment performance and the related functional bacteria, especially under long-term operation, remain largely unknown. In this study, a lab-scale anaerobic-aerobic system was established to evaluate the impacts of 5 mg l(-1) tetracycline on the performance of a lab-scale wastewater treatment system and the abundance of the related functional bacteria. The results indicated that Tc exposure had little effect (p > 0.05) on the efficiency of COD removal during the whole period of 200 days, but significantly decreased ammonia removal (p <0.05) and accelerated sludge bulking deterioration. Although the core bacterial communities and the abundance of amoA genes in the activated sludge were not affected, the growth of Nitrospira was inhibited (p < 0.05), and Sphaerotilus was promoted by tetracycline exposure. The results of this study provide important references for the maintenance of wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ofloxacin was found to be the dominant contaminant with concentrations up to 24760 mu g kg(-1), followed by oxytetracycline (52801 mu g kg(-1)), norfloxacin (5280 mu g kg(-1)) and ketoprofen (4458 mu g kg(-1)). The concentration of pharmaceutical residues varied greatly depending on the operation conditions of wastewater treatment plants and sampling locations. Poor agreement was found between the predicted (calculation based on the annual consumption and coefficient of sludge water partition) and detected concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indicating that the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues was affected by various factors such as loading rates, sewage properties and the chemical properties such as the contribution from polar groups. National wide fate and ecotoxicity study is required for the development of control strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a simple analytical method to determine the presence of selected pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors in wastewater treatment plant effluents. In this study, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were used to identify triclosan; 2,4-dichloro phenol; 2,3,4-trichloro phenol; galaxolide; tonalide; estrone; 17-beta-estradiol; 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol; clofibric acid; and carbamazepine.
   Extraction parameters such as types of SPME fiber, effect of ionic strength, magnetic stirring, pH, extraction temperature, extraction time, and desorption time were investigated to optimize the SPME-GC method. Also, analytical parameters such as repeatability, linearity, and detection limits were evaluated. The method developed in this study was fast (extraction procedure and GC-MS analysis was around 100 minutes), solvent-free, and low cost.
   This method was used as a screening test to determine if pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors were present in wastewater treatment plant effluents samples from the Chania Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in Crete, Greece.

AB Ozone application is an effective tool to reduce loads of (micro)pollutants in wastewater, however, its ecotoxicological implications are largely unknown. Therefore, the feeding rates of a leaf-shredding invertebrate (Gammarus fossarum) exposed to secondary (=non-ozone) or ozone treated wastewater were investigated to assess potential ecotoxicological effects. Two repetitive experiments resulted in significantly higher feeding rates for gammarids exposed to ozone compared to non-ozone treated wastewater sampled from a treatment plant equipped with a full-scale ozonation. A further experiment confirmed these results also for wastewater from the same treatment plant, when ozonation was conducted at the lab-scale. However, the deviations in dissolved organic carbon profiles of ozone and non-ozone wastewater did not seem to be the driving factor for the effects observed. Two additional experiments displayed on the one hand a higher feeding rate of G. fossarum if exposed to ten-fold enriched eluates from solid phase extraction cartridges loaded with ozone compared to non-ozone treated wastewater. On the other hand, the mean feeding rate of gammarids exposed to non-ozone treated wastewater, which contained hardly any (micro)pollutants (i.e. pharmaceuticals), was at the same level as wastewater from the same source additionally treated with ozone. These results suggest that not an alteration in the organic matrix but a reduction in the load of micropollutants most likely triggered the effects in the bioassay applied. Hence, the feeding rate of G. fossarum appears to be a well-suited bioassay to indicate alterations in ecotoxicological properties of wastewater due to the application of advanced oxidation processes like ozonation.

AB We measured five estrogens in the wastewater samples from the municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs), livestock wastewater treatment plants (L-WWTPs), hospital WWTPs (H-WWTPs) and pharmaceutical manufacture WWTPs (P-WWTPs) in Korea. The L-WWTPs showed the highest total concentration (0.195-10.4 mu g L-1) of estrogens in the influents, followed by the M-WWTPs (0.028-1.15 mu g L-1), H-WWTPs (0.068-0.130 mu g L-1) and P-WWTPs (0.015-0.070 mu g L-1). Like the influents, the L-WWTPs (0.003-0.729 mu g L-1) and the M-WWTPs (0.001-0.299 mu g L-1) also showed higher total concentration of estrogens in the effluents than the H-WWTPs (0.002-0.021 mu g L-1) and P-WWTPs (0.011 mu g L-1 in one sample). The L-WWTPs (37.5-543 mu g kg(-1), dry weight) showed higher total concentrations in sludge than the M-WWTPs (3.16-444 mu g kg(-1), dry weight) like the wastewater. The distribution of estrogens in the WWTPs may be affected by their metabolism in the human body, their transition through biological treatment processes, and their usage for livestock growth. Unlike the concentration results, the daily loads of estrogens from the M-WWTPs were the highest, which is related to the high capacities of WWTPs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Discharges from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are among the main sources of contamination to receiving surface water, therefore the quality of treated wastewater needs to be properly monitored. However, not only the effluents of larger WWTPs employing advanced treatment processes have been considered, but also those from more conventional WWTPs. In this study, the occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals have been investigated in a conventional WWTP which receives wastewater from an urban area and a near-by hospital. 24-h composite samples were collected during one week before (influent wastewater, IWW) and after (effluent wastewater, EWW) treatment along three monitoring campaigns distributed over one year. Moreover, seven daily IWW samples discharged from a hospital were also collected. A preliminary wide-scope screening using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry allowed to identify a wide number of pharmaceuticals in the samples. Based on the screening findings, a list of 40 compounds was established for subsequent target quantitative analyses by LC-tandem mass spectrometry. Up to 75% of the compounds investigated were present in all wastewater samples. Analyte concentrations in hospital discharge samples were significantly higher, evidencing an important contribution in terms of pharmaceuticals content. Antibiotics showed the highest concentrations during the winter season, which could be related to the increase in the prescription of these compounds to treat respiratory infections. Data from this work show that the biological treatment applied was able to eliminate nearly half of the compounds under study, although still 12 pharmaceuticals were not or poorly removed.

AB Anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater offers the prospect of a new paradigm by reducing aeration costs and minimizing sludge production. It has been successfully applied in warm climates, but does not always achieve the desired outcomes in temperate climates at the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values of municipal crude wastewater. Recently the concept of fortification' has been proposed to increase organic strength and has been demonstrated at the laboratory and pilot scale treating municipal wastewater at temperatures of 10-17 degrees C. The process treats a proportion of the flow anaerobically by combining it with primary sludge from the residual flow and then polishing it to a high effluent standard aerobically. Energy consumption is reduced as is sludge production. However, no new treatment process is viable if it only addresses the problems of traditional pollutants (suspended solids - SS, BOD, nitrogen - N and phosphorus - P); it must also treat hazardous substances. This study compared three potential municipal anaerobic treatment regimes, crude wastewater in an expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) reactor, fortified crude wastewater in an EGSB and crude wastewater in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor. The benefits of fortification were demonstrated for the removal of SS, BOD, N and P. These three systems were further challenged with the removal of steroid estrogens at environmental concentrations from natural indigenous sources. All three systems removed these compounds to a significant degree, confirming that estrogen removal is not restricted to highly aerobic autotrophs, or aerobic heterotrophs, but is also a faculty of anaerobic bacteria.

AB Sewage sludge sorption and desorption measurements were conducted for nine diverse contaminants of varying polarity: caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, atrazine, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, diclofenac, and, for the first time desethylatrazine and norethindrone. Two types of sorption behaviour were observed. Compounds with a log octanol-water partition coefficient, log K-ow, below 3 showed little or no sorption over 48 hours of shaking, while compounds with log K-ow over 3 showed 30 to 90% sorption within the first few minutes. After 6 hours of shaking, mass loss through suspected biotransformation became evident for some compounds. At the pH range considered (5.7-6.7), diclofenac (p(Ka) 4.0, log K-ow 4.5) was the only compound in which pH dependent sorption could be quantified. The log sewage sludge-water distribution coefficients, log K-d, ranged from 0.2 to 2.9, and, as expected, increased with increasing log K-ow of the compound and organic carbon (OC) content of the sewage sludge. A sewage sludge precipitated with alum had a substantially lower K-d values, as well as lower OC content, compared to alum-free sludge. Desorption was studied by sequentially replacing supernatant water. With each water replacement, log K-d values tended to either remain similar (following a linear isotherm) or in some cases increase (following a Freundlich-type isotherm). The length of time required to restore equilibrium increased with each rinsing step. A literature review of reported K-d values compared well with the alum-free sludge data, but not the alum-sludge data. Sewage sludge K-d across the literature appear more consistent with increasing K-ow.

AB In recent years, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in various environmental matrices, including ground water, surface water, and municipal wastewater. In order to evaluate the impact of PPCPs on environment, their distribution must be accurately established in these matrices first, as very limited studies have been carried out especially in the Indian subcontinent. In this study, the occurrence and removal of an antibiotic, Amoxicillin, at a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Delhi has been studied. Amoxicillin was selected for its widespread use as a prescribed over the counter drug. Sampling exercises were carried out over a period of six months so as to cover seasonal variations. Sewage samples were collected from the influents and effluents of STP to determine the occurrences and removal of the amoxicillin. Concentration of amoxicillin in the untreated raw sewage at the STP varied from not detected (ND) to 172.6ngL(-1). After treatment, it varied from ND to 62.5ngL(-1). Average removal efficiency was 49.7%. Presently, there is great focus on the reuse of the treated sewage. So, findings of the study can help to build a better understanding of reuse options for treated effluents and preparation of appropriate water resources management plans.

AB The decomposition of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (B), nonylphenol (NP), and bisphenol A (BPA) during ozonation of municipal sewage grabbed from the outlets of primary sedimentation tanks was studied through laboratory-scale experiments. A newly developed in vitro bioassay called nuclear receptor-ligand assay and GC-MS were both utilized to respectively determine the estrogenicity and individual ENS in the wastewater samples. The original estrogenicity, expressed as the E2 equivalent concentration (EEQC), in the primary effluents was 315-1018 ng/ L. Results indicate that the EEQC can be reduced rapidly to below 10 ng/L after ozonation. The appearance of 0.1 mg/L dissolved ozone (DO3) which corresponds to a consumed ozone amount of 0.4 mg per initial TOC (total organic carbon) of wastewater samples, was an appropriate operational parameter to simultaneously achieve efficient EDC removal and control of BrO3- and total organic bromine (TOBr). The presence of suspended solids in the range of 38-67 mg/L exhibited no obvious impact on the removal of nonsorbed estrogenicity. A complete decomposition of E2, E3 and BPA was achieved once 0.1 mg/L 003 appeared in the primary effluent. The oxidative decomposition of NP was relatively less efficient with a residual concentration of 100 ng/L. This work investigates the feasibility of EDC removal and brominated byproduct control during ozonation of original municipal sewage prior to biological treatment.

AB This study investigates the use of ozone as a pretreatment process for water containing pharmaceuticals. Experiments were carried out on synthetic wastewater, surface water, and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant. The degradation efficiencies of four groups of pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, estrogens, acidic, and neutral) were studied, and the effect of ozone dose and pH on the degradation efficiency was monitored. A Microtox bioassay test was used to evaluate the change in the toxicity of aqueous solutions before and after ozonation. The efficiency of oxidation of antibiotics, estrogens, and neutral pharmaceuticals increased as the ozone dose and pH increased. Ozone input dose of 188.1, 222.3, and 222.4 mgh(-1)was found to be optimum yielding the highest oxidation efficiency for the studied pharmaceuticals in synthetic wastewater, surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment plant, respectively. An average specific ozone dose of 2.05 for antibiotics, 1.11 for estrogens, and 1.30 mg O-3/mg DOC for neutral pharmaceuticals reduced significantly the acute the toxicity of the water solutions and mineralized more than 40%, 33%, and 23% of DOC in less than 1 min. The kinetics of ozone with pharmaceuticals was modeled for synthetic wastewater as an overall second-order reaction with a rate constant ranging from 10(3) to 10(6) M(-1)s(-1). The results indicate the effectiveness of ozone-based advanced oxidation processes in removing emerging pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. The results showed that ozonation process is more effective than other conventional oxidation processes (Cl-2 and ClO2) in eliminating pharmaceuticals and reducing the toxicity of the effluent water or wastewater.

AB Background: The fate of 14 antidepressants along with their respective N-desmethyl metabolites and the anticonvulsive drug carbamazepine was examined in a primary sewage treatment plant (STP) and following advanced treatments with ozone (O-3). The concentrations of each pharmaceutical compound were determined in raw sewage, effluent and sewage sludge samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The occurrence of antidepressant by-products formed in treated effluent after ozonation was also investigated.
   Results: Current primary treatments using physical and chemical processes removed little of the compounds (mean removal efficiency: 19%). Experimental sorption coefficients (K-d) of each studied compounds were also calculated. Sorption of venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, and carbamazepine on sludge was assumed to be negligible (log K-d <= 2), but higher sorption behavior can be expected for sertraline (log K-d >= 4). Ozonation treatment with O-3 (5 mg/L) led to a satisfactory mean removal efficiency of 88% of the compounds. Screening of the final ozone-treated effluent samples by high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) did confirm the presence of related N-oxide by-products.
   Conclusion: Effluent ozonation led to higher mean removal efficiencies than current primary treatment, and therefore represented a promising strategy for the elimination of antidepressants in urban wastewaters. However, the use of O-3 produced by-products with unknown toxicity.

AB In Mediterranean regions where the population is rapidly growing, the risk of water resource contamination by wastewater is likely to increase. This is the case of the Herault watershed (south of France), where the presence of treated wastewater in surface and ground waters has been shown in a previous study. To assess the consequence of these wastewater contaminations as regards pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds, 16 common pharmaceuticals (amitryptilin, acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, clenbuterol, diazepam, diclofenac, doxepin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, imipramine, ketoprofen, naproxen, nordiazepam, paracetamol, salbutamol, and terbutalin) as well as wastewater related pollutants (caffeine, gadolinium anomaly, and boron) were analyzed in wells pumped for potable water supply and in two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In addition, a monitoring along the Lergue River (the main tributary of the Herault River) was achieved to assess pharmaceutical behavior in surface waters. Pharmaceuticals and other wastewater-related contaminants are present in several reservoirs tapped for drinking water, confirming wastewater contamination; paracetamol, caffeine, and diclofenac are the most frequently detected. Paracetamol is present at rather high concentrations (up to 11 mu g/L and 211 ng/L, respectively, in a wastewater effluent and in a drinking water sample). Though degradable in WWTP, caffeine is commonly encountered in surface waters and detected in highly polluted groundwater. On the contrary, acetylsalicylic acid concentrations are generally low despite a large consumption in France; this is related to its metabolism in humans and rapid degradation in the aquatic environment. The monitoring of pharmaceuticals along the Lergue River shows that dilution is sufficient to decrease pharmaceutical values.

AB A target screening method using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) was developed. The method was applied to 14 groundwater and 11 surface water samples of a former wastewater infiltration site, where raw wastewater was applied until 1985 and treated wastewater is applied since 2005. The measured data are compared with mass spectrometric data of over 2000 organic micropollutants (OMPs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, industrial chemicals and metabolites of these classes. A total number of 151 and 159 OMPs were detected in groundwater and surface water, respectively, of which 12 have not been reported before in these matrices. Among these 12 compounds were 11 pharmaceuticals and one personal care product. The identity of 55 of the detected OMPs (35%) was verified by analysis of standard compounds. Based on the distribution in the study area, two groups of OMPs were clearly distinguished: current OMPs introduced with treated municipal wastewater since 2005 and legacy OMPs originating from infiltration of untreated wastewater until 1985. A third group included OMPs contained in historic as well as in current wastewater. During infiltration, OMPs with molecular mass >500 g/mol and log Dow > 3.9 were preferentially removed. Speciation had a strong impact with cationic OMPs showing high, neutral OMPs medium and anionic OMPs lowest elimination during infiltration. This target screening method proved useful to study a wide range of compounds, even in retrospect and at sites with poorly documented history and with a complex and variable hydrological situation.

AB Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. In sewer systems, human-associated and environmental bacteria are mixed together and exposed to many substances known to increase HGT, including various antibacterial compounds. In wastewaters, those substances are most often detected below concentrations known to induce HGT individually. Still, it is possible that such wastewaters induce HGT, for example via mixture effects. Here, a panel of antibiotics, biocides and other pharmaceuticals was measured in filter-sterilized municipal and hospital wastewater samples from Gothenburg, Sweden. The effects on HGT of the chemical mixtures in these samples were investigated by exposing a complex bacterial donor community together with a GFP-tagged E. coli. recipient strain. Recipients that captured sulfonamide resistance-conferring mobile genetic elements (MGEs) from the bacterial community were enumerated and characterized by replicon typing, antibiotic susceptibility testing and long read sequencing. While exposure to municipal wastewater did not result in any detectable change in HGT rates, exposure to hospital wastewater was associated with an increase in the proportion of recipients that acquired sulfonamide resistance but also a drastic decrease in the total number of recipients. Although, concentrations were generally higher in hospital than municipal wastewater, none of the measured substances could individually explain the observed effects of hospital wastewater. The great majority of the MGEs captured were Inch plasmids, and resistance to several antibiotics was co-transferred in most cases. Taken together, the data show no evidence that chemicals present in the studied municipal wastewater induce HGT. Still, the increased relative abundance of transconjugants after exposure to hospital wastewater could have implications for the risks of both emergence and transmission of resistant bacteria.

Analogue internal standards for fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporines), nitroimidazoles and tetracyclines were successfully used for calibration and shown to generally improve precision compared to external calibration. Matrix components caused ion suppression/enhancement effects during the MS detection for all analytes studied. Two effects were observed: general suppression and short-term variations in the MS response.
   In the hospital sewage water large temporal variations in the analyte concentration were observed during the course of the sampling period (seven grab samples in 13 h). Analyte concentrations varied within the following ranges (in mug l(-1)): ciprofloxacin, 3.6-101.0; metronidazole, 0.1-90.2; sulfamethoxazole, 0.4-12.8; ofloxacin, 0.2-7.6; trimethoprim, 0.6-7.6; and doxycycline, 0.6-6.7.

AB Toxic anions and heavy metals are one of the most important issues of concern in the world because of their exposure to ionic contamination, which is very common, as well as their potential for the environment and human health. Until now, the applications of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied extensively in many different fields such as filtering, purification, detection and storage. However, for some contaminations (eg organic pollutants, heavy metals and hazardous chemicals), their use in the field of wastewater treatment (WWT) has not yet been fully assessed. In this chapter, we discussed the development and comparison of traditional materials based on metal organic frameworks based wastewater treatment techniques. The process of pollutants in water and the performance and details of MOFs in different treatment areas have been emphasized.

AB Chemical analysis of raw wastewater in order to assess the presence of biological markers entering a wastewater treatment, plant can provide objective information about the health and lifestyle of the population connected to the sewer system. This work was performed in a tropical country of Central America, Costa Rica, with the aim of extending this knowledge to new world regions. This work is the first to report wastewater-based epidemiological data on the use of illicit drugs in this region of the world. Composite wastewater samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment facilities and surface water samples from surrounding areas were collected applying the best practice protocol and analysed to investigate the occurrence and fate of selected illicit drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Results showed the presence of chemical indicators of the classic drugs cocaine and cannabis at high concentration levels, besides the moderate presence of the opiates codeine and morphine. Neither the worldwide commonly used psychoactive substances of abuse such as synthetic phenethylamines, nor pharmaceuticals from the family of benzodiazepines were detected, demonstrating the spatial differences in drug use among different world regions. In addition, effluent wastewater samples were analysed and compared to influent concentrations in order to evaluate the decrease in concentration of the targeted analytes through two treatment technologies. As a final step, a wide-scope qualitative screening, including hundreds of suspect compounds, was applied in order to have a better knowledge on the presence of pharmaceuticals in waters and to assess the potential impact of the treated wastewater into the receiving aquatic ecosystems.

AB Rosuvastatin (RST) and atorvastatin (ATO) are prescription drugs and members in the statin family used for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. A method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of ATO, RST and its metabolite rosuvastatin lactone (RSTL) in sewage and surface water samples has been developed. In the influent and effluent samples collected from 11 sewage treatment plants located in Ontario, Canada, ATO, RST, and RSTL were detected in all samples with median concentrations of 166 ng L(-1) (influent) and 77 ng L(-1) (effluent) for ATO, 448 ng L(-1) (influent) and 324 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RST, as well as 158 ng L(-1) (influent) and 41 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RSTL. Due to the inter-conversion between RST and RSTL, the total concentration of RST and RSTL in a sewage sample should be reported. The median removal rate by wastewater treatment was 66% for ATO and 22% for RST and RSTL combined. These statins were quite persistent in sewage. After a storage period of 21 and 62 days, there was only a slight decrease in ATO concentration and no change in the total RST concentrations. These three compounds were also detected in a number of surface water samples at low ng L(-1) concentrations. This is the first reported occurrence and fate of RST and RSTL in the Canadian aquatic environment. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study an analytical procedure of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was elaborated and validated for simultaneous determination of 11 acidic, neutral and basic emerging contaminants in wastewater. The most frequently used pharmaceuticals were studied, i.e. five anti-inflammatory drugs - ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen and salicylic acid, an antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, clofibric acid, antibacterial triclosan, a plasticiser bisphenol A and two beta-blockers - propranolol and metoprolol. Sample enrichment was performed using Oasis HLB sorbent. Sample pH and sorbent washing step during the solid-phase extraction were optimised on real wastewater samples. Recoveries of the most polar acidic compounds diminished substantially when the alkalinity of the sample loaded into the cartridge increased. Thus finally wastewater was extracted at pH 2.0. Before elution, sorbent was washed subsequently with 5% methanol in water and n-hexane, which resulted in best recoveries of most of the target compounds and reduced a co-elution phenomena with respect to beta-blockers. The optimised method was successfully applied to influent and effluent samples from wastewater treatment plant, Krakow, Poland. All target compounds except propranolol were identified in wastewater at a concentration up to 12.8 mu g L-1.

AB In 2008, Lake Havasu City, Arizona, began a treated wastewater subsurface recharge program at its North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRP) to store treated wastewater, which is planned to be seasonally recovered for irrigation during the summer months. As a proactive measure, the city decided to monitor a suite of pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants (PECs) along with required regulatory constituents, e. g., nitrate. Potential contributing sources of PECs throughout the water system were identified, resulting in only six constituents detected in the untreated drinking water and treated drinking water, all at concentrations less than 50 ng/L. Thirty-three of 40 PECs analyzed were identified in the city's treated wastewater streams, with concentrations ranging from just above the detection level to 9000 ng/L (pseudoephedrine), clearly showing the dominating local urban use of these compounds. NRP treated wastewater is recharged via vadose zone injection wells. It migrates through alluvial fans sediments, some containing interstitial clays, forming a water mound and blending with groundwater of the Colorado River Aquifer. Sixteen of 33 PECs present in the NRP treated wastewater have concentrations above detection limits (>10 ng/L) within 150 m (492 ft) of the injection wells. Six PECs (sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, primidone, phenytoin, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and meprobamate) remained above their respective detection limit in monitoring wells that penetrate sediments largely free of clay more than 560 m (1,840 ft) away from the injection wells.

AB The anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac are frequently found as residues in the aquatic environment and also in samples of ground and drinking water. For both compounds, their loads occurring in the effluents from a military hospital and in the combined (household and hospital) sewage of a sewage pumping station (SPS) and a large municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) were predicted and measured within a field trial by collecting and analyzing defined composite samples over a time period of I week. The use of pharmacokinetic data and precise information on the administration of the individual medicinal formulation was found to be essential for the validity of the predicted data. The measured data confirmed the validity of the predicted loads with recoveries between 63 and 102% for carbamazepine and around 35% for diclofenac, in the hospital wastewater. A comparison of the weekly loads predicted and measured in the influents and effluents of a STP in Berlin (Germany) yielded a very low removal rate for diclofenac (less than 15%) and a removal rate of up to 40% for carbamazepine. In total, 2.0 kg of carbamazepine per week (105 kg/a) and 4.4kg of diclofenac per week (226 kg/a) were discharged into Berlin's surface water by the municipal STP, which treats both household sewage from approximately one million inhabitants and large amounts of hospital effluents (approximately 12,060 hospital beds).

AB The present study determined environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals, cocaine, and the main human metabolite of cocaine in seawater sampled from a subtropical coastal zone (Santos, Brazil). The Santos Bay is located in a metropolitan region and receives over 7367 m(3) of wastewater per day. Five sample points under strong influence of the submarine sewage outfall were chosen. Through quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS, 33 compounds were investigated. Seven pharmaceuticals (atenolol, acetaminophen, caffeine, losartan, valsartan, diclofenac, and ibuprofen), an illicit drug (cocaine), and its main humanmetabolite (benzoylecgonine) were detected at least once in seawater sampled from Santos Bay at concentrations that ranged from ng.L-1 to mu g.L-1. In light of the possibility of bioaccumulation and harmful effects, the high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and cocaine found in this marine subtropical ecosystem are of environmental concern.

AB Management of wastewater sludge continues to pose a challenge as its generation is rising as a result of an increase in wastewater treatment and because its quality varies widely. Lately, emerging pollutants have gained importance based on their persistence and potential risk once they enter the environment. Different treatment processes have been proposed to reduce their concentration, such as electrooxidation. Electrooxidation using boron doped diamond electrodes has properties that make them suitable for a wide variety of applications, including wastewater and sludge. Electrooxidation was applied to sludge from a wastewater treatment plant receiving industrial discharges located in Toluca, Mexico. Different pH and current densities were tested at the laboratory and, based on soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) reduction, operating conditions were set at a pH of 3 and a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) during 1 h. Oxidation of organic matter was limited by the concentration of solids during treatment as phased separation (flotation) occurred due to gas generation and additional tests were performed to overcome this situation. 4,4'-(Propane-2,2-diyl) diphenol, Nonylphenol, and 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol were removed by 73%, 89%, and 82% under improved test conditions. Sludge volatile solids were degraded 23% and total COD 27%. Overall, the proposed process represents a promising technology to reduce emerging pollutants in wastewater sludge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A number of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been detected in the aquatic environment as a result of discharges of municipal wastewater. In the state of Louisiana, USA, many municipalities treat wastewater using natural systems, such as lagoons and wetlands, rather than conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Nearly all research to date has focused on the fate of PhACs in conventional treatment plants, not constructed and natural wetlands. In the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for Mandeville, Louisiana, USA, wastewater flows of 76000 m(3) d(-1) are treated in a series of aeration lagoons (basins), followed by a constructed wetland and UV disinfection, before being discharged into a natural forested wetland (i.e. Bayou Chinchuba) and eventually, Lake Pontchartrain. Thirteen out of the 15PhACs investigated were detected in the wastewater inflow to the treatment plant. Only 9 of the 13 compounds were above the detection limits at the treatment plant effluent. The concentrations of most compounds were reduced by greater than 90% within the plant, while carbamazepine and sotalol were only reduced by 51% and 82%, respectively. The percent reductions observed in the Mandeville system were greater than reduction rates reported for conventional WWTPs; perhaps due to the longer treatment time (similar to 30 days). Most target PhACs were not completely removed before discharge into Lake Pontchartrain, although their collective annual loading was reduced to less than 1 kg and down to ppb with significant potential for dilution in the large lake.

AB An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of the four most detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in wastewater, namely ibuprofen (IBF), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DFC) and ketoprofen (KFN), was developed based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Extraction from wastewater samples was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges, while meclofenamic acid (MFC) was used as surrogate. The optimisation of SPE procedure included the type of the extraction solvent used for the elution and the pH of the loading solution (acidic or neutral). The developed extraction procedure resulted in good repeatability and reproducibility with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 10% for all the compounds. Moreover, satisfactory recoveries (>98%) were obtained. Chromatographic analysis was achieved after derivatisation with bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1% trimethyl chlorosilane (TMCS) in the presence of pyridine, a derivatisation mixture used for the first time for these compounds. The limits of detection (LODs) of the method varied from 0.37 (KFN) to 3.1 ng L-1 (NPX). The analytical method was successfully applied for the determination of these compounds in the raw and treated wastewater of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of the city of Mytilene in Lesvos, Greece. The maximum concentrations were detected in raw wastewater originated from a hospital and they were 574 ng L-1 and 704 ngL(-1) for IBF and KFN, respectively.

AB Soil-aquifer treatment is a wastewater treatment and reclamation option to facilitate beneficial water reuse. The fate of wastewater originated micropollutants in the soil-aquifer system is important to understand. In the study the sorption behavior of potential wastewater indicators such as two antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, primidone), one sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole), and one corrosion inhibitor (benzotriazole) were determined with three natural soils (Lufa 2.2, Euro Soil 5, and Wulpen sand) that differed in pH, organic carbon content and particle size distribution. As aqueous phase a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution as well as the effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used. Affinities of all analytes to the soil increased from Wulpen sand, over Lufa 2.2 to Euro Soil 5, indicating that the organic carbon contents might be crucial for sorption. isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model. Sorption was mainly close to linear (n = 0.93-1.07) for most target compounds and soils. Desorption gave rise to a small hysteresis only for Euro Soil 5 which was likely artificial, due to slow desorption kinetics beyond 24 h used in the experiment. All sorption studies confirmed that Carbamazepine, Benzotriazole and Primidone are appropriate to be used as wastewater indicator substances based on their low sorption affinity to soils, while the suitability of Sulfamethoxazole is limited due to the formation of non-extractable residues, especially at lower pH values.

AB Estrogenic compounds have been monitored for one year at an urban sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Tunisia, to evaluate their fate and seasonal variations. The concentrations of these compounds were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC MS). Results showed that the highest removal of all estrogens (>= 80%) was observed in summer. Mass balance analysis revealed that biodegradation was the predominant removal mechanism. Moreover, the results showed that the removal efficiency of the studied emerging micropollutants and their concentrations in the solid phase of return sludge were much higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. These findings were closely related to microbial activity and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSSs). Finally, the findings can be used to help with the modifications that could be implemented in that STP for the improved removal of estrogenic contaminants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrothermal treatment involving the oxidation and gasification of sewage sludge and pharmaceutical wastewater samples has been carried out in batch autoclave reactor. The efficiency of the oxidation processes measured in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) and total solids (TS) removal showed that effective sample treatments were achieved at moderately low temperatures of 350-450 degrees C. More than 90% TOC removal was achieved in all samples, with samples with lower organic contents reaching above 99% TOC removal. A maximum of 78% TS removal was achieved due to the high initial ash contents of the samples. Alkaline hydrothermal gasification of the samples with very high TOC contents yielded gas products rich in hydrogen gas and methane. Due to high concentrations of acetonitrile in some of the samples, the yields of methane were high, giving calorific values of the product gases of up to 35 MJ/m(3) in some samples; however, the gasification process resulted in lower TOC destruction compared to the oxidation process.

Among the WTP studied, samples from Samambaia showed higher concentrations (from 3866 to 2477 ng L-1 of BE and 805 to 579 ng L-1 of COC) and doses per inhabitants (more than 13 doses inhabitant(-1) per year). The extrapolation to the whole FD population points out to an annual consumption reaching 1.0 ton of free base cocaine, or 1.1 tons of cocaine hydrochloride. The work also addresses the influence of the cocaine presentation form (free base or hydrochloride) and the integration with chemical profiling results in a more realistic estimate, mainly concerning the viewpoints of forensics and law enforcement.

AB This study aimed to provide the first and comprehensive data on the occurrence of 17 target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in urban water environment in Singapore. Meanwhile, this study also verified the suitability of these PPCPs as specific markers of raw wastewater contamination in receiving water bodies in highly urbanized areas where both surface water and groundwater are not impacted by the discharge of treated wastewater effluents. Analytical results of wastewater showed that among 17 target PPCPs examined, only 5 PPCPs were detected in 100 % of raw wastewater samples, including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CF), diethyltoluamide (DEET), and salicylic acid (SA). Similarly, these PPCPs were found in most surface water and groundwater. Interestingly, the three PPCPs (ACT, CBZ, and SA) were only detected in surface water and groundwater in the sampling sites close to relatively older sewer systems, while they were absent in background samples that were collected from the catchment with no known wastewater sources. This suggests that ACT, CBZ, and SA can be used as specific molecular markers of raw wastewater in surface water and groundwater. This study also confirmed that CF and DEET were not really associated with wastewater sources, thus cannot serve well as specific molecular markers of wastewater contamination in receiving water bodies. To the best knowledge of the authors, the use of ACT and SA as specific molecular markers of raw wastewater contamination in urban surface waters and groundwater was first reported. Further studies on the use of ACT, CBZ, and SA along with other chemical/microbial markers are recommended to identify and differentiate contamination sources of surface waters/groundwater.

AB Extended anaerobic conditions during biological wastewater treatment may enhance the biodegradation of micropollutants. To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites.
   The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%).
   In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of antibiotics in the wastewater is one of the important issues related to environmental management. In this study, antibiotics-degrading bacteria were screened from the enriched sewage sludge sample. Among the isolated bacterial strains, Bacillus subtilis AQ03 showed maximum antibiotic tolerance ( 2000 ppm). The characterized strain B. subtilis AQ03 degraded sulfamethaoxazole and sulfamethoxine and the optimum nutrient and physical-factors were analyzed. B. subtilis AQ03 degraded 99.8 +/- 1.3 % sulfamethaoxazole, and 93.3 +/- 6.2 % sulfamethoxine. Sodium nitrate and ammonium chloride were improved antibiotics degradation (<90 %). The optimized conditions were maintained in a moving bed bioreactor for the removal of antibiotics and nutrients from the wastewater. The selected strain considerably produced proteases (109.4 U/mL), amylases (55.1 U/mL), cellulase (9.6 U/mL) and laccases (15.2). In moving bed reactor, sulfamethaoxazole degradation was maximum after 8 days (100 +/- 1.5 %) and sulfamethoxazole (100 +/- 0) was removed completely from wastewater after 10 days. In moving bed reactor, biological oxygen demand (92.1 +/- 2.8 %), chemical oxygen demand (79.6 +/- 1.2 %), nitrate (89.4 +/- 3.9 %) and phosphate (91.8 +/- 1.2) were removed from the wastewater along with antibiotics after 10 days of treatment. The findings indicate that the indigenous bacterial communities and the ability to survive in the presence of high antibiotic concentrations and xenobiotics. Moving bed bioreactor is useful for the removal of nutrients and antibiotics from wastewater.

AB The present study describes the evaluation of the risk posed by the occurrence of sulfonamides (SAs) in wastewaters. A fully automated analytical method based on on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (on line SPE-LC-MS/MS) was developed, validated and applied for the analysis of sixteen SAs and, for the first time in wastewaters and sewage sludge, five of their acetylated metabolites. Influent and effluent samples from twenty two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Catalonia (Spain) and sewage sludge from fifteen of them were analyzed: removal rates (RE%) and half-lives (t(1/2)) for each SA were calculated. The estimated correlations between RE% and to the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the different plants indicated no clear influence of HRT on removals. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfapyridine (SPY) and their corresponding acetylated metabolites were detected with the highest frequencies of detection and at the highest concentrations. The ecotoxicity of both SPY and AcSPY was evaluated for the first time through bioluminescent inhibition assays, resulting in a higher toxicity being attributed to the metabolite. Finally, the potential environmental risk posed by the levels of SAs detected was evaluated calculating the hazard quotients (HQ) to different non-target aquatic organisms in treated wastewaters. SMX was the only SA posing a risk to algae, with an HQ > 10. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study discusses the occurrence and environmental risk associated with a micropollutant plume originating from the direct discharge of treated wastewater into the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. The temporal variations and spatial extent of the plume and its effect on the presence of 39 pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in the Vidy Bay were assessed over a 10 month period. A pronounced plume was observed from April to October, leading to locally elevated (up to 70-fold) pharmaceutical concentrations compared to the surrounding water column. For three of the measured substances, these plume-associated concentrations were sufficiently high to pose an ecotoxicological risk. The plume depth followed the thermal lake stratification, which moved to lower depths over the course of the warm seasons. Pharmaceutical hotspots associated with the plume were detected as far as 1.5 km downstream of the effluent wastewater outfall, but concentrations typically decreased with increasing distance from the wastewater outfall as a result of dilution and photodegradation. From November to January, when uniform temperature prevailed throughout the water column, no micropollutant plumes were detected. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, most pesticides showed homogeneous concentrations throughout the Vidy Bay during the whole study period, indicating that the effluent wastewater was not their dominant source. A strong linear correlation between electrical conductivity and concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants was identified. This relation will allow future estimates of wastewater-derived micropollutant concentrations via simple conductivity measurements.

AB Diffuse sources of pollution such as sewer leakages, sewer overflows, illicit discharges and stormwater runoff affect the urban surface water quality but often remain unknown. Therefore, the development of chemical markers for identifying and characterizing the origin of diffuse sources of pollution in urban surface waters is a requisite for protecting and managing urban water resources. In this study, the occurrence of 31 emerging contaminants (ECs) in untreated wastewater, treated wastewater, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural stormwater runoff, and freshwater bodies was investigated. Artificial sweeteners (ASs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were more frequently detected in the collected water samples. In raw wastewater, 21 target ECs were detected 100% in the collected samples with median concentrations ranging from 49.6 to 77,721 ng/L, while in freshwater bodies, only 13 compounds were found with detection frequency >50%. The median concentration of the majority of detected ECs in freshwater samples was below 100 ng/L. The suitability of ECs as chemical markers of diffuse sources in an urban watershed was assessed using a suite of criteria, including the detection frequency (DF), detection ratio (DR) (i.e. the ratio between median concentration and method quantification limit of a compound) and attenuation rates (i.e., biodegradation, sorption and abiotic degradation) in wastewater treatment processes. In addition, we propose a new key criterion, the concentration ratio (CR) of labile to conservative compounds, to evaluate the applicability of suitable chemical markers for source tracking. Using this new set of criteria (i.e. CR, DF, DR and attenuation rates), our analysis showed that among the investigated ECs, only acesulfame (ACE), acetaminophen (ACT), cyclamate (CYC), saccharin (SAC) were suitable as chemical markers of diffuse sources in surface waters. For caffeine (CF), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEFT), crotamiton (MIT), triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS), their median concentration ratio to sucralose (SUC) in water bodies was consistently higher than that in raw wastewater, suggesting that these compounds might be unsuitable as chemical markers of sewage leakage in surface waters for this study area.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiency of seven pharmaceuticals (norfloxacin, trimethoprim, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine) were determined in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic, anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditches processes in Xuzhou City, Eastern China. The results showed that seven pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent samples with concentrations ranging from 93 to 2540 ng center dot L-1. The removal of these substances among the three different STPs varied from 36 to 84%, with the highest performance obtained by the wastewater treatment works with tertiary treatment (sand filtration). Most of the compounds were removed effectively during biologic treatment while sand filtration treatment also made a contribution to the total elimination of most pharmaceuticals. The efficiency comparison of the three sewage treatment processes showed that the STP which employed anaerobic/anoxic/oxic was more effective to remove pharmaceuticals than the oxidation ditches and anoxic/oxic.

AB An assessment of the sewage occurrence and biodegradability of seven parabens and three halogenated derivatives of methyl paraben (MeP) is presented. Several wastewater samples were collected at three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during April and May 2010, concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). The performance of the QTOF system proved to be comparable to triple-quadrupole instruments in terms of quantitative capabilities, with good linearity (R(2) > 0.99 in the 5-500 ng mL(-1) range), repeatability (RSD < 5.6%) and LODs (0.3-4.0 ng L(-1) after SPE). MeP and n-propyl paraben (n-PrP) were the most frequently detected and the most abundant analytes in raw wastewater (0.3-10 mu g L(-1)), in accordance with the data displayed in the bibliography and reflecting their wider use in cosmetic formulations. Samples were also evaluated in search for potential halogenated by-products of parabens, formed as a result of their reaction with residual chlorine contained in tap water. Monochloro- and dichloro-methyl paraben (ClMeP and Cl(2)MeP) were found and quantified in raw wastewater at levels between 0.01 and 0.1 mu g L(-1). Halogenated derivatives of n-PrP could not be quantified due to the lack of standards; nevertheless, the monochlorinated species (ClPrP) was identified in several samples from its accurate precursor and product ions mass/charge ratios (m/z). Removal efficiencies of parabens and MeP chlorinated by-products in WWTPs exceeded 90%, with the lowest percentages corresponding to the latter species. This trend was confirmed by an activated sludge biodegradation batch test, where non-halogenated parabens had half-lives lower than 4 days, whereas halogenated derivatives of MeP turned out to be more persistent, with up to 10 days of half-life in the case of dihalogenated derivatives. A further stability test performed with raw wastewater also showed that parabens degrade rapidly in real sewage, with half-lives lower than 10 h for n-butyl-paraben, while dihalogenated species again turned out to be more stable, with half-lives longer than a week.

AB The tested facility was a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Swarzewo, where the wastewater treatment takes place in aeration chambers with activated sludge using sequential batch reactors (SBRs). The concentration of the following pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, paracetamol, flurbiprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and its metabolites 5OH-diclofenac and 4OH-diclofenac was tested in influents and effluents. Simultaneously, the conventional parameters were characterised. The removal of conventional pollutants was high (94.4-99.5%). At the same time, the removal of pharmaceuticals was variable. In the case of diclofenac and its metabolites, the concentration in the effluent was higher than in the influents. The risk quotients (RQs) calculated for analyzed pharmaceuticals suggest low environmental risk for selected species. However, negative impact for the biota due to the chronic presence of diclofenac cannot be excluded. It can be concluded that the SBRs, similarly to traditional flow activated sludge technology, are not efficient in the removal of target pharmaceuticals.

AB Thousands of chemicals have been identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), but prioritizing them concerning ecological and human health risks is challenging. We explored the use of sewage treatment plants as chemical observatories to conveniently identify persistent and bioaccumulative CECs, including toxic organohalides. Nationally representative samples of sewage sludge (biosolids) were analyzed for 231 CECs, of which 123 were detected. Ten of the top 11 most abundant CECs in biosolids were found to be high-production volume chemicals, eight of which representing priority chemicals, including three flame retardants, three surfactants and two antimicrobials. A comparison of chemicals detected in nationally representative biological specimens from humans and municipal biosolids revealed 70% overlap. This observed co-occurrence of contaminants in both matrices suggests that the analysis of sewage sludge can inform human health risk assessments by providing current information on toxic exposures in human populations and associated body burdens of harmful environmental pollutants.

AB Sewage epidemiology has been proven as an effective approach to estimate the use of illicit drugs by a population. In this study, sewage analysis was applied to examine the patterns of amphetamine (AMP) and methamphetamine (METH) uses in the urban area of Beijing. Influent and effluent samples were collected from all the thirteen sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the urban area during two sampling campaigns. METH concentrations in influents were found to range from several tens to several hundred ng.L-1, whereas AMP concentrations ranged from several to several tens ng.L-1. The concentration ratios between AMP and METH in influents at most STPs were close to the rate of AMP excretion following METH ingestion, indicating that AMP in sewage in Beijing was predominately from the metabolism of METH. Much higher METH loads were observed in the center part of the urban area in Beijing, indicating a strong correlation between METH use and economic level and entertainment activities. Seasonal variation in METH loads was significant, with greater use in summer than in winter. Significant difference in METH loads between weekdays and weekend days were observed in winter but not in summer. No clear trend in diurnal variation of METH use was observed. Nearly complete removal of METH occurred at the STPS in Beijing. Apparent removal rates of AMP were lower than those of METH, likely due to degradation of METH into AMP during the wastewater treatment processes. In summary, this study represents the first application of sewage epidemiology to the entire urban population of a metropolitan in mainland China and provided an overview of METH and AMP uses in the city.

AB Sewage treatment plants (STP) are an important source of short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) to the ambient environment through discharge of effluent and application of sludge. In this work, a field study was conducted to determine the behavior and possible removal of SCCPs during the sewage treatment process in an advanced municipal STP in Beijing, China. SCCPs were detected in all sewage water and sludge samples, and 97% of the initial mass loading in raw sewage was found to be associated with suspended matter. The total concentrations in raw influent, tertiary effluent, and dewatered sludge were 184 +/- 19 ng/L, 27 +/- 6 ng/L, and 15.6 +/- 1.4 mu g/g dry weight (d.w.), respectively. The dissolved concentrations of total SCCPs (Sigma SCCPs) significantly decreased during mechanical, biological, and chemical treatments. SCCP homologue profiles in aqueous phase were distinctly different from those in solid phase. Along the treatment process, the relative abundance of shorter chain and lower chlorinated congeners gradually increased in sewage water, but no obvious variations of homologue profiles were found in sludge. Mass flow analysis indicated, the removal efficiency in aqueous phase for Sigma SCCPs was 82.2%, and the congener-specific removal efficiencies were positively related to their solid water partition coefficients (K-d). Mass balance results indicated that 0.8% and 72.6% of the initial SCCP mass loading were ultimately found in the effluents and dewatered sludge, respectively, while the remaining 26.6% was lost mainly due to biodegradation/biotransformation. It was suggested that the activated sludge system including basic anaerobic anoxic aerobic processes played an effective role in removing SCCPs from the wastewater, while the sorption to sludge by hydrophobic interactions was an important fate of SCCPs during the sewage treatment.

AB The occurrence of 8 drugs of abuse and metabolites in the influent and effluent of the 3 Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) that treat wastewater from Valencia was studied in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Target drugs except 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-ACMOR) were detected in 100% of the influents. The WWTPs eliminate cocaine (COC), amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MAMP) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). Benzoylecgonine (BECG) was also efficiently eliminated (93-98%), whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) presented removal rates of 32-57% and ketamine (KET) was not eliminated. The most consumed illicit drugs, according to the estimated concentrations of each compound in the studied WWTPs, were cannabis and COC followed by KET, AMP, MAMP, MDMA and heroin. Environmental risk assessment was evaluated by calculating Risk Quotient (RQ). MDMA and KET could pose a medium risk and low risk, respectively, to the aquatic organisms. Although short-term environmental risk is not worrisome, long-term effects cannot be known exactly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The antiviral agent oseltamivir acid (OA, the active metabolite of Tamiflu) may occur at high concentrations in wastewater during pandemic influenza events. To eliminate OA and its antiviral activity from wastewater, ozonation and advanced oxidation processes were investigated. For circumneutral pH, kinetic measurements yielded second-order rate constants of 1.7 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) and 4.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for the reaction of OA with ozone and hydroxyl radical, respectively. During the degradation of OA by both oxidants, the antiviral activity of the treated aqueous solutions was measured by inhibition of neuraminidase activity of two different viral strains. A transient, moderate (two-fold) increase in antiviral activity was observed in solutions treated up to a level of 50% OA transformation, while for higher degrees of transformation the activity corresponded to that caused exclusively by OA. OA was efficiently removed by ozonation in a wastewater treatment plant effluent, suggesting that ozonation can be applied to remove OA from wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Literature frequently reports that colloids in aqueous matrices sorb a large fraction of pharmaceuticals. Since coagulation/flocculation removes colloids, it is expected that coagulation/flocculation in principle should be useful in concentrating pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment, which would facilitate the treatment of these refractory compounds. In our present work, we researched the potential of coagulation/flocculation for removing pharmaceuticals from raw sewage. Results from jar tests showed that pharmaceuticals are hardly removed from sewage with coagulation/flocculation. To investigate the discrepancy between reported colloidal sorption and the lack of removal when removing colloids, we tested a commonly applied experimental setup, which makes use of ultra-filtration (UF), for determining the colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals. The UF method under research was compared with an assessment making use of flocculation. Both methods, UF and flocculation, showed similar removal of colloids. However, during UF, the retention of pharmaceuticals reached values up to 93 +/- 4 %. In contrast, when removing the colloids with flocculation, no pharmaceutical removal was observed. These results confirm that it is very likely to introduce an analysis bias in using UF membranes in the determination of colloidal sorption of pharmaceuticals. In fact, results predict an over-estimation caused by a direct retention of pharmaceuticals without any binding to colloidal matter. Overall results of the current work show that pharmaceuticals hardly sorb to colloids and herewith the absence of removal of pharmaceuticals during coagulation/flocculation is explained.

AB Steroid hormone Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) (natural estrogens (17-beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), estriol (E3), synthetic estrogen (17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)), natural androgen (testosterone) (tes) and natural progestogen (progesterone) (pro)) at an activated sludge wastewater works (WWW), were quantitated using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The steroid hormone profile in the adjacent surface water was also determined. Pro was the most abundant (41%, 408 ng/L) in the influent, followed by tes (35%, 343 ng/L) and E2 (12%, 119 ng/L). El was the most abundant (35%, 23 ng/L) in effluent, followed by E2 (30%, 20 ng/L) and tes (17%, 11 ng/L). Chemical removal efficiencies of the steroid hormones by the WWW averaged 92%. High removal efficiency was observed for pro (98% +/- 2) and tes (96% +/- 1), compared to natural (72-100%) and synthetic estrogen (90% +/- 3), with biodegradation being the major removal route for pro and tes. The lowest removal for E2 is in spring (65%), and maximum removal is in winter (95%). Natural (E2, El) and synthetic estrogen (EE2) were major contributors to influent (E2 = 69%) and effluent (E2 = 73%) estrogenic potency. The estrogenic potency removal averaged 85% (range: 73-100). Risk assessment of the steroid hormones present in wastewater effluent, and surface water, indicated that EE2 and E2 pose the highest risk to human health and fish. EE2 was found to be much more resistant to biodegradation, compared to E2, in surface water. Estrone, as the breakdown product of E2 and EE2 in wastewater, appears to be suitable as an indicator of EDCs. The study suggests that a battery of tests: quantitative chemical assay, bioassay for estrogenic activity and risk assessment methods, collectively, are preferred in order to make meaningful, accurate conclusions regarding potential adverse effects of EDCs present in treated wastewater effluent or surface water, to the aquatic environment, human health, and wildlife systems.

AB Emerging contaminants present a challenge for water preservation, threatening humans' health and all ecosystems. They consist of a variety of molecules ranging from pharmaceutical and personal care products to pesticides and endocrine disruptors detectable in wastewater, sewage effluent, surface water, drinking water, and ground waters at trace level concentrations (e.g., ng/L, mu g/L). Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) possess low efficiency to remove them. Therefore, new technologies capable of removing such residues are needed. Lignin recognized as a renewable and abundant biopolymer is transformed through electrospinning into an anionic nanofibrous nonwoven adsorbent to extract those contaminants and dispose them safely. Electrospinning allows the manufacture of fibers at the micro- or nanoscale under the influence of an electric current. In this study, nanofibers of alkali lignin and a co-polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol), were developed and tested on the adsorption of a pharmaceutical contaminant (fluoxetine) in an aqueous solution. Results showed that the lignin nanofibers, of 156 nm in diameter, adsorbed 70% of fluoxetine in solution which corresponds to 32 ppm of contaminants removed in water.

AB Endotoxins are potential toxics impacting human health through respiration derived in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), yet the formation of endotoxins during wastewater treatment processes is still lacking research. In our study, the distribution of endotoxins and bacterial community structure in the wastewater of three full scale pharmaceutical WWTPs were explored using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test and MiSeq technique. Results showed that higher endotoxin activities in the influent of Plant A and Plant C (560 and 1140 EU/mL), stemming from the fermentation process, were found compared to that of Plant B (135 EU/mL), coming from the process of chemical synthesis. During the anaerobic treatment and the cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) in the three WWTPs, the endotoxin activity increased, while it declined in the aerobic treatment system. In all bioreactors, the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50.0-94.6%. Bacteria with high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in LAL assay were found at the genus level of Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Desulfovibrio, and Megasphaera.

AB The occurrence of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two wastewater treatment plants in Beijing was studied monthly over the course of one year. The removal of PPCPs by three biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS), biological nutrient removal (BNR), and membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared during different seasons. Seasonal variations of PPCPs in the wastewater influent were discrepant, while in the wastewater effluent, most PPCPs had lower concentrations in the summer than in the winter. For the easily biodegradable PPCPs, the performance of MBR was demonstrated to be more stable than CAS or BNR especially during winter months. Diclofenac, trimethoprim, metoprolol, and gemfibrozil could be moderately removed by MBR, while their removal by CAS and BNR was much lower or even negligible. Nevertheless, no removal was achieved regardless of the season or the treatment processes for the recalcitrant PPCPs. Studies on the contribution of each tank of the MBR process to the total removal of four biodegradable PPCPs indicated the oxic tank was the most important unit, whereas membrane filtration made a negligible contribution to their elimination.

AB To reduce the release of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors into the aquatic environment or to remove them from wastewater intended for direct or indirect reuse, the application of advanced wastewater treatment may be required. In the present study, municipal wastewater effluents were treated with ozone (O-3) in a pilot-scale plant consisting of two bubble columns. The investigated effluents, which varied in suspended solids concentrations, comprised an effluent of conventional activated sludge treatment (CAS), the same effluent dosed with 15 mg of TSS L-1 of activated sludge (CAS + SS), and the effluent of a membrane bioreactor pilot plant (MBR). Selected classes of pharmaceuticals were spiked in the wastewater at realistic levels ranging from 0.5 to 5 mu g L-1. Samples taken at the inlet and the outlet of the pilot plant were analyzed with liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Macrolide and sulfonamide antibiotics, estrogens, and the acidic pharmaceuticals diclofenac, naproxen, and indomethacin were oxidized by more than 90-99% for O-3 doses >= 2 mg L-1 in all effluents. X-ray contrast media and a few acidic pharmaceuticals were only partly oxidized, but no significant differences were observed among the three effluents. These results show that many pharmaceuticals present in wastewater can be efficiently oxidized with O-3 and that suspended solids have only a minor influence on the oxidation efficiency of nonsorbing micropollutants.

AB The discovery that natural and synthetic chemicals, in the form of excreted hormones and pharmaceuticals, as well as a vast array of compounds with domestic and industrial applications, can enter the environment via wastewater treatment plants and cause a wide variety of environmental and health problems -even at very low concentrations, suggests the need for improvement of water recycling.
   Three Australian wastewater recycling schemes, two of which employ reverse osmosis (RO) technology, the other applying ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration, have been studied for their ability to remove trace organic contaminants including I I pharmaceutically active compounds and two non-steroidal estrogenic compounds. Contaminant concentrations were determined using a sensitive analytical method comprising solid phase extraction, derivatization and GC with MS using selected ion monitoring. In raw wastewater, concentrations of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications were comparable to those found in wastewaters around the world. Remarkably, removal efficiencies for the three schemes were superior to literature values and RO was responsible for the greatest proportion of contaminant removal. The ability of RO membranes to concentrate many of the compounds was demonstrated and highlights the need for continued research into monitoring wastewater treatment, concentrate disposal, improved water recycling schemes and ultimately, safer water and a cleaner environment.

AB A novel electrochemical membrane bioreactor (EMBR) was developed for enhancing PPCPs removal from real municipal wastewater. Compared to the control MBR (CMBR) without applying electric field, EMBR exhibited higher removal efficiencies for 14 PPCPs among all investigated PPCPs, including 3 fluoroquinolones, 2 macrolides, 6 sulfonamides and 3 anti-inflammatory drugs, while no significant difference was observed for the rest 8 PPCPs. The enhanced removal of 14 PPCPs was mainly attributed to electrooxidation by the direct anodic oxidation and reactive oxygen species-mediated indirect oxidation. Moreover, membrane fouling rates of EMBR (0.55 +/- 0.10 kPa/d) were significantly reduced compared with CMBR (0.99 +/- 0.09 kPa/d). Microbial activities and community analyses demonstrated that the applied electric field had no noticeable adverse impact on microbial viabilities, richness and diversity. These findings demonstrated that this EMBR enhanced pollutant removal and mitigated membrane fouling simultaneously, highlighting the potential of the novel technology to be used for removing PPCPs from wastewater.

AB Various pharmaceutical residues are being discharged from wastewater treatment works (WTW) effluents, the impact of which on river water quality is of high relevance to environmental risk assessment. The concentrations of eleven pharmaceutical compounds were determined in three WTWs in England, and the river Ouse receiving effluents from Scaynes Hill WTW. Results show that five compounds propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, indomethacine and diclofenac were detected in all wastewater and river water samples, with carbamazepine showing the highest concentrations (up to 2336 ng L(-1)) in WTW influent. Different compounds were removed to different extent in the WTWs. varying from 43 to 92%, with the highest performance obtained by the WTW with tertiary treatment (sand filtration). The pharmaceutical residues from Scaynes Hill WTW were eventually discharged into the river Ouse, causing an elevation in their concentrations downstream of the outfall. This was confirmed by the good agreement between measured concentrations and those predicted by a simple dilution model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pollution from endocrine disrupting compounds and related micropollutants is widely regarded as a major environmental issue on both a regional and a global scale, largely due to concerns over risks to human and ecological health. Between 2005 and 2010, the United Kingdom is conducting a demonstration program, costing similar to 40 million (similar to$80 million at the time of writing), to evaluate technologies to remove these compounds from wastewater. However, while such advanced treatment techniques will undoubtedly reduce the discharges of micropollutants, they will also inevitably result in large financial costs, as well as environmentally undesirable increases in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Here we calculate the price of treating urban sewage with two of the major options specifically proposed in the U.K. demonstration program: (i) granular activated carbon and ozone and (ii) membrane filtration and reverse osmosis. Economic analysis indicates that treating wastewater with these advanced technologies may be economically and environmentally undesirable due to the increased energy consumption and associated economic costs and CO2 emissions. Since the costs of advanced treatment of sewage would most likely have to be passed on to customers (both domestic and industrial), we propose that national demonstration programs should not only compare and contrast the most advanced treatment methods but also consider alternative techniques, such as increased sludge ages and hydraulic retention times in conjunction with nutrient removal stages and the varying redox conditions associated with them, which potentially may be almost as effective but with much lower environmental and financial costs.

AB Pharmaceutical residues and other micro-contaminants may enter aquatic environments through effluent from sewage treatment plants (STPs) and could cause adverse effects in wild fish. One strategy to alleviate this situation is to improve wastewater treatment by ozonation. To test the effectiveness of full-scale wastewater effluent ozonation at a Swedish municipal STP, the added removal efficiency was measured for 105 pharmaceuticals. In addition, gene expression, reproductive and behavioral endpoints were analyzed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed on-site over 21 days to ozonated or non-ozonated effluents as well as to tap water. Ozone treatment (7 g O-3/m(3)) removed pharmaceuticals by an average efficiency of 77% in addition to the conventional treatment, leaving 11 screened pharmaceuticals above detection limits. Differences in biological responses of the exposure treatments were recorded in gene expression, reproduction and behavior. Hepatic vitellogenin gene expression was higher in male zebrafish exposed to the ozonated effluent compared to the non-ozonated effluent and tap water treatments. The reproductive success was higher in fish exposed to ozonated effluent compared to non-ozonated effluent and to tap water. The behavioral measurements showed that fish exposed to the ozonated STP effluent were less active in swimming the first minute after placed in a novel vessel. Ozonation is a capable method for removing pharmaceuticals in effluents. However, its implementation should be thoroughly evaluated for any potential biological impact. Future research is needed for uncovering the factors which produced the in vivo responses in fish.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in our water resources is of prime concern. With this context, fate and seasonal variation of six EDCs (testosterone, T; progesterone, P; diethyl phthalate, DEP; dibutyl phthalate, DBP; propyl-paraben, PP and butylparaben, BP) were assessed throughout the year, i.e. in rainy, winter, spring and summer seasons in the raw, treated wastewater and activated sludge in an activated sludge process (ASP) based sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Haridwar, India. Qualitative and quantitative measurements were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results indicate that in summer, the examined STP could effectively remove 82.9% of T, 86.4% of P, 95.5% of DEP, 92.4% of DBP, 91.5% of PP, and 89.9% of BP from the wastewater. Among the EDCs considered, higher removal efficiencies were achieved for phthalates in the summer season. GC-MS analysis showed that a small fraction of EDCs was sorbed on the solid fraction of activated sludge. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy analysis were also performed to investigate the occurrence of EDCs in biomass samples. Results of this study also demonstrated that removal efficiency, assessed in terms of physicochemical and microbiological parameters, was maximum in summer and reached minimum in rainy season.

AB Residual pharmaceutical products in sewage and other water environments have recently become a serious social problem in advanced countries. Among these pharmaceutical products, antibiotics have attracted special attention due to their serious impact on the ecosystem and connections to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Our research intended to develop a new method to analyse the three antibiotics estimated to be released out of the body in large amounts in Japan; levofloxacin (LVFX), clarithromycin (CAM) and azithromycin (AZM), and survey the state of pollution in the sewerage. The concentrations of the water-phase antibiotics LVFX, CAM and AZM were measured in each process of activated sludge process in six wastewater treatment plants. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used to analyse solutions of the antibiotics after pretreatment with a solid phase extraction. The limits of quantification and the average recoveries for these antibiotics in the influent were 1.2 to 29 ng/L and 46 to 93%, respectively. In the influent, LVFX, CAM and AZM were detected at concentrations of 552, 647 and 260 ng/L, respectively, while their removal efficiencies were 42, 43 and 49%, respectively. Although the CAM and AZM concentrations decreased as the treatment progressed, it was shown that the LVFX concentration increased in activated sludge reactors in some cases. Despite differences in octanol-water partition coefficients among LVFX, CAM and AZM, their removal efficiency showed no major difference. This indicates that this removal phenomenon cannot be explained by simple adsorption by the activated sludge.

AB The removal of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from water and wastewater is of great significance for eco-system safety. In this study, an electrochemical ceramic membrane bioreactor (ECMBR) was developed for removing seven groups (24 kinds in total) of PPCPs from real wastewater. In the presence of an electric field (2 V/cm), the ECMBR could enhance the removal efficiencies for most targeted PPCPs without having adverse impacts on conventional pollutant removal and membrane filtration. The ECMBR achieved higher removal efficiencies for fluoroquinolones (82.8%), beta-blockers (24.6%), and sulfonamides (41.0%) compared to the control (CMBR) (52.9%, 4.6%, and 36.4%). For trimethoprim, ECMBR also significantly increased the removal to 66.5% compared to 15.6% in CMBR. Furthermore, the exertion of an electric field did not cause significant changes in microbial communities, suggesting that the enhanced removal of PPCPs should be attributed to the electrochemical oxidation of the built-in electrodes in the ECMBR.

AB Pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are detected in the environment in trace quantities, most at less than one part-per-billion (i. e. <1 mu g/l). There are three main pathways by which active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) can reach the environment. The vast majority of APIs found in water systems are a result of normal patient and consumer use and excretion into sewer and wastewater treatment systems. A second pathway is improper disposal of unused or expired medicines by consumers who flush them down toilets or pour them into drains. The third pathway is through wastewater discharged from API manufacturing sites. There are several other minor pathways, such as landfill leachate or hospital discharges, that may also present localised sources of API introduction to the environment. Given the widespread consumption of pharmaceuticals in developed countries, it is likely that pharmaceutical residues are present in the wastewater of virtually all households where the occupants are using such products as medicines. The contribution of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities to the levels of APIs in the environment is low when compared with the amount excreted by patients consuming the drugs. However, manufacturing losses are one area that can be controlled by manufacturers. The extent of improper disposal of unused medicines is currently unknown. What is known is that flushing them into sewage and wastewater treatment systems can have a significant impact on the API load entering the treatment plant and the concentrations discharged in the effluent. Given the demonstrated presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, coupled with their high profile, it is not surprising that they have attracted a disproportionate amount of attention. While concerns are understandable, one should not lose sight of the fact that there are many other chemical species reaching the environment and that APIs represent just one subset of multiple emerging pollutants.

AB An innovative approach for mitigating the micropollutants released by urban WWTP has been evaluated. It consists in applying ozone within an activated sludge system fed by a 50% vol mixture of raw hospital and urban wastewaters. Ozone was injected in the entering raw sewage or in the recycled mixed liquor. This integrated oxidation treatment provides a significant improvement in pharmaceuticals removal compared to biological treatment alone. Additional benefit lies in the simultaneous removal of the contaminants from both the solid and soluble phases. Compared to ozonation applied downstream the biological treatment, this configuration presents interesting advantages on the engineering aspects: improved operability of the biological treatment, control of bulking and odor issues.

AB Passing of pharmaceutical residues into environment in an uncontrolled manner as a result of continuous increase in drug consumption across the globe has become a threatening problem for the ecosystems and almost all living creatures. In this study, diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ), 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) and 17 alpha ethynylestradiol (EE2) belonging to different therapeutic classes were investigated simultaneously in advanced biological treatment and nature-based treatments during 12-months sampling campaign. In this context, behavior patterns of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) throughout the both wastewater and sludge lines in advanced biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), wastewater stabilization pond (WSP) and constructed wetland (CW) were discussed in detail based on each treatment processes seasonally. Furthermore, statistically evaluated data obtained in full-scale WWTPs were compared with each other in order to determine the valid removal mechanisms of these pharmaceutical compounds. While DCF and CBZ were detected very intensively both in the wastewater and sludge lines of the investigated WWTPs, steroid hormones,17 beta-E2 and EE2, were determined below the LOQ value in general. Annual average removal efficiencies achieved in studied WWTPs for DCF ranged between & minus;23.3% (in CW) and 75.2% (in WSP), while annual average removal rates obtained for CBZ varied between & minus;20.7% (in advanced biological treatment) and 10.0% (in CW). It has been found that DCF was highly affected by different wastewater treatment processes applied in the WWTPs compared to CBZ which showed extraordinary resistance to all different treatment processes. Although calculated in different rates for each compounds, biodegradation/biotransformation and sorption onto sewage sludge were determined as the main removal mechanisms for PhACs in plants. Although showed a similar behavior in the sludge dewatering unit (decanter) present in the advanced biological WWTP, quite different behaviors ob-served in the anaerobic digester for DCF (up to 15% decrease) and CBZ (up to 95% increase). Sorption and desorp-tion behaviors of DCF and CBZ were also evaluated in the sludge treatment processes found in advanced biological WWTP. Percentages of originated extra annual average of pharmaceutical loads were calculated as 0.64% and 0.90% for DCF and CBZ, respectively in the advanced biological WWTP due to the sidestream caused by the sludge dewatering unit.

AB Antidepressants are a new kind of pollutants being increasingly found in wastewater. In this study, a fast and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the analysis of 24 antidepressant drugs and six of their metabolites in wastewater. This is the first time that the antidepressant residues in wastewater of Beijing (China) were systematically reported. A solid-phase extraction process was performed with 3 M cation disk, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements. The chromatographic separation and mass parameters were optimized in order to achieve suitable retention time and good resolution for analytes. All compounds were satisfactorily determined in one single injection within 20 min. The limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, and extraction recovery were validated. The LOQ for analytes were ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 ng/mL. The determination coefficients were more than 0.99 within the tested concentration range (0.1-25 ng/mL), and the recovery rate for each target compound was ranged from 81.2% to 118% at 1 ng/mL. This new developed method was successfully applied to analysis the samples collected from Beijing municipal wastewater treatment plants. At least ten target antidepressants were found in all samples and the highest mean concentration of desmethylvenlafaxin was up to 415.6 ng/L.

AB The concentrations of nine emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (ibuprofen, IBF; naproxen, NPX; diclofenac, DCF; ketoprofen, KFN) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (triclosan, TCS; bisphenol, BPA; nonylphenol, NP; nonylphenol monoethoxylate, NP1EO; nonylphenol diethoxylate, NP2EO), were determined in wastewater and sludge samples of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Greece. Average concentrations in raw and treated wastewater ranged from 0.39 (KFN) to 12.52 mu g L-1 (NP) and from <LOD (IBF) to 0.80 mu g L-1 (DCF), respectively. A significant part of nonylphenols (NPs) and TCS in influent wastewater was bound to the particulate phase, while PhACs and BPA were mainly detected in the aqueous phase. Removal of target compounds during wastewater treatment ranged between 39% (DCF) and 100% (IBF). Except of DCF and BPA, similar removal efficiencies were observed in both WWTPs and no effect of WWTP's size and operational conditions was noticed. Use of mass balances showed that accumulation on sludge was a significant removal mechanism for NPs and TCS, while biodegradation/biotransformation was the major mechanism for the other compounds. Sampling of raw and digested sludge demonstrated that IBF and NPX are significantly removed (>80%) during anaerobic digestion, whereas removal of EDCs was lower, ranging up to 55% for NP1EO.

AB Six pharmaceuticals of different categories, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), and anti-microbial (trimethoprim), were investigated in wastewater of the urban areas of Ghaziabad and Lucknow, India. Samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction (SPE) and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The SPE-HPLC method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. All the six drugs were detected in wastewater of Ghaziabad, whereas naproxen was not detected in Lucknow wastewater. Results suggest that levels of these detected drugs were relatively higher in Ghaziabad as compared to those in Lucknow, and diclofenac was the most frequently detected drug in both the study areas. Detection of these drugs in wastewater reflects the importance of wastewater inputs as a source of pharmaceuticals. In terms of the regional distribution of compounds in wastewater of two cities, higher spatial variations (coefficient of variation 112.90-459.44 %) were found in the Lucknow wastewater due to poor water exchange ability. In contrast, lower spatial variation (162.38-303.77 %) was observed in Ghaziabad. Statistical analysis results suggest that both data were highly skewed, and populations in two study areas were significantly different (p < 0.05). A risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotient (RQ) in six different bioassays (bacteria, duckweed, algae, daphnia, rotifers, and fish) showed that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) posed high (RQ > 1) risk to all the test species. The present study would contribute to the formulation of guidelines for regulation of such emerging pharmaceutical contaminants in the environment.

AB Excreted trace organic chemicals, e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides, typically undergo incomplete elimination in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and are released to surface water via treated effluents and to agricultural soils through sludge amendment and/or irrigation with freshwater or reclaimed wastewater. Recent research has shown the tendency for these substances to accumulate in food crops. In this study, we developed and applied a simulation tool to predict the fate of three ionizable trace chemicals (triclosan-TCS, furosemide-FUR, ciprofloxacin-CIP) from human consumption/excretion up to the accumulation in soil and plant, following field amendment with sewage sludge or irrigation with river water (assuming dilution of WWTP effluent). The simulation tool combines the SimpleTreat model modified for fate prediction of ionizable chemicals in a generic WWTP and a recently developed dynamic soil-plant uptake model. The simulation tool was tested using country-specific (e.g., consumption/emission rates, precipitation and temperature) input data. A Monte Carlo-based approach was adopted to account for the uncertainty associated to physico-chemical and biokinetic model parameters.
   Results obtained in this study suggest significant accumulation of TCS and CIP in sewage sludge (1.4-2.8 mg kg(DW)(-1)) as compared to FUR (0.02-0.11 mg kg(DW)(-1)). For the latter substance, more than half of the influent load (60.1%-72.5%) was estimated to be discharged via WWTP effluent. Specific emission rates (g ha(-1) a(-1)) of FUR to soil via either sludge application or irrigation were up to 300 times lower than for TCS and CIP. Nevertheless, high translocation potential to wheat was predicted for FUR, reaching concentrations up to 4.3 mu g kg(DW)(-1) in grain. Irrigation was found to enhance the relative translocation of FUR to plant (45.3%-48.9% of emission to soil), as compared to sludge application (21.9%-27.6%).
   A comparison with peer-reviewed literature showed that model predictions were close to experimental data for elimination in WWTP, concentrations in sewage and sludge and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in plant tissues, which showed however a large variability. The simulation tool presented here can thus be useful for priority setting and for the estimation of human exposure to trace chemicals via intake of food crops. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presented study summarizes laboratory tests results to define the inhibition effect of selected pharmaceuticals on biogas production under anaerobic digestion conditions. Two sets of inhibition tests were realized: (i) with real anaerobic sludge (from municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) where sludge is present and includes a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals over a long period) and (ii) with laboratory sludge (sludge without pharmaceuticals). Methanogenic tests lasting 20 days were performed with three analgesics (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and tramadol), two antibiotics (amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin), beta-blocker (atenolol), three psychoactive compounds (carbamazepine, caffeine, and cotinine), and a mixture of these compounds. All tests were performed with two concentrations of pharmaceuticals (10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L). Results of the methanogenic tests showed the different behaviors of the investigated sludges in the presence of individual pharmaceuticals. Stimulation of anaerobic digestion was mostly detected for laboratory (unadapted) sludge (e.g., the addition of ibuprofen at a concentration of 500 mu g/L increased biogas production by 61%). On the other hand, pharmaceuticals inhibited biogas production for real sludge (e.g., the addition of ciprofloxacin 500 mu g/L decreased biogas production by 52%).

AB In this study, occurrence of 66 PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in liquid and solid phases of sewage sludge was elucidated. The extraction methods for the PPCPs from sludge were newly developed employing Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) and Ultrasonic Solvent Extraction (USE). As an appropriate method, PLE using water (pH2), PILE using methanol (pH4), and USE using mixture of methanol and water (1/9,v/v, pH11) was found most effective because total recovery of most of the PPCPs indicated 40 to 130%. The developed extraction method with previously developed method for liquid phase analysis was applied to field survey at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan. 56 compounds were detected from the primary sludge and 61 compounds were detected from the excess sludge. The concentration was ranged between several ng/g and several mu g/g. Solid-water distribution coefficient (Log K-d) ranged between 0.9 L/kg (Caffeine) and 3.7 L/kg (Levofloxacin) for primary sludge and between 1.4 L/kg (Sulpirid) and 4.3 L/kg (Mefenamic acid) for excess sludge.

No significant correlation existed between the BOD5 and the toxicity test results. Acute toxicity studies carried out with D. magna and synthetic Municipal sewage sludge have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of H2O2/O-3 oxidation.

AB Treatment of municipal wastewater reduces the concentrations of some pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, and drugs of abuse. However, reduced concentrations of these micropollutants in wastewater may not correlate with reduced toxicity because transformations of micropollutants and/or the formation of disinfection by-products may generate toxic compounds. In the present study, we prepared extracts by solid phase extraction of samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at various stages of treatment and tested these extracts for toxicity to early life stages of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Toxicity data for extracts prepared from a WWTP with secondary treatment showed that the numbers of exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) that did not hatch increased from 1 of 12 for the treatment with untreated effluent to 5 of 12 for the treatment with final treated effluent. For extracts prepared from a WWTP with tertiary treatment, toxicity among exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) also increased with each step of wastewater treatment, as shown by mortalities of 2 of 12 and 8 of 12 in treatments with extracts from untreated and final treated effluent, respectively, as well as an increase in the numbers of embryos that did not hatch from 2 of 12 to 9 of 12 in treatments with untreated and final treated effluent, respectively. Ozonation of treated wastewater collected from a third WWTP caused a high incidence of delayed hatch in exposed embryos (n = 24 per treatment). However, hatching success and the numbers of developmental abnormalities in embryos from this ozonation treatment were not different from controls. The present study shows the value of including toxicity testing to assess the effectiveness of technologies for treatment of municipal wastewater. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB Information on sales and emission of selected pharmaceuticals were used to predict their concentrations in Japanese wastewater influent through a > 300 of pharmaceuticals data sink. A combined wastewater-based epidemiology and environmental risk analysis follow was established. By comparing predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of pharmaceuticals in wastewater influent against measured environmental concentrations (MECs) reported in previous studies, it was found that the model gave accurate results for 17 pharmaceuticals (0.5 < PEC/MEC < 2), and acceptable results for 32 out of 40 pharmaceuticals (0.1 < PEC/MEC < 10). Although the majority of pharmaceuticals considered in the model were antibiotics and analgesics, pranlukast, a receptor antagonist, was predicted to have the highest concentration in wastewater influent. With regard to the composition of wastewater effluent, the Estimation Program Interface (EPI) suite was used to predict pharmaceutical removal through activated sludge treatment. Although the performance of the EPI suite was variable in terms of accurate prediction of the removal of different pharmaceuticals, it could be an efficient tool in practice for predicting removal under extreme scenarios. By using the EPI suite with input data on PEC in the wastewater influent, the PEC values of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent were predicted. The concentrations of 26 pharmaceuticals were relatively high (> 1 mu g/L), and the PECs of 6 pharmaceuticals were extremely high (> 10 mu g/L) in wastewater effluent, which could be attributed to their high usage rates by consumers and poor removal rates in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Furthermore, environmental risk assessment (ERA) was carried out by calculating the ratio of predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) to PEC of different pharmaceuticals, and it was found that 9 pharmaceuticals were likely to have high toxicity, and 54 pharmaceuticals were likely to have potential toxicity. It is recommended that this is further investigated in detail. The priority screening and environmental risk assessment results on pharmaceuticals can provide reliable basis for policy-making and environmental management.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes are primarily designed to reduce the amount of organic matter, pathogens, and nutrients from the incoming influent. However, these processes are not as effective in reducing the concentrations of micropollutants, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which notoriously evade traditional wastewater treatment technologies and are found even in tertiary-treated effluent. For WWTPs practicing deep -well injection or surface -water discharge, EDCs in the treated effluent are discharged into groundwater or the aquatic environment where humans and wildlife may potentially suffer the effects of chemical exposure. In the current laboratory-scale study, we tested a bench -top electrocoagulation (EC) unit utilizing aluminum blades for the removal of six estrogenic EDCs [estrone (El), 17B-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol-A (BPA), and nonylphenol (NP)]. Samples of municipal wastewater influent and tertiary -treated effluent were spiked with the six EDCs in order to test the removal efficiency of the EC unit. The mean concentration of each EDC component was statistically lower after EC treatment (removal range = 42%-98%). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate aluminum electrocoagulation for removal of these specific EDCs, including nonylphenol (without the ethoxylate chain), as well as natural and synthetic estrogens.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from anaerobic biological processes of organic waste and wastewater were investigated in four sites in North China, including a biogas well of landfill, a fermentation workshop of pharmaceutical residues, an anaerobic digestion workshop of pharmaceutical wastewater, and an anaerobic digester of petrochemical wastewater. 108 VOC species were qualified and quantified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system with canister sampling. Results showed that the total amounts of analyzed VOCs varied from 8503 +/- 1320 mu g/m(3) to 727 +/- 109 mu g/m(3) in summer with the order as municipal landfill > pharmaceutical residues >pharmaceutical wastewater > petrochemical wastewater. The most abundant types of VOCs in the municipal landfill were halogenated hydrocarbons (41.9%), followed by acetates (22.0%), aromatic hydrocarbons (13.0%) and alcohols (10.5%). For the pharmaceutical residues, alkenes (51.4%) dominated, followed by aromatic hydrocarbons (22.5%) and alkanes (16.0%). For the pharmaceutical wastewater, aromatic hydrocarbons (27.1%) dominated, followed by ketones (24.9%), acetates (20.71%) and halogenated hydrocarbons (11.4%). For the petrochemical wastewater, aromatic hydrocarbons were highest, accounting for 28.3% of the total species, they were followed by alkanes (25.9%), halogenated hydrocarbons (19.9%) and methyl tert-butyl ether (14.8%). These results implied that the types and levels of airborne VOCs species from the four biological degradation processes exist significant differences, which were mainly caused by the type of waste and wastewater, operational characteristics of the treatment plant, and environmental conditions. In the other hand, the reactivity of VOCs species from the four sources was also assessed by OH loss rate, due to the impact of VOCs on the production of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).

AB Seen as a solution to water shortages, wastewater reuse for crop irrigation does however poses a risk owing to the potential release of organic contaminants into soil and water. The frequency of detection (FOD), concentration, and migration of nonylphenol (NP) isomers in reclaimed water (FODRW), surface water (FODSW), and groundwater (FODGW) were investigated in a long-term wastewater irrigation area in Beijing. The FODRW, FODSW and FODGW of any or all of 12 NP isomers were 66.7% to 100%, 76.9% to 100% and 133% to 60%, respectively. The mean (+/- standard deviation) NP concentrations of the reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater (NPRW, NPSW, NPGW, repectively) were 469.4 +/- 73.4 ng L-1, 694.6 +/- 248.7 ng(-1) and 244.4 +/- 230.8 ng(-1), respectively. The existence of external pollution sources during water transmission and distribution resulted in NPSW exceeding NPRW. NP distribution in groundwater was related to the duration and quantity of wastewater irrigation, the sources of aquifer recharge, and was seen to decrease with increasing aquifer depth. Higher riverside infiltration rate nearby leads to higher FODGW values. The migration rate of NP isomers was classified as high, moderate or low. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, commonly used for fever, inflammation and for different health problems, as found for many pharmaceuticals has been recently detected in sewage effluents, surface, and ground water, and sometimes even in drinking water. An advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), utilizing ultra-filtration, activated charcoal (AC), and reverse osmosis (RO) after the primary biological treatment, showed that both nano- and micro-ultrafiltration were not sufficient for removing spiked naproxen to a safe level, whereas RO membrane was quite efficient. No naproxen degradation was detected in pure water whereas it underwent biodegradation within three days in activated sludge giving O-desmethyl-naproxen. Adsorption performed on micelle-clay complex and AC under steady state conditions, showed that the former adsorbent is highly effective in removing naproxen with fast kinetics. Laboratory micelle-clay complex filters under continuous naproxen-spiked water flowing were found to be efficient in removing this drug, suggesting that the efficiency of existing advanced WWTP could be improved by including filtration columns filled with suitable sand/micelle-clay mixtures.

AB Hydrophilic, persistent markers are useful to detect, locate, and quantify contamination of natural waters with domestic wastewater. The present study focused on occurrence and fate of seven marker candidates including carbamazepine (CBZ), 10, 11-dihydro-10, 11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), primidone (PMD), crotamiton (CTMT), N-acetyl-4-aminoantipyrine (AAA), N-formyl-4-aminoantipyrine (FAA), and benzotriazole (BTri) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), lakes, and groundwater. In WWTPs, concentrations from 0.14 mg/L to several micrograms per liter were observed for all substances, except CTMT, which was detected at lower concentrations. Loads determined in untreated and treated wastewater indicated that removal of the potential markers in WWTPs is negligible; only BTri was partly eliminated (average 33%). In lakes, five compounds, CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, FAA, AAA, and BTri, were consistently detected in concentrations of 2 to 70 ng/L, 3 to 150 ng/L, less than the limit of quantification to 30 ng/L, 2 to 80 ng/L, and 11 to 920 ng/L, respectively. Mean per capita loads in the outflows of the lakes suggested possible dissipation in surface waters, especially of AAA and FAA. Nevertheless, concentrations of CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, and BTri correlated with the actual anthropogenic burden of the lakes by domestic wastewater, indicating that these compounds are suitable for quantification of wastewater contamination in lakes. Marker candidates were also detected in a number of groundwater samples. Carbamazepine concentrations up to 42 ng/L were observed in aquifers with significant infiltration of river water, receiving considerable wastewater discharges from WWTPs. Concentration ratios between compounds indicated some elimination of BTri and DiOH-CBZ during subsurface passage or in groundwater, while CBZ and PMD appeared to be more stable and thus are promising wastewater markers for groundwater. The wastewater burden in groundwater, estimated with the markers CBZ and PMD, reached up to 6%.

AB Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, which may contain various contaminants including pharmaceuticals, is often used as a soil amendment. These contaminants may subsequently be taken up by plants. In the present study we examined uptake of select pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge applied to soils by spinach plants. Seven soils were amended with sewage sludge from two wastewater treatment plants (A and B). Concentrations of compounds in plant tissues (roots and leaves) of spinach planted 45 days in these soils under greenhouse conditions were evaluated after harvest. The largest bioaccumulation in the roots and leaves was observed for sertraline (bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of 3.3-37.9 and 1-13.4, respectively), tramadol (1.3-10.0 and 4.8-30.0), and carbamazepine (2.2-17.2 and 6.1-48.8) and its metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (not-quantified to 7.3 and 9.3-96.7). Elevated bioaccumulation in spinach roots was also identified for telmisartan (3.0-20.3) and miconazole (4.3-15.1), and leaves for metoprolol acid (not-quantified to 24.3). BAF values resulting from application of sludge B were similar to or moderately higher than BAFs from sludge A. The BAF values of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide in all tissues were negatively correlated with soil cation exchange capacity (CEC). This negative correlation between BAF and CEC was also observed for tramadol (A-roots and B-leaves), citalopram (B-roots), and telmisartan (B-roots) or between BAF and clay content for metoprolol acid (A-leaves and B-roots), tramadol (B-roots and A-leaves) and venlafaxine (B-roots). However, in the case of some other compounds (i.e. sertraline, amitriptyline, mirtazapine, metoprolol), uptake and the subsequent translocation and transformation from 3 soils of a higher pH and base cation saturation (Stagnic Chemozem Siltic, Haplic Chemozem and Greyic Phaeozem) significantly differed from 4 soils with a lower pH and base cation saturation (Haplic Luvisol, Haplic Cambisol, Dystric Cambisol and Arenosol Epieutric). Such observations proved strong compound dependent influences of soil conditions on various compounds bioaccumulations in plants and necessity of studying these processes always in diverse soils.

AB To study the possibility of producing better water quality from municipal wastewater, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant with flat sheet (FS) and hollow fiber (HF) membranes coupled with another pilot plant equipped with nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were operated to treat municipal wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Rincon de Leon, Alicante (Spain). This study was focused on improving the quality of the permeate obtained from the MBR process when complemented by NF or RO stages with respect to salinity, organic matter and nutrients. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies of 10 EMPs were evaluated, comparing the reductions achieved between the wastewater treatment by MBR (adsorption to sludge and biodegradation) and the later treatment using NF or RO (mainly size exclusion). The results showed that the high quality of water was obtained which is appropriate for reuse with salinity removal efficiencies higher than 97%, 96% for total organic carbon (TOC), 91% for nitrates (NO3-) and 99% for total phosphorous (TP). High removal efficiencies were obtained for the majority of the analyzed EMP compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several pharmaceutically active compounds have been monitored during 1-year period in influent and effluent wastewater from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate their temporal evolution and removal from wastewater and to know which variables have influence in their removal rates. Pharmaceutical compounds monitored were four antiinflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine) and a nervous stimulant (caffeine). All of the pharmaceutically active compounds monitored, except diclofenac, were detected in influent and effluent wastewater. Mean concentrations measured in influent wastewater were 6.17, 0.48, 93.6, 1.83 and 5.41 mu g/L for caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, respectively. Mean concentrations measured in effluent wastewater were 2.02, 0.56. 8.20, 0.84 and 2.10 mu g/L for caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, respectively. Mean removal rates of the pharmaceuticals varied from 8.1% (carbamazepine) to 87.5% (ibuprofen). The existence of relationships between the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds, their removal rates, the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters and the WWTP control design parameters has been studied by means of statistical analysis (correlation and principal component analysis). With both statistical analyses, high correlations were obtained between the concentration of the pharmaceutical compounds and the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters; and between the removal rates of the pharmaceutical compounds, the removal rates of the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters and the WWTP hydraulic retention times. Principal component analysis showed the existence of two main components accounting for 76% of the total variability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutically active compound diclofenac has been monitored during one year at separate treatment units of two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate its seasonal variation and the removal efficiency. Conventional wastewater characterization was also performed to assess the possible relationship between conventional parameters and diclofenac. Diclofenac concentrations in the influent and effluent of both WWTPs were detected in the range of 295-1376 and 119-1012 ng/L, respectively. Results indicated that the higher diclofenac removal efficiency was observed in summer season in both WWTPs. Although a consistency in diclofenac removal was observed in WWTP_1, significant fluctuation was observed at WWTP_2 based on seasonal evaluation. The main removal mechanism of diclofenac in the WWTPs was most often biological (55%), followed by UV disinfection (27%). When diclofenac removal was evaluated in terms of the treatment units in WWTPs, a significant increase was achieved at the treatment plant including UV disinfection unit. Based on the statistical analysis, higher correlation was observed between diclofenac and suspended solids concentrations among conventional parameters in the influent whereas the removal of diclofenac was highly correlated with nitrogen removal efficiency.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has become a subject of concern in recent years. A vast number of these compounds have been detected in sewage treatment plants (STP) effluents, surface waters and, less frequently, in ground and drinking water all over the world. Adverse effects caused by pharmaceuticals include aquatic toxicity, resistance development in pathogenic bacteria, genotoxicity and endocrine disruption. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the main source of pharmaceutical pollution in the aquatic environment are STPs effluents. Therefore, the discharge of pharmaceutical residues with the effluents of STPs should be minimized as far as possible. Degradation of persistent organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater can be achieved using advanced treatment technologies such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in combination with advanced oxidation processes (AOPS). This paper evaluates the treatment of three antibiotics of large consumption rates worldwide (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) by MBR followed by different AOP-steps. The identification and quantification of the precursor compounds and degradation products observable during the different treatment steps applied were performed with liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)

AB Population size is crucial when estimating population-normalized drug consumption (PNDC) from wastewater-based drug epidemiology (WBDE). Three conceptually different population estimates can be used: de jure (common census, residence), de facto (all persons within a sewer catchment), and chemical loads (contributors to the sampled wastewater). De facto and chemical loads will be the same where all households contribute to a central sewer system without wastewater loss. This study explored the feasibility of determining a de facto population and its effect on estimating PNDC in an urban community over an extended period. Drugs and other chemicals were analyzed in 311 daily composite wastewater samples. The daily estimated de facto population (using chemical loads) was on average 32% higher than the de jure population. Consequently, using the latter would systemically overestimate PNDC by 22%. However, the relative day-to-day pattern of drug consumption was similar regardless of the type of normalization as daily illicit drug loads appeared to vary substantially more than the population. Using chemical loads population, we objectively quantified the total methodological uncertainty of PNDC and reduced it by a factor of 2. Our study illustrated the potential benefits of using chemical loads population for obtaining more robust PNDC data in WBDE.

AB Three wastewater samples from a pharmaceutical plant formulating medical ointments were subjected to lab-scale treatment by a Fenton-like system in combination with lime coagulation. All samples were plant pre-treated by adsorption/flocculation/filtration processes with utilization of bentonite, but-the quality of effluents did not comply with the regulations for wastewater discharged to local sewerage. The optimization of Fenton-like oxidation demonstrated the highest process efficacy at H2O2/COD weight ratio of 2: 1, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 10: 1 and 2 It of treatment time. The fast pH decrease to acidic values similar to 3 during first min of oxidation for all effluents suggested that pH adjustment was unnecessary. Combination of Fe(III) precipitation and lime coagulation proved feasible to improve considerably COD and residual iron concentration reduction in pharmaceutical effluents. Additionally, considerable BOD7 reduction and BOD7/COD ratio improvement of pharmaceutical wastewater samples was achieved by combined treatment. The application of Fenton-like oxidation with subsequent iron (III)/lime coagulation did not only enhance the quality of pharmaceutical effluents with different chemical characteristics and help to meet the requirements for wastewater discharged to sewage, but also improve the biodegradability of pharmaceutical effluents.

AB On-site sewage treatment facilities, particularly septic systems combined with soil infiltration, can be an important source of emerging organic contaminants in groundwater and surface water and thus represent a significant source of environmental and human exposure. Two infiltration systems in Are municipality, Sweden, were examined to assess the occurrence of contaminants in groundwater and their fate and transport during infiltration. Groundwater samples, recipient surface water samples, and wastewater samples from septic tanks were collected from 2016 to 2017 covering all climatological seasons. These samples were analysed for a total of 103 contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, organic phosphorus flame-retardants, plasticisers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and food additives. Fourteen of 103 contaminants showed 100% detection frequency in groundwater at concentrations in the low ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 range. Of the compounds analysed, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, sucralose, caffeine, and benzophenone showed high abundancy with maximum concentrations in the mu g L-1 range. The data were normalised for dilution using chloride and sucralose as commonly applied tracers; however, the level of sucralose decreased significantly during infiltration and it is thus suboptimal as a sewage water tracer. Large differences between the two infiltration sites were observed in detection frequencies and concentrations in groundwater, which could be attributed to the system design and the contaminant's migration time from release to sampling point. Seasonal variation was observed for selected chemicals, and the more hydrophobic chemicals showed a higher tendency for attenuation, indicating sorption as a major retention mechanism. A moderate environmental risk to aquatic organisms was estimated in adjacent surface water for galaxolide, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate. Due to this site-dependency and potential environmental risks, further studies are needed on infiltration systems in different settings and on alternative treatment techniques to reduce the contaminant discharge from on-site sewage treatment facilities.

AB Intentional or accidental release (direct disposal) of high loads of unused pharmaceuticals into wastewater can go unnoticed. Here, direct disposal of a pharmaceutical drug via the sewer network was identified for the first time using wastewater analysis. An irregularly high load of the antidepressant fluoxetine in raw wastewater (10.5 +/- 2.4 g d(-1)) was up to 11 times greater than any other day. National prescription data revealed a predicted daily fluoxetine load for the studied treatment works to be 0.4-1.6 g d(-1). Enantio-selective analysis showed the high load of fluoxetine was present as a racemic mixture, which is typical for fluoxetine in dispensed formulations. As fluoxetine undergoes stereoselective metabolism within the body, a racemic mixture in wastewater suggests a nonconsumed drug was the major contributor of the high load. This was confirmed by its major metabolite norfluoxetine whose load did not increase on this day. Considering the most commonly prescribed formulation of fluoxetine, this increased load accounts for the disposal of similar to 915 capsules. Furthermore, as fluoxetine is prescribed as one capsule per day, disposal is unlikely to be at the patient level. It is postulated that direct disposal was from a facility which handles larger quantities of the drug (e.g., a pharmacy).

AB Concentrations of nine antibiotics [erythromycin- H2O (ERY-H2O); trimethoprim (TMP); tetracycline (TET); norfloxacin (NOR); penicillin G (PEN G); penicillin V (PEN V); cefalexin (CLX); cefotaxim (CTX); and cefazolin (CFZ)] were measured in influent and effluent samples from four sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hong Kong as well as in influent samples from one STP in Shenzhen. Levels of PEN V and CFZ were below method detection limits in all of the samples analyzed. CLX concentrations were the highest in most of the Hong Kong samples, ranging from 670 to 2900 ng/L and 240 to 1800 ng/L in influent and effluent samples, respectively, but CLX was not detected in the samples from Shenzhen. Comparatively lower concentrations were observed for ERY-H2O (470-810ng/L) and TET (96-1300 ng/L) in the influent samples from all STPs in Hong Kong. CTX was found to be the dominant antibiotic in the Shenzhen STP influents with a mean concentration of 1100 ng/L, but occurred at lower concentrations in Hong Kong sewage. These results likely reflect regional variations in the prescription and use patterns of antibiotics between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Antibiotic removal efficiencies depended on their chemical properties and the wastewater treatment processes used. In general, relatively higher removal efficiencies were observed for NOR (5-78%) and TET (7-73%), which are readily adsorbed to particulate matter, while lower removal efficiencies were observed for ERY-H2O (9-19%), which is relatively persistent in the environment. Antibiotics were removed more efficiently at Hong Kong STPs employing secondary treatment processes compared with those using primary treatment only. Concentrations of NOR measured in effluents from STPs in Hong Kong were lower than the predicted no-effect concentration of 8000 ng/L determined in a previous study. Therefore, concentrations of antibiotics measured in this preliminary study would be unlikely to cause adverse effects on microorganisms used in wastewater treatment processes at the sampled STPs.

AB In order to help prioritize future research efforts within the US, risks associated with exposure to human prescription pharmaceutical residues in wastewater were estimated from marketing and pharmacological data. Masses of 371 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) dispensed in the US in 2004 were estimated from marketing data, and then divided by therapeutic dose rate to normalize for potency. Metabolic inactivation of the 50 most dispensed APIs was estimated from published data, and active metabolites were tabulated. Comparing maximum likely average wastewater concentrations of API-associated activity to exposure rates that produce therapeutic effects in humans suggests that the threat to healthy human adults from aquatic exposure is low, even when likely mixture effects are considered. Comparing predicted wastewater concentrations to human therapeutic plasma concentrations suggests that some APIs may be present at sufficient concentrations to affect organisms which eliminate them inefficiently. Comparing predicted antimicrobial concentrations to published minimum inhibitory concentrations suggests that antibacterial APIs in wastewater, but probably not antifungal APIs, may select for low-level antimicrobial resistance. The taxonomic distribution of molecular targets of the 50 most dispensed APIs suggests that potential effects of some APIs are likely restricted to vertebrates, while other APIs can probably affect many eukaryotic and prokaryotic clades.

AB A wide range of emerging contaminants (ECs), such as pharmaceutically active compounds, personal care products (PCPs), endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), and hormones are released into hospital wastewater (HWW). These contaminants can enter into natural environments, such as aquatic and terrestrial ones, thereby threatening human health and aquatic life. Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat all types of chemical and biological contaminants, thereby allowing the release of these contaminants into water bodies, such as rivers, streams, and groundwater. Accordingly, adequate measures and advanced technologies should be implemented to prevent the discharge of ECs into aquatic environments. Reducing environmental health risks of HWW is particularly important amid the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the necessary guidelines and legislation for wastewater treatment are available, efficient removal of ECs from HWW requires the applications of advanced treatment technologies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing healthcare structures, ECs pathways to the environment, management practices, and effective treatment options for removing ECs from HWW. A critical evaluation of the current research advances, knowledge gaps, and directions for future research is also presented.

AB Transformations of cocaine and eleven of its metabolites were investigated in untreated municipal sewage at pH a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 7 and 9, 23, and 31 A degrees C. Results indicated that hydrolysis-possibly bacterially mediated-was the principal transformation pathway. Residues possessing alkyl esters were particularly susceptible to hydrolysis, with pseudo-first-order rate constants varying from 0.54 to 1.7 day(-1) at 23 A degrees C. Metabolites lacking esters or possessing only a benzoyl ester appeared stable. Residues lacking alkyl esters did accumulate through hydrolysis of precursors, however. As noted previously, this may positively bias cocaine utilization estimates based on benzoylecgonine alone. Reported variability in metabolic excretion was used in conjunction with transformation data to evaluate different approaches for estimating cocaine loading. Results indicate that estimates derived from measurands that capture all major cocaine metabolites, such as COCtot (the sum of all measurable metabolites) and EChyd (the sum of all metabolites that can be hydrolyzed to ecgonine), may reduce uncertainty arising from variability in metabolite transformation and excretion, possibly to a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 10 % RSD. This is more than a two-fold reduction relative to estimates derived from benzoylecgonine (> 26 % RSD), and roughly equivalent to reported uncertainties from sources that are not metabolite-specific (e.g., sampling frequency, flow variability). They and other composite measurands merit consideration from the sewage epidemiology community, beginning with efforts to evaluate the stability of the total cocaine load under realistic sewer conditions.

In the coal cinder filter, the removal efficiencies of COD, BOD(5), SS and color were 90 +/- 2%, 72 +/- 2%, 95 +/- 2% and 80 +/- 2%, respectively. The results attribute to the big specific surface area and strong adsorption ability. Coal cinder filter removes a large portion of the pollutants in the influent wastewater, which would strongly stable the effluent waste water quality, and reduce the load of follow-up biological treatment process. The average removal efficiencies for COD, BOD5, SS and color of the combined process were about 99.7 +/- 3%, 98.2 +/- 4%, 98.5 +/- 3% and 96.3 +/- 2%, respectively, with the average effluent quality of COD 16 +/- 1 mg/L, BOD(5) 11 +/- 1 mg/L, SS 10 +/- 0.6 mg/L and color 22 +/- 1 (multiple), which are consistent with the national requirements of the waste pollutants for pharmaceutical industry of chinese traditional medicine discharge standard (GB 21906-2008). The results indicated that the combined procedure could offer an attractive solution for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with considerable low cost.

AB Three samples of cosmetic wastewater from the" production of soaps and shampoos were treated by the following processes: coagulation with sedimentation (C/S), coagulation with dissolved air flotation (C/DAF), and the Fenton process (FP). The COD values of raw wastewater samples were 13 160, 13 580 and 9410 mg O-2/dm(3). The anionic surfactants were 3000, 4500 and 4000 mg/dm(3), for samples 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All three processes were effective in highly polluted cosmetic wastewater treatment. The most effective process was coagulation. In the case of sample 1, application of FeCl3 at pH 6.0 resulted in 88.2% of COD removal and the application of aluminum based coagulants allowed for 80.1-85.3% COD removal. In the case of samples 2 and 3, the usage of Al 1019 and Al 3010 coagulants brought about a 91.6% and 82.6% decrease in COD values, respectively. C/DAF was found to be less effective than C/S. The best results with C/DAF were obtained using Al 3010 coagulant with wastewater recirculation the COD removal efficiency amounted to 82.3, 87.3 and 78.8, respectively. The lowest COD removal efficiency was observed for FP and it was equal to 64.0 and 72.7% for samples 2 and 3, respectively.

AB Analytical measurements of sewage water have been used many times to estimate the consumption of specific drugs in an area. This study measured a large number of illicit drugs and metabolites (>30) at a large number of sewage treatment plants (STPs) distributed across Sweden. Twenty-four illicit and prescription drugs, classified as narcotic substances in Sweden, and seven selected metabolites were included in the study. A 24 hour composite sample of incoming sewage water was collected from 33 different municipalities at various geographic locations across Sweden. Species were analyzed using an on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method. The method proved to be rapid with minimum need for sample work up and was able to detect 13 compounds above their respective limits of quantification. The results for all compounds were presented as per capita loads. Multivariate data analysis was used to relate drug consumption to geographical location and/or population of cities. The results showed that geographical differences in drug consumption were apparent across the country. For the narcotic pharmaceuticals, the geographical differences suggested by the multivariate model were supported by prescription statistics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses risks to human and ecosystem health. Wastewater treatment facilities are primary sources of pharmaceutical pollutants, but little is known about the factors that affect drugs entering the wastewater stream. This paper investigates the effects of student pharmaceutical use and disposal behaviors and an annual demographic shift on pharmaceutical pollution in a university town. We sampled wastewater effluent during a ten-day annual spring student move-out period at the University of Vermont. We then interpreted these data in light of survey results that investigated pharmaceutical purchasing, use, and disposal practices among the university student population. Surveys indicated that the majority of student respondents purchased pharmaceuticals in the previous year. Many students reported having leftover drugs, though only a small portion disposed of them, mainly in the trash.
   We detected 51 pharmaceuticals in 80% or more of the wastewater effluent samples collected over the ten-day sampling period. Several increased in concentration after students left the area. Concentrations of caffeine and nicotine decreased weakly. Drug disposal among this university student population does not appear to be a major source of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Increases in pharmaceutical concentration after the students left campus can be tied to an increase in the seasonal use of allergy medications directly related to pollen, as well as a demographic shift to a year-round older population, which supports national data that older people use larger volumes and different types of pharmaceuticals than the younger student population.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a broad range antimicrobial agent used in many personal care products, which is commonly discharged to wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). This study examined the impact of TCS on wastewater treatment performance using laboratory bench-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) coupled with anaerobic digesters. The SBRs were continuously fed synthetic wastewater amended with or without 0.68 mu M TCS, with the aim of determining the effect of chronic TCS exposure as opposed to a pulse TCS addition as previously studied. Overall, the present study suggests inhibition of nitrogen removal during reactor startup. However, NH4+ removal fully rebounded after 63 days, suggesting acclimation of the associated microbial communities to TCS. An initial decrease in microbial community diversity was observed in the SBRs fed TCS as compared to the control SBRs, followed by an increase in community diversity, which coincided with the increase in NH4+ removal. Elevated levels of NO3- and NO2- were found in the reactor effluent after day 58, however, suggesting ammonia oxidizing bacteria rebounding more rapidly than nitrogen oxidizing bacteria. Similar effects on treatment efficiencies at actual WWTFs have not been widely observed, suggesting that continuous addition of TCS in their influent may have selected for TCS-resistant nitrogen oxidizing bacteria.

AB Design of ship sewage treatment systems that not only satisfy the use of small space on board but also meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) latest emission standards is still a challenging problem for ship industry. This study provides a comparative disquisition between two different MBR reactors i.e, air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR) and anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic membrane reactor (AOA-MBR) for domestic sewage treatment. The influence of pollutants volume loading rate (VLR) and C/N on effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and TN for marine domestic sewage was analyzed. The results revealed that AMCMBR showed better removal efficiencies for COD and TN than AOA-MBR. The volume of AMCMBR was only half of the AOA-MBR. In addition, high average value of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) (i.e. 0.75) of AMCMBR indicated high biomass and good pollutants removal achieved by this reactor. An interesting phenomenon was found in the study regarding Urease activity for the two reactors. Urease activity for AMCMBR in different working conditions all exceeded AOA-MBR and there exist no clear difference of NR activities between AMCMBR and AOA-MBR except for low C/N ratio (i.e. 6 and 4). This phenomenon proved that AMCMBR has a greater performance for treating ship domestic wastewater.

AB A review of consumption and excretion rates of 17 pharmaceuticals, two musk fragrances and two hormones by the Spanish population in 2003 was performed. For that purpose, three different models were used: (i) extrapolation of the per capita use in Europe to the number of inhabitants of Spain for musk fragrances; (ii) annual prescription items multiplied by the average daily dose for pharmaceuticals and; (iii) excretion rates of different groups of population for hormones. This information enabled the prediction of the expected concentrations (PEQ entering sewage treatment plants (STPs), which were subsequently compared with the measured environmental concentrations (MEC) in raw sewage. Annual drugs consumption in Spain ranges from few kilograms (Oxazepam and 17ot-ethinylestradiol) to several hundred of tons (lbuprofen). The quantities of musks used accounts for 110-450 kg d(-1) and the total amount of hormones excreted daily reaches almost 1 kg d(-1). 12 out of 21 selected substances were predicted to be present in raw sewage influent at concentrations greater than 100 ng l(-1) and these predicted concentrations fltted with the measured values for half of them (Carbamazepine, Diazepam, lbuprofen, Naproxen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Roxithromycin, Erythromycin and 17ot-ethinylestradiol).

AB Stability and removal of spironolactone (SP) from wastewater produced at Al-Quds University Campus were investigated. Kinetic studies on both pure water and wastewater coming from secondary treatment (activated sludge) demonstrated that the potassium-sparing diuretic (water pill), spironolactone, underwent degradation to its hydrolytic derivative, canrenone, in both media. The first-order hydrolysis rate of SP in activated sludge at 25 degrees C (3.80 x 10(-5) s(-1)) was about 49-fold larger than in pure water (7.4 x 10(-7) s(-1)). The overall performance of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed in the University Campus was assessed showing that more than 90% of spiked SP was removed together with its newly identified metabolites. In order to look for a technology to supplement or replace ultra-filtration membranes, the effectiveness of adsorption and filtration by micelle-clay filters for removing SP was tested in comparison with activated charcoal. Batch adsorption in aqueous suspensions was well described by Langmuir isotherms, showing a better removal by the micelle-clay material. Filtration of SP water solutions by columns filled with a mixture of sand and a micelle-clay complex showed complete removal of the drug at concentrations higher than in sand/activated-charcoal filled filters.

AB In this work a step forward in investigating the use of prescription drugs, namely erectile dysfunction products, at European level was taken by applying the wastewater-based epidemiology approach. 24-h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected at the entrance of eight wastewater treatment plants serving the catchment within the cities of Bristol, Brussels, Castellon, Copenhagen, Milan, Oslo, Utrecht and Zurich. A validated analytical procedure with direct injection of filtered aliquots by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was applied. The target list included the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) together with (bio) transformation products and other analogues. Only sildenafil and its two human urinary metabolites desmethyl- and desethylsildenafil were detected in the samples with concentrations reaching 60 ng L-1. The concentrations were transformed into normalized measured loads and the estimated actual consumption of sildenafil was back-calculated from these loads. In addition, national prescription data from five countries was gathered in the form of the number of prescribed daily doses and transformed into predicted loads for comparison. This comparison resulted in the evidence of a different spatial trend across Europe. In Utrecht and Brussels, prescription data could only partly explain the total amount found in wastewater; whereas in Bristol, the comparison was in agreement; and in Milan and Oslo a lower amount was found in wastewater than expected from the prescription data. This study illustrates the potential of wastewaterbased epidemiology to investigate the use of counterfeit medication and rogue online pharmacy sales.

AB Hospital wastewater is regarded as a primary and very important source of antibiotics in the aquatic environment. Studies on the analysis, occurrence, and ecological risk assessment of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in wastewater are still limited in Africa. A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction method was optimized and applied for determination of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin) in wastewater from two Nigerian hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and effluent receiving water. Separation, detection, and quantification of target fluoroquinolone antibiotics were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ecological risk of the three fluoroquinolone antibiotics was evaluated for three trophic levels: fish, daphnid, and algae. The method LODs were 4.1 mu g L-1, 7.0 mu g L-1, and 18.5 mu g L-1 for ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries and precisions were achieved, in addition to the correlation coefficients of greater than 0.993. Target fluoroquinolones were quantified in influents up to 228 mu g L-1 (UCH influent) for ciprofloxacin, 561 mu g L-1 (Ijaiye influent) for norfloxacin, and 198 mu g L-1 (UCH influent) for ofloxacin. Norfloxacin had the highest concentration (386 mu g L-1) in effluent receiving water. All three fluoroquinolones posed low risk to fish, whereas ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin presented moderate risk to daphnid and algae. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data on the occurrence and risk assessment of the target fluoroquinolones in wastewater from Nigerian hospital WWTPs. The findings revealed the importance of developing local and nationwide surveys of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the Nigerian aquatic environment.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) are considered to reduce the amount of pollutants that enter water reservoirs as a result of wastewater disposal. An assessment of the occurrence and removal of pharmaceutical compounds, mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in wastewater from the Kavoor MWWTP (southwest monsoon region), India, is presented in this paper. The performance of the MWWTP was monitored in the summer (May) and monsoon (September) periods. The highest inlet concentrations of diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid in the wastewater were observed in May and were 721.37, 2132.48, 2109.875, 2747.29, and 2213.36 mu g/L, respectively. The ketoprofen content was found to be higher than that of other NSAIDs in the influent in both seasons, whereas the diclofenac content was found to be the lowest. The removal efficiency (RE) of the target NSAIDs in the Kavoor secondary treatment plant varied from 81.82-98.92% during the summer season. During the monsoon season, the influent NSAID concentration level dropped, probably because of infiltration in old sewer pipes. In addition, a 100% RE was achieved for all the target NSAIDs in the wastewater of the MWWTP. The results showed that secondary treatment plants have the potential to remove NSAID compounds from municipal sewage with consistent performance. The environmental hazards caused by the accumulation of such compounds in water reservoirs are due to open discharge. The environmental risk levels of these compounds were also studied by the environmental risk assessment (ERA) using the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicines approach.

AB A one-year study on the occurrence and fate of macrolide antibiotics and their metabolites, synthesis byproducts, and transformation products (TPs) was performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb (Croatia). The target compounds were found in all analyzed influent and effluent samples with the total concentrations of azithromycin-, clarithromycin-, and erythromycin-related compounds reaching up to 25, 12, and 0.25 mu g/L, respectively. The most prominent individual constituents were the parent macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin. However, a substantial contribution of their derivatives, formed by deglycolysation and microbial phosphorylation, was also detected. In addition, widespread presence of several linearized nontarget TPs was confirmed for the first time in real wastewater samples by suspect screening analysis. Complex characterization of macrolide-derived compounds enabled decoupling of industrial and therapeutic sources from the in situ transformations. Due to the high inputs and incomplete removal and/or formation of several TPs during the conventional wastewater treatment, the average mass load of azithromycin-related compounds in secondary effluents exceeded 3.0 g/day/1000 inhabitants. This is the first study to reveal the importance of metabolites, byproducts, and TPs for the overall mass balance of macrolide antibiotics in urban wastewater systems.

AB The occurrence and removal of 13 pharmaceuticals and 2 consumer products, including antibiotic, antilipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anticonvulsant, stimulant, insect repellent and antipsychotic, were investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Beijing, China. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) Most of the target compounds were detected, with the concentrations of 4 4 ng L-1-6 6 mu g L-1 and 2 2-320 ng L-1 in the influents and secondary effluents, respectively These concentrations were consistent with their consumptions in China, and much lower than those reported in the USA and Europe Most compounds were hardly removed in the primary treatment, while their removal rates ranging from -12% to 100% were achieved during the secondary treatment in the tertiary treatment, different processes showed discrepant performances The target compounds could not be eliminated by sand filtration, but the ozonation and microfiltration/reverse osmosis (MF/RO) processes employed in two WWTPs were very effective to remove them, showing their main contributions to the removal of such micro-pollutants in wastewater treatment (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Methods were modified and tested to monitor the occurrence of 20 pharmaceuticals and consumer product chemicals in raw wastewater and septic tank effluent (STE) from six single-family homes (two each located in Florida, Colorado, and Minnesota) each utilizing an onsite wastewater treatment system. Ten compounds were detected, including the stimulant caffeine, the metal-chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, the surfactant metabolite 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxylate, and the antimicrobial triclosan, which were present in all wastewater samples. Pharmaceutical occurrence and levels were more variable than consumer product chemicals; nonprescription anti-inflammatory drugs were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals. Concentrations ranged from <1 mu g/L to > 1,000 mu g/L and varied by compound, site, and sampling event. No clear relationship between raw wastewater and STE composition existed. Raw wastewater composition, which previously has not been reported, reflected the per-capita water consumption and chemical-consuming activities at the source during the 24 h of sample collection. STE composition was likely affected by all consumptive activities during the tank hydraulic residence time (similar to 1 to 2 weeks) as well as differences in conditions between sites and at a single site over time (e. g., residence time, temperature, and load of organic compounds). Knowledge of source activities regarding the types, frequencies, and levels of pharmaceuticals and consumer product chemicals present in onsite wastewaters can aid in efforts to minimize potential risk to ecological and human health.

AB Photolytic and photocatalytic removals of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated under UVC radiation. Wastewater collected from WYETH, St-Laurent, Canada contained high concentrations of EE2 and LNG in suspension and coloring agent tartrazine in solution. Aqueous phase removals of EE2 and LNG were studied as individual contaminants in water and in complex matrices including: co-contaminants in water, in simulated synthetic wastewater and in the wastewater. After 30 min of UVC photocatalysis of the individual contaminants, removal efficiencies of EE2 and LNG were 92% and 97%, respectively, while higher photolytic removal was observed for LNG (94%) compared to EE2 (60%). Hydroxyl radicals were shown to contribute significantly to the removal of both compounds in water. In contrast to EE2, photolytic removal of LNG was higher than its photocatalytic removal efficiencies in all complex matrices. Higher photolytic removal of LNG was attributed to the fact that it absorbs UVC radiation considerably more than EE2. Lower photocatalytic removals of LNG in complex matrices compared to its photocatalytic removal as an individual contaminant was due to the presence of EE2 at concentrations up to five times larger than LNG in water, thus leading to increased competition for hydroxyl radicals and retarding LNG removal. In the wastewater matrix photocatalytic removals for EE2 and LNG were similar at 48%, whereas the photolytic removal of LNG (76%) was higher than EE2 (29%). The applicability of UVC processes for reduction of hormone content in similar wastewaters was demonstrated. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the current research was to detect some antibiotics in hospital sewage and compare their removal rates reached using a vermifilter (VF) pilot and a real activated sludge (AS) treatment system. Six target antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline and metronidazole) prescribed in the hospital were detected in the sewage and the removal rates via the two systems were examined. Three sampling points were chosen: the raw effluents from the hospital, VF and AS. Four sampling campaigns were performed over four months. Moreover, the environmental risk assessment was performed for all the antibiotics through estimating risk quotients (RQs). All the antibiotics were quantified in all the samples taken. It was found that ciprofloxacin had the highest concentration (7505.08-14731.88 ng/L). The results revealed that the VF reactor had a better and more stable performance in removal of the antibiotics than the AS system even though all the antibiotics were present in the effluents of both the processes compared. Further, according to the calculated RQs, the hospital effluent had even high risk to algae and, generally, the VF system was capable of reducing the ecotoxicity of the antibiotics. Therefore, it could be confirmed that earthworm-based vermifiltration can be considered as a promising alternative to conventional processes like AS, particularly when it comes to economic situations.

AB Sampling and analysis of wastewater from inicipal wastewater treatment plants (VV\ATTPs) has become a useful tool for understanding exposure to chemicals. Both wastewater based studies and management and planning of Lhe catchment require information on catchment population in the time of monitoring. Recently, a model has been developed and calibrated using selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) measured in influent wastewater for estimating population in different catchments in Australia. The present study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of utilizing this population estimation approach in China. Twenty-four hour composite influent samples were collected from 31 WWTPs in 17 cities with catchment sizes from 200000-3,450,000 people representing all seven regions of China. The samples were analyzed for 19 PPCPs using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in direct injection mode. Eight chemicals were defected in more than 50% of the samples. Significant positive correlations were found between individual PPCP mass loads and population estimates provided by WWTP operators. Using the PPCP mass load modeling approach calibrated with WWTP operator data, we estimated the population size of each catchment with good agreement with WWTP operator values (between 50-200% for all sites and 75-125% for 23 of the 31 sites). Overall, despite much lower detection and relatively high heterogeneity in PPCP consumption across China the model provided a good estimate of the population contributing to a given wastewater sample. Wastewater analysis could also provide objective PPCP consumption status in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We measured six acidic analgesics or anti-inflammatories (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid), two phenolic antiseptics (thymol, triclosan), four amide pharmaceuticals (propyphenazone, crotamiton, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide), three phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (nonylphenol, octylphenol, bisphenol A), and three natural estrogens (17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol) in 24-h composite samples of influents and secondary effluents collected seasonally from five municipal sewage treatment plants in Tokyo. Aspirin was most abundant in the influent, with an average concentration of 7300 ng/L (n = 16), followed by crotamiton (921 ng/L), ibuprofen (669 ng/L), triclosan (511 ng/L), and diethyltoluamide (503 ng/L). These concentrations were 1 order of magnitude lower than those reported in the USA and Europe. This can be ascribed to lower consumption of the pharmaceuticals in Japan. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and thymol were removed efficiently during primary+secondary treatment (> 90% efficiency). On the other hand, amide-type pharmaceuticals, ketoprofen, and naproxen showed poor removal (< 50% efficiency), which is probably due to their lower hydrophobicity (logK(ow)< 3). Because of the persistence of crotamiton during secondary treatment, crotamiton was most abundant among the target pharmaceuticals in the effluent. This is the first paper to report ubiquitous occurrence of crotamiton, a scabicide, in sewage. Because crotamiton is used worldwide and it is persistent during secondary treatment, it is a promising molecular marker of sewage and secondary effluent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work described the development, optimization and validation of an analytical method for rapid detection of multiple-class pharmaceuticals in both municipal wastewater and sludge samples based on ultrasonic solvent extraction, solid-phase extraction, and ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification. The results indicated that the developed method could effectively extract all the target pharmaceuticals (25) in a single process and analyze them within 24 min. The recoveries of the target pharmaceuticals were in the range of 69%-131% for wastewater and 54%-130% for sludge at different spiked concentration levels. The method quantification limits in wastewater and sludge ranged from 0.02 to 0.73 ng/L and from 0.02 to 1.00 mu g/kg, respectively. Subsequently, this method was validated and applied for residual pharmaceutical analysis in a wastewater treatment plant located in Beijing, China. All the target pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent samples with concentrations varying from 0.09 ng/L (tiamulin) to 15.24 mu g/L (caffeine); meanwhile, up to 23 pharmaceuticals were detected in sludge samples with concentrations varying from 60 ng/kg (sulfamethizole) to 8.55 mg/kg (ofloxacin). The developed method demonstrated its selectivity, sensitivity, and reliability for detecting multiple-class pharmaceuticals in complex matrices such as municipal wastewater and sludge.

AB Wastewater treatments can eliminate or remove a substantial amount of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), but there may still be significant concentrations of them in effluents discharged into surface water bodies. Beirolas wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is located in the Lisbon area and makes its effluent discharges into Tagus estuary (Portugal). The main objective of this study is to quantify a group of 32 PhACs in the different treatments used in this WWTP. Twelve sampling campaigns of wastewater belonging to the different treatments were made in 2013-2014 in order to study their removal efficiency. The wastewaters were analysed by solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (UPLC-MS/MS). The anti-diabetics were the most frequently found in wastewater influent (WWI) and wastewater effluent (WWE) (208 and 1.7 mu g/L, respectively), followed by analgesics/antipyretics (135 mu g/L and < LOQ, respectively), psychostimulants (113 and 0.49 mu g/L, respectively), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (33 and 2.6 mu g/L, respectively), antibiotics (5.2 and 1.8 mu g/L, respectively), antilipidemics (1.6 and 0.24 mu g/L, respectively), anticonvulsants (1.5 and 0.63 mu g/L, respectively) and beta blockers (1.3 and 0.51 mu g/L, respectively). A snapshot of the ability of each treatment step to remove these target PhACs is provided, and it was found that global efficiency is strongly dependent on the efficiency of secondary treatment. Seasonal occurrence and removal efficiency was also monitored, and they did not show a significant seasonal trend.

AB The widespread use of pharmaceuticals by human populations results in their sustained discharge to surface waters via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, 16 highly prescribed pharmaceuticals were quantified along a 250 km transect of the Hudson River Estuary and New York Harbor to describe their sources and spatial patterns. Sampling was conducted over two dry weather periods in May and July 2016, at 72 sites which included mid-channel and nearshore sites, as well as locations influenced by tributaries and WWTP outfalls. The detection frequency of the study pharmaceuticals was almost identical between the May and July sampling periods at 55% and 52%, respectively. Six pharmaceuticals were measurable at 92% or more of the sites during both sampling periods, illustrating their ubiquitous presence throughout the study area. Individual pharmaceutical concentrations were highly variable spatially, ranging from non-detect to 3810 ng/L. during the study. Major factors controlling concentrations were proximity and magnitude of WWTP discharges, inputs from tributaries and tidal mixing. Two compounds, sucralose and caffeine, were evaluated as tracers to identify wastewater sources and assess pharmaceutical behavior. Sucralose was useful in identifying wastewater inputs to the river and concentrations showed excellent correlations with numerous pharmaceuticals in the study. Caffeine-sucralose ratios showed potential in identifying discharges of untreated wastewater occurring during a combined sewage overflow event Many of the study pharmaceuticals were present throughout the Hudson River Estuary as a consequence of sustained wastewater discharge. Whereas some concentrations were above published effects levels, a more complete risk assessment is needed to understand the potential for ecological impacts due to pharmaceuticals in the Hudson River Estuary.

AB The occurrence of 26 antibiotics from three groups of Sulfonamides, Quinolones and Macrolides were investigated in the surface water of Pudong New Area, Shanghai in March (dry season) and June (wet season). As a result, the detection rates of the three groups were 20%, 81% and 56% (n = 10) with the concentration range of not detected-9.73 ng L-1, 30-344 ng L-1, and 14-107 ng L-1, respectively. Comparably, during wet season, the detection rates were 20%, 56% and 25% with the range of ND -14 ng L-1, 32-92 ng L-1, and ND-22 ng L-1, respectively. This indicates higher concentrations in dry season than that in wet season, which was attributed to the water dilution and weaker self-purification of the river during dry season. In addition, significant correlations were observed between SMA and most of Quinolones during dry season, and Quinolones and Macrolides during wet season, due to the similar sources. Considering for the typical wastewater sources in the investigated area, Quinolones were identified to be the most significant group in the aquiculture water. Furthermore, pharmaceutical manufacturing factory (PMF) and sewage treatment plant (STP) should be the serious point source pollution as the concentration in their effluents could range from ng L-1 to mg L-1. The occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the aquatic system of Pudong New Area need to be paid more attention to prevent the potential risk for human beings in the future study.

AB Pharmaceuticals, by design, induce biological responses in animals and humans at very low doses, making their presence in the aquatic environment an issue of concern. Prescription and over-the-counter drugs commonly found in wastewater are discharged on a continuous basis into the waters of two coastal watersheds in Atlantic Canada. Ten acidic drugs and caffeine were observed in the final effluents of sewage treatment facilities in Millcove (Halifax watershed), and Trenton (Pictou watershed), Nova Scotia. Naproxen and ibuprofen, two highly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and caffeine, were the predominant compounds. Naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylic acid (metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid), diclofenac (NSAID) and gemfibrozil (lipid regulator) were also detected in the low ng/L range in the receiving waters of treated and untreated sewage outflows. Acidic drugs were not detected in the marine waters of the Cocagne watershed located in southeast New Brunswick. This watershed was evaluated for the possibility of contamination of near-shore coastal waters from domestic septic systems in the vicinity of a densely populated cottage area. The observation of traces of caffeine suggests some organic pollution in the area. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and four benzodiazepines/anti-depressants (ADs) in municipal wastewater in Mardan city, Pakistan, and in River Kabul and River Indus receiving untreated sewage. Liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for the analysis of paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and codeine (NSAIDs) and diazepam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam (ADs). Except codeine and lorazepam, all the target compounds were observed in sewage and surface water in various concentrations. In sewage, paracetamol was found at the higher end (32.4 mu g/L) of the reported ranges in literature for other countries. Results of river samples showed that the target compounds were usually lower in concentration than the respective EC50 values for aquatic organisms. However, the levels for paracetamol and ibuprofen were critical depicting the consequence of untreated disposal. Environmental risk assessment by estimating the risk quotient (RQ) as the ratio of measured environmental concentration and predicted no-effect concentration showed medium to high (RQ > 1 and 0.1 < RQ < 1) risk from paracetamol and ibuprofen to aquatic organisms in River Kabul and Kalpani stream, Pakistan.

   CONTAMINATION
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include a wide variety of compounds like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites. In developing countries, CEC are gaining interest as they are contaminating the water resources. In Tunisia, for the first time, a total of 25 PPCPs and three of their metabolites were analysed in wastewater, reclaimed water, surface water and groundwater. Most of selected CEC were detected not only in raw wastewater, but also in treated wastewater and reclaimed water. High contents of Cl and Na in wastewater and reclaimed water were an indication of industrial discharge. PPCPs were detected in surface water from the Meliane River; the highest concentrations were measured close to the estuary to the Mediterranean Sea. High concentrations of 2-OH-ibuprofene in the Meliane River downstream a wastewater treatment plant might result from the biodegradation of ibuprofen during secondary wastewater treatment. Based on their levels of concentration, it is proposed to use carbamazepine, caffeine, ibuprofene, atenolol, fenofibric acid, methylparabene, bisphenol A, and 2-OH-ibuprofene as indicators of wastewater-derived pollution of surface water resources in Tunisia. Salinity of the groundwater in the study area is controlled by sea water entered decades ago due to over-pumping of groundwater. Groundwater quality is also influenced by CEC as sulfamethoxazol, carbamazepine, methylparabene, propylparabene, bisphenol A, trichlosan, and 1-H-benzotriazole were detected in groundwater collected from an area exposed to irrigation with reclaimed water. The presence of these compounds indicates that they are not completely removed during soil passage according to incomplete sorption and/or biodegradation. Thus, these compounds are suggested as indicators of wastewater contamination confirming the pollution of groundwater resources at sites where wastewater is reused for irrigation in agriculture. Special attention has to be paid to the occurrence of TRS occurring in groundwater since this compound is recognized to produce antibiotic resistance in the environment.

AB Sertraline is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the last few years. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is regularly detected in wastewaters, surface waters, sediments, biosolids and biota. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants are the main contributors to its presence in the environment. The presented study aims to elucidate the processes involved in its removal, concentrating mainly on sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment.
   We performed our laboratory scale experiments in two sets of experiments: 1) batch biodegradation and sorption experiments and 2) flow-through laboratory scale pilot wastewater treatment bioreactors. The batch experiments revealed that sorption to activated sludge was the leading removal process, eliminating up to 90% of sertraline present in the batches. Biodegradation was however the secondary removal process, influenced by the presence of alternative easily biodegradable carbon sources. We postulated chemical structures of ten detected biotransformation products. Among these, we propose the previously recognized metabolite norsertraline, sertraline ketone and hydroxy-sertraline. All the remaining biotransformation products are herein reported for the first time.
   The removal efficiency of approximately 94% was determined after the treatment in the flow-through bioreactors. To support our findings, we sampled influents and effluents from two wastewater treatment plants and untreated wastewater from a psychiatric hospital. Removal efficiencies of 81% and 77% were determined, and along with the parent compound sertraline, the presence of eight transformation products was confirmed in the actual wastewaters.

AB The aim of the this study was to investigate the ozone dosage required to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from biologically treated wastewater of varying quality, originated from different raw wastewater and wastewater treatment processes.
   Secondary effluents from six Swedish wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) were spiked with 42 APIs (nominal concentration 1 mu g/L) and treated with different O-3 doses (0.5-12.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments.
   In order to compare the sensitivity of APIs in each matrix, the specific dose of ozone required to achieve reduction by one decade of each investigated API (DDO3) was determined for each effluent by fitting a first order equation to the remaining concentration of API at each applied ozone dose. Ozone dose requirements were found to vary significantly between effluents depending on their matrix characteristics.
   The specific ozone dose was then normalized to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of each effluent. The DDO3/DOC ratios were comparable for each API between the effluents.
   15 of the 42 investigated APIs could be classified as easily degradable (DDO3/DOC <= 0.7), while 19 were moderately degradable (0.7 < DDO3/DOC <= 1.4), and 8 were recalcitrant towards O-3-treatment (DDO3/DOC > 1.4). Furthermore, we predict that a reasonable estimate of the ozone dose required to remove any of the investigated APIs may be attained by multiplying the experimental average DDO3/DOC obtained with the actual DOC of any effluent.

AB Treated wastewater is being increasingly used for irrigation and aquifer replenishment through artificial recharge. However, wastewater reuse can result in contamination of exposed soil and groundwater by chemicals such as some pharmaceuticals and their metabolites. The fate of these molecules depends largely on their capacity to sorb onto soil and aquifer materials during infiltration. In this study, the sorption isotherm of carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-seizure medication, and two of its metabolites, i.e. carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-EP) and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), were determined in two soils in laboratory assays. In the field, the presence of CBZ and its metabolites were investigated in soil and in groundwater underlying an irrigated area with treated wastewater. The results showed that CBZ had the highest carbon normalised sorption coefficients in the two tested soils (irrigated soil and a Lufa SP2.4 reference soil) followed by CBZ-EP and DiOH-CBZ, indicating the relatively higher mobility of CBZ metabolites compared to CBZ. The chromatographic analysis revealed that CBZ and its two metabolites were present in treated wastewater used for irrigation and in groundwater. In soil samples, CBZ concentrations showed a build-up taking place with irrigation. The mobility of metabolites in soil and their potential biodegradation require further investigation.

AB The first part of this study examined the effect of operating conditions on Fenton pretreatment of an antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin. The optimum H2O2/COD and H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratios were 2.5 and 20, respectively. Under the optimum operating conditions, complete degradation of the antibiotics occurred in 1 min. In the second part of this study, a bench-scale SBR was operated for 239 days and fed with Fenton-treated wastewater under different operating conditions. BOD5/COD ratio below 0.40 of the Fenton-treated wastewater had negative effect on the SBR performance. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h was found suitable for the SBR and increasing HRT to 24 and 48 h did not significantly improve the SBR efficiency. Statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA) was made on the results to optimize the H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio and Fenton reaction time and it was found possible to reduce the Fe' dose and increase the Fenton reaction time. Under the best operating conditions (H2O2/COD molar ratio 2.5, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio 150, Fenton reaction time 120 min and HRT 12 h), the combined Fenton-SBR process efficiency was 89% for sCOD removal and the SBR effluent met the discharge standards. Combined Fenton-SBR is a feasible process for antibiotic wastewater treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pollution of wastewater with antibiotics and antibiotics resistance genes has attracted public concerns about ecosystem and global health. Swine wastewater can contain high concentrations of antibiotics, especially sulfonamides, even after full-scale wastewater treatment. In this study, mesocosm-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands (VF-CWs) were applied to abate nutrients and antibiotics in swine wastewater containing sulfonamides. VF-CWs performed well in the removal of both nutrients and antibiotics. Sulfonamides did not influence total organic carbon (TOC) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, and even slightly enhanced NH4+-N removal. High removal efficiencies (26.42-84.05%) were achieved for sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SMZ). Together with lab-scale sorption and biodegradation experiments, microbial degradation was found to be the most important removal mechanism for sulfonamides in VF-CWs. Sulfonamides addition increased bacterial alphadiversity and changed microbial community structure. Moreover, antibiotics promoted antibiotic-resistant or -degrading bacteria. Bacillus, Geobacter and other seven genera were correlated with sulfonamides reduction under either aerobic or anaerobic condition. In summary, VF-CW is a suitable alternative for swine wastewater treatment, and biodegradation plays the key role in sulfonamides abatement.
   Main findings of the work.
   This was the first work to combine bacterial community analysis with microcosm experiments to uncover the major removal mechanism of sulfonamides in constructed wetlands. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater contains huge amounts of hazardous pollutants which are being discharged daily to environment with or without treatment. Antibiotics were among the important group of pharmaceuticals considered as a potential source of health risk for human and other living creatures. Although the investigations about the existence of antibiotics in hospital wastewater have gained concern for researchers in many countries, there is only one research conducted in Hanoi-Vietnam. Hence, in this study, investigations have been done to fulfill the requirement of real situation in Vietnam by accomplishing survey for 39 health care facilities in Ho Chi Minh City. As results, seven popular antibiotics were detected to exist in all samples such as sulfamethoxazole (2.5 +/- 1.9 mu g/L), norfloxacin (9.6 +/- 9.8 mu g/L), ciprofloxacin (5.3 +/- 4.8 mu g/L), ofloxacin (10.9 +/- 8.1 mu g/L), erythromycin (1.2 +/- 1.2 mu g/L), tetracycline (0.1 +/- 0.0 mu g/L), and trimethoprim (1.0 +/- 0.9 mu g/L). On the other hand, survey also showed that only 64% of health care facilities using conventional activate sludge (AS) processes in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As a consequence, basic environmental factors (BOD5, COD, TSS, NH4+-N, or total coliforms) were not effectively removed from the hospital wastewater due to problems relating to initial design or operational conditions. Therefore, 18% effluent samples of the surveyed WWTPs have exceeded the national standard limits (QCVN 28:2010, level B).

AB Coagulation-flocculation and flotation processes were evaluated for the pre-treatment of hospital wastewater, including the removal of 13 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Coagulation-flocculation assays were performed in a jar-Test device and in a continuous pilot-scale plant. Raw hospital wastewater as well as the effluent from the continuous coagulation plant were treated in a flotation cell. Removal of total suspended solids (TSS) during pre-treatment was very effective, reaching an average removal efficiency of 92% in the combined coagulation-flotation process. Musk fragrances were eliminated to a high degree during batch coagulation-flocculation (tonalide: 83.4 +/- 14.3%; galaxolide: 79.2 +/- 9.9%; celestolide: 77.7 +/- 16.8%), presumably due to their strong lipophilic character which promotes the interaction of these compounds with the lipid fraction of solids. For cliclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP) maximum removals of 46%, 42% and 23%, respectively, were obtained, while the rest of PPCPs were not affected by the physico-chemical treatment. Flotation of raw wastewater led to slightly worse results compared to coagulation-flocculation, although the combined action of both improved the overall efficiency of the process. The proposed pre-treatment strategy for hospital wastewater is useful for assimilating its conventional physico-chemical characteristics to that of municipal wastewater as well as for reducing the load of some PPCPs into the sewer system.

AB A survey on the presence of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater of a Spanish Mediterranean area (Castellon province) was carried out. The scope of the study included a wide variety of pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutical classes. For this purpose, 112 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, from different conventional wastewater treatment plants were collected. Two monitoring programmes were carried out along several seasons. The first was in June 2008 and January 2009, and the second in April and October 2009. During the first monitoring, the occurrence of 20 analytes in 84 urban wastewater samples (influent and effluent) was studied. The selection of these pharmaceuticals was mainly based on consumption. From these, 17 compounds were detected in the samples, with analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and lipid regulators being the most frequently detected groups. 4-Aminoantipyrine, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, naproxen and venlafaxine were the compounds most frequently found. In the highlight of these results, the number of analytes was increased up to around 50. A lot of antibiotic compounds were added to the target list as they were considered "priority pharmaceuticals" due to their more potential hazardous effects in the aquatic environment. Data obtained during the second monitoring programme (spring and autumn) corroborated the results from the first one (summer and winter). Analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators together with quinolone and macrolide antibiotics were the most abundant pharmaceuticals. Similar median concentrations were found over the year and seasonal variation was not clearly observed. The removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater treatment plants was roughly evaluated. Our results indicated that elimination of most of the selected compounds occurred during the treatment process of influent wastewater, although it was incomplete. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotics that play an important role in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. FQs can reach wastewater treatment plants from different routes, and eventually accumulate in activated sludge. In this study, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with HPLC-FLD detection method was utilized to investigate the partition and fate of FQs in digested sludge when thermal hydrolysis was used as pretreatment. As a result, thermal hydrolysis showed minor effects on the fate of FQs in batch anaerobic digestion processes, while anaerobic digestion alone removed >60% FQs and finally assisted in the mitigation of the inhibitory effects to microbial communities.

AB This study investigated the degradation of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol beta-blockers by ferrate (K2FeO4) in hospital wastewater and in aqueous solution. In the case of hospital wastewater, the effect of the independent variables pH and [Fe(VI)] was evaluated by means of response surface methodology. The results showed that Fe(VI) plays an important role in the oxidation-coagulation process, and the treatment of the hospital wastewater led to degradations above 90% for all the three beta-blockers, and to reductions of aromaticity that were close to 60%. In addition, only 17% of the organic load was removed. In aqueous solution, the degradation of the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol was 71.7%, 24.7% and 96.5%, respectively, when a ratio of 1:10 [beta-blocker]:[Fe(VI)] was used. No mineralization was achieved, which suggests that there was a conversion of the beta-blockers to degradation products identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tandem. Degradation pathways were proposed, which took account of the role of Fe(VI). Furthermore, the ready biodegradability of the post-process samples was evaluated by using the closed bottle test, and showed an increase in biodegradability. The use of the ferrate advanced oxidation technology seems to be a useful means of ensuring the remediation of hospital and similar wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To understand the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment bioreactors, the ARGs in sludge from two full-scale pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were investigated and compared with sludge samples from three sewage treatment plants (STPs) using metagenomic approach. The results showed that the ARG abundances in PWWTP sludge ranged from 54.7 to 585.0 ppm, which were higher than those in STP sludge (27.2 to 86.4 ppm). Moreover, the diversity of ARGs in PWWTP aerobic sludge (153 subtypes) was higher than that in STP aerobic sludge (118 subtypes). In addition, it was found that the profiles of ARGs in PWWTP aerobic sludge were similar to those in STP aerobic sludge but different from those in PWWTP anaerobic sludge, suggesting that dissolve oxygen (DO) could be one of the important factors affecting the profiles of ARGs. In PWWTP aerobic sludge, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance genes were frequently detected. While, tetracycline, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and polypeptide resistance genes were abundantly present in PWWTP anaerobic sludge. Furthermore, we investigated the microbial community and the correlation between microbial community and ARGs in PWWTP sludge. And, significant correlations between ARG types and seven bacterial genera were found. In addition, the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were also examined and correlations between the ARGs and MGEs in PWWTP sludge were observed. Collectively, our results suggested that the microbial community and MGEs, which could be affected by DO, might be the main factors shaping the profiles of ARGs in PWWTP sludge.

AB There is no quantitative data on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in the aquatic environment in Southeast Asian countries, particularly no information on their suitability as indicators of raw wastewater contamination on surface water and groundwater. This study provided the first quantitative information on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in raw wastewater, surface water and groundwater in the urban catchment area in Singapore. Acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose were ubiquitous in raw wastewater samples at concentrations in the range of ng/L-mu g/L, while other sweeteners were not found or found only in a few of the raw wastewater samples. Residential and commercial effluents were demonstrated to be the two main sources of artificial sweeteners entering the municipal sewer systems. Relatively higher concentrations of the detected sweeteners were frequently found in surface waters at the sampling sites located in the residential/commercial areas. No significant difference in the concentrations of the detected sweeteners in surface water or groundwater was noted between wet and dry weather conditions (unpaired T-test, p>0.05). Relatively higher concentrations and detection frequencies of acesulfame, cyclamate and saccharin in surface water samples were observed at the potentially impacted sampling sites, while these sweeteners were absent in most of the background surface water samples. Similarly, acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin were found in most groundwater samples at the monitoring well (GW6), which is located close to known leaking sewer segment; whereas these were absent in the background monitoring well, which is located in the catchment with no known wastewater sources. Taken together, the results suggest that acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin can be used as potential indicators of raw wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater.

AB A comprehensive study was conducted at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and one water treatment plant (WTP) in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The occurrence of 220 emerging and legacy compounds, their removal efficiencies by the existing treatment processes, and their potential environmental impacts were studied. The results are reported in a two part paper. In this part (I), the occurrence and removal efficiencies are presented. Three of the 47 target pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) contributed 89-96% of the total concentration of PhACs/EDCs in the WWTP influents. They were acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. The existing treatment processes successfully removed between 95 and 98% of 'all' PhACs/EDCs, primarily due to the high removal rates of these three analgesics. Concentrations of PhACs/EDCs detected at the WTP intake were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in the effluent of the upstream WWTP. These concentrations remained relatively unchanged in the finished drinking water, indicating the WTP's low removal efficiency for trace amounts of them. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were detected at concentrations as high as 150 ng/L (for PBDE-209) in the WWTPs' influent, and removed at 86-96% efficiency. PDBE effluent concentrations were mostly below 1 ng/L at both WWTPs, with a maximum of 9 ng/L for PBDE-209. Octylphenol, nonylphenol, and nonylphenol ethoxylates concentrations were monitored in one WWTP's effluent, and ranged between undetectable and 286 ng/L (LoDs varied between 1.3 and 15.2 ng/L).

AB The presence of sewage-borne Organic Micro-Pollutants (OMP) in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) effluents represents an increasing concern when water is reclaimed for irrigation or even indirect potable reuse. During eighteen months, an innovative hybrid water reclamation scheme based on a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) enhanced with Powder Activated Carbon (PAC) was operated at pilot-scale (70 m(3)/d) in order to compare it with state-of-the art Wastewater Reclamation System (WWRS) also revamped with a final step of ozonation-UV. Removal of persistent OMP, water quality and treatment costs were evaluated and compared for the different treatment schemes. OMP removal efficiency results for the different schemes concluded that established technologies, such as physico-chemical and filtration systems as well as MBR, do not remove significantly (>15%) the most recalcitrant compounds. The upgrading of these two systems through the addition of ozonation-UV step and PAC dosing allowed improving average recalcitrant OMP removal to 85 +/- 2 and 75 +/- 5%, respectively. In term of costs, PAC-MBR represents an increase of 37% of costs regarding conventional systems but presents improvements of 50% reduction in space and water quality. On the other hand, ozonation requires up to a 15% increase of foot-print; nevertheless, represents lower costs and lower carbon footprint. Ozonation-UV seems to be the best option for upgrading existing facilities, while PAC-MBR should be considered when space represents a critical limitation and produced water is reused for high water quality purposes.

AB Research on the effects of chemical pollution in the environment that is related to urban wastewaters' discharge and reuse until recently was focused almost exclusively on conventional pollutants. During the last several years though there has been a growing level of concern related to the hypothesis that various chemicals may exhibit endocrine disrupting effects. In addition, thousands of tons of pharmacologically active substances are used annually ending up in the wastewaters. In many countries facing prolonged droughts and implementing wastewater reuse schemes for irrigation and groundwater discharge, the existence of xenobiotic compounds in the tertiary treated wastewaters constitutes a new concern. This study describes the application of a recently developed multi-residue method for the determination of 29 multi-class pharmaceuticals using off line solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The method was applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues at three sewage treatment plants in Cyprus serving major coastal Mediterranean cities. The presence of 19 pharmaceuticals was confirmed. For some of the compounds high concentrations were obtained for the final effluents (e.g. ofloxacin: 4.82 mu g/L, diclofenac: 5.51 mu g/L, carbamazepine: 27.27 mu g/L, metoprolol: 9.59 mu g/L). Concerning the elimination potential, what was derived from the study is that the biological treatment step contributes the most to the removal of the compounds while sand filtration and chlorination steps reduce slightly the residual concentrations.

AB For nearly two decades, the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) has been used as a valuable tool for determining the total estrogenic potency of various environmental samples, including influent and effluent streams at municipal wastewater plants. However, applying the YES assay to wastewater sludges and stabilized biosolids has been problematic. This is due to co-extracted compounds from the solids either proving toxic to the yeast or masking the presence of estrogenic substances. The present research describes the development and validation of sample preparation steps that mitigate the toxicity effects of municipal wastewater sludge and biosolid samples in the YES assay, while allowing for reliable dose-dependent expression of estrogenic activity. A copper work-up for sulfur removal and chromatographic cleanup with silica and alumina were required in addition to solid-phase extraction to adequately remove interfering compounds. Sample stabilization methods such as autoclaving, lyophilization and formaldehyde treatment were found to be detrimental to the assay. Hence, heat-drying is recommended to prevent cytotoxicity and the degradation of estrogenic substances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim antibiotics in four full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that differ in design and operating conditions was determined. The WWTPs chosen utilized a variety of secondary removal processes, such as a two stage activated sludge process with a nitrification tank, extended aeration, rotating biological contactors, and pure oxygen activated sludge. Several of the WWTPs also employed an advanced treatment process, such as chlorination and UV radiation disinfection. The detected concentrations (mu g/l) ranged from 0.20 to 1.4 for ciprofloxacin, 0.21 to 2.8 for sulfamethoxazole, 0.061 to 1.1 for tetracycline, and 0.21 to 7.9 for trimethoprim. The overall percent difference in the concentrations of the antibiotics in the effluent and influent of these antibiotics differed between plants and ranged from 33% to 97%. Based on these four full-scale WWTPs evaluated, the apparent removal of organic micropollutants in wastewater is dependent on a combination of biological and physicochemical treatment processes and operating conditions of the treatment system.

AB To date, the utilization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is found from numerous fields of applications including separation, storage, sensing, and many other miscellaneous ones. Their feasibility toward wastewater treatment (WWT) for several pollutants (e.g., heavy metal ions, pesticides, volatile organic pollutants (VOCs), and other hazardous chemicals) has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we attempted to provide the current technical advances associated with MOF-based WWT in reference to conventional materials. Our review emphasized current perspectives on contamination processes in water systems and performance of MOF in diverse WWT applications.

AB A one-year monitoring study was performed to evaluate the occurrence, persistence and fate of a group of 14 organic compounds in a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in the south of Spain. These results are part of a more extensive study, financed by the Spanish Ministry of Research with the aim to evaluate the traceability of new pollutants on the Mediterranean coast and to determine the removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants (STP) for these pollutants. The compounds which have been analyzed include pharmaceuticals of various therapeutic categories (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, dipyrone, diclofenac, carbamazepine and codeine), pesticides (chlorfenvinfos and permethrin), caffeine, triclosan, bisphenol A and three of their more relevant metabolites (1,7-dimethylxanthine, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide and 2,7/2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). An SPE/GC-MS multi-residue analytical method was developed and validated to facilitate simultaneous determination of these compounds in both influent and effluent wastewater. The method provided mean recoveries higher than 75%, with the exception of 2,7/2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, dipyrone and permethrin which exhibited recoveries lower than 22%. The overall variability of the method was below 14%. The method detection limit (LOD) was between 1 and 100 ng l(-1) and precision, which was calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), ranged from 1.8% to 11.2%. The application of the proposed method has allowed the identification of all the target compounds at mean concentrations which ranged from 0.12 to 134 mu g l(-1) in the influent and from 0.09 to 18.0 mu g l(-1) in the effluent. The removal efficiencies of the STP for these compounds varied from 20% (carbamazepine) to 99% (acetaminophen), but in all cases resulted insufficient in order to avoid their presence in treated water and subsequently in the environment.

AB The effluents of eight municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Western Europe were analyzed by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry for the occurrence of 36 polar pollutants, comprising household and industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. In a long-term study of the effluents of three WWTP over 10 months, sulfophenyl carboxylates and ethylene diamino tetraacetate (EDTA) were detected above 10 mu g/L on average, while benzotriazoles, benzothiazole-2-sulfonate, diclofenac, and carbamazepine showed mean concentrations of 1-10 mu g/L, followed by some flame retardants, naphthalene disulfonates, and personal care products in the range of 0.1-1 mu g/L. Half of the determined compounds were not significantly removed in tertiary wastewater treatment. By dividing the effluent concentration of a compound by its relative removal in WWTP a water cycle spreading index (WCSI) was calculated for each compound. We propose that this index provides a measure for the potential of a polar compound to spread along a partially closed water cycle after discharge with municipal wastewater and to occur in raw waters used for drinking water production. Polar pollutants in surface water samples of different catchments showed increasing concentration for compounds with increasing WCSI.

AB Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are one of the most widely prescribed psychoactive drugs, however their persistence in the receiving environment has raised great concerns about their potential ecological risks. Here we investigated the occurrence, fate and mass loading of 17 BZDs and their 3 transformation products in 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Guangdong province, China. A total of 10 BZDs and 1 transformation product were found in the WWTPs influents, effluents and excess sludge, with concentrations reaching up to 44.5 ng/L (clozapine), 27.1 ng/L (oxazepam) and 62.9 ng/g (clozapine), respectively. The overall removal efficiency varied widely from negative to complete removal in these 11 WWTPs. Mass balance analysis of two representative WWTPs (WWTPA and WWTPB) with different treatment processes showed that their removals were mainly attributed to the sludge adsorption and biodegradation/biotransformation. The total usage of detected BZDs was estimated to be 185 kg/y in Guangdong province, China, while the total emission was 143 kg/y. Based on sewage epidemiology method, the total back-estimated consumption and emissions of BZDs and their transformation products in one district of Guangzhou (WWTPC service area) were 1012 mg/d/1000 people and 10.1 mg/d/1000 people, respectively. The findings from this study demonstrate the persistence of BZDs in WWTPs and also provide basis for further investigation into the potential ecological risks from this group of chemicals.

AB Industrial wastewater flow caused operational difficulties in the wastewater treatment plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Bioaugmentation was successfully applied to maintain effluent quality in the periods when wastewater of high starch content was accepted, but, at the end of 2008, the nitrification capacity of the plant decreased considerably due to improperly pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater.
   Dynamic simulations were carried out in a prototype programme developed by the Environmental Expert System Research Group at the University of Pannonia, Hungary. Several parameters for heterotrophic biomass were adjusted in function of time, and the specific growth rate of autotrophic biomass was altered in function of time and temperature in order to describe the effects of inoculation and toxic influence. Simulations were carried out with both constant and adjusted parameters.
   Though results on effluent COD of the different modelling versions were similar, the ammonia concentration fitted the measured data only when modified parameters were used. The study revealed that the autotrophic biomass had slowly adapted to the toxic compound. Different control strategies of aeration and decreased excess sludge removal rate were tested to enhance the nitrification in the critical time intervals. The amount of ammonia and inorganic nitrogen decreased in all cases while the oxygen demand increased to a maximum of 10.1%.
   Reducing excess sludge removal rate gave satisfactory results even without changing aeration. Further improvement could be achieved by introducing aeration into the post-denitrification reactor. The combination of the two modifications can compensate for the effect caused by toxicity.

AB Mathematical modelling plays a key role in understanding and quantifying uncertainties of emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs). This paper presents for the first time a simplified emerging pollutant pathway that incorporates two pathways to sequestration. It develops deterministic and stochastic ordinary differential equations to gain insight into the fate and behaviour of a case study pharmaceutical, with particular focus on sorption to the solid phase, as well as the nature of the experimentally measured solid parent compound. Statistical estimation and inferential procedures are developed and via a proof-of-concept examination, the study explores the transformation pathways of the bioactive chemicals (BACs) in the bioreactor, which is the heart of the WWTP. Simulations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a case study, show good agreement with data. The results suggest that the measured EE2-parent concentration in the solid phase is very similar to the model-based sequestered (rather than adsorbed) EE2-parent concentration.

AB The occurrence and distribution of eight UV filters benzophenone (BP), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (OD-PABA), 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS), isoamyl benzoate, and benzyl cinnamate in eleven sites among three rivers, five sewage treatment plants (STPs), and four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different parts of Korea was investigated. The total concentrations of UV filters in the three sampled seasons were 62.9-412 ng L-1 (river), 417-5055 ng L-1 (STP influent), 108-2201 ng L-1 (STP effluent), 122-4154 ng L-1 (WWTP influent), and 120-849 ng L-1 (WWTP effluent). The concentration of the target pollutants in the influent of the treatment systems was directly proportional to the resident population density. A seasonal increase of >27% was observed in the total concentration of the UV filters in the rivers and influents of the treatment plants (TPs) during summer. BP, BP-3, EHMC, 4-MBC, and EHSwere the most dominant, showing a distinct distribution pattern that was dependent on the effectiveness of the treatment process and properties of each compound. The concentrations of the UV filters were higher in the TPs influents than in the rivers, and the most dominant UV filters in the rivers were those with low removal rate. Although biological treatment processes favored the removal of the UV filter compounds in the TPs, complete removal was not achieved before discharge into the rivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB An analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of six selected endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs: diltiazem, progesterone, benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), estrone, carbamazepine (Cbz), acetaminophen) was developed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ES-MS/MS). All of the parameters for HPLC and ES-MS/MS systems including mobile phase composition, flow rate, and sample injection volume were optimized to obtain not only the best separation of species interested but also low detection limits. Reverse phase chromatography coupled to ES-MS/MS was used for the separation and detection of EDCs. Formic acid (0.10% ) and 5.0 mM ammonium formate were selected as mobile phase composition in gradient elution. Detection limits for diltiazem, progesterone, BBP, estrone, Cbz, and acetaminophen were found to be 0.13, 0.12, 0.04, 0.13, 0.12, and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Influent and effluents from three different wastewater treatment plants located in Ankara, i.e., rotating flat-sheet membrane unit, pilot type flat-sheet membrane unit located at METU Campus and samples from Ankara central wastewater treatment plant were analyzed for their EDCs contents under the optimum conditions.

AB This study was designed to analyze pharmaceuticals removal using biological sewage and wastewater treatment processes. Since pharmaceutical removal efficiency in a bioreactor was very low, it was determined that removing pharmaceuticals using biological treatment alone is very difficult. Thus, it attempted to identify the pharmaceutical removal characteristics with main physical and chemical processes such as coagulation sedimentation, ozonation, activated carbon treatment, and chlorine disinfection process as targets. The removal efficiency by coagulation and sedimentation turned out to be highest in atenolol with 16%. Other substances exhibited low removal rates regardless of coagulant dosage. Results of the batch test in which 30 mg/L of ozone was injected stepwise showed that diclofenac and trimethoprim showed a 95% removal rate at an ozone concentration of 5 mg/L, while iopromide with the lowest processing efficiency exhibited a 90% removal rate at a high ozone concentration of 30 mg/L. The same trend was found in the activated carbon adsorption process in that substances such as iopromide and mefenamic acid showed satisfactory removal rates at EBCT = 15 min.

AB This study assessed the ability to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) of three different full-scale hybrid pond-constructed wetlands and a conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The four systems were fed with primary-treated urban wastewaters. The three hybrid systems consisted of several different subsystems (ponds, surface flow constructed wetlands and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands) connected in series, and their PPCP degradation efficiency was monitored. In addition, the enantiomeric behaviour of ibuprofen was studied in all the subsystems. The hybrid systems were at least as efficient in PPCP removal as the WWTP, removal efficiencies mainly exceeding 70%. Moreover, enantiomeric analysis indicates that ibuprofen removal followed a predominantly aerobic and microbiological pathway. Constructed wetlands and ponds are therefore successful technologies for removing PPCPs from wastewater and the most significant removal process in these systems is biologically mediated.

AB The system ozone and hydrogen peroxide was used to reclaim wastewater from the secondary clarifier from a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of Alcala de Henares (Madrid-Spain). The assays were performed by bubbling a gas mixture of oxygen and ozone, with similar to 24 g Nm(-3) of ozone concentration, through a volume of wastewater samples for 20 minutes at 25 degrees C. The removal of dissolved micropollutants such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Organic Carbon (TOC) was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. Removal efficiency ratios in the range of 7-26 mg O-3/mg TOC and 0.24 mg O-3 /ng micropollutants at 5 minutes of ozonation were assessed as reference data to reclaim wastewater from STP. The relation between the extent of TOC removed and ozone doses used was related by a second-order kinetic model in which the time-integrated ozone-hydrogen peroxide concentration was included.

Average influent concentrations of OMC, HHCB, OC, AHTN, 4-MBC and OT were at 20070, 4420, 1680,1430, 960 and 720 ng L-1, respectively The other PCMs, permethrin and carbendazim ranged between < limits of quantification and 670 ng L-1. Concentrations in the water line decreased significantly for most compounds. Removal rates for PCMs ranged from 72% to 86%, for UV filters from 92% to > 99% and were at 92% and 37% for permethrin and carbendazim, respectively. Removal during wastewater treatment was mainly driven by sorption onto solids and biodegradation. For anaerobic sludge digestion, elimination of PCMs, OMC and the biocides was observed.

AB Pharmaceuticals and particularly antibiotics can harm sensitive aquatic species. Their occurrence in urban wastewater systems is the consequence of five successive processes: (i) ingestion of the substance, (ii) accumulation in the urine, (iii) excretion, (iv) degradation in the sewer system and (v) transport to the wastewater treatment plant (WTP). These processes were included in an integrated model that can be used to assess the dynamics of pharmaceuticals at a WTP inlet. First, information on sales data, posology, pharmacokinetics and toilet flushing frequency were combined to create a source model of pharmaceuticals entering a sewer system. This production function was then coupled with a transport/degradation model to simulate concentrations of pharmaceuticals at a WTP inlet. In an example application, the full model was applied to simulate the concentration of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin on an hourly time scale. In this application, the model was calibrated and validated for a case study at a WTP in Lausanne, Switzerland. Validation of the integrated approach was successful despite the high variability evident in the model results. This modeling approach has potential use in pollution management and epidemiology related to wastewater.

AB The detection of microcontaminants in aquatic environments raises concerns about their potential to exert ecotoxicological effects and impact human health. In contrast to freshwater habitats, little information is available on environmental concentrations in urban estuarine and marine environments. This study investigated an extensive range of organic and inorganic microcontaminants in the Darwin Harbour catchment, a tropical estuary in northern Australia undergoing rapid urbanisation and industrial development. We sampled wastewater effluent and surface water from seven sites in Darwin Harbour for pharmaceuticals and personal care products, alkylphenols, hormones, pesticides, herbicides and metals. In vitro bioassays were used to estimate the (anti) estrogenic and (anti) androgenic activities of samples. Seventy-nine of 229 organic microcontaminants analysed were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 20 mu g/L, with acesulfame, paracetamol, cholesterol, caffeine, DEET and iopromide detected at the highest concentrations in wastewater effluent (20 mu g/L, 17 mu g/L, 11 mu g/L, 11 mu g/L, 10 mu g/L and 7.6 mu g/L, respectively). Levels of estrogenic activity ranged from estradiol equivalency quotients (EEQs) of <0.10 to 6.29 +/- 0.16 ng/L while levels of androgenic activity ranged from dihydrotestosterone equivalency quotients (DHTEQs) of <3.50 to 138.23 +/- 3.71 ng/L. Environmental concentrations of organic microcontaminants were comparable to ranges reported from aquatic environments worldwide with sewage effluent discharges representing the dominant source of entry into Darwin Harbour. The measured concentration range of DEET was higher than ranges reported in previous studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products which are irrigated on arable land with treated municipal waste-water was investigated. In Braunschweig, Germany, wastewater has been irrigated continuously for more than 45 years. In the winter time only the effluent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) of Braunschweig is used for irrigation, while during summer digested sludge is mixed with the effluent. In the present case study six wells and four lysimeters located in one of the irrigated agricultural fields were monitored with regard to the occurrence of 52 pharmaceuticals and two personal care products (PPCPs; e.g. betablockers, antibiotics, antiphlogistics, carbamazepine, musk fragrances, iodinated contrast media (ICM) and estrogens). No differences in PPCP pollution of the groundwater were found due to irrigation of STP effluents with and without addition of digested sludge, because many polar compounds do not sorb to sludge and lipophilic compounds are not mobile in the soil-aquifer. Most of the selected PPCPs were never detected in any of the lysimeter or groundwater samples, although they were present in the treated wastewater irrigated onto the fields. In the groundwater and lysimeter samples primarily the ICM diatrizoate and iopamidol, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were detected up to several mu g l(-1), while the acidic pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, estrogens and betablockers were likely sorbed or transformed while passing the top soil layer. Potential estrogenic effects are likely to disappear after irrigation, since the most potent steroid estrogens were not measurable. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fifty-nine stream-water samples and 14 municipal wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) discharge samples in Johnson County, northeastern Kansas, were analyzed for 55 compounds collectively described as organic wastewater compounds (OWCs). Stream-water samples were collected upstream, in, and downstream from WWTF discharges in urban and rural areas during base-flow conditions. The effect of secondary treatment processes on OWC occurrence was evaluated by collecting eight samples from WWTF discharges using activated sludge and six from WWTFs samples using trickling filter treatment processes. Samples collected directly from WWTF discharges contained the largest concentrations of most OWCs in this study. Samples from trickling filter discharges had significantly larger concentrations of many OWCs (p-value < 0.05) compared to samples collected from activated sludge discharges. OWC concentrations decreased significantly in samples from WWTF discharges compared to stream-water samples collected from sites greater than 2000 m downstream. Upstream from WWTF discharges, base-flow samples collected in streams draining predominantly urban watersheds had significantly larger concentrations of cumulative OWCs (p-value=0.03), caffeine (p-value=0.01), and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (p-value < 0.01) than those collected downstream from more rural watersheds.

AB Pharmaceuticals and selected major human metabolites are ubiquitous in Jamaica Bay, a wastewater-impacted estuary at concentrations in the low ng/L to low mu g/L range. Concentrations throughout the bay are often consistent with conservative behavior during dry-weather conditions, as evidenced by nearly linear concentration -salinity relationships. Deviation from conservative behavior is noted for some pharmaceuticals and attributed to microbial degradation. Caffeine, cotinine, nicotine, and paraxanthine were detected with the greatest analytical signal, although evidence is presented for in situ removal, especially for nicotine and caffeine. There is little evidence for significant removal of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, suggesting they are more conservative and useful wastewater tracers. Immediately following heavy precipitation, which induced a combined sewer overflow (CSO) event, the concentrations of all compounds but acetaminophen and nicotine decreased or disappeared. This observation is consistent with a simple model illustrating the effect of precipitation has on pharmaceutical concentration in the wastewater stream, given the balance between dilution from rain and the bypass of treatment.

AB For safe biosolid-land-applying, sludge should be contaminant-free. However, it may contain important amounts of micropollutants, not removed in the wastewater-treatment-processes. An alternative treatment with the fungus Trametes versicolor was applied in sterile solid-phase systems consisting of sludge and a lignocellulosic substrate. Fungal colonization and activity were demonstrated during the process, according to monitoring of ergosterol, laccase activity and the naproxen-degradation test (ND24). Fourteen out of 43 analyzed pharmaceuticals were found in the raw sludge. After treatment, phenazone, bezafibrate, fenofibrate, cimetidine, clarithromycin, sulfamethazine and atenolol were completely removed, while removals between 42% and 80% were obtained for the remaining pharmaceuticals. Toxicological analyses (Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and seed germination) showed an important reduction in sludge toxicity after treatment. Results suggest that a solid-phase treatment with T. versicolor may reduce the ecotoxicological impact of micropollutants present in sewage sludge. This is the first report of a fungal-approach for elimination of emerging pollutants from biosolids. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) constitute a class of chemicals of emerging concern due to the potential risks they pose to organisms and the environment, even at low concentrations (ng/L). Recent studies have found that PPCPs are not efficiently removed in secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study has: (1) simultaneously investigated the occurrence of sixty-one PPCPs using solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, (2) evaluated removal efficiencies of target PPCPs in six WWTPs that discharge effluents into major Taiwanese rivers, and lastly (3) examined matrix interference during analysis of target PPCPs in water samples. The twenty target PPCPs were chosen for their high detection frequencies, high influent concentrations, and stability during wastewater treatment processes. Caffeine and acetaminophen were detected at the highest concentrations (as high as 24,467 and 33,400 ng/L) and were effectively removed (both >96%); other PPCPs were detected in the high ng/L range but were not effectively removed. Matrix interference (by ion suppression or enhancement) during the analysis resulted in underestimation of the removal efficiencies of erythromycin-H2O, cefazolin, clarithromycin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, clofibric acid and gemfibrozil.

AB The removal of trace organic compounds through membrane bioreactors (MBR) compared with a conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a long-term study was investigated. Two MBR pilot plants were operated in parallel to a full-scale WWTP fed with the same municipal raw wastewater. Polar compounds (phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, their metabolites, and carbamazepine) and less polar estrogenic steroids (estradiol, estrone, and ethinylestradiol) were quantified.
   The removal rate of phenazone, propyphenazone, and formylaminoantipyrine by the conventional WWTP was less than 15%. Significantly higher removal rates (60 to 70%) started to be clearly monitored in the pilot plants after approximately 5 months. Higher removal rates coincided with higher temperatures in the summer.
   The conventional WWTP removed, on average, more than 90% of the natural steroids estrone and estradiol and approximately 80% of the synthetic ethinylestradiol. Approximately 99% of estradiol and estrone and approximately 95% of ethinylestradiol was eliminated by the MBR processes.

AB The presence of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) poses potential risks to the aquatic system and human health. This study comprehensively characterized the presence, elimination, and transformation of micropollutants in the WWTP using the suspect screening approaches by employing the gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Overall, 5724 features were identified in influent, while only 3418 features existed in effluents. Hierarchical duster analysis (HCA) was used to group features based on intensity profiles to investigate the behavior and fate of detected features. Four representative trends were defined with the corresponding features. Among 117 compounds identified during the treatment process, there were 99 compounds in influent, 10 biological transformation products (TPs), 3 ozone Ws, and 5 ultraviolet TPs. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies for the detected compounds were determined.

AB BACKGROUNDRemoval of some EDCs, such as triclosan including its metabolites (2,4-dichloro phenol and 2,3,4-trichloro phenol), estrogens (estrone, 17--estradiol and 17--ethinyl estradiol) and some pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, clofibrate, clofibrate methyl ester, carbamazepine) from water and treated wastewater by commercial highly crosslinked polymer adsorbents (Diaion SP207, Diaion SP825, Dowex L493) and activated carbon was investigated using batch adsorption. The analyses of EDCs were performed by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   RESULTSThe optimum dosages of polymer adsorbents were in the range 0.2-1.2 g L-1, while the respective values for activated carbon were in the range 0.05-0.2 g L-1. When treated municipal wastewater was used as the water matrix, removal rates of EDCs for activated carbon clearly deteriorated compared with pure water solutions. However, when the synthetic resins were tested in treated effluent, most substances exhibited similar or even higher removals.
   CONCLUSIONSPolymer adsorbents exhibited good performance for removal of EDCs from water. Their use in biologically treated effluent for EDCs removal is also a viable option. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Occurrence and behavior of six antiviral pharmaceuticals (acyclovir, ganciclovir, oseltamivir, ribavirin, stavudine and zidovudine) and one active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate were investigated in wastewater, landfill leachate, river water, reservoir and well water in the vicinity of municipal landfills in the Pearl River Delta, China. Acyclovir was the only antiviral detected in the wastewater at 177-406 (mean = 238) and 114-205 (mean = 154) ng L-1 in the influent and final effluent, respectively. Aerobic biodegradation appeared to be the main process for the elimination of acyclovir in the wastewater. Acyclovir was also the only antiviral quantitatively detected in the Pearl River and its tributaries, with a maximum concentration up to 113 ng L-1. Treated wastewater was a major source of acyclovir in the rivers. The highest concentration of acyclovir was observed in winter in the river water and the dilution effect by precipitation was suggested to be the dominant factor impacting the seasonal pattern of acydovir in the rivers. No antivirals were quantitatively detected in the well water whereas acyclovir was frequently detected in the reservoirs at a maximal concentration of 33.6 ng L-1 in the vicinity of the municipal landfills. However, source identification and fate of acyclovir in the reservoirs pend on further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distribution of six psychoactive compounds (primidone, phenobarbital, oxazepam, diazepam, meprobamate, and pyrithyldione) and a metabolite of primidone (phenylethylmalonamide) were investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, surface water, groundwater of a bank filtration site, raw and final drinking water, and in groundwater affected by former sewage irrigation.
   Primidone and its metabolite phenylethylmalonamide were found to be ubiquitous in environmental water samples in Berlin. Maximum concentrations of 0.87 and 0.42 mu g/L, respectively, were encountered in WWTP effluents. Both compounds are apparently not removed when passaging through the different compartments of the water cycle and concentrations are only reduced by dilution. Phenobarbital was present at nearly every stage of the Berlin water cycle with the exception of raw and final drinking water. The highest concentrations of phenobarbital (up to 0.96 mu g/L) were measured in groundwater influenced by former sewage irrigation. Oxazepam was only present in WWTP effluents and surface waters (up to 0.18 mu g/L), while diazepam was not detected in any matrix. Due to their withdrawal from the German market years ago, the pharmaceuticals meprobamate and pyrithyldione were only found in sewage farm groundwater (up to 0.50 and 0.04 mu g/L, respectively) and, in case of meprobamate, also in decade old bank filtrate (0.03 mu g/L).
   Our results indicate a high persistence of some of the investigated compounds in the aquatic system. As a consequence, these pollutants may potentially reach drinking water resources via bank filtration if present in WWTP effluents and/or surface waters in partly closed water cycles such as Berlin's.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) especially anthropogenic compounds in sewage systems affects their ultimate fate in the environment which is challenging to ascertain the heterogenic nature of the compound and causes co-occurring effects in most aquatic samples. So, our study have focused on current approaches to the chemical and structural characterization of DOM with the detailed classification of individual compounds such as the molecular levels of volatile organic, inorganic materials, drugs and endocrine disrupting compounds. Analytical techniques for example high performance gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) with high-resolution liquid chromatography (HR-LCMS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM) has resulted in advancing the parametric studies. In addition, the toxicological assessment of an aquatic organism (zebrafish as a model) has ensued in enlightening the risk of contaminated sources. The result of the research highlighted the efficacy of high-throughput approaches to assess the environmental impact of sewage water.

AB Herein, a highly sensitive and selective simultaneous electrochemical method to monitor the emerging organic contaminants tartrazine (TRT), dexamethasone (DMZ) and diclofenac (DCL) in sewage treatment plants was developed. The sensing was based on electroreduction of TRT (-0.22 V), DMZ (-0.93 V) and DCL (-1.12 V) on hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), using citrate buffer pH 2.5 as electrolyte. The fast electrodic kinetics of these chemicals provided improvements on selectivity at high scan rates. The unique electrochemical properties of HMDE were associated to analytical performance of the square-wave voltammetry to quantify trace concentrations of TRT, DMZ and DCL, with detection limits ranging from 2.78 x 10(-8) to 1.48 x 10(-7) mol L-1. After wastewater treatment by using solid-phase extraction, the proposed procedure was successfully applied for the direct quantification of the studied compounds with high precision, accuracy and stability of the measurements, even in the presence of other electroactive contaminants.

AB Degradation kinetics and mineralization of an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent contaminated with a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds composed of amoxicillin (10 mg L-1), carbamazepine (5 mg L-1) and diclofenac (2.5 mg L-1) by TiO2 photocatalysis were investigated. The photocatalytic effect was investigated using both spiked distilled water and actual wastewater solutions. The process efficiency was evaluated through UV absorbance and TOC measurements. A set of bioassays (Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lepidium sativum) was performed to evaluate the potential toxicity of the oxidation intermediates. A pseudo-first order kinetic model was found to fit well the experimental data. The mineralization rate (TOC) of the wastewater contaminated with the pharmaceuticals was found to be really slow (t(1/2) = 86.6 min) compared to that of the same pharmaceuticals spiked in distilled water (t(1/2) = 46.5 min). The results from the toxicity tests of single pharmaceuticals, their mixture and the wastewater matrix spiked with the pharmaceuticals displayed a general accordance between the responses of the freshwater aquatic species (P. subscapitata > D. magna). in general the photocatalytic treatment did not completely reduce the toxicity under the investigated conditions (maximum catalyst loading and irradiation time 0.8 g TiO2 L-1 and 120 min respectively).

AB The main objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of sorption to the removal of two commonly used antibiotics (amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin) from wastewater. These antibiotics are excreted in large quantities with more than 75% of them being unmetabolized and are therefore likely to end up in domestic wastewater in significant quantities. The specific objectives were to determine the sorption behavior in synthetic wastewater (SWW), the effect of pH and contribution of microbial surfaces, to the sorption of these antibiotics. The SWW, adjusted to various pH levels, was used and sorption kinetics conducted at 100 and 250 mu g L-1 concentrations. Adsorption isotherms were determined at different pH levels. The SWW (pH 6.6) was inoculated with Rhodococcus sp. B30 strain to determine the contribution of microbial surfaces to sorption. Generally, both antibiotics revealed a decrease in sorption with pH increase, suggesting that lowering the solution pH of the wastewater may reduce their amounts in wastewater solution. Comparatively, ciprofloxacin exhibited higher sorption than amoxicillin. The sorption distribution coefficient (K (d)) values for ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.4356 to 0.8902 L g(-1), with pH = 5.5 exhibiting the highest K (d), while that for amoxicillin ranged from 0.1582 to 0.3858 L g(-1) with the highest K (d) at pH = 3.5. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in K (d) values between various pH levels for both antibiotics except between the pH of 5.5 and 6.6. Both antibiotics were not degraded within 48 h by Rhodococcus sp. B30 strain. These results indicate that degradation may not be the major process of removal of compounds from wastewater treatment plants and hence the importance of sorption as an intervention technique.

AB Illicit drug consumption in five cities in South Korea was estimated by analyzing 17 drug residues in untreated wastewater samples collected during the Christmas and New Year period of 2012-13. Only methamphetamine, amphetamine, and codeine were detected at concentrations of tens of nanograms per liter or even lower concentrations in more than 90% of the samples. Other illicit drug residues (including cocaine, methadone, and benzoylecgonine) that have been detected frequently in wastewater from other countries were not found in this study. Methamphetamine was found to be the most widely used illicit drug in South Korea, and the estimated average consumption rate was 22 mg d(-1) (1000 people)(-1). This rate is, for example, 2-5 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in Hong Kong and other parts of China and 4-80 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in cities in Western countries. It should be noted that the wastewater samples analyzed in this study were collected during a holiday season, when daily consumption of illicit drugs is often higher than on an average day. The methamphetamine usage rates were calculated for different cities in South Korea, and the usage rates in smaller cities was higher (2-4 times) than the average. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a simple, sensitive and rapid method for the determination of triclosan and ketoprofen in wastewater influent, effluent and river water. The method involves solid phase extraction (SPE) of target compounds using Oasis HLB sorbent. Several extraction parameters such as sample pH, sample volume, SPE cartridge and SPE elution solvent were optimized. The pH of the collected samples was adjusted to 5.5, and then 100 mL of the sample was loaded into an Oasis HLB cartridge. Methanol was used to elute the retained compounds. The eluted compounds were analyzed using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detection (HPLC-PDA). The method was validated by spiking ultra-pure water and wastewater with different concentrations of both compounds ranging from 5 mu g L-1 to 1000 mu g L-1. Recoveries were in the range of 73% to 104 %, and% RSD ranged from8% to 15%. The method gave good detection limits of 0.01 and 0.08 mu g L-1 for triclosan and ketoprofen, respectively. Traces of both compounds were detected in all wastewater (influent and effluent) samples at a range of 1.2 to 9.0 mu g L-1 and in some river water samples.

AB This paper demonstrates how occurrence, transport and fate of pharmaceuticals at trace levels can be assessed when modelling wastewater treatment systems using two case studies. Firstly, two approaches based on: 1) phenomenology; and, 2) Markov Chains, are developed to describe the dynamics of pharmaceuticals with or without clear administration patterns. Additional simulations also show that sewer conditions might have an important effect on the behaviour of the generated compounds and their metabolites. The results demonstrate that different operating conditions in wastewater treatment plants can have opposite effects on the studied pharmaceuticals, especially when they present co-metabolic or inhibitory behaviour in the presence of biodegradable substrate. Finally, the paper ends with: i) a critical discussion of the presented results; ii) a thorough analysis of the limitations of the proposed approach; and, iii) future pathways to improve the overall modelling of micropollutants.

AB Pain is a global health priority that is challenging to asses. Here we propose a new approach to estimating the burden of pain treatment in a population using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE is able to quantify multiple pharmaceutical compounds in order to estimate consumption by a population. Wastewater samples collected from areas representing whole communities can be analysed to estimate the consumption of drugs used to treat pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. The collection and analysis of wastewater can be conducted systematically to estimate the total consumption of NSAIDs and/or opioids in the population of a catchment area and to compare changes over time within the catchment or between different catchment populations. Consumption estimates can be combined by standardising the mass consumed to Defined Daily Doses (DDD) or morphine equivalents in order to assess, the population burden of pain treatment from mild to moderate (for NSAIDs) and for strong and severe pain (for opioids). We propose this method could be used to evaluate the total pain treatment burden between locations and over time. While this concept shows promise, future studies should evaluate the applicability as a tool to measure the burden of pain receiving treatment in a community.

   OUTPUTS
AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove mainly the organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and suspended solids from wastewater but are not capable of removing chemicals of human origin, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The presence of PPCPs in wastewater has environmental effects on the water bodies receiving the WWTP effluents and renders the effluent as unsuitable as a nonconventional water source. Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using the output distance function to measure the environmental benefits of removing five PPCPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and trimethoprim) from WWTP effluents discharged to three different ecosystems (wetland, river and sea). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen show the highest shadow prices of the sample for wetland areas. Their values are 128.2 and 11.0 (sic)/mg respectively. These results represent a proxy in monetary terms of the environmental benefit achieved from avoiding the discharge of these PPCPs in wetlands. These results suggest which PPCPs are urgent to remove from wastewater and which ecosystems are most vulnerable to their presence. The findings of this study will be useful for the plant managers in order to make decisions about prioritization in the removal of different pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of residues from the therapeutic use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug metamizole have been studied in investigations of sewage effluents from a military hospital, municipal sewers and a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Berlin, Germany. The loads of the metabolites aminoantipyrin (AA), 4-acetylaminoantipyrin (AAA) and 4-formyl-aminoantipyrin (FAA), rapidly formed after the application of metamizole, were predicted from pharmacokinetic data and based on the evaluation of extensive data sets of on the administration in hospitals and private households. In parallel, the actual concentrations were measured within three field trials.
   For the military hospital, the estimated average annual discharges of AA/AAA and FAA were 10.5 and 3.2 kg, respectively. For the STP, annual loads of 333 and 133 kg were determined for AA/AAA and FAA, respectively. During sewage treatment, an average decrease of 26% of the loads was measured for AA/AAA whereas no changes were observed for FAA. Generally, the prediction of the loads resulted in an overestimation of the residue levels compared to those measured in the respective sewers. Thus, modeling of predicted loads or concentrations alone will not be sufficient for a realistic assessment.
   Concerns for human or other mammals' health are not expected from the occurrence of metamizole residues in the aquatic system measured at concentrations up to 7 mu g l(-1) in STIR effluents. However, a rest of uncertainty remains as it was not possible to derive a no observed effect level for the induction of rare but potentially fatal toxicological side effects reported for metamizole.

AB Increased attention is currently directed towards potential negative effects of pharmaceuticals and other micro-pollutants discharged into the aquatic environment via municipal sewage water. A number of additional treatment technologies, such as ozonation, have therefore been suggested as promising tools for improving the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). Constructed wetlands are also capable of removing a variety of micro-pollutants, including some pharmaceuticals, and could hence be a resource efficient complement to more advanced treatment technologies. The purpose of the present study was therefore to increase the knowledge base concerning the potential use of constructed wetlands as a treatment step to reduce emissions of organic micro-pollutants from municipal sewage effluents. Under cold winter conditions, incoming and outgoing waters from four Swedish free water surface wetlands, operated as final treatment steps of sewage effluent from municipal STPs, were sampled and analyzed for levels of a set of 92 pharmaceuticals and 22 inorganic components as well as assessed using subchronic ecotoxicity tests with a macro-alga and a crustacean.
   Sixty-five pharmaceuticals were detected in the range from 1 ng L-1 to 7.6 mu g L-1 in incoming and outgoing waters from the four investigated wetlands. Although the sampling design used in the present study lacks the robustness of volume proportional to 24 h composite samples, the average estimated removal rates ranged from 42% to 52%, which correlates to previous published values. The effects observed in the ecotoxicity tests with the macro-alga (EC(50)s in the range of 7.5-46%) and the crustacean (LOECs in the range of 11.25-90%) could not be assigned to either pharmaceutical residues or metals, but in general showed that these treatment facilities release water with a relatively low toxic potential, comparable to water that has been treated with advanced tertiary treatments.
   From the present study it can be concluded that constructed wetlands may provide a complementary sewage treatment option, especially where other treatment is lacking today. To fully remove micro-pollutants from sewage effluent, however, other more advanced treatment technologies are likely needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The abuse of psychoactive substances has been increasing dramatically over the last few years, which is becoming a concern for human health and social stability. How to accurately estimate psychoactive substances' total consumption in certain areas is the key to manage such substances. In order to control psychoactive substances, 8 psychoactive substances' consumption within 12 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) service areas in a certain city of Guangxi, China was investigated in 2019. Firstly, a solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used to determine the influent concentrations. Morphine (MOR), 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine (METH), ketamine (KET), and norketamine (NK) were detected, with the concentrations ranging from less than method detection limit (NK, MDMA) to 170.91 (METH) ng/L. Then, the back-estimation of consumption was conducted according to the objective and near real-time wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The results demonstrate that KET, MOR, and METH are the most abused psychoactive substances, with the mean consumption of 682.42, 167.81, and 44.56 mg/day/1000 inh, respectively. The psychoactive substance residues of WWTPs influent were analyzed to estimate such substances' consumption in specific areas, so as to provide support for risk prevention and control.

AB Multiple chemical constituents (nutrients; N, O, H, C stable isotopes; 64 organic wastewater compounds, 16 pharmaceutical compounds) and microbiological indicators were used to assess the impact on groundwater quality from the land application of approximately 9.5 million liters per day of treated municipal sewage effluent to a sprayfield in the 960-km(2) Ichetucknee Springs basin, northern Florida. Enriched stable isotope signatures (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were found in water from the effluent reservoir and a sprayfield monitoring well (MW-7) due to evaporation; however, groundwater samples downgradient from the sprayfield have delta O-18 and delta H-2 concentrations that represented recharge of meteoric water. Boron and chloride concentrations also were elevated in water from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and MW-7, but concentrations in groundwater decreased substantially with distance downgradient to background levels in the springs (about 12 km) and indicated at least a tenfold dilution factor. Nitrate-nitrogen isotope (delta N-15-NO3) values above 10 parts per thousand in most water samples were indicative of organic nitrogen sources except Blue Hole Spring (delta N-15-NO3 = 4.6-4.9 parts per thousand), which indicated an inorganic source of nitrogen (fertilizers). The detection of low concentrations the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET), and other organic compounds associated with domestic wastewater in Devil's Eye Spring indicated that leakage from a nearby septic tank drainfield likely has occurred. Elevated levels of fecal coliforms and enterococci were found in Blue Hole Spring during higher flow conditions, which likely resulted from hydraulic connections to upgradient sinkholes and are consistent with previoius dye-trace studies. Enteroviruses were not detected in the sprayfield effluent reservoir, but were found in low concentrations in water samples from a downgradient well and Blue Hole Spring during high-flow conditions indicating a human wastewater source. The Upper Floridan aquifer in the Ichetucknee Springs basin is highly vulnerable to contamination from multiple anthropogenic sources throughout the springs basin.

AB The occurrence and fate of free and conjugated estrogens were investigated in wastewater and sludge from five sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Guangdong Province, China. Estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were found in all influent samples at concentrations of 69.3-280 ng L-1 and 1.3-30 ng L-1, respectively. The concentrations of conjugated estrogens were from ND (not detected) to 7.6 ng L-1. High concentrations (27.6-235 ng g(-1)) of E1 were found in sludge of some STPs indicating that sorption was an important estrogen removal mechanism. According to the mass flux analyses for estrogens in STP-A, E2 was mainly removed in the anaerobic process and E1 removal was the combined efforts of biodegradation and sorption. Abnormally high concentrations of EE2 (42.6-246 ng L-1), detected with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found in all influent samples of the STPs, therefore interlaboratory analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was conducted for confirmation, which detected no EE2 at all. In consideration of the rather lower estimated EE2 concentration than the measured value, it was speculated that the presence of interfering substances like tetracosanic acid in the matrix could lead to overestimation of EE2 concentration. Overall, the effluents still pose potential estrogenic effect to the downstream aquatic organisms.

AB Sampling and analysis of Water Framework Directive priority chemicals were undertaken in nine urban catchments across the UK. Over 9000 samples were collected from a number of different catchment sources including tap water, domestic waste water, surface water runoff, trade discharges, town centre and light industrial estate wastewaters. Determinands included trace metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), persistent organic pollutants and a number of common pharmaceuticals. Loads of the chemicals from each catchment entering the local wastewater treatment works (WwTW) were estimated and were shown to be relatively consistent between different catchments, after taking population into account. A Monte Carlo mixing model was used to combine the concentrations and flows from the different catchment sources and to predict concentrations and loads entering the WwTW. Based on the model output, the significance of the different sources could be evaluated. The study highlighted the importance of domestic wastewater as a source of contaminants, including metals and trace organic substances (such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), bisphenol A, nonylphenol and tributyl tin (TBT)). Concentrations in trade discharges were important in some locations in the case of nonylphenol, EDTA, TBT, as well as for some metals such as copper, zinc and nickel. Contributions to the total load from town centre and light industrial estate sources were generally less than 10% of the total.

AB Israel and its Palestinian neighbors constitute a unique venue for evaluating the treatment efficiency and potential environmental risks of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), because of their physical proximity yet contrasting societal dynamics. Israel primarily relies on advanced tertiary sewage treatment and recycles over 85% of its treated wastewater, while in the Palestinian Authority (PA), there is only secondary treatment levels at WWTPs and reuse is minimal (<1%). To evaluate the extent of EDC occurrence and treatment efficiency, we conducted four sampling campaigns over two consecutive years, and measured the concentrations of selected EDCs in raw wastewater (WW), treated WW and sludge in six WWTPs in Israel, as well as in two Palestinian plants. Low concentrations of bisphenol A, octylphenol and triclosan measured in the raw WW in the Palestinian WWTPs reflected the relatively modest industrial activity and consumption habits as compared to the westernized consumer patterns in Israel. On the other hand, hormone concentrations in raw WW were higher in the Palestinian WWTPs than those in the Israeli WWTPs, presumably because of a dilution effect associated with a higher water per capita consumption among Israelis. Despite these differences in raw WW concentrations, the removal efficiency in all advanced WWTPs was relatively high when compared to averages reported internationally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutically active substances (PhACs ) and drugs of abuse (DAs) are two classes of contaminants of emerging concern that have attracted great concern and interest by the scientific community during the last two decades. Numerous studies have revealed their presence in treated urban wastewaters. This is mainly due to the fact that some compounds are not efficiently removed during wastewater treatment processes, and are thus able to reach the aquatic environment through wastewater discharge and reuse practices. The application of an optimized multi-residue method for the simultaneous confirmation and quantification of licit and illicit drugs has been investigated in influent and effluent wastewater samples from seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in north-eastern Tunisia. Analysis was performed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Out of 12 pharmaceutical compounds analyzed, 11 of them were detected mainly in effluent wastewaters. In both matrices, antibiotics and beta-blockers were the most detected groups. This suggests that these compounds show noticeable resistance against biological treatment in WWTPs. The estimated concentrations of antibiotics in effluents ranged from ca. 35 ng/L to 1.2 mu g/L. However, all five studied illicit drugs were detected, mainly in influent wastewaters. Forensic investigation performed on people suspected to be drug abusers covering all Tunisian cities was conducted by monitoring an epidemiological study of human urine samples surveying rate of consumption for illicit drugs. Hence, these preliminary results confirmed the presence of illicit drugs in the influent wastewater samples. For example, quantification ranges for cocaine were found to be 25-450 ng/L in influent wastewater samples. Significant differences for cocaine consumption across the two sampling methods were observed. Consequently, we conclude that the analyses in wastewater are more reflective of the real levels of illicit drug consumption. Moreover, the cost for chromatographic analysis is lower than the screening test methods for human biological specimen, particularly staffing. which are likely to be much lower.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are omnipresent in wastewater world-wide. In order to predict their sorption quantities onto sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d values) of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, estrogens, lipid regulators, anti-epileptic and cytostatic agents) and polycyclic musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) were determined in primary and secondary sludges taken from a German municipal WWTP. For the K-d determination, batches of primary and secondary sludge slurries were spiked with the respective target compounds and slowly stirred under defined conditions (e.g. an argon atmosphere). Finally, the water and solid sludge phases were analysed. The K-d values of pharmaceuticals ranged from < 1 to 500 L kg(-1), while those for the polycyclic musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB proved to be up to 5300 and 4900 L kg(-1), respectively. The primary and secondary sludge showed significant differences for some pharmaceuticals such as Diclofenac and Cyclophosphamide due to the different pH and composition of the two sludges. The removal rate from the water phase caused by sorption in a WWTP can be reasonably predicted on the basis of the Kd values. (C)(C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and removal of seven selected pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in South India were investigated. The PCs selected for this study were sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), chloramphenicol (CAP), erythromycin (ERY), naproxen (NPX), bezafibrate (BZF), and ampicillin (AMP). Wastewater samples were collected from inlet and outlet of the STPs during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to investigate the seasonal influences in occurrence and removal rates. The analytical method was based on simultaneous extraction of all target compounds by solid phase extraction (SPE), using a hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB) sorbent followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The STP that catered exclusively to domestic wastewater had lesser concentrations of PCs compared to the STPs serving the combined hospital and domestic effluents. SMX was the dominant compound in all effluents with the highest concentration at 3.2 mu g/L in the outlet of an STP. TMP and ERY were the other PCs present at higher concentrations in STP outlets (1 mu g/L and 0-0.13 mu g/L, respectively). Removal rates varied from 100 % for BZF to 60-100 % for SMX, CTX, and AMP.

AB The reactivities of the amine-containing pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol with hypochlorite were studied using conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection including neutral pH (7.0), a range of reaction times (2-60 min), and a molar excess of hypochlorite relative to the pharmaceutical concentration (5.7 times). The reactions were monitored using liquid chromatography (LC) with several detection modes including ultraviolet absorbance (UV), mass spectrometry (MS), and post-column reaction/reductive electrochemistry (EC) for determining active chlorine products. At levels of 10 mu M, both compounds reacted rapidly (< 2 min) to form principally N-chloramine products that were stable in aqueous solution for at least I h. The reaction was also studied in wastewater, and similar reactivity was noted. These results demonstrate that the cations fluoxetine and metoprolol are likely to be rapidly transformed into neutral N-chloramines during wastewater disinfection. The reactivity of the N-chloramines was also studied with sulfite to simulate dechlorination, which is often employed in wastewater treatment. Both N-chloramines reacted slowly with sulfite. In the pure water dechlorination experiments, it was estimated that 70% and 10% of the peak areas remained after 2 min reaction time for fluoxetine and metoprolol, respectively. At longer reaction times both N-chloramines had been completely reduced by sulfite, and the product of the sulfite reduction reaction was the parent pharmaceutical amine. Since typical dechlorination times in wastewater treatment are on the order of seconds, this suggests the chloramines formed from these two basic drugs might evade dechlorination and be released into the environment. The implications of chloramine release are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, livestock wastewater treatment plants in South Korea were monitored to determine the characteristics of influent and effluent wastewater, containing four types of veterinary antibiotics (sulfamethazine, sulfathiazole, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline), and the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes. Chlortetracycline had the highest average influent concentration (483.7 mu g/L), followed by sulfamethazine (251.2 mu g/L), sulfathiazole (230.8 mu g/L) and oxytetracycline (25.7 mu g/L), at five livestock wastewater treatment plants. Sulfathiazole had the highest average effluent concentration (28.2 mu g/L), followed by sulfamethazine (20.8 mu g/L) and chlortetracycline (11.5 mu g/L), while no oxytetracycline was detected. For veterinary antibiotics in the wastewater, a removal efficiency of at least 90% was observed with five types of treatment processes, including a bio-ceramic sequencing batch reactor, liquid-phase flotation, membrane bioreactor, bioreactor plus ultrafiltration (BIOSUF) and bio best bacillus systems. Moreover, this study evaluated the removal efficiency via laboratory-scale experiments on the conventional contaminants, such as organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and veterinary antibiotics. This was done using the hydraulic retention time (HRT), under three temporal conditions (14 h, 18 h, 27 h), using the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) process, in an attempt to assess the combined livestock wastewater treatment process where the livestock wastewater is treated until certain levels of water quality are achieved, and then the effluent is discharged to nearby sewage treatment plants for further treatment. The removal efficiencies of veterinary antibiotics, especially oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline, were 86.5-88.8% and 87.9-90.8%, respectively, exhibiting no significant differences under various HRT conditions. The removal efficiency of sulfamethazine was at least 20% higher at HRT = 27 h than at HRT = 14 h, indicating that sulfamethazine was efficiently removed in the A2O process with increased HRT. This study is expected to promote a comprehensive understanding of the behavior and removal of veterinary antibiotics in the livestock wastewater treatment plants of South Korea.

AB Rural communities in central and eastern Europe usually use constructed wetlands (CWs) to treat domestic wastewater. Effluents from these systems are regularly discharged to receiving water, resulting in a potential transfer of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from sewage to the aquatic environment. In this study, the seasonal occurrence, removal and risk assessment of 32 multi-class PPCPs were investigated in three CWs from the village of south Bohemia, Czech Republic. Among the PPCPs considered, 25 compounds were detected in sewage influent, and ibuprofen, caffeine and paracetamol were the most commonly detected PPCPs. The removal efficiencies of PPCPs in the rural CWs exhibited large variability with 11-100% for anti-inflammatories, 37-99% for beta-blockers and 18-95% for diuretics. The statistical results revealed significant correlations between removal efficiencies of six PPCPs and conventional water quality parameters. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that most of the PPCPs (except ibuprofen) in the effluent yielded low aquatic risk. This study suggested that constructed wetlands could be effective for removing PPCPs and reducing environmental risk of PPCPs discharged from rural communities into surface water systems.

AB Effective removal of organic contaminants in wastewater effluent poses a challenge to small communities worldwide, particularly in the Arctic due to infrastructure challenges and harsh climates. To understand better the efficacy of current treatment options and risks posed by pharmaceuticals and pesticides on receiving waters in the Arctic, four representative human communities in Nunavut, Canada were evaluated. Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) were also investigated in one community. These communities have treatment ranging from primary lagoons, engineered wetlands, and natural lakes. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides were measured using the organic diffusive gradients in thin film (o-DGT) passive sampler in summer 2018. Of the 34 compounds studied, seven pharmaceuticals were found at least once: atenolol, carbamazepine, metoprolol, naproxen, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. With the exception of 5210 ng naproxen/L in lqaluit, most receiving waters showed negligible amounts of contamination. lqaluit had the poorest overall system performance while Baker Lake had the best. Measured pharmaceutical concentrations do not appear to pose a significant acute hazard to receiving waters at this time, based on known toxicological endpoints. PFAS concentrations were found to be over 100-fold greater in Cambridge Bay wastewater than previously reported Arctic seawater. Results suggest that wastewater may be an important point source of PFASs in Arctic communities. The o-DGT passive samplers performed well in marine Arctic settings. We recommend further testing of wastewater efficiencies in Arctic communities along with evaluations of seasonal variations. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to its resistance to many wastewater treatment processes, the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is routinely found in wastewater effluent. Wastewater irrigation is an alternative to stream discharge of wastewater effluent, which utilizes the soil as a tertiary filter to remove excess nutrients and has the potential to remove pharmaceutical compounds. Previous data suggest that CBZ is strongly sorbed to soil; however, it is unknown what its fate is for long periods of irrigation and if land use affects its distribution. Therefore, the objectives of our research were to characterize CBZ concentrations in soils that have been receiving wastewater irrigation for >25 yr under three different land uses: cropped, grassed, and forested. Triplicate soil cores were collected at each of the land uses to a depth of 120 cm. Extractions for CBZ were performed using 5-g soil samples and 20 mL of acetonitrile. The extracted solutions were analyzed on a liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer. The samples were also analyzed for supporting information such as organic carbon, pH, and electrical conductivity. Results suggest that there is accumulation of the CBZ in the surface soils, which have the highest organic carbon content. Average concentrations of CBZ in the surface soils were 4.92, 2.9, and 1.92 ng g(-1), for the forested, grassed, and cropped land uses, respectively. The majority of the CBZ was found in the upper 30 cm of the profile. Our results suggest that the soils adsorb CBZ and slow its movement into groundwater, compared to the movement of nonadsorbed chemicals.

AB In this experimental study both biological treatability of pharmaceuticals and their potential toxic effect in biological processes were evaluated. The pharmaceuticals were selected among those that are present at higher concentration in the Italian wastewater treatment plant effluents and widely used as antiulcer (ranitidine), beta-blocker (atenolol) and antibiotic (lincomycin). The present paper is the continuation of a work already presented,[1] which used a synthetic wastewater fed to laboratory scale SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) operated with different sludge ages (8 and 14 days), different biochemical conditions (aerobic or anoxic-aerobic mode) and several influent drug concentrations (2, 3 and 5 mg/L). In this case a real municipal wastewater was used as influent to the SBR. In parallel, batch tests were conducted to determine the removal kinetics of drugs and nitrogen. Toxicity tests using a titrimetric biosensor to verify possible inhibition on microorganisms were also performed. Finally, the possible adsorption of the pharmaceuticals on activated sludge was evaluated. The drugs under investigation showed different behaviours in terms of both biodegradability and toxicity effect on nitrifiers. Ranitidine showed generally low removal efficiencies (17-26%) and a chronic inhibition on nitrification. Atenolol showed generally higher removal efficiencies than ranitidine, even if the fairly good efficiency obtained in the previous experimentation with synthetic wastewater (up to 90%) was not attained with real wastewater (36%). No inhibition on nitrification was observed on both acclimated and non acclimated microorganisms with a high nitrification activity, whilst it was present with activated sludge characterised by a lower nitrification activity. Consistently with his pharmaceutical properties, lincomycin showed significant inhibition on nitrification activity.

AB Micropollutant pathways were studied for the Swist river basin (Western Germany). The aim was to verify the effectiveness of a monitoring approach to detect micropollutants entering the river. In a separate sewer system, water was frequently found to be contaminated with micropollutants. Improper connections of sewage canals to the stormwater network seemed to be the cause of pollution. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) exerted the largest influence on micropollutants for the receiving river. During a flu outbreak, antibiotics in the Swist stemming from WWTPs increased remarkably. Elevated levels of pharmaceuticals were measured in discharges from a combined sewer overflow (CSO). The study showed that the pharmaceutical load of a CSO was significantly reduced by advanced treatment with a retention soil filter. Painkillers, an anticonvulsant and beta blockers were the most often detected pharmaceuticals in the sewage of urban areas. Herbicides, flame retardants and industrial compounds were also observed frequently. On cropland, Chloridazon and Terbuthylazine compounds were often found in landscape runoff. Fungicides and insecticides were the most frequent positive findings in runoff from orchards. The paper shows that a coherent approach to collecting valid information regarding micropollutants and to addressing relevant pathways as a basis for appropriate management strategies could be established.

AB This study assessed the influence of different treatment configurations on the removal of six types of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) (dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzylphthalate (BBP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and bis (2-ethyl) hexylphthalate (DEHP)) from domestic wastewater in twelve pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs). Removal methods were investigated using orthogonal array testing with the following parameters of interest: four different water flow types, three substrates, two types of live plants, and three hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Results showed that PAE removal efficiencies differed based on chemical properties. Water flow type in the wetland was the most important factor in eliminating PAEs; downward vertical flow wetlands were most effective. The removal of high hydrophobicity DEHP and DOP was significantly impacted by substrate type; gravel systems were better than vesuvianite and zeolite systems. In addition, HLRs were important factors in reducing PAEs; the optimal HLR is 0.125-0.25 m/day, allowing PAEs to come into contact with substrate biofilm. Study results suggest that microbiological activity and adsorption were the most prevalent removal route for PAEs in constructed wetlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although many studies have addressed the ability of subsurface filtration systems to remove emerging contaminants from wastewater at micro- and mesocosm-scale, little is known about their performance on full-scale wastewater treatment facilities. To understand better how effective these systems can be for municipal wastewater polishing, we assessed the ability of a full-scale lagoon-subsurface filter system located in Dunnottar, Manitoba, Canada, to attenuate regulatory wastewater parameters, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and toxicity over the course of the discharge periods in 2015 and 2016 (June-October). Pharmaceuticals included beta-blockers, anticonvulsant drugs, and macrolide and sulfonamide antibiotics. Out of six consistently detected pharmaceuticals, four were efficiently removed through lagoon treatment (e.g. clarithromycin, metoprolol, propranolol), while two persisted to a certain extent (e.g. carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole), even after subsurface filtration. Attenuation was observed for nutrients with averages of 40% and 60% for ammonia and total phosphorus respectively within the filter, consistent with previous pilot-scale studies at this facility. Compliance with regulations for conventional wastewater parameters at the effluent was observed, as well as reduced acute toxicity (as determined by Microtox (R)) from the primary lagoon to the effluent, and little likelihood of acute toxicity in receiving waters. Our results suggest that first, the full-scale system has an overall similar performance when compared to the previously studied pilot-scale system; second, there was no apparent effect of acclimation on the attenuation of studied contaminants or toxicity; and finally, the concentrations of contaminants do not appear to pose an acute risk for aquatic species in the receiving environment.

AB The impact and occurrence of wastewater (treated and untreated) derived pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been investigated in small, rural and effluent-dominated tributaries of the lower Ebro River located in the North-Eastern Spain (Catalonia). We have observed the predominant effect of stream flow and consequently dilution factor on the concentration levels of detected PhACs that combined with the absence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) resulted in 12 times higher concentrations in streams with direct discharge of untreated wastewater. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most ubiquitous compounds, in terms of both individual concentration and frequency of detection. In the sites impacted by raw wastewater, acetaminophen and ibuprofen showed the highest concentrations among all analyzed PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 7.78 mu g L-1 and 2.66 mu g L-1, respectively. However, PhACs detected in the sites impacted by treated wastewater showed generally lower concentration levels and frequencies of detection. Also, effluent-dominated streams showed higher concentration levels of PhACs due to a generally lower stream flows and small dilution factors. However, concentration levels of detected PhACs were dependent on the hydraulic travel time and distance from the discharge point and related with the in-stream attenuation. As a result, this study highlights the combined impact of hydrological and chemical stressors on the water quality of the rural Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are a major source of micropollutants to the aquatic environment. Despite intense research on the fate and effects of PPCPs in temperate climates, there is a paucity of data on their presence in polar environments. This study reports the presence of selected PPCPs in sewage effluents from two Antarctic research stations, the adjacent coastal seawater, sea ice, and biota. Sewage effluents contained bisphenol-A, ethinylestradiol, estrone, methyl triclosan, octylphenol, triclosan, and three UV-filters. The maximum sewage effluent concentrations of 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor, benzophenone-1, estrone, ethinylestradiol, and octylphenol exceeded concentrations previously reported. Coastal seawaters contained bisphenol-A, octylphenol, triclosan, three paraben preservatives, and four UV-filters. The sea ice contained a similar range and concentration of PPCPs as the seawater. Benzophenone-3 (preferential accumulation in clams), estradiol, ethinylestradiol, methyl paraben (preferential accumulation in fish, with concentrations correlating negatively with fillet size), octylphenol, and propyl paraben were detected in biota samples. PPCPs were detected in seawater and biota at distances up to 25 km from the research stations WWTP discharges. Sewage effluent discharges and disposal of raw human waste through sea ice cracks have been identified as sources of PPCPs to Antarctic coastal environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Personal care products and pharmaceuticals have been reported in various concentrations in the effluent of municipal sewage treatment plants (STP). Although they are generally found in the nanogram to microgram per liter range, many of them might have adverse health effects on humans at these concentrations. Conventional treatments applied at the STP are unable to effectively remove most of these recalcitrant compounds, thus there is a necessity for development of alternative treatment techniques. In this article, the efficiency of enzymatic treatment using soybean peroxidase in treating some commonly found micropollutants is discussed. The target compounds were, two phenolic surfactant breakdown products, nonylphenol and octylphenol, two antimicrobial agents, Triclosan and sulfamethoxazole and three phenolic steroids. The effects of the most important parameters pH, enzyme concentration and peroxide concentration have been evaluated for each compound. The treatment of synthetic wastewater was shown to be effective (95% removal), except for sulfamethoxazole, in concentration ranges of 10s of mu M at neutral pH with 2-5mU/L of catalytic activity and 2-3 molar equivalents of hydrogen peroxide. The effectiveness of the treatment has also been determined for lower concentrations (6-9nM) which approximate those in real wastewater. A matrix effect was found in the treatment of Triclosan in spiked real wastewater indicating that re-optimization of important parameters for STP treatment would be required to achieve high removal efficiency. A reverse-phase, solid-phase extraction technique was used to concentrate target analytes in real wastewater, enabling chromatographic detection by UV absorbance.

AB Micropollutants, including antibiotics, hormones, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, are discharged into the environment with liquid and solid effluent streams from water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). The objective of this research was to determine whether biosolids-derived biochar (BS-biochar) could be used as a sorbent in continuous flow-through columns to remove micropollutants as a polishing step for wastewater treatment. Triclosan (TCS) was selected as a representative micropollutant due to frequent detection in liquid effluents, residual biosolids, and surface waters. Bench-scale column experiments were conducted to determine the effect of flow rate and competition due to the presence of other organic micropollutants and inorganic nutrients on TCS adsorption to BS-biochar. TCS removal efficiency was compared in Milli-Q water and secondary wastewater effluent by using two commercial adsorbents: a granular activated carbon and a wood-based biochar. Increased removal of TCS was observed at lower flow rates (2.6gpm/ft(2)) compared with higher flow rates (10.3gpm/ft(2)). Presence of inorganic nutrients (NH4+ and PO43-) and organic micropollutants 17-estradiol and sulfamethoxazole decreased adsorption of TCS to BS-biochar. TCS was sorbed to BS-biochar in wastewater, but percent removal decreased in wastewater relative to Milli-Q water. This study demonstrated that BS-biochar can remove TCS from wastewater in continuous flow-through columns, although to a lesser extent than activated carbon. An additional benefit of using BS-biochar is that WRRFs could re-activate biochar on-site by using a pyrolysis reactor.

AB Purpose Although the ubiquity of pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater has now been well documented, their fate and risk during beneficial wastewater reuse are far less understood. Soil sorption and degradation are important processes affecting the leaching potential of trace contaminants in irrigated soil. To this end, we examined the sorption and attenuation of six psychoactive and antilipidemic drugs, i.e., carbamazepine, diazepam, Dilantin, meprobamate, primidone, and gemfibrozil, in a loam (LVL) and a loamy sand representative of golf course soils in the southwestern United States.
   Materials and methods Sorption of pharmaceuticals in the soils was measured using a batch equilibrium method at room temperature. Degradation experiments were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Pharmaceutical residues in soil samples were extracted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS.
   Results and discussion Except for diazepam in both soils and carbamazepine in LVL soil, sorption was mostly negligible for all other compound-soil combinations (K (d) = 0-2.5 L/kg). For the same soil, the sorption affinity generally followed a decreasing order diazepam > carbamazepine > gemfibrozil > Dilantin a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand meprobamate a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand primidone. While Dilantin, gemfibrozil, and meprobamate showed moderate persistence in the soils under aerobic conditions, with T (1/2) 27-99 days, the test compounds were recalcitrant to degradation in the other treatments.
   Conclusions The low sorption affinity and long persistence suggest that some of the wastewater-borne pharmaceutical compounds may be easily mobile with groundwater flow and pose groundwater contamination risks when the treated wastewater is dispersed in the environment through practices such as landscape irrigation.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment as a result of wastewater effluent discharge is a concern in many countries. In order to expand our understanding on the occurrence and fate of PPCPs during wastewater treatment processes, 62 antibiotic, analgesic/anti-inflammatory, and antifungal compounds were analyzed in 72 liquid and 24 biosolid samples from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during the summer and winter seasons of 2010-2012. This is the first scientific study to compare five different wastewater treatment processes: facultative and aerated lagoons, chemically-enhanced primary treatment, secondary activated sludge, and advanced biological nutrient removal. PPCPs were detected in all WWTP influents at median concentrations of 1.5 to 92,000 ng/L, with no seasonal differences. PPCPs were also found in all final effluents at median levels ranging from 3.6 to 4200 ng/L with higher values during winter (p <0.05). Removal efficiencies ranged between -450% and 120%, depending on the compound, WWTP type, and season. Mass balance showed that the fate of analgesic/anti-inflammatory compounds was predominantly biodegradation during biological treatment, while antibiotics and antifungal compounds were more likely to sorb to sludge. However, some PPCPs remained soluble and were detected in effluent samples. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence and behavior of a large set of PPCPs and determined how their removal is affected by environmental/operational factors in different WWTPs.

AB A fast and sensitive monitoring method for trace pharmaceuticals in the environment is vital because many of these compounds are ubiquitous, persistent, and biologically active with recognized endocrine-disruption and pharmacological functions. A rapid and reliable ultra high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry was developed in the present study to simultaneously identify, confirm, and quantify 60 target pharmaceuticals in wastewater samples. The method uses a sub-2 A mu m particle column for separating target compounds, which were subsequently quantified with the mass spectrometer. Using this high-throughput analysis method, a single injection could provide results within 5 min for the pharmaceuticals. All of the target compounds were analyzed by the multiple-reaction monitoring with 15-ms fast polarity switching. Both intraday and interday precision analyses indicate excellent coefficient of variability. To evaluate the performance of the method, a standard solution (100 and 1000 ng L-1) was spiked into complex wastewater samples. The tailing factor and peak width were also monitored and adjusted for optimizing peaks from the ultra high-performance liquid chromatograph. Of the target pharmaceuticals in wastewater of a sewage-treatment plant analyzed on an hourly basis, only 17 compounds were detected, and others were lower than the method detection limits. Acetaminophen, cimetidine, and iopromide were all detected at > 1 mu g L-1, and their concentration profiles were similar to that of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug detected in wastewater. Other noticeable pharmaceuticals were sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Sources of pharmaceuticals in wastewater are briefly discussed.

AB The treatment of toxic and difficult-to-degrade phenolic compounds has become a key issue in the coking, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Considering the polymerization and oxidation of phenolic compounds in supercritical water partial oxidation/supercritical water oxidation (SCWPO/SCWO), the present study reviewed the removal efficiency and reaction pathway of phenolic compounds and phenolic waste/wastewater under different reaction conditions. Temperature is the dominant factor affecting the SCWO reaction. When the oxidizing ability is insufficient, the organics polymerize to form phenolic compounds. The gradual increase of oxidant equivalent causes the intermediate product to gradually oxidize to CO2 and H2O completely. Finally, the free radical reaction mechanism is considered to be a typical SCWO reaction mechanism.

AB Pharmaceuticals are increasingly used in large amounts in human (and veterinary) medicine around the world. They reach the aquatic environment mainly through sewage treatment systems and can reach mg l(-1) levels. The continual input of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment, via sewage, can also impart a persistent quality to compounds that otherwise possess no inherent environmental stability. While the literature contains increasing numbers of studies detailing fate, effects and behaviour in the environment, the subject is still not fully understood for all the different therapeutic classes. The toxicological significance for non-target (especially aquatic) organisms is poorly understood. The use/ release of antibiotics and natural/ synthetic steroids to the environment has generated most of the concern to date, but a plethora of other drugs are increasingly attracting attention, as their biological activity alone may support ecotoxicity assessments of those compounds with high production volumes (or toxicity), especially in view of the increasing importance of freshwater resources. Pharmaceuticals display a variety of removal efficiencies during wastewater treatment and their fate and behaviour are not determined by their physicochemical properties alone. Despite the fact that many drugs have high sorption potentials, partitioning to the solid phase was determined to be an unlikely removal pathway for the majority of compounds. The partitioning behaviour of these compounds both in sewage treatment and the aquatic environment is likely to be dictated by a number of physicochemical parameters. Findings also indicate that the costs of using tertiary treatment options (mainly based on drinking water treatment) to remove drugs from wastewater effluent are likely to be prohibitively expensive, and potentially undesirable, due sustainability implications. While adjusting existing treatment parameters may increase the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals, any changes to sewage treatment parameters would need to be offset against the economic and environmental costs. Likewise, any regulations on drug use must be balanced against health benefits. If receiving waters are used for potable supplies, the presence of these compounds may (although it is unlikely) represent a potential hazard to human health, especially in areas without advanced water treatment. The focus for future research should therefore be on proper and sufficient science for establishing the occurrence, exposure and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment, so that sound decisions can be made regarding human and ecological health.

AB While the extent of pharmaceutical consumption within a society/community is of high relevance to its health, economy and general wellbeing, this data is often not readily available. Herein, we strengthen a waste-water-based epidemiology (WBE) approach as a way to track the consumption of pharmaceuticals within the sampled community. This method is less laborious than established questionnaire or databases approaches and allows a higher temporal and spatial resolution. The WBE approach was conducted by sampling influent wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants of different size. A total of 39 targeted compounds were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The number of prescriptions and the defined daily doses for each prescription was obtained from the reference database of The Catalan Health System to validate the wastewater-based approach. The wastewater sampling and the data inquiry were both executed during the same period (October 2019) and standardised for comparison to treatments per 1,000 in-habitants per day. The back-calculation parameters were improved from previous studies by including the faecal excretion rate of the pharmaceuticals. For prescription only pharmaceuticals, where prescription numbers are expected to be a good estimate of consumption, our WBE approach agreed with 27 out of 32 (<0.7 order of magnitude). Common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen showed much higher values for treatments per day per 1,000 inhabitant in wastewater than prescribed, reflecting the usefulness of WBE in obtaining an estimate of the total consumption i.e. with and without a prescription.

AB Systematic sampling and analysis of wastewater has become an important tool for monitoring consumption of drugs and other substances, and has been proposed as a method to evaluate aspects of population health using endogenous biomarkers. 1,4-methylimidazoleacetic acid (MIAA) is an endogenous biomarker and metabolite of histamine turnover. Its urinary excretion is elevated in conditions such as mastocytosis, hay fever, hives, food allergies and anaphylaxis. The aim of this study was to develop and apply methods for MIAA in wastewater and compare its occurrence with antihistamine use in wastewater. Consecutive daily samples were collected from seven catchments serving populations from 3000 to 2 million and covering rural and urban communities during the 2016 Census in Australia. MIAA and the antihistamines (ranitidine, fexofenadine, cetirizine) were quantified consistently. Per capita excretion of MIAA (mg/d/capita) estimated from the WW concentrations were consistent with findings from previous clinical studies. We found significant positive correlations between loads of MIAA and fexofenadine (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001) and cetirizine (R-2 = 0.25, p = 0.03) across the various catchments. Sewer reactor experiments on the degradation of MIAA and the antihistamines found that fexofenadine is stable for at least 24 h while MIAA, ranitidine and cetirizine are subject to degradation, and this should be considered in interpretations. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first wastewater study to introduce and monitor an endogenous metabolite of histamine, and the first study to monitor and relate proxies of disease and treatment of disease.

AB The little data about pharmaceutical residue contamination in African water bodies motivated our study on the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in the water and sediment of Msunduzi River in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa; and in the Darvill wastewater treatment plant found in Msunduzi catchment. Samples collected along the River and wastewater treatment plant were extracted and analysed for pharmaceutical residues selected based on statistics of drug usage in South Africa i.e. antipyretics, antibiotics, caffeine, an antiepileptic and an antipsychotic drug were determined using HPLC-MS/MS.
   In all the matrices investigated, the antipyretic ibuprofen had the highest concentration of up to 117 mu g L-1, 84.60 mu g L-1 and 659 ng g(-1) in wastewater, surface water and sediment respectively. Antibiotics were detected in generally low concentrations of <10 mu g L-1 in surface water samples and up to 34.50 mu g L-1 in wastewater; moreover they were not completely removed during wastewater treatment. The percentage removal efficiency of the studied group was 6.55-98.00% for antipyretics, 73.33-98.90% for antibiotics, 48.80% for the anti-epileptic drug and 86.40% for Caffeine. Clozapine exhibited a negative removal.
   In surface water, Henley dam exhibited a high concentration of the pharmaceutical residues and the highest concentration of metronidazole in sediment (up to 1253.50 ng g(-1)) detected. Metronidazole was only detected in sediment and bio-solids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional activated sludge (CAS) wastewater treatment processes are insufficient at removing many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater. In addition, negative mass balances, where the effluent concentration is greater than the influent concentration, have been observed in wastewater treatment studies and a further understanding of these results is needed. In this study, the fate and occurrence of 57 PPCPs and hormones were evaluated in an activated sludge process and the mass balances were determined. The goal of the project was to understand the PPCPs biological degradation and the extent of sorption to solids. The samples containing in situ PPCPs (i.e. samples were not spiked with additional PPCPs) were evaluated. Forty-eight of the PPCPs were detected in the soluble form and 29 were detected sorbed to solids. Two notable results were found. First, the results of this study indicate a subset of the highly biodegradable PPCPs stop being degraded at low, yet notable, concentrations. Second, the results revealed that negative mass balances were present for a subset of the PPCPs when evaluating both the soluble and sorbed concentration, for example carbamazepine and ofloxacin. Desorption from solids was not found to attribute to negative mass balances. Overall, the results from this study provide new insights into the fate of PPCPs during CAS wastewater treatment by evaluating the degradation kinetics and sorption and the results may explain the consistent levels of highly degradable PPCPs being emitted from WWTPs worldwide.

AB The adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC) of ecotoxic or potentially ecotoxic micropollutants (ten pharmaceuticals, four X-ray contrast media, and eight industrial chemicals) present in a biologically treated municipal wastewater is studied. All but the X-ray contrast media are eliminated with high efficiency at an economically feasible PAC dosage of 10 mg/L. Based on the experimental data, the competition between the background organic matter and the micropollutant for the active sites of the adsorbent is modeled with the help of the adsorption and tracer analysis supported by the Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory. With granulated activated carbon, adsorption isotherms are determined by spiking. Based on these experimental data and modeled parameters, a lay-out of fixed-bed adsorbers may be simulated.

AB Background: The discharge of complex mixtures of nutrients, organic micropollutants, and antibiotic resistance genes from treated municipal wastewater into freshwater systems are global concerns for human health and aquatic organisms. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are genes that have the ability to impart resistance to antibiotics and reduce the efficacy of antibiotics in the systems in which they are found. In the rural community of Grand Marais, Manitoba, Canada, wastewater is treated passively in a sewage lagoon prior to passage through a treatment wetland and subsequent release into surface waters. Using this facility as a model system for the Canadian Prairies, the two aims of this study were to assess: (a) the presence of nutrients, micropollutants (i.e., pesticides, pharmaceuticals), and ARGs in lagoon outputs, and (b) their potential removal by the treatment wetland prior to release to surface waters in 2012.
   Results: As expected, concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species were greatest in the lagoon and declined with movement through the wetland treatment system. Pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals were detected at concentrations in the ng/L range. Concentrations of these compounds spiked downstream of the lagoon following discharge and attenuation was observed as the effluent migrated through the wetland system. Hazard quotients calculated for micropollutants of interest indicated minimal toxicological risk to aquatic biota, and results suggest that the wetland attenuated atrazine and carbamazepine significantly. There was no significant targeted removal of ARGs in the wetland and our data suggest that the bacterial population in this system may have genes imparting antibiotic resistance.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that while the treatment wetland may effectively attenuate excess nutrients and remove some micropollutants and bacteria, it does not specifically target ARGs for removal. Additional studies would be beneficial to determine whether upgrades to extend retention time or alter plant community structure within the wetland would optimize removal of micropollutants and ARGs to fully characterize the utility of these systems on the Canadian Prairies.

AB In this report, we refer to pharmaceuticals that are widespread in the urban aquatic environment and that mainly originate from wastewater treatment plants or non-point source sewage as "wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals" (WWMPs). To some extent, they reflect the condition or trend of water contamination and also contribute to aquatic environmental risk assessment. The method reported here for screening typical WWMPs was proposed based on academic concerns about them and their concentrations present in the urban aquatic environment, as well as their properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and related environmental risks caused by them. The screening system consisted of an initial screening system and a further screening system. In the former, pharmaceuticals were categorised into different evaluation levels, and in the latter, each pharmaceutical was given a normalised final evaluation score, which was the sum of every score for its properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and environmental risk in the aquatic environment. The system was applied to 126 pharmaceuticals frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In the initial screening procedure, five pharmaceuticals were classified into the "high" category, 16 pharmaceuticals into the "medium" category, 15 pharmaceuticals into the "low" category and 90 pharmaceuticals into the "very low" category. Subsequently, further screening were conducted on 36 pharmaceuticals considered as being of "high", "medium" and "low" categories in the former system. We identified 7 pharmaceuticals with final evaluation scores of 1-10, 10 pharmaceuticals with scores of 11-15, 15 pharmaceuticals with scores from 16 to 20 and 4 pharmaceuticals with scores above 21. The results showed that this screening system could contribute to the effective selection of target WWMPs, which would be important for spatial-temporal dynamics, transference and pollution control of pharmaceuticals in the urban aquatic environment. However, there remains a number of pharmaceutical parameters with measured data gaps, such as organic carbon adsorption coefficients and bioconcentration factors, which, if filled, would improve the accuracy of the screening system.

AB The ability of a sub-surface treatment filtration system to remove nutrients, thirty-nine organic contaminants, metals, and antibiotic resistant gene (ARG)-bearing organisms, and to attenuate acute toxicity of wastewater lagoon effluents, was assessed. Significant removal was observed for nutrients between the conventional primary and secondary sewage lagoons, with further average attenuation of 59% and 50% of ammonia and total phosphorus (TP), respectively, within the filter. Effluent concentrations of ammonia ranged from 0.4 to 2.6 mg/L and concentrations of TP from 1 to 4.1 mg/L, with decreasing acute toxicity from primary to secondary lagoons, and no toxicity observed in the filtration system based on Microtox (R) assays. Most organic micropollutants were also efficiently removed between the primary and secondary lagoons (e.g., up to 98% for atenolol). However, in general, little attenuation occurred within the filter for estrogenic compounds (e.g., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol); beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol); antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine-Prozac); antibacterial agents (e.g., triclosan), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., diclofenac); lipid regulators (e.g., clofibric acid); and macrolide (e.g., clarithromycin) and sulfonamide (e.g., sulfamethazine) antibiotics; or metals (Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn). This lack of removal was likely due to a minimal hydraulic residence time within the filter (similar to 6 h) under current operating conditions. The lagoon treatment system effectively removed similar to 99% of sulfonamide resistant bacteria, but the filter both reduced tetracycline-resistant bacteria (similar to 58%) in wastewater and harbored them in the biofilms, as relative abundances of sul and tet genes were greatest there. The filter also harbored nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, respectively, contributing to N removal. These results suggest that the constructed sub-surface treatment filtration system can provide a low-cost, low-maintenance, and effective means to reduce nutrient loading and improve microbial community structure and function.

AB It is well known that pharmaceuticals are not completely removed by conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants. Hospital effluents are of major concern, as they present high concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds. Despite this, these specific effluents are usually co-treated with domestic wastewaters. Separate treatment has been recommended. However, there is a lack of information concerning the efficiency of separate hospital wastewater treatment by activated sludge, especially on the removal of pharmaceuticals. In this context, this article presents the results of a 2-year monitoring of conventional parameters, surfactants, gadolinium, and 13 pharmaceuticals on the specific study site SIPIBEL. This site allows the characterization of urban and hospital wastewaters and their separate treatment using the same process. Flow proportional sampling, solid-phase extraction, and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used in order to obtain accurate data and limits of quantification consistent with ultra-trace detection. Thanks to these consolidated data, an in-depth characterization of urban and hospital wastewaters was realized, as well as a comparison of treatment efficiency between both effluents. Higher concentrations of organic carbon, AOX, phosphates, gadolinium, paracetamol, ketoprofen, and antibiotics were observed in hospital wastewaters compared to urban wastewaters. Globally higher removals were observed in the hospital wastewater treatment plant, and some parameters were shown to be of high importance regarding removal efficiencies: hydraulic retention time, redox conditions, and ambient temperature. Eleven pharmaceuticals were still quantified at relevant concentrations in hospital and urban wastewaters after treatment (e.g., up to 1 mu g/L for sulfamethoxazole). However, as the urban flow was about 37 times higher than the hospital flow, the hospital contribution appeared relatively low compared to domestic discharges. Thanks to the SIPIBEL site, data obtained from this 2-year program are useful to evaluate the relevance of separate hospital wastewater treatment.

AB The investigations on seasonal and spatial distribution of 12 selected wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals (WWMPs) belonging to different therapeutic classes were conducted in three major urban rivers of Yangpu District, Shanghai, East China. The potential mechanisms for the removal of WWMPs in the rivers were also experimentally investigated. The detection frequencies of most WWMPs were in the range of 56-100%, with the exception of clofibric acid, which was not detected during the storm events. The median concentrations ranged from not detected to 5821 ng/L (caffeine) and the maximum concentration was 8662 ng/L, found in caffeine. Part of WWMPs such as paracetamol and caffeine showed significant seasonal variation (P < 0.05), while most of pharmaceuticals displayed limited concentration fluctuation under different seasons for relative low levels. The spatial pattern of most WWMPs has not showed obvious difference in the three rivers (P > 0.05). WWMPs could come from different sources, such as wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, untreated domestic wastewater, or some unknown sources. Lab-scale tests showed that the biodegradation and adsorption were the main removal pathways for WWMPs with lesser contribution from photodegradation and hydrolysis.

AB The goal of this study was to compare removal efficiencies of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) using typical wastewater treatment technologies, and to identify the most significant mechanisms of removal. Two types of municipal wastewater reactors were studied: a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) reactor with tertiary treatment; and three pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) having different sludge retention times (SRTs). All four reactors were fed the same influent. A third reactor type, a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was fed tap water, ammonia, and TBBPA. TBBPA in municipal influent ranged from 1 to 41 ng L-1 (n = 10). The CAS effluent had an average TBBPA concentration of 0.7 +/- 1.3 ng L-1 (n = 3). Effluent concentrations from the MBRs were an average of 6 +/- 6 ng L-1 TBBPA (n = 26). Significant TBBPA removal was observed in the MABR throughout the 5 week of study (p >= 0.05). Removal of TBBPA from wastewater treatment was found to be due to a combination of adsorption and biological degradation. Based on experimental results, nitrification is likely a key process therein. No significant relationship between removal of TBBPA and SRT was identified (p >= 0.05). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influent and effluent samples originating from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (treating hospital wastewater and domestic wastewater, Belgium) have been analyzed in order to estimate their steroid hormone content. The natural estrogens estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and the synthetic 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) together with other steroid hormones progesterone (P) and testosterone (T) metabolites were detected in these samples. The hormone concentrations in both the hospital and the domestic WWTP samples were not significantly different and ranged from < 0.2 ng EE2/L to 114 ng EE2/L, from < 0.2 ng E1/L to 58 ng E1/L and from < 0.2 ng P/L to >100 ng P/L. E2 was detected once at a concentration of 17 ng/L. In the domestic WWTP which comprises a conventional activated sludge treatment in parallel with a membrane bioreactor, no differences in estrogen removal efficiency could be observed for both treatments. In comparison to chemical analysis data, the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) appears to underestimate the influent estrogen concentrations, probably due to influent toxicity for the YES. Effluent estrogen concentrations, on the other hand, were overestimated by the YES test, probably due to the presence of other estrogenic compounds in the effluent.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and the environment has attracted growing public concern. Although studies have been performed to detect pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents, little research has been conducted to assess the efficiency of pharmaceutical removal using different treatment technologies. To assess the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, samples from 22 municipal treatment plants in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were analyzed for 12 commonly used pharmaceuticals and 2 primary metabolites. The medians of removal efficiencies for 9 technologies: aerated lagoon, extended aeration, facultative lagoon, membrane bioreactor, modified secondary, oxidation ditch, primary treatment, rotating biological contactor, and sequencing batch reactor technologies, were determined to be 98.0%, 96.4%, 98.2%, 99.8%, 68.4%, 99.0%, 3.0%, 81.3%, and 98.3%, respectively. The medians of removal efficiencies of individual pharmaceuticals were found from -14.4% to 100%. Primary treatment showed significant differences comparing to other treatment technologies. Very strong correlations of removal efficiencies were found between acetaminophen and warfarin, between cotinine and warfarin, between cotinine and paraxanthine, and between ramipril and atorvastatin. In general, there was no strong correlation of removal between pharmaceuticals and total organic waste load or total suspended solids.

AB This paper presents, for the first time, spatial and temporal occurrence of a comprehensive set of >60 pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater (7 wastewater treatment plants utilising different treatment technologies) and a major river in the UK over a 12 month period. This paper also undertakes a comparison of the efficiency of processes utilised during wastewater treatment and it discusses under-researched aspects of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the environment including sorption to solids and stereoselectivity in the fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters.
   The removal efficiency of analytes strongly depended on the type of wastewater treatment technology employed and denoted <50% or >60% in the case of tricking filter and activated sludge respectively. It should be stressed, however, that the removal rate was highly variable for different groups of compounds. A clear increase in the cumulative concentration of all monitored compounds was observed in receiving waters; thus highlighting the impact of WWTP discharge on water quality and the importance of the removal efficiency of WWTPs. No seasonal variation was observed with regard to the total load of targeted compounds in the river each month. The concentration of each analyte was largely dependent on rainfall and the dilution factor of WWTP discharge. These results indicate that although the drugs of abuse are not present at very high concentrations in river water (typically low ng L-1 levels), their occurrence and possible synergic action is of concern, and the study of multiple groups of drugs of abuse is of significant importance.

AB Numerous studies have reported the presence of trace (i.e., ng/L) organic chemicals in municipal wastewater effluents, but it is unclear which compounds will be useful to evaluate the contribution of effluent to overall river flow or the attenuation processes that occur in receiving streams. This paper presents a new approach that uses a suite of common trace organic chemicals as indicators to assess the degree of impact and attenuation of trace organic chemicals in receiving streams. The utility of the approach was validated by effluent monitoring at ten wastewater treatment plants and two effluent-impacted rivers with short retention times (<17 h). A total of 56 compounds were particularly well suited as potential indicators, occurring frequently in effluent samples at concentrations that were at least five times higher than their limit of quantification. Monitoring data from two effluent-impacted rivers indicated that biotransformation was not important for these two river stretches, whereas photolysis attenuation was possibly important for the shallow river. The application of this approach to receiving waters and water reclamation and reuse systems will allow for more effective allocation of resources in future monitoring programs.

AB Drug abuse trends in South Korea were assessed by estimating the consumption rates of drugs that may be abused or misused by performing wastewater-based drug epidemiology. Of the 29 target compounds, 10 were found in samples from three wastewater treatment plants. Ephedrine had the highest mean estimated consumption rate, 574.1 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1). The anti-obesity drugs phendimetrazine and phentermine had the second and fifth highest mean estimated consumption rates, 182.9 and 113.1 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1), respectively. The zolpidem consumption rate was 65.8 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1). Methamphetamine was the only illicit drug detected in wastewater, and the estimated consumption rates (14.9-28.6 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1)) were similar to consumption rates found in previous Korean studies (not detected to 45.8 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1)). The mean estimated meperidine and cis-tramadol (opioid) consumption rates were 120 and 27.5 mg d(-1)(1000 people)(-1), respectively, and were 8.2 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the consumption rates found in 2013. Methylphenidate was detected in the influent and effluent samples at mean concentrations of 2.7 and 2.6 ng L-1, respectively, but the methylphenidate consumption rate could not be estimated because of the low excretion rate for humans (< 1%).

AB Antibiotic resistance is an emerging global health crisis, driven largely by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, there are examples in which the production of these antimicrobial agents has polluted the environment with active antibiotic residues, selecting for antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry. In this work, we have used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the taxonomic structure and resistance gene composition of sludge communities in a treatment plant in Croatia receiving wastewater from production of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin. We found that the total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was three times higher in sludge from the treatment plant receiving wastewater from pharmaceutical production than in municipal sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Zagreb. Surprisingly, macrolide resistance genes did not have higher abundances in the industrial sludge, but genes associated with mobile genetic elements such as integrons had. We conclude that at high concentrations of antibiotics, selection may favor taxonomic shifts towards intrinsically resistant species or strains harboring chromosomal resistance mutations rather than acquisition of mobile resistance determinants. Our results underscore the need for regulatory action also within Europe to avoid release of antibiotics into the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUNDAzithromycin (AZM), a 15-member macrolide antibiotic, has caused widespread pollution in China, where anaerobic digestion is the predominant wastewater treatment technology. However, the type of anaerobic sludge most suitable for treating antibiotic wastewater is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the response of anaerobic flocculent and granular sludge to AZM wastewater, and, using a high-throughput sequencing technique, to explain the diverse microbial community structures.
   RESULTSAnaerobic granular sludge provided better resistance to the decline of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal caused by AZM and greater biodegradation efficiency than flocculent sludge. Furthermore, there was stronger resistance to AZM-induced reactive oxygen species in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge. The granular sludge exhibited richer microbial communities than the flocculent sludge after AZM exposure to the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.
   CONCLUSIONAt high AZM concentration, anaerobic granular sludge was superior to flocculent sludge in COD removal and AZM degradation. This is attributed to less cell death and greater microbial diversity and richness in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge following exposure to AZM. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed to the resistance to AZM in the granular sludge. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Comprehensive study on the occurrence and fate of several classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in Croatian municipal wastewaters was performed using an integrated approach, which comprised analysis of both dissolved and particulate fractions. A nation-wide screening showed ubiquitous occurrence of human-use antimicrobials in raw wastewater samples with the total concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 mu g/L, while veterinary antimicrobials were typically present in much lower concentrations (<100 ng/L). The percentage of the particulate fraction in raw wastewater varied significantly depending on the type of the antimicrobial and the load of suspended solids. A detailed study of the mass flows of dissolved and particulate antimicrobials, performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb, allowed an improved assessment of the biological and physico-chemical removal mechanisms of investigated compounds during the conventional activated sludge treatment. The overall removal efficiencies of antimicrobials from the water phase were rather variable, ranging from 0% for trimethoprim to 85% for norfloxacin. A significant percentage of fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin) was associated with the primary and excess secondary sludge, explaining 14-77% of the total removal. The removal, which could be attributed to biological transformation, was relatively poor for all antimicrobials, exceeding 30% only for SMX (32%) and clarithromycin (55%). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 17-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), diclofenac (DCF), and 4-nonylphenol (4NP) belong to the most common micropollutants (MPs) occurring in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The WWTPs are the primary barrier against the spread of micropollutants in the environment. The aim of this work was to study the kinetics of biological removal of the three aforementioned micropollutants from wastewater and to check whether the acclimation of biomass influenced on the kinetic parameters. In addition, the effect of MPs on the biochemical activity of microorganisms was tested. DCF inhibited the respiration activity of biomass to the highest extent, followed by 4NP and EE2, respectively. DCF occurred to be less susceptible to microbial decomposition than the other two MPs and was removed from wastewater at the lowest degree of 58%. The degrees of removal of EE2 and 4NP were higher than that of DCF and equal to 93 and 71%, respectively. The kinetic parameters determined in this work can be used in modelling and simulation of the removal of micropollutants from wastewater. They improve the predictive ability of the biokinetic models. The acclimation of the biomass to the relevant micropollutant does not influence on the kinetic parameters of biomass growth; however, it causes the increase of the yield coefficient for heterotrophic biomass.

AB The presence of antibiotics in treated wastewater and consequently in surface and groundwater resources raises concerns about the formation and spread of antibiotic resistance. Improving the removal of antibiotics during wastewater treatment therefore is a prime objective of environmental engineering. Here we obtained a detailed picture of the fate of sulfonamide antibiotics during activated sludge treatment using a combination of analytical methods. We show that pterin-sulfonamide conjugates, which are formed when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis, represent a major biotransformation route for sulfonamides in laboratory batch experiments with activated sludge. The same major conjugates were also present in the effluents of nine Swiss wastewater treatment plants. The demonstration of this biotransformation route, which is removal. related to bacterial growth, helps explain seemingly contradictory views on optimal conditions for sulfonamide More importantly, since pterin-sulfonamide conjugates show retained antibiotic activity, our findings suggest that risk from exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics may be less reduced during wastewater treatment than previously assumed. Our results thus further emphasize the inadequacy of focusing on parent compound removal and the importance of investigating biotransformation pathways and removal of bioactivity to properly assess contaminant removal in both engineered and natural systems.

AB Drug consumption in individual cities, regions, and at various music events and festivals across the EU has generally been monitored via questionnaires, patients' medical data, and police reports. However, an overview of drug consumption obtained from these methods can be negatively affected by various subjective factors. We aimed to investigate an association between levels of target drugs in wastewater, music genres, and festival courses. The occurrence of illicit drugs, their metabolites, and psychoactive compounds was investigated in the influent of six wastewater treatment plants in the Czech and Slovak Republic during seven large-scale music festivals from different music genres: metal, rock, pop, country and folk, ethnic, multi-genre, dance, and trance. The total number of participants included N130,000 active festival attendees. The association between music genre and illicit drug and/or psychoactive pharmaceutical consumptions is discussed on the basis of the results obtained through wastewater analyses. The observed trend was similar to worldwide published data with a specific local phenomenon of methamphetamine prevalence that did not significantly change between music events. Increased specific loads of cocaine (measured as its metabolite benzoylecgonine) and Ecstasy, along with some cannabis, were mainly observed during pop/rock and dance music festivals. However, there was no significant increase observed in the specific loads of all monitored psychoactive pharmaceuticals. This study demonstrates that the abuse of some illicit drugs is closely associated with specific music preferences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed for the removal of antibiotics. Thus, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of antibiotics in wastewater treatment processes. However, most of these investigations did not consider the antibiotic contamination in the receiving waters. This study investigated the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in a wastewater treatment plant and the ecological risks posed by surface water receiving the effluent discharge. The results indicated that the levels of 18 antibiotics in the influent ranged from 37.21 ngL(-1) to 2935.40 ngL(-1), and sulfamethizole (SMZ) was the major component among the 18 antibiotics; SMZ occurred most frequently and at the highest concentrations. Mass balance analysis was performed to explore the mechanisms of antibiotic removal, and the findings indicated that biotic and abiotic degradation are the major removal mechanisms; however, removal of quinolones is primarily ascribed to sludge adsorption. Because activated sludge consists of negatively charged colloidal particles, it is more inclined to adsorb quinolones, which contain positively charged nitrogen atoms. The resulting loading of antibiotics from WWTP effluent discharge into the receiving water of the Yangjie River may result in their uptake by aquatic organisms and thus poses a risk to human health.

AB A full-scale test was conducted with an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) pre-treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and amoxicillin. The aim of the study is to investigate the performance of UASB in the condition of a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate from 12.57 to 21.02 kg m(-3) d(-1) and a wide pH from 5.57 to 8.26, in order to provide a reference for treating the similar chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and amoxicillin. The results demonstrated that the UASB average percentage reduction in COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin were 52.2%, 26.3% and 21.6%, respectively. In addition, three models, built on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory and linear regression techniques were developed for the simulation of the UASB system performance in the biodegradation of pharmaceutical wastewater containing 6-APA and amoxicillin. The average error of COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin were -0.63%, 2.19% and 5.40%, respectively. The results indicated that these models built on the BPNN theory were well-fitted to the detected data, and were able to simulate and predict the removal of COD, 6-APA and amoxicillin by UASB.

AB The occurrence and removal of six pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including caffeine (CF), N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), carbamazepine, metoprolol, trimethoprim (TMP), and sulpiride in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Shanghai, China were studied in January 2013; besides, grab samples of the influent were also taken every 6 h, to investigate the daily fluctuation of the wastewater influent. The results showed the concentrations of the investigated PPCPs ranged from 17 to 11,400 ng/L in the WWTP. A low variability of the PPCP concentrations in the wastewater influent throughout the day was observed, with the relative standard deviations less than 25 % for most samples. However, for TMP and CF, the slight daily fluctuation still reflected their consumption patterns. All the target compounds except CF and DEET, exhibited poor removal efficiencies (< 40 %) by biological treatment process, probably due to the low temperature in the bioreactor, which was unfavorable for activated sludge. While for the two biodegradable PPCPs, CF, and DEET, the anaerobic and oxic tank made contributions to their removal while the anoxic tank had a negative effect to their elimination. The tertiary UV treatment removed the investigated PPCPs by 5-38 %, representing a crucial polishing step to compensate for the poor removal by the biologic treatment process in winter.

AB A study has been carried out in three French hospitals in order to assess and model the pharmaceutical load in hospital wastewater and its impact in WWTP. This study, called Mediflux, consisted of three successive steps: first, an original prioritization procedure developed in our laboratory enabled us to select a list of relevant molecules from different Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes containing pharmaceuticals for specific hospital use such as anesthetics or antineoplastic agents and pharmaceuticals dispensed in the community. Then, analytical quantification procedures were developed and validated according to 2002/657/EC European directive. Sampling campaigns were performed in three different hospitals, two located in the Paris area and one in a medium-sized city 150 km from Paris. Sampling was also carried out in wastewater treatment plants. At the same time, in order to model the pharmaceutical loads from hospitals, predicted concentrations were calculated as a first approach assuming it would be a single-box model, i.e. hospitals have no effect on drug loads and only human metabolism is taken into account to evaluate the fraction of drugs eliminated in hospital effluent. In the last step, the comparison of measured and calculated concentrations showed a satisfactory correlation for some pharmaceuticals, mainly those with short elimination half-lifes and weak human metabolism. For others, it appeared that modeling should take into account various factors such as out patient use, pharmacokinetic data and molecule stability in wastewater.

AB Laboratory degradation tests with five acidic pharmaceuticals using activated sludge as inocculum under aerobic conditions were performed and microbial metabolites were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Ketoprofen was partly mineralized as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolites determined by LC-MS suggest microbial ketoprofen degradation to proceed along the pathway known for biphenyls and related compounds. Bezafibrate, naproxen and ibuprofen were degraded only cometabolically whereas no transformation was obtained for diclofenac. Some biodegradation intermediates in these batch tests could be tentatively identified by means of LC-MS. The first step in microbial bezafibrate degradation appears to be the hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond, generating well degradable 4-chlorobenzoic acid as one of the hydrolysis products. As previously found for mammals, ether cleavage and formation of desmethyinaproxen was the initial step in microbial degradation of naproxen. Two isomers of hydroxy-ibuprofen were detected as intermediates in the mineralization of ibuprofen. Laboratory studies suggest that naproxen and ibuprofen can be fully mineralized whereas more stable metabolites occur in microbial ketoprofen and bezafibrate transformation, that may deserve further attention. A LC-MS method for the trace analysis of these metabolites in water was developed and applied to municipal wastewater. Municipal wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor may gradually improve the removal of these pharmaceuticals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the efficiency of a trickling photo-bioreactor (TPBR), seeded with activated sludge and microalgae, was evaluated for domestic wastewater treatment. TPBR was operated completely on natural aeration at 2-, 4-, and 6-h hydraulic retention time (HRT) with a 12:12 h light: dark cycle. The total organic carbon (TOC) and total nutrient (TN) removal were negatively affected by decreasing the HRT from 6 to 2 h. The TPBR was able to reduce TOC from 93 to 9 mg/L, TN from 34 to 18 mg/L, and phosphorus from 23.5 to 4 mg/L at 6-h HRT. The chlorophyll concentration (5 - 7 mg per liter of sponge volume) was observed to be highest in the middle of the reactor. Altogether, 106 organic micropollutants of different classes like pharmaceutical, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides were detected in the influent wastewater sample. However, in the treated effluent, only 17 micropollutants were detected at 6-h HRT. This shows that the algal-bacterial consortia are capable of removing micropollutants from wastewater. The energy input was 0.06 kWh/kg COD removed which is much less than the conventional activated sludge processes. The results indicate that this novel system is capable of providing a sustainable wastewater treatment solution. (c) 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB 22 representative antibiotics, including 8 quinolones (QNs), 9 sulfonamides (SAs), and 5 macrolides (MCs) were selected to investigate their occurrence and removal efficiencies in a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and their distribution in the receiving water of the Chaobai River in Beijing, China. Water quality monitoring was performed in an integrated way at different selected points in the WWTP to explore the potential mechanism of antibiotics removal during wastewater treatment. Water quality of the Chaobai River was also analyzed to examine environmental distribution in a river ecosystem. The results showed that within all the 22 compounds examined, 10 antibiotics were quantified in wastewater influent, 10 in effluent, and 7 in river. Sulfadiazine (SDZ, 396 ng/L) and Sulfamethazine (SMZ, 382 ng/L) were the dominating antibiotics in the influent. Both the conventional treatment and advanced Biological Aerated Filter (BAF) system was important for the removal of antibiotics from the wastewater. And the concentrations of selected antibiotics were ranged from 0-41.8 ng/L in the effluent-receiving river. Despite the fact that the concentrations were reduced more than 50% compared to effluent concentrations, WWTP discharge was still regarded as a dominant point-source input of antibiotics into the Chaobai River.

AB In this study, the stability of 124 target analytes in influent and effluent wastewater samples during short-term (4 degrees C) and long-term (-18 degrees C) storage was assessed. The most common storage scenario was considered, in which samples were frozen immediately after sampling without any pre-treatment. During short-term storage more analytes remained stable (concentration during storage was in the range of 60-120% of the initial concentration) at 4 degrees C than at -18 degrees C. During long-term storage (-18 degrees C), three types of behavior were observed: constant concentrations throughout the experimental period, decreasing concentrations with time, and loss of the compound from the sample after freezing. Differences between effluent and influent samples were observed for 50 out of 124 tested PPCPs. The amount of stable analytes decreased with time during long-term storage. 72% and 56% of the target compounds in the effluent and influent wastewater, respectively, remained stable during 60 days of storage. The number of stable compounds decreased to 57 (46%) and 46 (37%) in the effluent and influent, respectively, over 120 days. 15 Pharmaceuticals were lost after freezing/thawing cycle. The results stress the importance of storage factors during analysis of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. The stability of target compounds in the samples under the planned storage conditions should be checked before starting the experiment to obtain reliable data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Municipal wastewater containing 21 pharmaceutical compounds, as well as activated sludge obtained from the aeration tank of the same wastewater treatment plant were used in lab-scale biodegradation experiments. The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and ranged from 13.2 ng/L to 51.8 mu g/L. Activated sludge was characterized in the terms of phylogenetic and catabolic diversity of microbial community, as well as its morphology. Proteobacteria (24.0%) represented the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes (19.8%) and Firmicutes (13.2%). Bioaugmentation of wastewater with activated sludge stimulated the biodegradation process for 14 compounds. The concentration of carbamazepine in non-amended and bioaugmented WW decreased during the first 17 h up to 30% and 70%, respectively. Diclofenac and ibuprofen demonstrated comparatively slow removal. The stimulating effect of the added nutrients was observed for the degradation of almost all pharmaceuticals detected in WW The most pronounced effect of nutrients was found for erythromycin. The results were compared with those obtained for the full-scale WW treatment process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The irrigation of agricultural land with wastewater is increasingly practiced in many parts of the world as a consequence of growing populations and urbanization The risks emerging from pharmaceuticals that are contained in wastewater for soils and groundwater have hardly been investigated We studied leaching and effects of naproxen. ibuprofen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrocil. clarithromycin. trimethoprim, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metoprolol in a soil column experiment simulating an irrigation event with 8 6 cm of wastewater containing 20 mu g L(-1) or 2000 mu g L(-1) of each compound or of erythromycin alone The leached fraction of applied pharmaceuticals ranged from 0 1 +/- 0 1% (clarithromycin, 2000 mu g L(-1)) to 130 +/- 41 % (naproxen, 20 mu g L(-1)) and tended to increase with decreasing K(d) or K(oc). Naproxen transport was similar to that of the tracer chloride Ibuprofen was also hardly retarded (R = 1 20 +/- 0 18). but showed a higher degradation rate of 0 02 +/- 0 004 h(-1) (2000 mu g L(-1)) than naproxen The transport of a pulse of 2000 mu g L(-1) of bezafibrate could be described with a retardation factor of 1 5 and a degradation rate of 0.033 h(-1) The application of erythromycin alone or of a cocktail of all pharmaceuticals significantly Increased soil CO(2) emissions by 50% 1 d after the application Mere is a considerable risk that pharmaceuticals are leached to groundwater during wastewater irrigation

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of pharmaceutical residue in surface water. Epilithic biofilms were collected downstream from 12 WWTPs of various types and capacities to study the impacts of their discharge through the changes in biofilm composition (compared to a corresponding upstream biofilm) in terms of pharmaceutical concentrations and bacterial communitymodifications (microbial diversity and resistance integrons). The biofilm is a promising indicator to evaluate the impacts of WWTPs on the surrounding aquatic environment. Indeed, the use of biofilms reveals contamination hot spots. All of the downstream biofilms present significant concentrations (up to 965 ng/g) of five to 11 pharmaceuticals (among the 12 analysed). Moreover, the exposition to the discharge point increases the presence of resistance integrons (three to 31 fold for Class 1) and modifies the diversity of the bacterial communities (for example cyanobacteria). The present study confirms that the discharge from WWTPs has an impact on the aquatic environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the increased consumption of chemotherapeutic agents, their high toxicity, carcinogenicity, their occurrence in the aquatic environment must be properly evaluated. An analytical method based on online solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated. A 1 mL injection volume was used to quantify six of the most widely used cytotoxic drugs (cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, ifosfamide, methotrexate, irinotecan and epirubicin) in municipal wastewater. The method was validated using standard additions. The validation results in wastewater influent had coefficients of determination (R-2) between 0.983 and 0.998 and intra-day precision ranging from 7 to 13% (expressed as relative standard deviation %RSD), and from 9 to 23% for inter-day precision. Limits of detection ranged from 4 to 20 ng L-1 while recovery values were greater than 70% except for gemcitabine, which is the most hydrophilic compound in the selected group and had a recovery of 47%. Matrix effects were interpreted by signal suppression and ranged from 55 to 118% with cyclophosphamide having the highest value. Two of the target anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) were detected and quantified in wastewater (effluent and influent) and ranged from 13 to 60 ng L-1. The proposed method thus allows proper monitoring of potential environmental releases of chemotherapy agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the presence of twelve antibiotics, total cultivable bacteria and fecal coliforms were investigated in the influent and effluent in a wastewater treatment plant as well as the water from the upstream and downstream of the relevant receiving water. The twelve antibiotics were detectable in these waters except for Erythromycin, which was not detected in the receiving water. 58.17-97.35% of the antibiotics can be removed during the wastewater treatment process. Among these antibiotics, the highest concentration was detected for Cephalexin in the influents, followed by the Amoxycillin, Sulfamethoxazole and Tetacyclines. Besides, no significant differences were found in the concentrations of these antibiotics between the upstream and downstream of the receiving river. The total cultivable bacteria and fecal coliforms in influent were higher than that in effluent in WWTP while the same items of downstream were a little higher than that of upstream. With respect to the influent, the highest resistance was found for Trimethoprin/ sulfamethoxazole (SXT), followed by Tetracycline (TET), Chloramphenicol (CHL) and Ampicillin (AMP) while the lowest resistance was Ciprofloxacin (32%). In the effluent, the highest resistance was found for SXT, followed by CHL, Erythromycin and TET. The wastewater treatment process increased the level of antibiotic resistant among the isolated fecal coliform. Consequently, the substantial concern should be paid to the multi-antibiotic resistant isolates.

AB The residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products are the cause of increasing concern around the world. The aim of this study was to carry out the quantification of six antipsychotic drugs in hospital wastewater with the aid of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and, subsequently, make a preliminary assessment of the environmental risk posed. Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and solid phase extraction were optimized by multivariate design and validated in compliance with international guidelines. The extraction procedures were successfully applied to the quantification of the six selected antipsychotics in samples that were formed each day and collected at two main sampling points of the sewage network over the period of a week, in December 2017. Olanzapine (0.31-0.52 mu g L-1), clozapine (0.56-0.97 mu g L-1), haloperidol (1.43-2.73 mu g L-1), risperidone (0.92-0.98 mu g L-1) and chlorpromazine (0.52 mu g L-1) were found in at least one sampling point. In the case of most analytes, the highest concentrations were determined at sampling point A, which are derived from the psychiatric wing. The environmental risk quotient for clozapine, chlorpromazine and risperidone was >600, a very high-risk index, which signals the need for a better control of the emission of antipsychotics and an improvement of the wastewater treatment, especially, with regard to wastewater discharged from the hospital psychiatric wing.

AB In many surface waters, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent is a substantial source of both regulated and unregulated contaminants, including a suite of complex organic compounds derived from household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and industrial and medical byproducts. In addition, STP effluents in some urban areas have also been shown to have a positive gadolinium (Gd) anomaly in the rare earth element (REE) pattern, with the Gd derived from its use in medical facilities. REE concentrations are relatively easy to measure compared to many organic wastewater compounds and may provide a more widely utilized tracer of STP effluents. To evaluate whether sewage treatment plant-associated Gd is a useful tracer of treatment plant effluent, an investigation of the occurrence, fate, and transport of rare earth elements was undertaken. The rare earth element patterns of four of five STP effluents sampled display positive Gd anomalies. The one site that did not have a Gd anomaly serves a small community, population 1200, with no medical facilities. Biosolids from a large metropolitan STP are not enriched in Gd even though the effluent is, suggesting that a substantial fraction of Gd remains in the aqueous phase through routine treatment plant operation. To evaluate whether STP-derived Gd persists in the fluvial environment, a 14-km study reach downstream of an STP was sampled. Gadolinium anomalies were present at all five downstream sites, but the magnitude of the anomaly decreased. Effluent from STPs is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic constituents, and to better understand the chemical interactions and their effect on REES, the aqueous speciation was modeled using comprehensive chemical analyses of water samples collected downstream of STP input. These calculations suggest that the REES will likely remain dissolved because phosphate and carbonate complexes dominate over free REE ions. This study supports the application of Gd anomalies as a useful tracer of urban wastewater.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a potential endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC), which produces an adverse impact on aquatic life and human beings. Wastewater discharge is considered as the primary source of triclosan in water bodies. The study is aimed to investigate the occurrence and environmental risk of triclosan released by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). An analytical protocol was developed and validated to determine the presence of TCS in the samples through offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography - electron spray ionization (ESI)quadrupole mass spectrum (LC/ESI/MS). The limit of detection and quantification of protocol was estimated as 2.8ng/L and 6.25ng/L, respectively. The season-wise influent and effluent samples from two WWTP in Chennai, India, were monitored. The TCS concentrations in samples were found in the range of 443 to 1757ng/L. The Risk Quotient (RQ) method was performed to evaluate the environmental (ecotoxicological and human health) risk associated with the exposure of TCS-containing wastewater. The results of the study revealed that primary producer (algae) was highly vulnerable to exposure of TCS in the aquatic environment. The estimated daily intake of TCS was much lower than the reference dosage, and this indicates that TCS did not produce any considerable risk to human health. Also, it suggested that additional treatment was required for complete removal of triclosan residues.

AB The study presented the occurrence of antibiotics in 16 different hospital effluents, the removal of antibiotics in urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and the potential ecotoxicological risks of the effluent discharge on the aquatic ecosystem. The total concentration of antibiotics in hospital effluents was ranged from 21.2 +/- 0.13 to 4886 +/- 3.80ng/L in summer and from 497 +/- 3.66 to 322,735 +/- 4.58ng/L in winter. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were detected the highest concentrations among the investigated antibiotics. The total antibiotic load to the influent of the WWTP from hospitals was 3.46g/day in summer and 303.2g/day in winter. The total antibiotic contribution of hospitals to the influent of the WWTP was determined as 13% in summer and 28% in winter. The remaining 87% in summer and 72% in winter stems from the households. The total antibiotic removal by conventional physical and biological treatment processes was determined as 79% in summer, whereas it decreased to 36% in winter. When the environmental risk assessment was performed, azithromycin and clarithromycin in the effluent from the treatment plant in winter posed a high risk (RQ>10) for the aquatic organisms (algae and fish) in the receiving environment. According to these results, the removal efficiency of antibiotics at the WWTP is inadequate and plant should be improved to remove antibiotics by advanced treatment processes.

AB The occurrence and removal of 13 antibiotics were investigated in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced wastewater treatment processes in Beijing, China. Most of the target antibiotics were detected in the secondary and tertiary effluents, with the concentrations of 4.8-1106.0 and 0.3-505.0 ng.L-1. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics showed relatively high concentrations in all samples (782-1814 ng.L-1). Different tertiary treatment processes showed discrepant antibiotics removal performances. Ozonation process was found more effective in removing target antibiotics compared to the coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation process and sand filtration process. Investigation of the target antibiotics in three typical urban rivers in Beijing was carried out to understand antibiotics occurrence in surface water environment. Eight antibiotics were detected in the studied rivers, with highest concentration of antibiotics in the river which was mainly replenished by reclaimed water. This study showed the necessity of employing more effective advanced treatment facilities to further reduce the discharge amount of antibiotics.

AB Artificial sweeteners (Ass) have been used for decades as food and drink additives. ASs are not readily metabolized by humans and are excreted mostly unchanged from the human body and therefore they can be detected in high concentrations in the inflow to wastewater treatment plants. This study evaluates the occurrence and removal of saccharin in six constructed wetlands in the Czech Republic. The results revealed that saccharin was identified in 100% of samples of inflowing wastewater. The average removal of saccharin was only 42.4%, lower as compared to >90% removal of saccharin commonly achieved in activated sludge treatment plants. There was no difference in saccharin removal during the summer and winter periods. The correlation of saccharin removal with removal of major pollutants indicated a significant positive relationship with removal of COD, relationships to other major pollutants removal were not significant. Saccharin removal was positively related (p < 0.05) to dissolved oxygen concentration in the inflow wastewater and outflow values of redox potential. This is the first study that evaluates the removal of saccharin in constructed wetlands and therefore, more research is needed to confirm these preliminary results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 31 antibiotics, including 11 sulfonamides (SAs), five fluoroquinolones (FQs), four macrolides (MLs), four tetracyclines (TCs), three chloramphenicols (CAPs), and four other antibiotics (Others), were investigated in 12 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Dalian, China. A total of 29 antibiotics were detected in wastewater samples with the concentration ranging from 63.6 to 5404.6 ng/L. FQs and SAs were the most abundant antibiotic classes in most wastewater samples, accounting for 42.2 and 23.9% of total antibiotic concentrations, respectively, followed by TCs (16.0%) and MLs (14.8%). Sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were the most frequently detected antibiotics; of these, the concentration of ofloxacin was the highest in most of influent (average concentration = 609.8 ng/L) and effluent (average concentration = 253.4 ng/L) samples. The removal efficiencies varied among WWTPs in the range of -189.9% (clarithromycin) to 100% (enoxacin, doxycycline, etc), and more than 50% of antibiotics could not be efficiently removed with the removal efficiency less than 65%. An environmental risk assessment was also performed in the WWTP effluents by calculating the risk quotient (RQ), and high RQ values (> 1) indicated erythromycin and clarithromycin might cause the ecological risk on organisms in surrounding water near discharge point of WWTPs in this area, which warrants further attention.

AB The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance represents one of the most important public health concerns and has been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine. The overall elimination of antibiotics in conventional wastewater treatment plants is quite low; therefore, residual amounts of these compounds are continuously discharged to receiving surface waters, which may promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In this study, the ability of a fungal treatment as an alternative wastewater treatment for the elimination of forty-seven antibiotics belonging to seven different groups (beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, metronidazoles, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) was evaluated. 77% of antibiotics were removed after the fungal treatment, which is higher than removal obtained in conventional treatment plants. Moreover, the effect of fungal treatment on the removal of some antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was evaluated. The fungal treatment was also efficient in removing ARGs, such as ermB (resistance to macrolides), tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), bla(TEM) (resistance to beta-lactams), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones). However, it was not possible to establish a clear link between concentrations of antibiotics and corresponding ARGs in wastewater, which leads to the conclusion that there are other factors that should be taken into consideration besides the antibiotic concentrations that reach aquatic ecosystems in order to explain the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.

AB In this study, the analytical method optimization for analysis of (beta-blockers including metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), atenolol (ATE), sotalol (STL), timolol (TML) in wastewater were carried out. The effect of various parameters such as sample volume, pH, concentration, matrix and pre-treatment procedure was studied in order to find out the optimum conditions for their determination in SPE system. The presence of the compounds in Konya urban wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent samples was investigated and the eco-toxicological risk assessment was carried out. The extraction of the samples was performed with SPE system using Oasis HLB cartridges. The concentrations of the target compounds were determined using a liquid chromatograph equipped with MS-MS detector. STL, ATE, MET, PRO, TML were determined in the range of 43.5-468, 278-465, 28.3-92, <d1-18, 58-86 ng/L in influent wastewater samples while STL, ATE, MET, PRO were determined as 30.4-44, 163276, 81.8-136, 3.3-34 ng/L in effluent samples, respectively. TML compound was not detected in effluent samples. The hazard quotient (HQ) for determined P-blocker compounds were calculated according to EU guidelines. PNEC values were derived from the available aquatic toxicity data using three different species (algae, crustaceans and fish) from different tropic levels. The HQ values for MET, PRO, STL and ATE compounds were determined below 0.1 which means insignificant risk to aquatic organisms.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an important source of pharmaceuticals released into the environment. Understanding how various pharmaceuticals are distributed and handled in WWIPs is a prerequisite to optimize their abatement. Here we investigated the spatial distribution and removal efficiencies pharmaceuticals in China's WWTPs. A total of 35 pharmaceuticals in wastewater samples from 12 WVVTPs at different cities of China were analyzed. Among these detected pharmaceuticals, caffeine showed the highest concentration (up to 1775.98 ng L-1) in the WIMP influent. In addition, there were significant regional differences in pharmaceutical distribution with higher influent concentrations of total pharmaceuticals detected in WVtrFPs in the northern cities than the southern ones. The state-of-the-art treatment processes were generally inefficient in removing pharmaceuticals. Only 14.3% of pharmaceuticals were removed effectively (mean removal efficiency > 70%), while 51.4% had a removal rate of below 30%. The anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (AA0)-membrane bioreactor (MBR) integrated process and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) showed better performance than the MO and oxidation ditch (OD) processes:Ofloxacin, erythromycin-H2O, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and sulfamethoxazole in WWlP effluents exhibited a high or medium ecological risk and deserved special attention.

AB Due to a growing interest in the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the aquatic environment and their potential impacts on humans and the environment, a collaborative study was conducted on these emerging contaminants in the effluents from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the drinking water supply system of Calgary, Alberta. A number of PhACs and EDCs were detected in the WWTP effluents, at concentrations ranging from ng/L to low mu g/L. Although these compounds were generally removed from WWTP effluents during wastewater treatment, some compounds, such as carbamazepine were more persistent. Some target PhACs and EDCs were detected at low ng/L levels in the surface and potable water in this study. Currently, there is no evidence that trace amounts of PhACs and EDCs in Calgary's waterways can have a health impact on humans, but they may pose adverse chronic effects on aquatic life.

AB Urban pollution and hydrological stress are common stressors of stream ecosystems, but their combined effects on ecosystem functioning are still unclear. We measured a set of functional processes and accompanying environmental variables in locations upstream and downstream of urban sewage inputs in 13 streams covering a wide range ofwater pollution levels and hydrological variability. Sewage inputs seriously impaired stream chemical characteristics and led to complex effects on ecosystem functioning. Biofilm biomass accrual, whole-reach nutrient uptake andmetabolism(ecosystem respiration) were generally subsidized, whereas organic matter decomposition and biofilm phosphorus uptake capacity decreased with increasing pollutant concentrations. Hydrological stress affected stream ecosystem functioning but its effect was minor compared to the effects of urban pollution, due to the large inter-site variability of the streams. Changes appeared mainly linked to the concentration of pharmaceutically active compounds, followed by other chemical characteristics and by hydrology. The results point to the need to further improve sewage treatment, especially as climate change will stress riverine organisms and reduce the dilution capacity of the receiving streams.

The present paper reports the chemical, microbiological, biochemical, and biological effects of upgrading a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a powdered activated carbon stage in the catchment area of the Schussen River, the largest German tributary of Lake Constance. Data were obtained prior to and after the upgrade between 2011 and 2017.ResultsAfter the upgrading, the release of antibiotic resistant and non-resistant bacteria, micropollutants, and their effect potentials was significantly lower in the effluent. In addition, in the Schussen River downstream of the wastewater treatment plant, reduced concentrations of micropollutants were accompanied by both a significantly improved health of fish and invertebrates, along with a better condition of the macrozoobenthic community.ConclusionsThe present study clearly provides evidence for the causality between a WWTP upgrade by powdered activated carbon and ecosystem improvement and demonstrates the promptness of positive ecological changes in response to such action. The outcome of this study urgently advocates an investment in further wastewater treatment as a basis for decreasing the release of micropollutants and both resistant and non-resistant bacteria into receiving water bodies and, as a consequence, to sustainably protect river ecosystem health and drinking water resources for mankind in the future.

AB This chapter reviews current and new technologies for the removal of emerging TrOC from wastewater for reuse purposes. In particular, it compares the relative performance of Membrane bioreactors (MBR) with other conventional biological processes. It is shown that MBR has many intrinsic advantages over other methods leading to superior performance. Fundamental to this is the presence of a membrane barrier which provides a range of other adsorption mechanisms for TrOC. However, in practice there are many factors affecting TrOC removal by MBR, leading to sometimes conflicting reports in the literature from both lab scale studies as well as full scale plants. These factors include both structural and physicochemical characteristics of the TrOC as well as operational parameters of the MBR process. It is concluded that further work is required, particularly in areas such as improved understanding of the overall fate and degradation pathways of TrOC undergoing MBR processes, investigation of specific microbial-TrOC interactions and development of hybrid systems having MBR at the core to treat the wide varieties of TrOC from wastewater.

AB This study examines the removal of micropollutants (MPs) in a hybrid process that combines anaerobic and aerobic redox conditions under different Organic Loading Rates (OLRs).A laboratory-scale pilot-plant composed of an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor (UASB) combined with a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated. Six MPs were analyzed: the hormones estrone, 17--ethinyl estradiol and 17--estradiol, the plasticizer bisphenol A and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac. In order to study its influence on removal efficiencies, the system was operated at three different OLRs: high (0.670.15kg COD/m(3) d), medium (0.37 +/- 0.06kg COD/m(3) d) and low (0.11 +/- 0.02kg COD/m(3) d).The results demonstrated the synergistic effects due to the double biological treatment, with removal rates above 90% for the hormones and the plasticizer. Pharmaceuticals were the most resistant compounds, being only partially removed in the liquid phase. Removal rates of the MPs were higher at high OLR of the influent.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are discharged into the environment from domestic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we determined the distribution of the anti-epileptic drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), and its major metabolites and caffeine in both aqueous and solid phases through different treatment processes of a WWTP. A method was developed to extract samples of biosolids using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), coupled with cleanup of extracts using solid-phase extraction. Samples of biosolids and wastewater were analyzed for caffeine and CBZ and five of its metabolites, 10,-11-dihydro-10,11-epoxycarbamazepine (CBZ-EP), 11-dihydro-10, 11-epoxycarbamazepine (CBZ-DiOH), 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ-2OH), 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ3OH), and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ-100H). The analytes were quantified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The recoveries of the analytes were 82.1-91.3% from raw biosolids and 80.1-92.4% from treated biosolids, and the limits of detection were 0.06-0.50 and 0.06-0.40 mu g/kg on a wet weight basis for raw and treated biosolids, respectively. The behavior of carbamazepine and its metabolites, together with caffeine as a marker of domestic inputs, was investigated in the WWTP for the City of Peterborough, ON, Canada, which utilizes secondary sewage treatment technologies. CBZ, CBZ-2OH, CBZ3OH, and CBZ-DiOH were detected at concentrations of 69.6, 1.9, 1.6, and 7.5 mu g/kg (dry weight), respectively, in untreated biosolids and at concentrations of 258.1, 3.4, 4.3, and 15.4 mu g/kg (dry weight), respectively, in treated biosolids. However, CBZ-EP and CBZ-100H were not detected in any of the biosolid samples. CBZ and its five metabolites were detected in all wastewater samples collected from four different stages of treatment. The results showed that 29% of the carbamazepine was removed from the aqueous phase during treatment in the WWTP, while the metabolites were not effectively removed. Concentrations of caffeine were reduced by 99.9% in the aqueous phase, which appeared to be due primarily to degradation. Caffeine was also detected at concentrations of 165.8 and 7.6 mu g/kg (dry weight) in raw and treated biosolids, respectively. Because of differences in hydrophobicity, CBZ is the primary analyte in biosolids, while CBZ-DiOH is the primary analyte in the aqueous phase of the wastewater. A mass balance calculation showed that the majority of CBZ and its metabolites exist in the aqueous phase (i.e., wastewater), rather than in the biosolids, 78 g of CBZ and its metabolites enters the Peterborough WWTP daily, and 91 g is discharged from the WWTP daily in the combined suspended solids and aqueous phases of the wastewater. The calculated daily inputs into the WWTP are somewhat less than the inputs of 192 g estimated from Canadian annual sales data for CBZ.

AB Sewage effluents are the most important source of emergent pollutants in the aquatic environment. In the present study the toxicological impact of an untreated sewage effluent on the Prochilodus lineatus fish was assessed under field conditions using a caging experiment. The biomarkers which were measured here involved oxidative stress markers, hepatic function parameters, neurotoxicity indicators, energy reserves, histological alterations and brain cell proliferation. In addition, water quality parameters including the occurrence of some human pharmaceuticals were measured. Juveniles of P. lineatus were caged for 15 days at three sites: the effluent site, and 2 km upstream and downstream from the effluent discharge. Caffeine, atenolol, carbamazepine, en-alapril and sildenafil were detected in water river samples. The increased activation of caspase-3 and the decreased cell proliferation in the diencephalon showed that the brain of fish caged at the effluent was affected. These fish also displayed a rise in hepatic transaminase activity, and oxidative stress in liver and gills which was evidenced by an increased lipid peroxidation and activation of antioxidant enzymes. At tissue level, increased glycogen and decreased lipid contents in liver as well as the highest indexes of hepatic lesions were also observed in the fish caged at the effluent. Both biochemical and histopathological findings demonstrated that effects were more severe on the liver of such fish than on their gills. The in situ exposure method carried out in our study makes it possible to observe the real effects of the sewage effluent on fish. Furthermore, our results also provide a better understanding of the harmful effects of wastewater effluents on the aquatic wildlife.

AB Anticancer drugs routinely used in chemotherapy enter wastewater through the excretion of the non-metabolised drug following administration to patients. This study considers the consumption and subsequent behaviour and occurrence of these chemicals in aquatic systems, with the aim of prioritising a selection of these drugs which are likely to persist in the environment and hence be considered for environmental screening programmes. Accurate consumption data were compiled from a hospital survey in NW England and combined with urinary excretion rates derived from clinical studies. Physical-chemical property data were compiled along with likely chemical fate and persistence during and after wastewater treatment. A shortlist of 15 chemicals (from 65) was prioritised based on their consumption, persistency and likelihood of occurrence in surface waters and supported by observational studies where possible. The ecological impact of these 'prioritised' chemicals is uncertain as the measured concentrations in surface waters generally fall below standard toxicity thresholds. Nonetheless, this prioritised sub-list should prove useful for developing environmental screening programmes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of Al-Quds Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which includes sequential elements as activated sludge, ultrafiltration, activated carbon column and reverse osmosis, to remove spiked ibuprofen, a non steroid anti inflammatory drug (NSAID), was investigated. Kinetic studies in pure water and in the activated sludge indicated that the drug was stable during one month of observation. Besides, the overall performance of the integrated plant showed complete removal of ibuprofen from wastewater. Activated carbon column, which was the last element in the sequence before the reverse osmosis system, yielded 95.7% removal of ibuprofen. Batch adsorptions of the drug by using either activated charcoal or composite micelle-clay system were determined at 25 degrees C and well described by Langmuir isotherms. Octadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA) bromide and montmorillonite were used to prepare the micelle-clay adsorbent, for which the adsorption kinetics are much faster than activated charcoal. Results suggest that integrating clay-micelle complex filters within the existing WWTP may be promising in improving removal efficiency of the NSAID.

AB The occurrence, behavior, and release of five acidic pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), ketoprofen (KEP), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA), have been investigated along the different units in a tertiary-level domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in hyper-urbanization city of China (Shanghai). IBP was the most abundant chemicals among the measured in raw wastewater. The loads of the acidic pharmaceuticals in the WWTP influent ranged from 7.5 to 414 mg/day/1,000 inh, which were lower than those reported in the developed countries suggesting a less per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals in Shanghai. IBP obtained by highest removal (87 %); NPX and KEP were also significantly removed (69-76 %). However, DFC and CA were only moderately removed by 37-53 %, respectively. Biodegradation seemed to play a key role in the elimination of the studied pharmaceuticals except for DFC and CA. An annual release of acidic pharmaceuticals was estimated at 1,499 and 61.7 kg/year through wastewater and sludge, respectively, from Shanghai. Highest pharmaceuticals concentrations were detected in the effluent discharge point of the WWTP, indicating that WWTP effluent is the main source of the acidic pharmaceuticals to its receiving river. Preliminary results indicated that only DFC in river had a high risk to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the joint toxicity effects of these chemicals are needed to further investigate.

AB Pharmaceutical residues have become tightly controlled environmental contaminants in recent years, due to their increasing concentration in environmental components. This is mainly caused by their high level of production and everyday consumption. Therefore there is a need to apply new and sufficiently sensitive analytical methods, which can detect the presence of these contaminants even in very low concentrations. This study is focused on the application of a reliable analytical method for the analysis of 10 selected drug residues, mainly from the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, caffeine, naproxen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and dicofenac), in wastewaters and surface waters. This analytical method is based on solid phase extraction, derivatization by N-methyl-N-(trimethylsily)triftuoroacetamide (MSTFA) and finally analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with Time-of-Flight mass spectrometric detection (GCxGC-TOF MS). Detection limits ranged from 0.18 to 5 ng/L depending on the compound and selected matrix. The method was successfully applied for detection of the presence of selected pharmaceuticals in the Svratka River and in wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant in Brno-Modrice, Czech Republic. The concentration of pharmaceuticals varied from one to several hundreds of ng/L in surface water and from one to several tens of mu g/L in wastewater.

AB The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the production of an antibacterial drug (nalidixic acid) was investigated employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR) integrated with either ozonation or UV/H2O2 process. This was achieved by placing chemical oxidation in the recirculation stream of the MBR. A conventional configuration with chemical oxidation as polishing for the MER effluent was also tested as a reference. The synergistic effect of MBR when integrated with chemical oxidation was assessed by monitoring (i) the main wastewater characteristics, (ii) the concentration of nalidixic acid, (iii) the 48 organics identified in the raw wastewater and (iv) the 55 degradation products identified during wastewater treatment. Results showed that MBR integration with ozonation or UV/H2O2 did not cause relevant drawbacks to both biological and filtration processes, with COD removal rates in the range 85-95%. Nalidixic acid passed undegraded through the MBR and was completely removed in the chemical oxidation step. Although the polishing configuration appeared to give better performances than the integrated system in removing 15 out of 48 secondary organics while similar removals were obtained for 19 other compounds. The benefit of the integrated system was however evident for the removal of the degradation products. Indeed, the integrated system allowed higher removals for 34 out of 55 degradation products while for only 4 compounds the polishing configuration gave better performance. Overall, results showed the effectiveness of the integrated treatment with both ozone and UV/H2O2.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are the predominant disposal method for human waste in areas without municipal sewage treatment alternatives. Relatively few studies have addressed the release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from OWTS to groundwater. PPCP fate and transport from OWTS are important, particularly where these systems are adjacent to sensitive aquatic ecosystems such as coastal areas or wetlands. The objectives of this study were to identify PPCPs in residential wastewater and groundwater beneath OWTS and to characterize the environmental conditions affecting the OWTS discharge of PPCPs to nearby streams. The study sites are in coastal plain aquifers, which may be considered vulnerable "end-members" for subsurface PPCP transport. The PPCPs most commonly detected in the OWTS, at concentrations ranging from 0.12 mu g L-1 to 12.04 mu g L-1 in the groundwater, included: caffeine, ibuprofen, DEET, and homosalate. Their presence was related to particulate and dissolved organic carbon abundance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid development of pharmaceutical industry, and thus widespread availability of different types of therapeutical and increased intake of pharmaceuticals, results in elevated concentrations of pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater subjected to treatment in wastewater treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals present in raw wastewater discharged from hospitals, households, veterinary and health care clinics eventually end up in wastewater treatment plants. Commonly applied methods for treating wastewater do not allow complete removal of these contaminants. As a consequence, pharmaceuticals still present in treated wastewater are introduced to water environment. The most frequently identified pharmaceuticals in surface water belong to the following groups: non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, estrogens and lipid regulators. The most difficult is removal of diclofenac, clofibric acid and carbamazepine as these substances show low biodegradability. Diclofenac can be removed in the process of wastewater treatment by 40%, carbamazepine by 10%, and clofibric acid from 26 to 50%. The presence of diclofenac sodium in the rivers in Poland was confirmed and the concentrations were following: 380 ng/dm(3) (the Warta river), 470 ng/dm(3) (the Odra river), 140 ng/dm(3) (the Vistula river). Naproxene was found in the Warta river at the concentration of 100 ng/dm(3). The presence of pharmaceuticals in surface water can be toxic to aqueous microorganisms and fish. Recent studies confirmed also the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. This is considered as a problem especially in urban agglomerations such as Berlin or large cities in Spain and China. The studies showed that pharmaceuticals were also identified in the samples taken from the Polish rivers and drinking water. The presence of naproxene and diclofenac at the concentrations of 13 and 4 ng/dm(3) was identified in drinking water sampled from water intakes in Poznan. Surface water and drinking water showed also the presence of illegal drugs.

AB Green chemists have recently created enzyme-like catalysts called tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand activators (TAMLs) that are capable of destroying stubborn pollutants by accelerating cleansing reactions with hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. When applied to the wastewater from pulp mills, TAMLs have been shown to reduced staining and hazardous chemicals. TAMLs could also be used to treat runoff from agricultural waste lagoons as well as residential sewage, which contains dyes from washing machines and traces of harmful pharmaceuticals that are excreted in human urine. These catalysts may also someday be used to disinfect drinking water and clean up contamination from bioterror attacks.

AB Acetaminophen and sulfonamides are emerging contaminants. Conventional wastewater treatment systems fail to degrade these compounds properly. Mycoremediation, is a formof novel bioremediation that uses extracellular enzymes ofwhite-rot fungi to degrade pollutants in the environment. In this study, spentmushroomcompost (SMC), which contains fungal extracellular enzymes, was tested for acetaminophen and sulfonamides removal. Among the SMCs of nine mushrooms tested in batch experiments, the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii exhibited the highest removal rate for acetaminophen and sulfonamides. Several fungal extracellular enzymes that might be involved in removal of acetaminophen and sulfonamides were identified by metaproteomic analysis. The bacterial classes, Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, were revealed by metagenomic analysis and may be assisting with acetaminophen and sulfonamide removal, respectively, in the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii. Bioreactor experimentswere used to simulate the capability of Pleurotus eryngii SMC for the removal of acetaminophen and sulfonamides from wastewater. The results of this study provide a feasible solution for acetaminophen and sulfonamide removal from wastewater using the SMC of Pleurotus eryngii. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work is to establish baseline levels of pharmaceuticals in three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) streams in the greater Dublin region to assess the removal efficiency of the selected WWTPs and to investigate the existence of any seasonal variability. Twenty compounds including several classes of antibiotics, acidic and basic pharmaceuticals, and prescribed medications were selected for investigation using a combination of membrane filtration, solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Fourteen of the selected compounds were found in the samples. Increased effluent concentrations, compared to influent concentrations, for a number of compounds (carbamazepine, clotrimazole, propranolol, nimesulide, furosemide, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, metoprolol, and gemfibrozil) were observed. The detected concentrations were generally below toxicity levels and based on current knowledge are unlikely to pose any threat to aquatic species. Mefenamic acid concentrations detected in both Leixlip and Swords effluents may potentially exert ecotoxicological effects with maximum risk quotients (i.e., ratio of predicted exposure concentration to predicted no effect concentration) of 4.04 and 1.33, respectively.

AB Antibiotics including three beta-lactams, two fluoroquinolones and two macrolides, which were the top seven most prescribed antibiotics in Dalian, China, were selected to investigate their occurrence in six municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their distribution in the effluent-receiving waters of the Yellow Sea. Four WWTPs employing different treatment technologies were selected to explore the mechanism of antibiotics elimination during wastewater treatment. Results showed that fluoroquinolones and macrolides were dominant species in both WWTPs effluents and the surveyed coastal waters. Biodegradation was the main pathway for beta-lactams removal, however, primary treatment performed better than biological treatment for fluoroquinolones removal. Concentrations of macrolides increased dramatically after the biological treatment, which was probably due to the release of macrolides enclosed in feces particles. In the surveyed coastal waters, reduction of antibiotic concentration with distance was observed. Potential environmental risk caused by the occurrence of these antibiotics should be evaluated in future work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of present study was to treat municipal wastewater in two-stage anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFMBR) (anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) followed by AFMBR) using granular activated carbon (GAC) as carrier medium in both stages. Approximately 95% COD removal efficiency could be obtained when the two-stage AFMBR was operated at total HRT of 5 h (2 h for AFBR and 3 h for AFMBR) and influent COD concentration of 250 mg/L. About 67% COD and 99% TSS removal efficiency could be achieved by the system treating the effluent from primary clarifier of municipal wastewater treatment plant, at HRT of 1.28 h and OLR of 5.65 kg COD/m(3) d. The system could also effectively remove twenty detected pharmaceuticals in raw wastewaters with removal efficiency in the range of 86-100% except for diclofenac (78%). No other membrane fouling control was required except scouring effect of GAC for flux of 16 LMH. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated five different trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) (one hormone: 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), two pharmaceuticals: salicylic acid (SA) and trimethoprim (TMP), one analgesic drug: carbamazepine (CBZ), and one surfactant metabolite: nonylphenol (NP)) removal efficiency at a full-scale Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP). The AWTP achieved average EE2, SA and NP removal over 80% at the biological carbon removal stages. The results also showed a 66% removal of TMP at the nitrogen removal stages. CBZ was recalcitrant throughout the plant, due to its high solubility and low distribution coefficient between wastewater and sludge. Batch experiments were conducted on active and inactive secondary, nitrification and denitrification sludge by adding TOrCs to understand the removal mechanism through sorption and biodegradation. Sorption was the dominant mechanism to remove EE2, SA and NP in secondary treatment processes. In nitrification and denitrification processes, higher percentage of TOrCs removal through biodegradation were observed compared to removal through sorption.

AB The advent of increasingly stringent and wider ranging European Union legislation relating to water and the environment has required regulators to assess compliance risk and to respond by formulating appropriate pollution control measures. To support this process the UK Water Industry has completed a national Chemicals Investigation Programme (CIP), to monitor over 160 wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) for 70 determinands. Final effluent concentrations of zinc, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene and indeno(1,2,3-cd) pyrene), "penta" congeners (BDEs) 47 and 99, tributyltin, triclosan, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, ibuprofen, propranolol, fluoxetine, diclofenac, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol exceeded existing or proposed Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) in over 50% of WwTWs. Dilution by receiving water might ensure compliance with EQSs for these chemicals, apart from the BDEs. However, in some cases there will be insufficient dilution to ensure compliance and additional management options may be required. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are among the most important antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicines. A simple and effective analytical method based on reversed-phased liquid chromatography with fluorescence was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of eight FQs in wastewater at trace level. Aqueous samples were extracted using Anpel (TM) MEP cartridges where they were subsequently eluted by formic acid in methanol. The aqueous extracts were analyzed by gradient elution Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (LC-FLD), whose mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and 10mM tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB). The limits of detection (LOD) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were as low as 0.11-1.06 mu g/L and 2-5%, respectively. The presented method was successfully applied to quantify FQs in the influent and effluent of several typical Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in Shanghai. For the extraction of 100mL influent and 500mL effluent sewage water samples, recoveries obtained were between 79-109% and 80%-105%, respectively. 7 FQs were occurred and identified in the STPs with the concentrations varying from 7 ng/L to 1 mu g/L. Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin were the most frequently detected antibiotics occurring in the wastewaters. The analytical procedure developed may be used for more in-depth studies on the occurrences and the fate of these commonly used pharmaceuticals in the sewage treatment plants and in the aquatic environment.

AB This study investigated the potential of biochar filters as a replacement or complement for sand filters for removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater in onsite sewage facilities (OSSF). Specifically, the study investigated the effects of biodegradation, adsorption and a combination of these processes on removal of four model PhACs from wastewater in biochar filters operated under hydraulic loading conditions mimicking those found in onsite infiltration beds. Concentrations and removal of the four PhACs (i.e. carbamazepine, metoprolol, ranitidine and caffeine) were investigated over 22 weeks in four treatments: biochar (BC) with active or inactive biofilm (BC-active-biofilm, BC-inactive-biofilm), biochar without biofilm (BC-no-biofilm) and sand with active biofilm (Sand-active-biofilm). The adsorption of carbamazepine was high in BC-no-biofilm (99% removal after 22 weeks), while biodegradation was very low in Sand-active-biofilm (7% removal after 22 weeks). Removal of carbamazepine in BC-active-biofilm was high and stable over the 22 weeks (>98%), showing a significant role of biofilm in filter biogeneration. However, carbamazepine removal declined over time in BC-inactive-biofilm, from 99% in week 13 to 73% in week 22. Metoprolol was poorly degraded in Sand-active-biofilm (37% after 22 weeks), while adsorption seemed to be the major pathway for removal of metoprolol in biochar. Ranitidine and caffeine were efficiently removed by either adsorption (97% and 9S%, respectively, after 22 weeks) or biodegradation (99% and >99%, respectively, after 22 weeks). In conclusion, biochar is a promising filter medium for OSSF, especially for persistent PhACs such as carbamazepine and metoprolol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB beta-Blockers are used to treat high blood pressure as well as patients recovering from heart attacks. In several studies, they were detected in surface water, thus indicating incomplete degradability of these substances in sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, we determined the sorption coefficients (K-D) and degradation rates of the four beta-blockers sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol in sludge from an STP operating with municipal wastewater.
   The sorption coefficients (K-D, standard deviations in brackets) were determined as 0.04(+/- 0.03S), 0.04(+/- 0.033), 0.00(+/- 0.023) and 0.32(+/- 0.058) L g(COD)(-1), and the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants were estimated to be 0.29(+/- 0.02), 0.69(+/- 0.05), 0.58(+/- 0.05) and 0.39(+/- 0.07) L d(-1) g(COD)(-1) for sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively.
   These values translate into a typical elimination in STPs (sludge concentrations of 4 g(COD) L-1 and a hydraulic retention time of 6h) of 25%, 37%, 44% and 50% for sotalol, propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol, respectively These results are also confirmed by measurements in two municipal STPs for atenolol, sotalol and propranolol. The estimated eliminations are slightly too high for metoprolol. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Xenobiotics such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals are an increasingly large problem in aquatic environments. A fixed-bed adsorption filter, used as tertiary stage of sewage treatment, could be a solution to decrease xenobiotics concentrations in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent. The adsorption efficiency of two mineral adsorbent materials (expanded clay (EC) and zeolite (ZE)), both seen as a possible alternative to activated carbon (AC), was evaluated in batch tests. Experiments involving secondary treated domestic wastewater spiked with a cocktail of ten xenobiotics (eight pharmaceuticals and two pesticides) known to be poorly eliminated in conventional biological process were carried out. Removal efficiencies and partitions coefficients were calculated for two levels of initial xenobiotic concentration, i.e, concentrations lower to 10 mu g/L and concentrations ranged from 100 to 1,000 mu g/L. While AC was the most efficient adsorbent material, both alternative adsorbent materials showed good adsorption efficiencies for all ten xenobiotics (from 50 to 100 % depending on the xenobiotic/adsorbent material pair). For all the targeted xenobiotics, at lower concentrations, EC presented the best adsorption potential with higher partition coefficients, confirming the results in terms of removal efficiencies. Nevertheless, Zeolite presents virtually the same adsorption potential for both high and low xenobiotics concentrations to be treated. According to this first batch investigation, ZE and EC could be used as alternative absorbent materials to AC in WWTP.

AB In the last years, the number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has increased and consequently, sewage sludge production. This residue is very rich in crop nutrients, which makes it prone to be used as organic fertilizer or soil conditioner for agriculture. However, the presence of emerging pollutants in these fertilizers has raised concern, namely their potential accumulation in soil and, eventually their uptake by crops. Therefore, the main goal of this work was to study the potential plant uptake and translocation of ultraviolet-filters (UVFs) and synthetic musk compounds (SMCs). A total of 6 UVFs and 11 SMCs were analysed in Micro-Tom tomatoes grown in soil amended with a commercial sewage sludge-based organic fertilizer. Most of the studied compounds were detected in the tomato fruit, in concentrations ranging from 5 to 147 ng g(-1) dw for UVFs and from 1.3 to 68 ng g(-1) dw for SMCs. This indicates a potential uptake of these emerging pollutants and a subsequent translocation to the fruits. Besides that, 1.11/Fs show bioconcentration factors (BCFs) from 3 (DTS) to 33 (BZ) and SMCs from 0.2 (AHTN) to 23 (HHCB). Nevertheless, no risk by ingestion was observed based on estimation of the weekly exposure dose through hazard quotients (HQ < 0.02). SMCs galaxolide and tonalide seem to pose risk to the amended soils. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seven mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) of different configurations were operated outdoors for nine months to assess their ability to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewaters. CWs differed in some design parameters, namely the presence of plants, the species chosen (i.e., Typha angustifolia vs Phragmites australis), flow configuration (i.e., surface flow vs subsurface flow) and the presence of a gravel bed. A nearby conventional activated-sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) fed with the same sewage was simultaneously monitored for comparison. The PPCPs ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate were monitored. The presence of plants favoured the removal of some PPCPs. The performance of the mesocosm studied was compound-dependant, soilless CWs showing the highest removal efficiency for ketoprofen, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, while free-water CWs with effluent leaving through the bottom of the tank performed well for the degradation of ketoprofen, salicylic acid, galaxolide and tonalide. Finally, subsurface horizontal flow CWs were efficient for the removal of caffeine. Significant linear correlations were observed between the removal of some PPCPs and temperature or redox potential. Hence, microbiological pathways appear to be the most probable degradation route for PPCPs in the CWs studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are a recently identified global threat to wildlife, including birds. Like other human pharmaceuticals, the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) enters the environment via sewage and has been detected at wastewater treatment plants. Birds foraging on invertebrates at these sites can be exposed to pharmaceuticals, although the implications of exposure are poorly understood. We conducted experiments to test whether chronic exposure to a maximally environmentally relevant concentration of fluoxetine (2.7 mu g day(-1)) altered courtship behaviour and female reproductive physiology in wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a species commonly found foraging on invertebrates at wastewater treatment plants. When paired with a female over two days, males sang less and were more aggressive towards fluoxetine-treated females than controls. Fluoxetine-treated females were initially aggressive towards males, becoming significantly less aggressive by the second day. In contrast, control females expressed intermediate levels of aggression throughout. We found no effect of female treatment on female courtship behaviour. Female body condition, circulating testosterone and circulating oestradiol were unaffected by treatment and did not account for male preference. Our findings suggest that exposure to an antidepressant reduced female attractiveness, adding to growing evidence that environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics.

AB The occurrence of 93 pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites has been investigated in stabilized sewage sludge from five municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Slovak Republic. The total population connected to the tested WWTPs was approximately 600,000 p.e. which represents >20% of the Slovak population connected to public sewer systems. The sludge production from the five tested plants was >8100 tons in 2016, which is approximately 15% of the total Slovak sewage sludge production in 2016.
   The highest total concentration of all pharmaceuticals was found in WWTP Bratislava Devinska NovasVes (DNV) and Senec - 11,800 and 11,300 ng/g dry matter (DM), respectively. Among individual pharmaceuticals, the highest concentrations were recorded for fexofenadine (mean 2340 ng/g DM, maximum 5600 ng/g DM in Bratislava DNV) and telmisartan (mean 1170 ng/g DM, with a maximum of 3370 ng/g DM in Senec). A principal component analysis revealed differences between pharmaceutical patterns in aerobically and anaerobically stabilized sludge.
   The worst-case scenario based on no further degradation of pharmaceuticals between sludge production and field application was used to predict pharmaceutical mass loads in agriculture. For the result, we estimated an annual load to soil in the Slovak Republic of up to several hundred kilograms of pharmaceuticals and drugs, with the maximum for fexofenadine (120 kg/year) and verapamil (29 kg/year).

AB Concern about the presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment from wastewater discharge is mounting. In this work, the occurrence and fate of atenolol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, and chloramphenicol, including 10 different stereoisomers, were investigated in sewage and sludge from diverse treatment processes in 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hong Kong via 4 sampling campaigns over a period of 2 years. The average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the STPs ranged from 4.91 g/d to 6290 g/d, with sludge carrying much lower amounts than the discharged effluent. Mass balance analysis revealed that: larger quantities of these pharmaceuticals were released during the dry seasons, biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for atenolol and chloramphenicol, and the removal via primary sedimentation and disinfection processes was insignificant (<30%). Selectivity toward R-(+)-atenolol, S-(-)-metoprolol, and R-(-)-venlafaxine was mostly found across secondary treated effluent samples. Sold as an enantiopure pharmaceutical in R,R-para-form, chloramphenicol was preferentially eliminated after biological process. This is the first study on the occurrence of chloramphenicol enantiomers in the aquatic environment. Ecotoxicological assessment indicated that atenolol and metoprolol could pose risks to marine fish in effluent-receiving waters (i.e., the western waters and Victoria Harbor) of Hong Kong, while R-(+)-atenolol could pose a risk to protozoans five times higher than the S-(-)-enantiomer.

AB This study provides an insight into the prevalence of (fluoro)quinolones (FQs) and their specific quinolone qnrS resistance gene in the Avon river catchment area receiving treated wastewater from 5 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), serving 1.5 million people and accounting for 75% of inhabitants living in the catchment area in the South West of England.. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin were found to be ubiquitous with daily loads reaching a few hundred g/day in wastewater influent and tens of g/day in receiving waters. This was in contrast to other FQs analysed: flumequine, nadifloxacin, lomefloxacin, ulifloxacin, prulifloxacin, besifloxacin and moxifloxacin, which were hardly quantified. Enantiomeric profiling revealed that ofloxacin was enriched with the S-(-)-enantiomer, likely deriving from its prescription as the more potent enantiomerically pure levofloxacin, alongside racemic ofloxacin. While ofloxacin's enantiomeric fraction (EF) remained constant, high stereoselectivity was observed in the case of its metabolite ofloxacin-N-oxide. The removal efficiency of quinolones during wastewater treatment at 5 WWTPs utilising either trickling filters (TF) or activated sludge (AS), was compound and wastewater treatment process dependent, with AS providing better efficiency than TF. The qnrS resistance gene was ubiquitous in wastewater. Its removal was WWTP treatment process dependent with TF performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene (from 28 to 75%). AS underperformed with only 9% removal in the case of activated sludge and actual increase in the gene copy number within sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). Interestingly, the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotics could be linked with high prevalence of the gene (SBR and WWTP E) and vice versa, low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent (TF, WWTP B and D). This is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that AS might be facilitating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prevalence to higher extent than TF. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was also applied to monitor any potential misuse (e.g. direct disposal) of FQs in the catchment. In most cases higher use of antibiotics with respect to official statistics (i.e. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) was observed, which suggests that FQs management practice require further attention.

AB The presence of sewage-borne micro contaminants in environmental waters is directly related to the discharge of treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the flow rate of the receiving river waters. Mediterranean rivers, in particular, are characterized by important fluctuations in the flow rates and heavy pollution pressures resulting from extensive urban, industrial and agricultural activities. This translates into contamination levels in these rivers often higher than those in other larger European basins. The present work provides an overview of the occurrence of five groups of organic contaminants (131 compounds) namely pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, polar pesticides, estrogens, alkylphenols and related ethoxylates in WWTP tertiary treatment effluents. Data gathered during a period of water reuse carried out in the lower stretch of the Llobregat river (NE Spain), in the surroundings of the town of Barcelona as a consequence of the severe drought that took place along the years 2007-2008 are presented as illustrative example. In general, measured concentrations of the target compounds were in the low to mid ng L-1 range. The total concentration of each compound class downstream to the discharge point was similar or slightly higher than that found upstream. Regarding the loads calculated for each compound, the relative contribution from the river upstream and the tertiary effluent were highly compound depending with no apparent trend. However, estimation of the overall bulk loads for each compound class determined in the Llobregat river showed the following rank order: pharmaceuticals > alkylphenols > pesticides > illicit drugs >> estrogens.

AB Sewage sludge disposal onto lands has been stabilized previously but still many pollutants are not efficiently removed. Special interest has been focused on pharmaceutical compounds due to their potential ecotoxicological effects. Nowadays, there is scarce information about their occurrence in different sludge stabilization treatments. In this work, the occurrence of twenty-two pharmaceutically active compounds has been studied in sludge from four sludge stabilization treatments: anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, composting and lagooning. The types of sludge evaluated were primary, secondary, anaerobically-digested and dehydrated, composted, mixed, aerobically-digested and dehydrated and lagoon sludge. Nineteen of the twenty-two pharmaceutically active compounds monitored were detected in sewage sludge. The most contaminated samples were primary sludge, secondary sludge and mixed sludge (the average concentrations of studied compounds in these sludges were 179,310 and 142 mu g/kg dm, respectively) while the mean concentrations found in the other types of sewage sludge were 70 mu g/lcg dm (aerobically-digested sludge), 63 mu g/kg dm (lagoon sludge), 12 mu g/kg dm (composted sludge) and 8 mu g/kg dm (anaerobically-digested sludge). The antibiotics ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were found at the highest concentration levels in most of the analyzed sludge samples (up to 2660 and 4328 mu g/kg dm, respectively). Anaerobic-digestion treatment reduced more considerably the concentration of most of the studied compounds than aerobic-digestion (especially in the case of bezafibrateand fluoroquinolones) and more than anaerobic stabilization ponds (in the case of acetaminophen, atenolol, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, naproxen and salicylic acid). Ecotoxicological risk assessment, of sludge application onto soils, has also been evaluated. Risk quotients, expressed as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration and the predicted non-effect concentration, were lower than 1 for all the pharmaceutically active compounds so no significant risks are expected to occur due to the application of sewage sludge onto soils, except for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol when chronic toxicity was considered.

AB Sewage-based epidemiology was applied for the first time to a number of mainland Chinese megacities. The application monitored influents to 9 sewage treatment plants (STPs) to estimate the use of illicit drugs in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. Altogether, 11.4 million inhabitants were covered during September-October 2012.24-h composite raw sewage samples were collected for 4 consecutive days at each STP. Each collected sample was analyzed for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methylester, methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethy1-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, ketamine, and norketamine. Through the analysis of these chemical residues, the use of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, mephedrone, methadone, methamphetamine, methylenedioxypyrovalerone and ketamine among Chinese urban inhabitants was monitored. The results obtained demonstrated in a quantitative way that the drug use patterns of Chinese are different from their European counterparts. Abuse of methamphetamine and ketamine was particularly noteworthy in China, while consumption of cocaine and ecstasy, the most popular drugs in Europe, was very low among the sampled Chinese inhabitants. Further, the use of most drugs demonstrated a geographical trend, since their use was much higher in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou than it was in Beijing and Shanghai. Interestingly, the exclusive, but minor, metabolite of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine, was detected only sporadically. This would suggest that the use of heroin among Chinese urban users sampled in the study was low. Further, the patterns of drug use observed during the study are largely consistent with trends reported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Overall, our study suggests that sewage-based epidemiology can readily be used to monitor the use of illicit drugs in those countries/regions where traditional means to monitor drug use patterns have only yielded limited or information of questionable reliability.

AB Sewage profiling as a mean to estimate consumption of drugs of abuse is gaining increasing attention. However, only scarce data are available so far on the impact of microbial biotransformation on the presence and hence detectability of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in wastewater (WW) samples. The aim of this work was therefore to study the biotransformation pathways of the novel psychoactive substance 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MPDV) in WW by incubating it, based on the OECD guideline 314 A. MDPV was incubated (100 mu g/L) for 10 d at 22 degrees C in WW from a local WW treatment plant. Furthermore, urine and feces collected from rats administered 20 mg MDPV/kg BW were incubated correspondingly. Samples were worked-up either by centrifugation/filtration and solid-phase (HEX) extraction or QuEChERS. High resolution (HR) mass spectra (MS) were recorded using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. All products were identified via their HR-MS2 spectra and chromatographic properties. The observed biotransformations in WW were: demethylenation and subsequent O-methylation, hydroxylation at the phenyl part, hydroxylation at the pyrrolidine part with subsequent methylation or oxidation, N-demethylation, and hydroxylation at the alkyl part as well as combination of them. In total, 12 biotransformation products were identified after 10 days of incubation. Three of these biotransformation products were previously reported to be also rat and human metabolites. No additional MDPV biotransformation products could be found after incubating the rat urine and feces samples. Instead, the urinary phase II glucuronides were nearly completely cleaved after one day of WW incubation. The presented study indicates that demethylenyl-methyl MDPV, the most abundant metabolite in human urine, should be the best indicator in WW to estimate its use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Concentrations of metabolites of illicit drugs in sewage water can be measured with great accuracy and precision, thanks to the development of sensitive and robust analytical methods. Based on assumptions about factors including the excretion profile of the parent drug, routes of administration and the number of individuals using the wastewater system, the level of consumption of a drug can be estimated from such measured concentrations. When presenting results from these 'back-calculations', the multiple sources of uncertainty are often discussed, but are not usually explicitly taken into account in the estimation process. In this paper we demonstrate how these calculations can be placed in a more formal statistical framework by assuming a distribution for each parameter involved, based on a review of the evidence underpinning it. Using a Monte Carlo simulations approach, it is then straightforward to propagate uncertainty in each parameter through the back-calculations, producing a distribution for instead of a single estimate of daily or average consumption. This can be summarised for example by a median and credible interval. To demonstrate this approach, we estimate cocaine consumption in a large urban UK population, using measured concentrations of two of its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and norbenzoylecgonine. We also demonstrate a more sophisticated analysis, implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our model allows the two metabolites to simultaneously inform estimates of daily cocaine consumption and explicitly allows for variability between days. After accounting for this variability, the resulting credible interval for average daily consumption is appropriately wider, representing additional uncertainty. We discuss possibilities for extensions to the model, and whether analysis of wastewater samples has potential to contribute to a prevalence model for illicit drug use. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB We employed a multi-tracer approach to investigate sources and pathways of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in urban groundwater, based on 53 groundwater samples taken from confined aquifers and unconfined aquifers in Tokyo. While the median concentrations of groundwater PFAAs were several ng/L, the maximum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, 990 ng/L), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 1800 ng/L) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA, 620 ng/L) in groundwater were several times higher than those of wastewater and street runoff reported in the literature. PFAAs were more frequently detected than sewage tracers (carbamazepine and crotamiton), presumably owing to the higher persistence of PFAAs, the multiple sources of PFAAs beyond sewage (e.g., surface runoff, point sources) and the formation of PFAAs from their precursors. Use of multiple methods of source apportionment including principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid ratio analysis highlighted sewage and point sources as the primary sources of PFAAs in the most severely polluted groundwater samples, with street runoff being a minor source (44.6% sewage, 45.7% point sources and 9.7% street runoff, by PCA-MLR). Tritium analysis indicated that, while young groundwater (recharged during or alter the 1970s, when PFAAs were already in commercial use) in shallow aquifers (<50 m depth) was naturally highly vulnerable to PFAA pollution, PFAAs were also found in old groundwater (recharged before the 1950s, when PFAAs were not in use) in deep aquifers (50-500 m depth). This study demonstrated the utility of multiple uses of tracers (pharmaceuticals and personal care products; PPCPs, tritium) and source apportionment methods in investigating sources and pathways of PFAAs in multiple aquifer systems.

AB The partitioning of pharmaceuticals in the environment can be assessed by measuring their adsorption coefficients (K-d) between aqueous and solid phases. Measuring this coefficient in sewage sludge gives an indication of their partitioning behaviour in a wastewater treatment plant and hence contributes to an understanding of their subsequent fate. The regulatory approved method for measuring K-d in sewage sludge is the US Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) guideline 835.1110, which is labour intensive and time consuming. We describe an alternative method for measuring the K-d of pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge using a modified solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique. SPE cartridges were packed at different sludge/PTFE ratios (0.4, 6.0, 24.0 and 40.0% w/w sludge) and eluted with phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The approach was tested initially using three pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, diclofenac and oxytetracycline) that covered a range of K values. Subsequently, the sorption behaviour of ten further pharmaceuticals with varying physico-chemical properties was evaluated. Results from the SPE method were comparable to those of the OPPTS test, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 between the two approaches. SPE cartridges packed with sludge and PTFE were stable for up to one year; use within one month reduced variability in measurements (to a maximum of 0.6 log units). The SPE method is low-cost, easy to use and enables the rapid measurement of K-d values for a large number of chemicals. It can be used as an alternative to the more laborious full OPPTS test in environmental fate studies and risk assessments. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present an assessment of the dynamics in the influent concentration of hormones (estrone, estriol) and antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin) in the liquid phase including the efficiency of biological municipal wastewater treatment. The concentration of estradiol, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, chlortetracycline, cefuroxime, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide were below the limit of detection in all of the sewage samples collected within this study. Two different types of diurnal variation pattern were identified in the influent mass loads of selected antibiotics and hormones that effectively correlate with daily drug administration patterns and with the expected maximum human hormone release, respectively. The occurrence of natural hormones and antimicrobials, administered every 12 hours, shows a daily trend of decreasing contaminant mass load, having the maximum values in the morning hours. The occurrence of antibiotics, typically administered every 8 hours, indicates a daily peak value in samples collected under the highest hydraulic loading. The efficiency of biological removal of both hormones and antibiotics is shown to be limited. Compared to the values obtained in the influent samples, increased concentrations are observed in the biologically treated effluent for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, mainly as a result of deconjugation processes. Ciprofloxacin is shown as the predominant antimicrobial compound in the effluent, and it is present at quantities approximately 10 fold greater than the total mass of the other of the compounds due to poor removal efficiency and alternating solid-liquid partitioning behaviour. Our results suggest that, to increase the micro-pollutant removal and the chemical dosing efficiency in enhanced tertiary treatment, significant benefits can be derived from the optimisation of reactor design and the development of control schemes that accounts for diurnal secondary effluent micro-pollutant and hydraulic loading patterns.

AB Reports concerning the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals in marine ecosystems are somewhat limited. It is necessary to determine pharmaceutical fate and assess any potential risk of exposure to aquatic species and ultimately, seafood consumers. In the work presented herein, analytical methods were optimised and validated for the quantification of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater effluent, receiving marine waters and marine mussels (Mytilus spp.). Selected pharmaceuticals included two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac and mefenamic acid), an antibiotic (trimethoprim), an antiepileptic (carbamazepine) and a lipid regulator (gemfibrozil). This paper also presents the results of an in situ study in which caged Mytilus spp. were deployed at three sites on the Irish coastline over a 1-year period. In water samples, pharmaceutical residues were determined using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extraction of pharmaceuticals from mussel tissues used an additional pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) step prior to SPE and LC-MS/MS. Limits of quantification between 15 and 225 ng.L-1 were achieved in wastewater effluent, between 3 and 38 ng.L-1 in marine surface water and between 4 and 29 ng.g(-1) dry weight in marine mussels. Method linearity was achieved for pharmaceuticals in each matrix with correlation coefficients of R-2 >= 0.976. All five selected pharmaceuticals were quantified in wastewater effluent and marine surface waters. This work has demonstrated the susceptibility of the Mytilus spp. to pharmaceutical exposure following the detection of pharmaceutical residues in the tissues of this mussel species at measurable concentrations.

AB The extent of prescription and illicit drug abuse in geographically isolated rural and micropoli tan communities i n the intermountain western United States (US) has not been well tracked. The goal of this pilot study was to accurately measure drug dose consumption rates (DCR) between two select populations, normalize the data and compare the DCRs to similar communities. To learn about patterns of drug abuse between the two disparate communities, we used the emergent field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A rapid, quantitative and systematic process for the determination of multiple classes of prescribed and illicit drugs was applied to influent wastewater samples. Influent samples were collected over the course of three months (April to June 2019) at two wastewater treatment plants representing a small urban and a rural community. Collection of sewage influent included 24-h composite samples and the use of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), time-weighted samplers. Using the results from the composite sampling data, DCRs per 1000 population could be calculated from the concentration data and the use of excretion correction factors. The following 18 compounds: amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, methadone, EDDP, codeine, benzoylecgonine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, noroxycodone, ketamine, fluoxetine, tramadol, and ritalinic add; represent a subset of the targeted analytes that were consistently measured at detectable concentration levels, and present at both sites. Following normalization of the drug measurements to influent flow rates and per capita, the small urban community demonstrated greater collective excretion rates (CER) than the rural community, with the exceptions of amphetamine and methamphetamine.

AB Seven commonly utilized antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion) and three of their metabolites were detected in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and corresponding receiving waters including the mainstream and three of the tributaries of Huangpu River, Shanghai. The concentration levels of selected antidepressants in wastewater and receiving water were both at ng L-1 level, but those antidepressants that were found in wastewater were typically in a range of one and even two orders of magnitude higher than those that were present in the receiving water except for the concentration levels of paroxetine, norfluoxetine, and nortriptyline. Venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine were the primary compounds (reaching up to 132.04 and 173.68 ng L-1 as well as 3.03 and 4.53 ng L-1 in wastewater and receiving water, respectively). Based on the mass loadings of selected antidepressants in four WWTPs, the mass loading of sertraline in effluent for this study was at the highest level when compared to other countries. The important finding was that the sampling sites H11 and H13 were much more likely to be polluted by side-pollution sources (the accumulation areas of Grade A of Class-three hospitals and pharmaceutical factories) than point pollution sources (WWTP 1 and WWTP2) through analysis of Spearman correlation. The results have shown that the RQs for these antidepressants were less than 0.1 except for the RQ of venlafaxine in an effluent for mollusks, which was less than 1. This indicated that the concentration levels of antidepressants would not pose a high risk for aquatic organisms, but sustained attention should still be paid.

AB Accurate data is needed to evaluate the capacity of wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) to remove contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The variability of CEC removals reported in the literature has raised questions about the methods used to estimate removals. In this study, we used the recently proposed "fractionated approach" to account for the influence of hydrodynamics in WWTPs and applied this method for estimating the removal of 23 target CECs. Data on the conductivity and temperature of wastewater at two WWTPs were used to determine the hydraulic model that best described the flow regime of treatment units. Composite samples (24-h) were collected at different stages of treatment over successive days. The concentrations of the target compounds in wastewater were determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Different hydraulic models were necessary to define the hydrodynamics at the two WWTPs, resulting in different load fractions to be used in the calculation of removals. For WWTP A, that has a primary clarifier, all target CECs, except triclosan, were poorly removed during this step at efficiencies <30%. On the other hand, the activated sludge treatment unit at both WWTPs removed most target CECs at >70%. This study expanded the application of the fractionated approach to compare the hydraulics of two treatment trains of different configurations, including primary and secondary treatment. It demonstrated the sensitivity of the method to account for variations between the different treatment units. Reliable removals of an extended list of CECs in primary and secondary treatment were also provided in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from wastewater using conventional treatment technologies and there is limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs. In this study, we used the "fractionated approach" that accounts for the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate the fate of 26 target CECs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that includes primary, secondary and tertiary treatment steps. Prior, hydraulic calibration of each treatment unit was performed. Wastewater and sludge samples were collected at different locations along the treatment train and the concentrations of target CECs were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The most substantial aqueous removal occurred during activated sludge treatment (up to 99%). Removals were <50% in the primary clarifier and tertiary rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and up to 70% by sand filtration. Mass balance calculations demonstrated that (bio)degradation accounted for up to 50% of the removal in the primary clarifier and 100% in activated sludge. Removal by sorption to primary and secondary sludge was minimal for most CECs. Analysis of the selected metabolites demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and secondary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The monitoring of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has focused on the distribution in rivers and small lakes, but data regarding their occurrence and effects in large lake systems, such as the Great Lakes, are sparse. Wastewater treatment processes have not been optimized to remove influent PPCPs and are a major source of PPCPs in the environment. Furthermore, PPCPs are not currently regulated in wastewater effluent. In this experiment we evaluated the concentration, and corresponding risk, of PPCPs from a wastewater effluent source at varying distances in Lake Michigan. Fifty-four PPCPs and hormones were assessed on six different dates over a two-year period from surface water and sediment samples up to 3.2 km from a wastewater treatment plant and at two sites within a harbor. Thirty-two PPCPs were detected in Lake Michigan and 30 were detected in the sediment, with numerous PPCPs being detected up to 3.2 km away from the shoreline. The most frequently detected PPCPs in Lake Michigan were metformin, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan. To determine the ecological risk, the maximum measured environmental concentrations were compared to the predicted no-effect concentration and 14 PPCPs were found to be of medium or high ecological risk. The environmental risk of PPCPs in large lake systems, such as the Great Lakes, has been questioned due to high dilution; however, the concentrations found in this study, and their corresponding risk quotient, indicate a significant threat by PPCPs to the health of the Great Lakes, particularly near shore organisms.

AB Triclosan, gemfibrozil and galaxolide, representing acidic and non-ionized hydrophobic organic compounds, are biologically active and can be accumulated during wastewater treatment in sewage sludge. The interactions of these substances with the soils amended by sewage sludge-originating biosolids may control their environmental fate. Therefore, the sorption of three organic compounds was studied in dune sand, loess soil, clay soil and mixtures of these media with three different sewage sludge-originating biosolids that were incubated under aerobic conditions for 6 months. For each compound, 15 sorption isotherms were produced at pH 7.8-8.0. The sorption of triclosan and gemfibrozil on sand-containing sorbents was examined also under acidic conditions. In some soil series, the compound's Freundlich constants (K-F) are linearly related to the soil organic carbon (OC) content. Notably, for a given OC content, the sand-containing sorbents tend to demonstrate enhanced interactions with triclosan and galaxolide. This may be related with more hydrophobic and/or less rigid soil organic matter (SUM) as compared with the clay-containing soils, implying indirect effects of minerals. Generally the OC-normalized K-F vary among different soil-biosolid combinations which is explained by the differences in the composition and properties of SOM, and is also contributed by the non-zero intercepts of the linear KF upon soil OC dependencies. The negative intercepts suggest that below a certain OC level no considerable organic compound-soil interactions would occur. Interactions of molecular and anionic forms of triclosan with a sand-containing sorbent may be comparable, but interactions involving gemfibrozil molecules could be stronger than interactions involving its anion.

AB Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were placed at two wastewater treatment plants, where they were constantly fed with effluent and intermittently fed with primary wastewater. Each reactor was subjected to different feast/famine periods and flow rates of primary wastewater, thus the different organic and nutrient loads (chemical oxygen demand(COD), ammonium(NH4-N)) resulted in different feast-famine conditions applied to the biomass. In batch experiments, this study investigated the effects of various feast-famine conditions on the biodegradation of micropollutants by MBBRs applied as an effluent polishing step. Rate constants of micropollutant removals were found to be positively correlated to the load of the total COD and NH4-N, indicating that higher organic loads were favourable for the growth of micropollutant degraders in these MBBRs. Rate constant of atenolol was five times higher when the biomass was fed with the highest COD and NH4-N load than it was fed with the lowest COD and NH4-N load. For diclofenac, mycophenolic acid and iohexol, their maximum rate constants were obtained with feeding of COD and NH4-N of approximately 570 mgCOD/d and 40-60 mgNH4N/d respectively. This also supports the concept that co-metabolism (rather competition inhibition or catabolic repression) plays an important role in micropollutants biodegradation in wastewater.

AB The presence of five different pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, was determined in influent and effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) near the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland, and in the receiving water, northern Lake Paijanne. In addition, samples of sedimented particles were collected among water samples from five locations near the discharge point of the treated wastewater. The solid phase extracts (SPEs) of water samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The studied pharmaceuticals were detected from influent, effluent, and lake water but also in the sedimented particles. The concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in Lake Paijanne ranged from 1 to 21 ng L-1, 4 to 209 ng L-1, 5 to 836 ng L-1, 9 to 952 ng L-1, and 2 to 129 ng L-1, respectively. The concentrations of ketoprofen in sedimented particles ranged from 79 to 135 mu g g(-1) while only trace amounts of other selected pharmaceuticals were detected. The results indicate that the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are affected by the biological and chemical reactions occurring in the wastewater treatment processes but also by the UV light in the photic layer of Lake Paijanne. It can be concluded that considerable amount of selected pharmaceuticals are present in the influent and effluent of municipal WWTP but also in the water phase and sedimented particles of northern Lake Paijanne.

AB This study aimed to investigate the antibiotic concentration at each stage of treatment and to evaluate the removal efficiency of antibiotics in different types of secondary and advanced treatment, as well as the effects of the location of their discharge points on the occurrence of antibiotics in surface water. Eight target antibiotics and four hospital wastewater treatment plants in Bangkok with different conventional and advanced treatment options were investigated. Antibiotics were extracted by solid phase extraction and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The antibiotic with the highest concentration at influent was cefazolin at 13,166 ng/L, while the antibiotic with the highest concentration at effluent was sulfamethoxazole at 1,499 ng/L. The removal efficiency of antibiotics from lowest to highest was sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, dicloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and cefalexin. The adopted conventional treatment systems could not completely remove all antibiotics from wastewater. However, using advanced treatments or disinfection units such as chlorination and UV could increase the antibiotic removal efficiency. Chlorination was more effective than UV, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole concentration fluctuated during the treatment process, and sulfamethoxazole was the most difficult to remove. Both these antibiotics should be studied further regarding their contamination in sludge and suitable treatment options for their removal.

AB This work examined the sorption potential to wastewater primary- and activated-sludge solids for 34 emerging trace organic chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations. These compounds represent a diverse range of physical and chemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and charge state, and a diverse range of classes, including steroidal hormones, pharmaceutically-active compounds, personal care products, and household chemicals. Solid-water partitioning coefficients (K-d) were measured where 19 chemicals did not have previously reported values. Sludge solids were inactivated by a nonchemical lyophilization and dry-heat technique, which provided similar sorption behavior for recalcitrant compounds as compared to fresh activated-sludge. Sorption behavior was similar between primary- and activated-sludge solids from the same plant and between activated-sludge solids from two nitrified processes from different wastewater treatment systems. Positively-charged pharmaceutically-active compounds, amitriptyline, clozapine, verapamil, risperidone, and hydroxyzine, had the highest sorption potential, log K-d = 2.8-3.8 as compared to the neutral and negatively-charged chemicals. Sorption potentials correlated with a compound's hydrophobicity, however the higher sorption potentials observed for positively-charged compounds for a given log D-ow indicate additional sorption mechanisms, such as electrostatic interactions, are important for these compounds. Previously published soil-based one-parameter models for predicting sorption from hydrophobicity (log K-ow > 2) can be used to predict sorption for emerging nonionic compounds to wastewater sludge solids.

AB Emerging organic contaminants in wastewater are usually analyzed by targeted approaches, and especially estrogens have been the focus of environmental research due to their high hormonal activity. The selection of specific target compounds means, however, that most of the sample components, including transformation products and potential new contaminants, are neglected. In this study, the fate of steroidal compounds in wastewater treatment processes was evaluated by a nontargeted approach based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The potential of the nontargeted approach to generate comprehensive information about sample constituents was demonstrated with use of statistical tools. Transformation pathways of the tentatively identified compounds with steroidal four-ring structure were proposed. The purification efficiency of the wastewater treatment plants was studied, and the distribution of the compounds of interest in the suspended solids, effluent water, and sludge was measured. The results showed that, owing to strong adsorption of hydrophobic compounds onto the solid matter, the steroids were mostly bound to the suspended solids of the effluent water and the sewage sludge at the end of the treatment process. The most abundant steroid class was androstanes in the aqueous phase and cholestanes in the solid phase. 17 beta-estradiol was the most abundant estrogen in the aqueous phase, but it was only detected in the influent samples indicating efficient removal during the treatment process. In the sludge samples, however, high concentrations of an oxidation product of 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, were measured.

AB Conventional active sludge (AS) process atmunicipal centralized wastewater treatment facilities may exhibit little pharmaceuticals (PhACs) removal efficiencies when treating hospital wastewater (HWW). Therefore, a dedicated efficient wastewater treatment at the source point is recommended. In this sense, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and fungal treatment (FG) have evidenced promising results in degrading PhACs. The coupling of the AOP based on UV/H2O2 treatment with biological treatment (AS or FG) treating a real non-sterile HWW, was evaluated in this work. In addition, a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment was applied to improve the efficiency of all approaches. Twenty-two PhACs were detected in raw HWW, which were effectively removed (93-95%) with the combination of any of the biological treatment followed by UV/H2O2 treatment. Similar removal results (94%) were obtained when placing UV/H2O2 treatment before FG, while a lower removal (83%) was obtained in the combination of UV/H2O2 followed by AS. However, the latestwas the only treatment combination that achieved a decrease in the toxicity of water.Moreover, deconjugation of conjugated PhACs has been suggested for ofloxacin and lorazepam after AS treatment, and for ketoprofen after fungal treatment. Monitoring of carbamazepine and its transformation products along the treatment allowed to identify the same carbamazepine degradation pathway in UV/H2O2 and AS treatments, unlike fungal treatment, which followed another degradation route.

AB Acetaminophen (ACT) is commonly used as a counter painkiller and nowadays, it is increasingly present in the natural water environment. Although its concentrations are usually at the ppt to ppm levels, ACT can transform into various intermediates depending on the environmental conditions. Due to the complexity of the ACT degradation products and the intermediates, it poses a major challenge for monitoring, detection and to propose adequate treatment technologies. The main objectives of this review study were to assess (i) the occurrences and toxicities, (2) the removal technologies and (3) the transformation pathways and intermediates of ACT in four environmental compartments namely wastewater, surface water, ground water, and soil/sediments. Based on the review, it was observed that the ACT concentrations in wastewater can reach up to several hundreds of ppb. Amongst the different countries, China and the USA showed the highest ACT concentration in wastewater (<= 300 mu g/L), with a very high detection frequency (81-100%). Concerning surface water, the ACT concentrations were found to be at the ppt level. Some regions in France, Spain, Germany, Korea, USA, and UK comply with the recommended ACT concentration for drinking water (71 ng/L). Notably, ACT can transform and degrade into various metabolites such as aromatic derivatives or organic acids. Some of them (e.g., hydroquinone and benzoquinone) are toxic to human and other life forms. Thus, in water and wastewater treatment plants, tertiary treatment systems such as advanced oxidation, membrane separation, and hybrid processes should be used to remove the toxic metabolites of ACT.

AB The high consumption of blood lipid regulators is leading to frequent reports of the occurrence of fibrates in natural streams and wastewater effluents. This paper describes a study undertaken to evaluate the acute toxicity of bezafibrate, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, and fenofibric acid, a metabolite of fenofibrate whose ecotoxicity has not been previously reported.
   The bioassays used were based on Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna, and Anabaena CPB4337 tests. Anabaena CPB4337 is a novel bioassay based on Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 strain CPB4337 bearing in the chromosome a Tn5 derivative with luxCDABE from the luminescent terrestrial bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.
   The higher toxicity corresponded to fenofibric acid, with EC50 as low as 1.72 mg/l for V. fischeri. Gemfibrozil was also toxic for Anabaena sp. with EC50 of 4.42 mg/l. The study reports the results from toxicity tests using fortified real wastewater samples taken from the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater itself was found to be very toxic to Anabaena CPB4337 (84% of bioluminescence inhibition) whereas it did not have any negative effect on D. magna or V. fischeri. On the contrary, V. fischeri luminescence exhibited a stimulatory effect in wastewater.
   Except for fenofibric acid, the Anabaena bioassay was more sensitive than the D. magna and V. fischeri bioassays to bezafibrate, clofibric acid, and gemfibrozil. For the three toxicity tests, fortification resulted in lower measured toxicity for the four compounds, probably indicating a reduced bioavailability due to the interaction with other chemicals in the wastewater or with particulate matter. The observed decrease in toxicity associated to the use of a wastewater matrix was higher for the more hydrophobic compounds reaching one order of magnitude for bezafibrate and gemfibrozil.
   The Anabaena CPB4337 bioassay revealed a certain risk associated with the three less toxic compounds tested. Based on V. fischeri and D. magna bioassays, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil would have been considered non-toxic and harmful, respectively. The use of EC50 data measured in wastewater increases the risk estimation.
   Cyanobacteria, as primary producers with a key role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, are a substantial component of the microbial food webs. Any detrimental effect on this group may have a negative impact in nutrient availability to organisms of higher trophic levels and should be considered in ecotoxicity assessment tests.

AB This paper reports on a comprehensive reconnaissance of over seventy individual wastewater contaminants in the region of Western Balkan (WB; Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia), including some prominent classes of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, surfactants and their degradation products, plasticizers, pesticides, insect repellents, and flame retardants. All determinations were carried out using a multiresidue analytical approach, based on the application of gas chromatographic and liquid chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometric detection. The results confirmed a widespread occurrence of the emerging contaminants in municipal wastewaters of the region. The most prominent contaminant classes, determined in municipal wastewaters, were those derived from aromatic surfactants, including linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) and alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO), with the concentrations in raw wastewater reaching into the mg/l range. All other contaminants were present in much lower concentrations, rarely exceeding few mu g/l. The most abundant individual compounds belonged to several classes of pharmaceuticals (antimicrobials, analgesics and and inflammatories, beta-blockers and lipid regulators) and personal care products (fragrances). Due to the rather poor wastewater management practices in WB countries, with less than 5% of all wastewaters being biologically treated, most of the contaminants present in wastewaters reach ambient waters and may represent a significant environmental concern.

AB Presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment has received a great attention due to their potential impacts on public health. This study examined the occurrence of PPCPs in West Prong Little Pigeon River in east Tennessee. As wastewater is a major source for environmental occurrence of PPCPs, both wastewater and river water samples were analyzed for nine target PPCPs and their estrogenicity. No estrogens were detected in influent, secondary effluent, and river samples. However, ibuprofen, caffeine, triclosan, bisphenol A, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in the influent. Ibuprofen, triclosan, and DEHP were detected in the secondary effluent samples. Only ibuprofen and triclosan were detected in river water collected near a wastewater outfall. Based on yeast estrogenic screening (YES) assays, estrogenic activities were observed in all influent, secondary effluent, and river water samples. Increased estrogenic activities were observed in river right after receiving effluent discharge, and the activities decreased as river water flowing away from the outfall. The estrogenicities of water samples measured from YES assays were much higher than those estimated from PPCP concentrations and their known estrogenicities, suggesting the presence of other unknown estrogenic compounds and/or additive effects of mixtures of estrogenic compounds at low concentrations. Results of this study demonstrated that wastewater contributed to environmental occurrence of PPCPs in the receiving water. As there is a myriad of known and unknown PPCPs in wastewater, in additional to chemical analysis, estrogenic bioassays are needed for assessing estrogenicity of environmental samples.

AB Occurrence of eleven pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) along Huangpu River, a representative urban river of megacity Shanghai, was investigated in four sampling campaigns. The overall concentrations of PPCPs ranged from < LOQ to 1455 ng/L, and untreated domestic wastewater was proposed as an important source of PPCPs in Huangpu River. Higher contamination levels of target PPCPs were detected in the lower reach (urban area) and dry season, compared to those in the upper reach (rural area) and wet season, respectively. The influence of rainfall on the occurrence of PPCPs was also extensively discussed in different regions along Huangpu River. At sampling sites in the rural area, similar or even lower concentrations of PPCPs were detected after rainfall; while increased concentrations of PPCPs were observed at most sampling sites, especially in the urban area, suggesting that overflow of untreated wastewater exceeding the capacity of wastewater treatment plants and leachates generated at temporary storage and transfer station of solid wastes might be the additional sources of PPCPs in the urban area in rainy days. These findings indicated that management of wastewater or/and solid wastes was more important to solve the problem of PPCPs contamination in the urban river of megacity.

AB Analysis of wastewater with an aim of community-wide estimation of drug use is a new and very promising approach. Until now it was very difficult to determine if mass loads of studied drugs were actually originating from consumption, or disposal of unused drugs or production waste. This uncertainty in the estimation of community wide drugs use should not be underestimated. This paper aims to apply for the first time enantiomeric profiling in verifying sources of the presence of MDMA and amphetamine in wastewater based on a case study in two Dutch cities: Utrecht and Eindhoven. The results showed that MDMA is usually present in wastewater due to its consumption (MDMA enriched with R(-)-enantiomer). Excessively high mass loads of MDMA during a sampling campaign in Utrecht in 2011 proved to be racemic indicating direct disposal of unused MDMA possibly as a result of a police raid at a nearby illegal production facility. Enantiomeric profiling was also undertaken in order to verify the origin of unexpectedly high mass loads of amphetamine in the city of Eindhoven in 2011. Unfortunately, a distinction between consumption and direct disposal of unused amphetamine in Dutch wastewater could not be achieved. Further work will have to be undertaken to fully understand sources of amphetamine in Dutch wastewaters. Crown Copyright 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of waters of impaired quality has been suggested as a means to expand available water resources supply for water-limited communities. An ongoing concern is the safety of supplies that use wastewater because of the potential for introduction of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals into drinking water supplies. Prior research into contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) have included a variety of methods, but the only consistent removal is with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, ultraviolet light (UV), and advanced oxidation processes (AOP). However, few of these prior studies have measurable quantities of these contaminants in the influent wastewater, so determining actual removal percentages is difficult. This project was designed to evaluate the removal of CECs to verify that a 3-log removal of common constituents was realized. Spike testing was used to compare to prior research and to evaluate whether the project costs were competitive with other forms of reuse or other water supplies. The combination of RO/UV/AOP was effective at obtaining a 3-log removal of CECs, but the RO and UV/AOP processes alone were not capable of removing all substances. However, despite the extensive treatment, the proposed process was both competitive cost-wise and met the water quality goals.

AB The mass load of pharmaceuticals in the municipal wastewater based on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a good indication of population consumption in the catchment. After successful application of illicit drugs' estimation, this method holds the potential to measure the geographical and temporal consumption of prescription medicines. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen (ACM), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU) and naproxen (NPX), in two wastewater treatment plants in Guangzhou City, China and compared the spatial and temporal consumption variation of them. Over a period of 28 days' sampling, the detection frequency of ACM, DCF, IBU, and NPX in the influent of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Guangzhou City were 91%, 66%, 100%, and 95%, and their concentrations were up to 128, 131, 372, and 324 ng/L, respectively. No significant inter-catchment difference was observed regarding the per capita mass load in the two WWTPs investigated. A literature review which covered 160 WWTPs in 18 countries was conducted to compare the population normalized mass load of four commonly used NSAIDs. ACM had the highest population normalized mass loads (29-17,430 mg/d/1000 inhabitants) and DCF had the lowest population normalized mass load (6.5-628 mg/d/1000 inhabitants) in the catchments located in 18 countries. The mass loads of selected NSAIDs in China were lower than those in European and North American. ACM and IBU consumptions were at least 2 times higher in winter than that in summer, in contrast, DCF and NPX consumptions had no significant seasonal variation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB When assessing the environmental exposure of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the mass contributed from over the counter (OTC) sales are often not included due to difficulty obtaining this data and topical formats are overlooked completely. This study presents a comprehensive approach, investigating the significance of OTC and topical applications as sources of API releases to wastewater, in addition to temporal and subnational variations in use in the UK. The study provides methods to obtain and make use of OTC sales data which can be applied widely. The calculated releases to wastewater compared well with influent concentrations measured at several UK wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Consistent overestimation was observed, attributed to a number of factors, including in-sewer removal. OTC sales were found to make up a large proportion of the mass of ibuprofen (76%) and diclofenac (35%) consumed and topical formats were also found to be vital, contributing disproportionately to wastewater loadings per unit mass of ibuprofen and diclofenac used (43% and 99% of the total mass released, respectively). Releases of the APIs investigated did not vary temporally, but regional variation was significant and where possible should be considered for the most accurate exposure assessment of pharmaceuticals.

AB The presence of four phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs: nonylphenol [NP], NP monoethoxylate[NP1EO], bisphenol A [BPA], triclosan, [TCS]) and four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs: ibuprofen[IBF], ketoprofen [KFN], naproxen [NPX], diclofenac [DCF]) in a Greek river receiving treated municipal wastewater was investigated in this study.
   Samples were taken from four different points of the river and from the outlet of a sewage treatment plant (STP) during six sampling campaigns, and they were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   According to the results, EDCs were detected in almost all samples, whereas NSAIDs were detected mainly in wastewater and in the part of the river that receives wastewater from the STP. Among the target compounds, the highest mean concentrations in the river were detected for NP (1,345 ng L-1) and DCF (432 ng L-1). Calculation of daily loads of the target compounds showed that STP seems to be the major source of NSAIDs to the river, whereas other sources contribute significantly to the occurrence of EDCs. The environmental risk due to the presence of target compounds in river water was estimated, calculating risk quotients for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids, and fish). Results denoted the possible threat for the aquatic environment due to the presence of NP and TCS in the river.

AB The polycyclic musk fragrances AHTN (Tonalide) and HHCB (Galaxolide) are the most common components of cosmetics and detergents. Use of AHTN and HHCB per year (in the USA and in EU) was estimated at 1500 Mg and 3800 Mg, respectively. Because of their persistent character, musk compounds are introduced into environment mostly via urban sewage treatment plant effluents. The aim of the presented research was to assess the receptivity of AHTN and HHCB to the oxidation by means of UV-radiation and in the UV/H2O2 process. The investigations were performed in the treated wastewater and the drinking water. After 8 minutes, in all experiments performed on drinking water, the degradations of AHTN and HHCB in the range of 99% were observed. The removal of HHCB from wastewater by means of UV radiation exceeded up 93% (after 8 minutes of the process), whereas the disappearance degree of this compound in wastewater, after only 3 minutes of UV/H2O2 process, exceeded 99%. The degradation constant rate for AHTN in drinking water using UV radiation was equal to 0.764 min(-1) when the degradation rate of HHCB was estimated at 0.634 min(-1). In the wastewater, the coefficient rate of HHCB degradation by means of UV/H2O2 was nearly 4.5 times higher (1.580 min(-1)) in comparison to tile value obtained by direct photolysis of HHCB (0.354 min(-1)).

AB Current wastewater treatment processes are insufficient at removing many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater and it is necessary to identify the chemical characteristics that determine their fate. Models that predict the fate of various chemicals lack verification using in situ data, particularly for PPCPs. BIOWIN4 is a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model that has been proposed to estimate the removal of PPCPs from wastewater, but data verifying the accuracy of its predictions is limited. In this study, the in situ soluble and suspended solid concentrations were assessed from raw influent, primary effluent, secondary effluent, and final effluent for 54 PPCPs and hormones over six dates. When assessing the removal efficiency across the different stages of the WWTP, the majority of the removal occurred across the secondary treatment process for the majority of the compounds. The primary treatment and disinfection process had limited impacts on the removal of most PPCPs. Sorption to solids was found to influence the removal for compounds with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient greater than 4.5 across the secondary treatment process. For other compounds, the removal of PPCPs across the secondary treatment process was significantly correlated with the biodegradation predicted by BIOWIN4. Removal efficiencies across the aerobic secondary treatment process were predicted by integrating BIOWIN4 into pseudo-first order kinetics of PPCPs and these predicted values were compared to the in situ data. This study determines that under a certain set of operating conditions, two chemical characteristics the expected hydrophobic interaction and the modeled biological degradation from BIOWIN4 were found to predict the removal of highly degradable and recalcitrant PPCPs from a wastewater secondary treatment process.

AB High global consumption rates have led to the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. The use of chlorine to disinfect wastewater prior to release into the environment may convert PhACs into uncharacterized chlorinated by-products. In this investigation, chlorination of a common pharmaceutical, the antihyperlipidemic agent gemfibrozil, was documented. Gemfibrozil (2,2-dimethyl-5-(2,5-dimethylphenoxy)pentanoic acid) was reacted with sodium hypochlorite and product formation was monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The incorporation of one, two or three chlorine atoms into the aromatic region of gemfibrozil was demonstrated using negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Further analysis using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy identified the reaction products as 4'-ClGem (5-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid) 4',6'-diClGem (5-(4,6-dichloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid), and 3',4',6'-triClGem (5-(3,4,6-trichloro-2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid), products consistent with electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The rapid reaction of gemfibrozil with free chlorine at pH conditions relevant to water treatment indicates that a mixture of chlorinated gemfibrozils is likely to be found in wastewater disinfected with chlorine.

AB We selected 14 anthropogenic organic compounds representing major classes of potential contaminants for analysis to determine their occurrence in the South Saskatchewan River and its tributaries near irrigated farmland and the only urban center in southeast Alberta, Canada. Agriculture and urban runoff and discharges seem to have little impact on the quality of surface water based on samples taken above and below Medicine Hat/Redcliff in the South Saskatchewan River and local tributaries. Samples of river water, tributary water, and raw and treated wastewater taken over a period of 3 years allowed an estimation of the impact of trace organic compounds from urban and agricultural activities on water quality. Of the 14 compounds investigated, 10 were detected in concentrations above the detection limit in at least one surface water sample and 9 at concentrations above the detection limit in sewage samples. The wastewater treatment plant removed indicator compounds to varying degrees, and the volume of treated effluent discharge was <1% of the river, even during the lowest flow conditions, thereby minimizing potential impact. Discharge in the river and tributaries varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study, including 2 major flood events in the South Saskatchewan River. Potential health or environmental effects were difficult to evaluate from a regulatory perspective because few guidelines are available for reference.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have emerged as a group of potential environmental contaminants of concern. The occurrence of gemfibrozil, a lipid-regulating drug, was studied in the influent and effluent at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and groundwater below a land application site receiving treated effluent from the WWTP. In addition, the sorption of gemfibrozil in two loam soils and sand was assessed, and biological degradation rates in two soil types under aerobic conditions were also determined. Results showed that concentrations of gemfibrozil in wastewater influent, effluent, and groundwater were in the range of 3.47 to 63.8 mu g/L, 0.08 to 19.4 mu g/L, and undetectable to 6.86 mu g/L, respectively. Data also indicated that gemfibrozil in the wastewater could reach groundwater following land application of the treated effluent. Soilwater distribution coefficients for gemfibrozil, determined by the batch equilibrium method, varied with organic carbon content in the soils. The sorption capacity was silt loam>sandy loam>sand. Under aerobic conditions, dissipation half-lives for gemfibrozil in sandy loam and silt loam soils were 17.8 and 20.6 days, respectively; 25.4 and 11.3% of gemfibrozil was lost through biodegradation from the two soils over 14 days.

AB 11-Nor-9-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) is commonly selected as biomarker for the investigation of cannabis consumption through wastewater analysis. The removal efficiency of THC-COOH in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been reported to vary between 31% and 98%. Accordingly, possible transformation products (TPs) of this metabolite might be formed during treatment processes or in receiving surface water under environmental conditions. In this work, surface water was spiked with THC-COOH and subjected to hydrolysis, chlorination and photo-degradation (both ultraviolet and simulated sunlight) experiments under laboratory-controlled conditions. One hydrolysis, eight chlorination, three ultraviolet photo-degradation and seven sunlight photo-degradation TPs were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QTOF MS). In a subsequent step, THC-COOH and the identified TPs were searched in wastewater samples using LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with triple quadrupole. THC-COOH was found in all influent and effluent wastewater samples analyzed, although at significant lower concentrations in the effluent samples. The removal efficiency of WWTP under study was approximately 86%. Furthermore, THC-COOH was also investigated in several surface waters, and it was detected in 50% of the samples analyzed. Regarding TPs, none were found in influent wastewater, while one hydrolysis and five photo-degradation (simulated sunlight) TPs were detected in effluent and surface waters. The most detected compound, resulting from sunlight photo-degradation, was found in 60% of surface waters analyzed. This fact illustrates the importance of investigating these TPs in the aquatic environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an emerging field that has mostly been applied to investigate consumption of illicit drugs. In this study, the wastewater-based epidemiology approach was employed to study consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and measure their prevalence of use in eight densely populated, urban areas of Beijing, China. Ammonium loads were used to estimate the population equivalents of each sewershed. These estimates were applied to calculate population-normalized antibiotic consumption and prevalence of use during flu season, when antibiotics are frequently misused as a medical treatment. Results indicated that 21.9 g d(-1) (10(4) people)(-1) of ten popular antibiotics were consumed across the eight sewersheds, indicating that 1.98% of the 12.5 million population equivalents used these antibiotics during the sampling period. A comparison of these results to calculations made using previously reported data from 2013 suggest that recent Chinese antibiotic control policies have been effective. Uncertainty analyses were conducted to identify the 95% confidence range for antibiotic prevalence of use as 1.44-3.61%. Human excretion factors were identified as the most sensitive variable. The wastewater-based epidemiology methods were also applied to a wider range of PPCPs, and the results indicated positive relationships between consumption and socioeconomic factors, such as housing price and population density. Overall, this work provides important public health information on antibiotic use and elucidates relationships between PPCP consumption and socioeconomic characteristics.

AB A fourteen-month monitoring period (April 2007May 2008) was realized to investigate the removal and occurrence of eight pharmaceutical and personal care compounds, two metabolites and caffeine across the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Agrinio city, located in Western Greece as well as in the discharging sampling point in Acheloos River, which receives the effluents of the plant. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target pollutants and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) for their detection and quantification. All the selected compounds were detected in the wastewater samples. The concentrations determined in the influent of the municipal WWTP ranged between 65.3 and 6679ng L-1 recorded for triclosan and caffeine respectively, while in the effluent ranged between 24.9 and 552ng L-1 observed for triclosan and carbamazepine, respectively. The detected concentration levels in Acheloos River ranged from 37.6ng L-1 for caffeine to 305ng L-1 for paracetamol. Mean total removal efficiencies ranged between 46.3% for carbamazepine and 96.8% for naproxen. The results of this study demonstrate that most of the compounds are being reduced in low levels by municipal wastewater treatment processes but quite significant levels of pharmaceuticals enter river waterways.

AB Selected pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, antipyretics, a stimulant, an antiepileptic and an antipsychotic drug were determined in wastewater, surface water and sediment along the Umgeni River which is the main source of water to Durban City in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS) after clean up and pre-concentration by solid phase extraction (SPE). At the wastewater treatment plant outlet, the antipyretic ibuprofen was detected in concentrations up to 12.94 mu g/L and 15.96 ng/g in wastewater and bio-solids, respectively. The antipsychotic clozapine was detected in concentrations up to 14.43 mu g/L and 18.75 ng/g in wastewater and bio-solids, respectively. Other pharmaceuticals namely sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim, acetaminophen, caffeine and carbamazepine were also detected but in lower concentration compared to clozapine and ibuprofen (<10 mu g/L or 10 ng/g). Clozapine and ibuprofen were detected at high concentrations in the surface water and sediment of Umgeni River. The highest concentration of clozapine (78.33 mu g/L) was detected at the business park, while that for ibuprofen (62.0 mu g/L) was detected at the point where a tributary, Msunduzi, joins Umgeni. Metronidazole was only detected in sediment, and caffeine (2243.52 ng/g) was detected at the highest concentration in the sediment at the blue lagoon sampling site. The antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was also detected in appreciable amounts up to 507.34 ng/g in the sediment at the Msunduzi tributary sampling site. The data collected implies that while insufficiently treated wastewater contributes to surface water contamination, human activities also contribute appreciably to the pharmaceutical loading of River Umgeni.

AB The reuse of wastewater for irrigation of agricultural land is a well established practice but introduces many contaminants into the terrestrial environment including pharmaceuticals and personal care products. This study reports the persistence and leaching potential of a group of acidic pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine, and three endocrine disruptors in soils from the Tula Valley in Mexico, one of the largest irrigation districts in the world that uses untreated wastewater. After irrigation of soil columns with fortified wastewater over the equivalent of one crop cycle, between 0% and 7% of the total added amounts of ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac and between 0% and 25% of 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, and bisphenol-A were recovered nom the soil profiles Carbamazepine was more persistent, between 55% and 107% being recovered. Amounts in leachates suggested that movement through the soil was possible for all of the analytes, particularly in profiles of low organic matter and clay content. Analysis of soil samples from the Tula Valley confirmed the general lack of accumulation of the acidic pharmaceuticals (concentrations from below the limit of detection to 0 61 mu g kg(-1)) and endocrine disruptors (concentrations from below the limit of detection to 109 mu g kg(-1)) despite continual addition through regular irrigation with untreated wastewater: there was little evidence of movement through the soil profiles. In contrast, carbamazepine was present in horizon A of the soil at concentrations equivalent to several years of additions by irrigation (2.6-7 5 mu g kg(-1)) and was also present in the deeper horizons. The persistence and mobility of carbamazepine suggested a potential to contaminate groundwater (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Treatment of primary wastewater effluent containing a mixture of nine pharmaceuticals model compounds (acetaminophen ACM, antipyrine ANT, caffeine CAF, ketorolac KET, metoprolol MET, sulfamethoxazole SFX, carbamazepine CARB, hydrochlorothiazide HCT and diclofenac DIC) has been carried out by means of aerobic biodegradation followed by different advanced oxidation processes (solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation). Only ACM and CAF were completely removed from municipal wastewater in aerobic biological experiments. Apparently, the bacteriostatic nature of SFX could lead to some extent to bacterial growth inhibition. Photocatalytic ozonation allows for a higher degradation rate than simple photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of oxygen. Under the conditions investigated, emerging compounds (ECs) degradation (sum of concentrations) in the photocatalytic ozonation was in the range 80-100% depending on the system. Application of solar light (SL) Fe(III) photocatalytic ozonation, SL/O-3/Fe (III) (180 min) and ozonation (45 min) systems reduced the concentrations of the studied emerging contaminants below their detection limit (2 mu g L-1). Nevertheless, photocatalytic ozonation led to 41.3% mineralization compared to 34% achieved by single ozonation. Toxicity analyses by Daphnia magna showed no effluent toxicity after the application of the three tertiary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological treatment, especially nitrogen removal, in an upflow packed bed reactor with immobilised biomass was studied. As a support material granulated activated carbon (GAC), ceramic material (crush brick), brown coal and cut polyethylene tubes were used. The size of the support material was 4 to 6 millimetres. In laboratory scale studies pharmaceutical wastewater was treated. Volumetric loading was from 6.8 to 7.6 g/l/day. Results of investigations showed us that aerated packed bed reactors are usable for nitrogen removal because in the reactor originates aerobic and anoxic conditions. In anoxic cones the denitrification of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia ions takes place. The most effective systems for nitrogen removal were reactors filled with granulated activated carbon and with ceramic material. In the reactor with granulated activated carbon also colour from wastewater was degraded.

AB After consumption, pharmaceuticals are excreted as parent compounds and/or metabolites in urine and faeces. Some are not completely removed during wastewater treatments, forcing sewage treatment plants (STPs) to apply alternative technologies to guarantee quality of treated water. To monitor the removal efficiency of STPs, not only unchanged compounds and metabolites have to be taken into account, but also formation of possible transformation products (TPs). In this work, QTOF MS has been used for screening metabolites/TPs of pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater from Athens. A customised database was built with the exact masses of metabolites reported in literature for the parent drugs found in an initial screening. Additionally, TPs identified in previous degradation experiments performed at our laboratory were included. Up to 34 metabolites/TPs were detected for omeprazole, venlafaxine, clindamycin, clarithromycin, clopidogrel or dipyrone, among others. Seven corresponded to TPs whose reference standards were available at our lab, seven were TPs previously identified in laboratory degradation experiments, eight were TPs tentatively identified by QTOF MS without reference standards, and twelve TPs were discovered after using the common fragmentation pathway approach. Tentative identification of TPs was supported by prediction of their chromatographic retention time based on the use of advanced chemometric QSRR models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewer pipelines, although primarily designed for sewage transport, can also be considered as bioreactors. In-sewer processes may lead to significant variations of chemical loadings from source release points to the treatment plant influent. In this study, we assessed in-sewer utilization of growth substrates (primary metabolic processes) and transformation of illicit drug biomarkers (secondary metabolic processes) by suspended biomass. Sixteen drug biomarkers were targeted, including mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their major human metabolites. Batch experiments were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using raw wastewater. Abiotic biomarker transformation and partitioning to suspended solids and reactor wall were separately investigated under both redox conditions. A process model was identified by combining and extending the Wastewater Aerobic/anaerobic Transformations in Sewers (WATS) model and Activated Sludge Model for Xenobiotics (ASM-X). Kinetic and stoichiometric model parameters were estimated using experimental data via the Bayesian optimization method DREAM((ZS)). Results suggest that biomarker transformation significantly differs from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, and abiotic conversion is the dominant mechanism for many of the selected substances. Notably, an explicit description of biomass growth during batch experiments was crucial to avoid significant overestimation (up to 385%) of aerobic biotransformation rate constants. Predictions of in-sewer transformation provided here can reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of drug consumption as part of wastewater-based epidemiological studies.

AB The aquatic environment can contain numerous micropollutants and there are concerns about endocrine activity in environmental waters and the potential impacts on human and ecosystem health. In this study a complementary chemical analysis and in vitro bioassay approach was applied to evaluate endocrine activity in treated wastewater, surface water and drinking water samples from six countries (Germany, Australia, France, South Africa, the Netherlands and Spain). The bioassay test battery included assays indicative of seven endocrine pathways, while 58 different chemicals, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds, were analysed by targeted chemical analysis. Endocrine activity was below the limit of quantification for most water samples, with only two of six treated wastewater samples and two of six surface water samples exhibiting estrogenic, glucocorticoid, progestagenic and/or anti-mineralocorticoid activity above the limit of quantification. Based on available effect-based trigger values (EBT) for estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity, some of the wastewater and surface water samples were found to exceed the EBT, suggesting these environmental waters may pose a potential risk to ecosystem health. In contrast, the lack of bioassay activity and low detected chemical concentrations in the drinking water samples do not suggest a risk to human endocrine health, with all samples below the relevant EBTs.

AB Removal of numerous classes of pharmaceuticals from the municipal and industrial wastewater, using conventional wastewater treatment, is incomplete and several studies suggested that improvement of this situation would require the application of advanced treatment techniques. This is particularly important for the treatment of industrial effluents, released from pharmaceutical industries, which can contain rather high concentrations of antimicrobials. The aim of this work was to evaluate membrane bioreactors (MBRs), nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and ozonation, as well as their combinations, for the removal of antimicrobials from a synthetic wastewater which simulated highly contaminated industrial effluents. The study was performed using a mixture of four important classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides (SA), fluoroquinolones (FQ), macrolides (MAC) and trimethoprim (TMP). Performance of two different types of MBRs, Kubota and Zenon, was evaluated under different regimes regarding hydraulic retention time, total organic load and total nitrogen load. It was shown that elimination of SA in MBR treatment was very efficient, while the elimination of MAC, FQ and TMP was incomplete. A mass balance of these contaminants in MBR suggested that microbial transformation represented the main mechanism, while only a small percentage was eliminated from the aqueous phase by adsorption onto sludge particles. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis achieved high elimination rates however produced highly contaminated concentrate. High removal was achieved using ozonation, but further research is needed to characterize formed ozonation products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In hospitals a large variety of substances are in use for medical purposes such as diagnostics and research. After application, diagnostic agents, disinfectants and excreted non-metabolized pharmaceuticals by patients, reach the wastewater. This form of elimination may generate risks for aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to present: (i) the steps of an ecological risk assessment and management framework related to hospital effluents evacuating into wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) without preliminary treatment; and (ii) the results of its application on wastewater from an infectious and tropical diseases department of a hospital of a large city in southeastern France. The characterization of effects has been made under two assumptions, which were related to: (a) the effects of hospital wastewater on biological treatment process of WWTP, particularly on the community of organisms in charge of the biological decomposition of the organic matter; (b) the effects on aquatic organisms. COD and BOD5 have been measured for studying global organic pollution. Assessment of halogenated organic compounds was made using halogenated organic compounds absorbable on activated carbon (AOX) concentrations. Heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chrome, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc) were measured. Low most probable number (MPP) for faecal coliforms, has been considered as an indirect detection of antibiotics and disinfectants presence. For toxicity assessment, bioluminescence assay using Vibrio fischeri photobacteria, 72-h EC50 algae growth Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and 24-h EC50 on Daphnia magna were used. The scenario allows to a semi-quantitative risk characterization. It needs to be improved on some aspects, particularly those linked to: long term toxicity assessment on target organisms (bioaccumulation of pollutants, genotoxicity, etc.); ecotoxicological interactions between pharmaceuticals, disinfectants used both in diagnostics and in cleaning of surfaces, and detergents used in cleaning of surfaces; the interactions into the sewage network, between the hospital effluents and the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Research over the last decade on emerging trace organic contaminants in aquatic systems has largely focused on sources such as treated wastewaters in high income countries, with relatively few studies relating to wastewater sources of these contaminants in low and middle income countries. We undertook a longitudinal survey of the Ahar River for a number of emerging organic contaminants (including pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products and industrial chemicals) which flows through the city of Udaipur, India. Udaipur is a city of approximately 450,000 people with no wastewater treatment occurring at the time of this survey. We found the concentrations of many of the contaminants within the river water were similar to those commonly reported in untreated wastewater in high income countries. For example, concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ranged up to 1900 ng/L. Other organic contaminants, such as steroid estrogens (up to 124 ng/L), steroid androgens (up to 1560 ng/L), benzotriazoles (up to 11 mu g/L), DEET (up to 390 ng/L), BPA (up to 300 ng/L) and caffeine (up to 37.5 mu g/L), were all similar to previously reported concentrations in wastewaters in high income countries. An assessment of the population densities in the watersheds feeding into the river showed increasing population density of a watershed led to a corresponding downstream increase in the concentrations of the organic contaminants, with quantifiable concentrations still present up to 10 km downstream of the areas directly adjacent to the highest population densities. Overall, this study highlights how a relatively clean river can be contaminated by untreated wastewater released from an urban centre. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hospital wastewaters contain large amounts of pharmaceutical residues, which may eventually be discharged into the aquatic environment through wastewater treatment plants, raising the question of their impact on human and environmental health. This has prompted the launch of several monitoring studies into the most commonly administered compounds in urban wastewater. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the cytotoxic potential of wastewaters samples collected from seven hospitals in Tunisia. The physicochemical analyses showed a large fluctuation of certain parameters in the collected samples, such as chemical oxygen demand (ranged from 860 to 1720 mg L-1), biochemical oxygen demand (ranged from 385 to 747 mg L-1), total organic carbon (ranged from 256 to 562 g L-1), total suspended solids (ranged from 905 to 1450 mg L-1), conductivity (ranged from 3.31 to 7.14 mu sm/cm), and turbidity (ranged from 100 to 480 NTU). The analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) also showed that hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of Hg (ranged from 0.0024 to 0.019 mg L-1). This could be explained by the variation of the activity and the services in certain hospitals compared to others. All hospital wastewater samples induced the proliferation of human breast cancer cell line MDA-231, even at low concentrations (20 mu L/assay). Moreover, the maximum induction reached at the concentration of 60 mu L/assay in wastewater samples from hospitals located in Monastir, Sidi Bouzid, Mahdia, and Sfax with percentages of induction up to 42.33, 14, 7.61, and 5.42%, respectively. These observations could be due to the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these wastewaters. Given this, our results evidenced the potential risk of these hospital effluents to environmental and public health.

AB The present study was undertaken to report the modeling of the dosing-time-dependent adverse effects of both untreated and biologically-treated pharmaceutical wastewater in mice. The mice were housed in a room controlled at 24 degrees C under a 12 h/12 h dark-light cycle (light 7:00-19:00 h) for two weeks before initiating the experiments and allowed free access to food and water. A single dose of pharmaceutical or bioremediated effluent was administrated intraperitoneally (10 mL/kg) to mice divided in six circadian stages [1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 hours after light onset (HALO)]. The surviving treated mice exhibited a significant circadian variation in body weight loss (p < 0.001). Pharmaceutical wastewater dosing at 17 HALO resulted in -6.5% weight loss, whereas drug dosing at 9 HALO was + 1.2% (&#1060; = 19.42 HALO +/- 1.25 h, p < 0.01). Only on the dark span, the proportion of dead mice was dosing-time-dependent (chi(2) = 12.7; p < 0.001). Pharmaceutical wastewater dosing at 17 HALO resulted in the poorest (67%) survival rate; whereas, the best survival was noted in the rest span with 100%. Troughs of motor incoordination were located at the administration times of 9 and 21 HALO (16% of animals affected), whereas peaks were located at 5 and 17 HALO (38 and 55% of animals affected, respectively). A statistically significant ultradian component rhythm with a trial period = 12 h, was detected by cosinor (p < 0.009) the &#1060; = 17.00 HALO +/- 1.70 h modulo 12 h. The toxicity was totally removed when the mice were treated by the bioremediated effluent. This indicates that Pseudomonas putida was able to completely detoxify the toxic pharmaceutical effluent. With regards to these data, the optimal tolerance to untreated pharmaceutical wastewater occurred in the light-rest span of mice.

AB The paucity of information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment in African countries led the authors to investigate 8 acidic pharmaceuticals (4 antipyretics, 3 antibiotics, and 1 lipid regulator) in wastewater, surface water, and sediments from the Msunduzi River in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The method recoveries, limits of detection (LOD), and limits of quantification were determined. The method recoveries were 58.4% to 103%, and the LODs ranged between 1.16 ng/L and 29.1 ng/L for water and between 0.58 ng/g and 14.5 ng/g for sediment. The drugs were all present in wastewater and in most of the surface water and sediment samples. Aspirin was the most abundant pharmaceutical observed, 118 +/- 0.82 mu g/L in wastewater influent, and the most observed antibiotic was nalidixic acid (25.2-29.9 mu g/L in wastewater); bezafibrate was the least observed. The distribution pattern of the antipyretic in water indicates more impact in suburban sites. The solid-liquid partitioning of the pharmaceuticals between sediment and water, measured as the distribution coefficient (log K-D) gave an average accumulation magnitude of 10x to 32x in sediments than in water. The downstream distribution patterns for both water and sediment indicate discharge contributions from wastewater, agricultural activities, domestic waste disposal, and possible sewer system leakages. Although concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were comparable with those obtained from some other countries, the contamination of the present study site with pharmaceuticals has been over time and continues at present, making effective management and control necessary.

AB Strategies for sample preparation. solid-phase extraction (SPE), clean-up, and detection conditions of an optimized solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography/mass/mass spectrometry (SPE-LC/MS/MS) method for determining multi-residues of four classes of widely used antibiotics in pig farms, sulfonamides (SAs), fluoroquinolone (FQs), tetracycline (TCs) and chloramphenicol (CAP) were presented. The multi-residue analysis was used in MS analysis, selecting two precursor ions to produce ion transitions for each target compound. Samples of swine wastewater, lake water and groundwater collected from two pig farms in central China were used to test the applicability of the multi-residue analysis method. The average antibiotics concentrations in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater were, respectively, 1.6-8.6, 5.7-11.6, 7.9-1172.3 and 8.5-21692.7 ngL(-1) in summer; respectively, 2.0-7.3, 6.7-11.7,5.8-409.5 and 32.8-11276.6ngL(-1) in winter. The limits of quantification were 0.8-4.1,1.4-5.5,1.8-11.5 and 6.4-104.4ngL(-1), respectively, in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater. Results of multi-residue analysis of antibiotics in the samples indicate that SAs, FQs and TCs were widely used veterinary medicines in the pig farms. As compared with previous studies, higher elimination rates (more than 80%) of the antibiotics (except DC) were observed in effluent in this study. More detailed work is indispensable to investigate the fate and transport of antibiotics in the environment and to find out cost-effective approaches of removing antibiotics from swine wastewater and contaminated sites.

AB In this study, a practicable and effective analytical method based on solid-phase-extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (SPE-LC-FLD) was developed and partially validated for routine analysis of eight FQs in wastewater at the trace level. Different SPE materials, pH conditions and eluents were modified to find an economic and effective SPE conditions. In our work, it is the first time that well-known commercially available SPE sorbent are compared to 'generic' cheap SPE sorbent. Aqueous samples (pH 2-3) were extracted using Anpel MEP cartridges where they were subsequently eluted by 6 mL of 2% formic acid in MeOH. The aqueous extracts were analysed by gradient elution LC-FLD, whose initial mobile phase was composed of ACN and 10 mmol L-1 tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (4/96, v/v, pH 3). The LODs and LOQs of the wastewater were as low as 0.32-2.12 ng L-1 and 1.07-7.07 ng L-1, respectively. The precisions of the overall method (RSD, n = 3) using wastewater were below 10%. The method was used to quantify FQs in influents and effluents of several typical sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Shanghai. The extraction recoveries of 100 mL influent, 500 mL effluent and 500 mL of river water samples were between 88.6 and 102.6%, 79.2 and 109.2%, 80.0 and 105.5% and 87.4 and 99.4%, respectively. FQs of interest except sarafloxacin were identified in the influents, effluents and river waters with concentrations varying from 0.012-1.163 mu g L-1, 0.003-0.291 mu g L-1, and 0.002-0.040 mu g L-1, respectively. The method can serve as a tool to obtain detailed information on occurrence, behaviour and fate of FQs in the aquatic environment. Occurrence of FQs detected in summer is higher than in spring at STPs, and those detected in the suburban area are less than those in the urban area. Complete removal of FQs is not achieved from the STPs, indicating domestic wastewater and STP discharge is the source of FQs in the surface water.

AB A study was conducted in which the effluent at four small to medium sized sewage treatment plants (STP) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was monitored for three pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol) over a period of four years. Grab sampling and auto sampling campaigns were accomplished with respect to various weather conditions in the catchment area. Flow volumes and hydraulic retention times (HRT) from various sampling dates which provide information on processes causing emission changes were additionally taken into account. Monitoring results showed that concentration scattering in the effluent is related to HRT in the sewage treatment plants. Dilution effects following rain events in the catchment area were analysed for the three investigated substances. Short-term emission changes explained by dilution only could be well determined by the mathematical relation between discharge and concentration, and for carbamazepine to be solely determined by the dilution effects at all HRTs. For metoprolol, a clear decrease in concentrations was observed at HRTs above 80 h, and a significant contribution of biodegradation was supported by independent biodegradation tests. For three out of the four STPs, a decrease in concentrations of diclofenac was observed at hydraulic retention times above 80 h, indicating removal, whereas the relationship between concentration and HRT of the other STP could be explained by dilution only. The study shows that emissions can vary with weather conditions, hampering the assessment of emissions and estimation of concentrations in surface waters from generic removal rates only. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of HRT of rather stable substances in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a new, more effective and cost-effective treatment alternative is investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant effluent (WWTP-eff). The potential of combining clay with biodegradable polymeric flocculants is further highlighted. Flocculation is viewed as the best method to get the optimum outcome from clay. In addition, flocculation with cationic starch increases the biodegradability and cost of the treatment. Clay is naturally abundantly available and relatively inexpensive compared to conventional adsorbents. Experimental studies were carried out with existing naturally occurring pharmaceutical concentrations found and measured in WWTP-eff with atrazine spiking for comparison between the demineralised water and WWTP-eff matrix. Around 70% of the total measured pharmaceutical compounds were removable by the clay-starch combination. The effect of clay with and without starch addition was also highlighted.

AB Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were placed at two wastewater treatment plants, where they were constantly fed with effluent and intermittently fed with primary wastewater. Each reactor was subjected to different feast/famine periods and flow rates of primary wastewater, thus the different organic and nutrient loads (chemical oxygen demand(COD), ammonium(NH4-N)) resulted in different feast-famine conditions applied to the biomass. In batch experiments, this study investigated the effects of various feast-famine conditions on the biodegradation of micropollutants by MBBRs applied as an effluent polishing step. Rate constants of micropollutant removals were found to be positively correlated to the load of the total COD and NH4-N, indicating that higher organic loads were favourable for the growth of micropollutant degraders in these MBBRs. Rate constant of atenolol was five times higher when the biomass was fed with the highest COD and NH4-N load than it was fed with the lowest COD and NH4-N load. For diclofenac, mycophenolic acid and iohexol, their maximum rate constants were obtained with feeding of COD and NH4-N of approximately 570 mgCOD/d and 40-60 mg NH4-N/d respectively. This also supports the concept that co-metabolism (rather competition inhibition or catabolic repression) plays an important role in micropollutants biodegradation in wastewater.

AB Each year, large quantities of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are used worldwide. Once conveyed to wastewater treatment plants, PPCPs can remain unchanged or undergo partial or complete transformation during wastewater treatment processes before discharge into the environment via effluent and biosolids for land application. Biosolids can be a major sink for some PPCPs. Previous investigations have indicated that land application of biosolids may be a potential important route through which PPCPs enter the environment. However, no information is available on exactly how closely the concentrations of PPCPs in the environmental media are related to the land application of PPCP-containing biosolids. This paper reviews currently available information on the occurrence of PPCPs in biosolids, methods of analysis, the potential fate of PPCPs in biosolids-applied soils, and composting as a potential means for removal of PPCPs from biosolids.

AB The environment receives antibiotics through a combination of direct application (e.g., aquaculture and fruit production), as well as indirect release through pharmaceutical manufacturing, sewage and animal manure. Antibiotic concentrations in many sewage-impacted rivers are thought to be sufficient to select for antibiotic resistance genes. Yet, because antibiotics are nearly always found associated with antibiotic-resistant faecal bacteria in wastewater, it is difficult to distinguish the selective role of effluent antibiotics within a 'sea' of gut-derived resistance genes. Here we examine the potential for macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing in England to select for resistance in the River Thames catchment, England. We show that 64% and 74% of the length of the modelled catchment is chronically exposed to putative resistance-selecting concentrations (PNEC) of macrolides and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Under current macrolide usage, 115 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (8% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Similarly, under current fluoroquinolone usage, 223 km of the modelled River Thames catchment (16% of total length) exceeds the PNEC by 5-fold. Our results reveal that if reduced prescribing was the sole mitigating measure, that macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing would need to decline by 77% and 85%, respectively, to limit resistance selection in the catchment. Significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing are feasible, but innovation in sewage-treatment will be necessary for achieving substantially-reduced antibiotic loads and inactivation of DNA-pollution from resistant bacteria. Greater confidence is needed in current risk-based targets for antibiotics, particularly in mixtures, to better inform environmental risk assessments and mitigation.

AB The closed basin of the Lower Jordan Valley with the Dead Sea as final sink features high evapotranspiration rates and almost complete reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation farming. This study focuses on the water transfer schemes and the presence, spreading, and potential accumulation of pharmaceutical residues in the local water resources based on findings of a five-year monitoring program. Overall 16 pharmaceuticals and 9 iodinated X-ray contrast media were monitored in groundwater, surface water, and treated wastewater. A total of 95 samples were taken to cover all geographical settings and flow paths from origin (wastewater) to target (groundwater). Nine substances were detected in groundwater, with concentrations ranging between 11 ng/L and 33,000 ng/L. Sometimes, detection rates were higher. than in comparable studies: Diatrizoic acid 75%, iopamidol 42%, iopromide 19%, iomeprol 11%, carbamazepine and iohexol 8%, ibuprofen 6%, and fenofibrate and iothalamic acid 3%. Concentrations in groundwater generally increase from north to south depending on the application of treated wastewater for irrigation. Almost all substances occurred most frequently and with highest concentrations in treated wastewater, followed by surface water and groundwater. As exception, diatrizoic add was found more frequently in groundwater than in treated wastewater, with concentrations being similar. This indicates the persistence of diatrizoic acid with long residence times in local groundwater systems, but may also reflect changing prescription patterns, which would be in accordance with increasing iopamidol findings and surveys at local hospitals. Trend analyses confirm this finding and indicate a high probability of increasing iopamidol concentrations, while other substances did not reveal any trends. However, no proof of evaporative enrichment could be found. The high spatial and temporal variability of the concentrations measured calls for further systematic studies to assess the long-term evolution of organic trace substances in this reuse setting.

AB Given the large number of chemicals under regulatory scrutiny, models play a crucial role in the screening phase of the environmental risk assessment. The sewage treatment plant (STP) model SimpleTreat 3.1 is routinely applied as part of the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances to estimate the fate and elimination of organic chemicals discharged via sewage. SimpleTreat estimates tend to be conservative and therefore only useful for lower-tier assessments. A probabilistic version of SimpleTreat was built on the updated version of the model (SimpleTreat 3.2, presented in a parallel article in this issue), embracing likeliest as well as worst-case conditions in a statistically robust way. Probabilistic parameters representing the variability of sewage characteristics, STP design, and operational parameters were based on actual STP conditions for activated sludge plants in Europe. An evaluation study was carried out for 4 chemicals with distinct sorption and biodegradability profiles: tonalide, triclosan, trimethoprim, and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Simulations incorporated information on biodegradability simulation studies with activated sludge (OECD 314B and OECD 303A tests). Good agreement for both median values and variability ranges was observed between model estimates and monitoring data. The uncertainty analysis highlighted the importance of refined data on partitioning and biodegradability in activated sludge to achieve realistic estimates. The study indicates that the best strategy to refine the exposure assessment of down-the-drain chemicals is by integrating higher-tier laboratory data with probabilistic STP simulations and, if possible, by comparing them with monitoring data for validation.

AB Anthropogenic contamination of surface waters in Asia is on the increase. While polar organic contaminants are gradually recognized for their impacts on aquatic ecosystems in the Western World, less is known about the situation in Asia. In developing countries like China, water resources are particularly vulnerable. We investigated the occurrence, elimination, and per capita loads of a wide range of pharmaceuticals, household chemicals and pesticides in five Beijing WWTPs representative for megacities in China, and compare the efficiency of different treatment processes. Based on initial screening for 268 micropollutants using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 33 compounds were examined in detail. Pollutant concentrations in raw wastewater ranged from <0.02 mu g L-1 for pesticides to >20 mu g L-1 for caffeine and the contrast agent iopromide. Concentrations in the WWTP effluents were generally <1 mu g L-1, except for some pharmaceuticals, iopromide (1.2-18 mu g L-1), caffeine (0.025-2.3 mu g L-1), and the artificial sweetener sucralose (2.7-3.5 mu g L-1). Elimination efficiencies varied greatly from <1% to close to 100%, with macrolides, some sulfonamides, metronidazole, iopromide, and 4-acetamidoantipyrine being the most persistent compounds. Total per capita loads of the investigated micropollutants were lower than in communal wastewater of Europe, amounting to 7.9-12.2 and 2.0-6.5 g d(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) in the influents and effluents, respectively, with an average release of similar to 100 kg d(-1) by the 11.4 million people and 2.3 million m(3) of wastewater treated per day. Since the wastewater effluents are often used for agricultural irrigation, residual organic pollutants pose a threat to food safety, the development of antibacterial resistance, and combined effects of micropollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB The occurrence and spatio-temporal patterns of five tetracyclines (TCs) and six of their degradation products were investigated in twenty-eight drinking water sources along the lower Yangtze River (LYR) over dry, normal and flood seasons. Tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxytetracycline (DXC) were the dominant antibiotics detected with the highest occurrence. The maximum concentrations of TC, OTC and DXC were found in dry season as 11.16, 18.98, and 56.09 ng/L, respectively, because of the low dilution, low degradation, and high consumption in this season. Cluster analysis indicated distinct variations in the TCs' compositional profiles in both space and time. OTC and its metabolites contributed 18.5-59.6% of the TC load in dry season, possibly due to the seasonally increased release of pharmaceutical OTCs from sewage effluents, but they were seldom detected in other seasons. Pollution load index analysis showed that tributaries carrying large amounts of veterinary TCs derived from breeding wastewater and untreated rural sewage contributed larger proportions of the TC load for most drinking water sources than sewage outlets. The contribution ratio of the TC load from tributaries (74.5%) was approximately three times higher than that from sewage discharges (25.5%). The study demonstrated that the control of load from tributaries is the key to mitigating TC pollution of the drinking water sources in the LYR. An effective source tracking method for evaluating the contribution of antibiotic load from multiple diffuse pollution origins and identifying the high-risk contamination sources was established for antibiotic management and control.

AB The antimicrobial compounds triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) accumulate in sludges produced during municipal wastewater treatment and persist through sludge treatment processes into finished biosolids. The objective of this research was to determine the extent to which conventional sludge processing systems such as aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion, and lime stabilization were able to remove TCC and TCS. The concentrations of TCC and TCS in sludge and biosolid samples were determined via heated solvent extraction and analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The removal of TCC and TCS in municipal biosolid processing systems was determined from the measured concentration change after correcting for reductions in solid mass during sludge treatment. Removal in the digester systems ranged from 15 to 68% for TCC and 20 to 75% for TCS. Increased solid retention times during sludge treatment operations were correlated with higher removals of TCC and TCS.

AB Some sources of organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) to streams, lakes, and estuaries, including wastewater-treatment-plant effluent, have been well documented, but other sources, particularly wet-weather discharges from combined-sewer-overflow (CSO) and urban runoff, may also be major sources of OWCs. Samples of wastewater-treatment-plant (WWTP) effluent, CSO effluent, urban streams, large rivers, a reference (undeveloped) stream, and Lake Champlain were collected from March to August 2006. The highest concentrations of many OWCs associated with wastewater were in WWTP-effluent samples, but high concentrations of some OWCs in samples of CSO effluent and storm runoff from urban streams subject to leaky sewer pipes or CSOs were also detected. Total concentrations and numbers of compounds detected differed substantially among sampling sites. The highest total OWC concentrations (10-100 mu g/l) were in samples of WWTP and CSO effluent. Total OWC concentrations in samples from urban streams ranged from 0.1 to 10 mu g/l, and urban stream-stormflow samples had higher concentrations than baseflow samples because of contributions of OWCs from CSOs and leaking sewer pipes. The relations between OWC concentrations in WWTP-effluent and those in CSO effluent and urban streams varied with the degree to which the compound is removed through normal wastewater treatment. Concentrations of compounds that are highly removed during normal wastewater treatment [including caffeine, Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, and cholesterol] were generally similar to or higher in CSO effluent than in WWTP effluent (and ranged from around 1 to over 10 mu g/l) because CSO effluent is untreated, and were higher in urban-stream stormflow samples than in baseflow samples as a result of CSO discharge and leakage from near-surface sources during storms. Concentrations of compounds that are poorly removed during treatment, by contrast, are higher in WWTP effluent than in CSO, due to dilution. Results indicate that CSO effluent and urban stormwaters can be a significant major source of OWCs entering large water bodies such as Burlington Bay.

AB Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition bioassay (VFBIA) has been widely applied for the monitoring of toxicity on account of multiple advantages encompassing shorter test duration, sensitive, cost-effective and ease of operation. Moreover, this bioassay found to be equally applicable to all types of matrices (organic & inorganic compounds, metals, wastewater, river water, sewage sludge, landfill leachate, herbicides, treated wastewater etc.) for toxicity monitoring. This review highlights the apparent significance of Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay for ecotoxicological screening and evaluation of diverse chemical substances toxicity profile. The biochemical and genetic basis of the bioluminescence assay and its regulatory mechanism have been concisely discussed. The basic test protocol with ongoing improvements, widespread applications, typical advantages and probable limitations of the assay have been overviewed. The sensitivity of VFBIA and toxicity bioassays has also been compared. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aqueous solutions of the tinidazole (TNZ) have been treated by applying the combination of ultrasound irradiation and H2O2. Based on the results, the maximum removal efficiency of 75 % was achieved under the optimum operating conditions (pH 3, 120 kHz frequency, 333 mM/L of H2O2 and 150 min of operating time) while, under the same conditions the minimum removal efficiency was found to be 8.5 by ultrasound radiation in the absence of H2O2. The results also revealed that the degradation of TNZ was enhanced with decreasing both TNZ initial concentrations and pH. Furthermore, TNZ removal efficiency in the case of actual wastewater was less than of synthetic wastewater (75 % and 68 % of synthetic and actual, respectively). According to the chromatographic analyses, no harmful intermediate compounds were observed. The chemical oxygen demand analysis (65 % reduction) confirmed our findings.

AB It is generally accepted that the main route for human pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is via sewage treatment plants receiving wastewater from households and hospitals. We have analysed pharmaceuticals in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant serving about 90 bulk drug manufacturers in Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India-a major production site of generic drugs for the world market. The samples contained by far the highest levels of pharmaceuticals reported in any effluent. The high levels of several broad-spectrum antibiotics raise concerns about resistance development. The concentration of the most abundant drug, ciprofloxacin (up to 3 1,000 mu g/L) exceeds levels toxic to some bacteria by over 1000-fold. The results from the present study call for an increased focus on the potential release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from production facilities in different regions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB A method for the simultaneous determination of 18 home and personal care chemicals (HPCCs) in river water and wastewater was developed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (SPE and UPLC/MS/MS). A series of tests were designed to find the potential background interference and loss of HPCCs during the sample preservation and pretreatment process. Our results suggested that a considerable amount of some target compounds were lost with increasing days of storage even at 4 degrees C. Accordingly, the samples were stored acidified and refrigerated, including during transportation, to reduce the losses. Experiments on filtration of water samples suggested that recoveries of many HPCCs were significantly affected by the filtration. It is therefore recommended to avoid filtration of water samples where possible. The internal standard corrected recoveries for the HPCCs ranged from 64.2 to 107.0%, except for benzisothiazolone which did not have an appropriate internal standard, in river water which was considered to be the most difficult matrix. The method detection limits for river water, influent and effluent samples were in the ranges of 0.17 to 42 ng/L, 13 to 5100 ng/L, and 0.50 to 200 ng/L, respectively. The validated method was applied for the determination of HPCCs in sewage water collected from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a typical urban city in Northeast China and from river water upstream and downstream of the WWTP. Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, caffeine, methyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride, triclocarban, and triclosan were the major compounds detected in the river water and wastewater samples. Sampling variability for the WWTP (intra-day and inter-day) and cross-river was also determined with the purpose of designing future monitoring requirements. Small variations in these samples confirmed that composite samples and a single sampling event would be representative for future use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater samples were collected at the influent and effluent of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and then pooled to daily samples over multiple days using 6 hourly grab samples. The aim was to provide a first assessment of the occurrence, consumption, removal and release of a range of organic chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), illicit drugs, an artificial sweetener, tobacco and its metabolites and alcohol biomarkers (referred to here as DPCPBs). Nineteen DPCPBs were detected via direct measurement of filtered wastewater on LC-MS/MS with a concentration range 010.05-38 mu g/L.Caffeine and paracetamol were the most prominent compounds detected in the influent, while acesulfame was found at the highest concentration in the effluent of both WWTPs. Mean concentrations of metabolites of tobacco (nicotine: 7.6 mu g/L, cotinine: 1.4 mu g/L and hydroxycotinine: 1.7 mu g/L) and alcohol (ethyl sulphate: 33 mu g/L) were lower than those of European countries. Consumption rates based on daily mass loads and catchment population data obtained from the WWTPs were <10 g/d/1000 pp for the majority of selected PPCPs, except for caffeine (300 g/d/1000 pp) and paracetamol (320 g/d/1000 pp). Consumption rates for codeine and methamphetamine were 0.05 g/d/1000 pp and 0.17 g/d/1000 pp, respectively. Consistently across the two WWTPs most of the chemicals (10) showed >80% apparent removal rate from the wastewater, three chemicals showed apparent removal efficiency of approximately 50%; and the removal efficiency could not be assessed for 5 compounds due to their low concentrations in the influent. Based on the fraction of treated and untreated wastewater (10:90) that is released into the receiving environment we estimated a total discharge of approximately 170 kg per day of DPCPBs in Ho Chi Minh City.

AB Antibiotics are one of the most consumed drugs and have become new emerging pollutants in the environment as antibiotics lead to long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem. They are produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of other bacteria in nature as a defense mechanism. Furthermore, after discovering their therapeutical features, synthetic production methods were developed. In general, antibiotics are widely used in human medicine, veterinary medicine, farming and aquaculture for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Approximately 90% of the consumed antibiotics are excreted via urinary or fecal pathways from the human body after partial, or no metabolism, and they are transferred to the domestic sewage plants or directly to the environment. Conventional biological treatment of domestic sewage provides very low-if any-reduction for the antibiotics, which usually by-pass treatment and accumulate in the receiving waters, sediments, plants, and animals. The concentration of these materials in domestic wastewaters and surface waters is observed in a range between 0.3 mu g/L and 150 mu g/L. However, pharmaceutical plants, hospitals, concentrated animal feeding operations, and aquaculture generate effluents having much higher antibiotics concentrations in the range 100-500 mg/L. Consequently, it is essential to gather information on the fate and effect of these compounds at high concentrations for setting the basis for related practical treatment schemes.
   Inhibitory action of the antibiotics is experimentally evaluated in two different approaches: Short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) tests: Acute experiments involve a microbial community selected and sustained by the selected organic substrate in the system and not previously exposed to the inhibitor. In long-term experiments with continuous feeding of the inhibitor, the test may reflect, aside from changes in substrate removal and utilization, adaptation and/or resistance of the microbial community or even shifts in microbial composition in response to continuous exposure to the selected inhibitor. However, a full insight on the inhibitory action can only be acquired when the response of the microbial community is tested for both acute and chronic inhibition impacts.
   In this chapter, the most commonly used antibiotic classes such as beta-lactams, tetracycline, macrolides, sulfonamides, quinolones are examined. Their fate and transformation during wastewater treatment as well as their inhibitory and toxic effects on the microbial community are discussed by using various toxicity and inhibition tests.

AB A highly sensitive and specific indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of diclofenac in water samples was developed With pure water, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) and IC50 were found to be 6 ng/L and 60 ng/L, respectively. The analytical working range was about 20-400 ng/L. Highest cross-reactivity (CR) of 26 tested pharmaceuticals, metabolites, and pesticides was found for 5-hydroxydiclofenac (100%). Other estimated values were well below 4% and, therefore, are negligible. The assay was applied for the determination of diclofenac in tap and surface water samples as well as wastewater collected at 20 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Austria and Germany. Humic substances were identified as main interference in surface water. Wastewater samples which were only submitted to filtration and dilution yielded about 25% higher diclofenac concentrations using the ELISA compared to GC-MS. However, the ELISA turned out to be a simple, inexpensive, and accurate method for the determination of diclofenac both in influent and effluent wastewater after rather simple sample preparation, i.e., filtration, acidification, and readjustment to neutral pH-value, and at least 10-fold dilution with pure water.

AB The concentrations of 12 pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, erythromycin, cyclophosphamide, paracetamol, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, caffeine, clarithromycin, lidocaine, sulfamethoxazole and N-acetylsulfamethoxazol (NACS)) were investigated in the influents and effluents of two hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs) in Saudi Arabia. The majority of the target analytes were detected in the influent samples apart from bezafibrate, cyclophosphamide, and erythromycin. Caffeine and paracetamol were detected in the influent at particularly high concentrations up to 75 and 12 ug/L, respectively. High removal efficiencies of the pharmaceutical compounds were observed in both HWWTPs, with greater than 90 % removal on average. Paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole, NACS, ciprofloxacin, and caffeine were eliminated by between >95 and >99 % on average. Atenolol, carbamazepine, and clarithromycin were eliminated by >86 % on average. Of particular interest were the high removal efficiencies of carbamazepine and antibiotics that were achieved by the HWWTPs; these compounds have been reported to be relatively recalcitrant to biological treatment and are generally only partially removed. Elevated temperatures and high levels of sunlight were considered to be the main factors that enhanced the removal of these compounds.

AB Synthetic musk fragrances (SMFs) are considered micropollutants and can be found in various environmental matrices near wastewater discharge areas. These emerging contaminants are often detected in wastewater at low concentrations; they are continuously present and constitute a constant exposure source. Objectives of this study were to investigate the environmental fate, transport, and transformation of SMFs. Occurrence of six polycyclic musk compounds (galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide, phantolide, traseolide, cashmeran) and two nitro musk compounds (musk xylene and musk ketone) was monitored in wastewater, various surface waters and their sediments, as well as groundwater, soil cores, and plants from a treated wastewater land application site. Specifically, samples were collected quarterly from (1) a wastewater treatment plant to determine initial concentrations in wastewater effluent, (2) a storage reservoir at a land application site to determine possible photolysis before land application, (3) soil cores to determine the amount of sorption after land application and groundwater recharge to assess lack thereof, (4) a lake system and its sediment to assess degradation, and (5) non-effluent impacted local playa lakes and sediments to assess potential sources of these compounds. All samples were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC MS). Data indicated that occurrence of SMFs in effluent-impacted environments was detectable at ng/L and ng/g concentrations, which decreased during transport throughout wastewater treatment and land application. However, unexpected concentrations, ng/L and ng/g, were also detected in playa lakes not receiving treated effluent. Additionally, soil cores from land application sites had ng/g concentrations, and SMFs were detected in plant samples at trace levels. Galaxolide and tonalide were consistently found in all environments. Information on occurrence is critical to assessing exposure to these potential endocrine disrupting compounds. Such information could provide a scientific framework for establishing the need for environmental regulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Sewage sludge in the wastewater treatment plants contains considerable amount of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). A few studies have reported that anaerobic digestion (AD) could successfully remove some ARGs from sewage sludge, but information on the fate of ARGs in sludge pretreatment-AD process is still very limited. In this study, three sludge pretreatment methods, including alkaline, thermal hydrolysis and ultrasonic pretreatments, were compared to investigate the distribution and removal of ARGs in the sludge pretreatment-AD process. Results showed that the ARGs removal efficiency of AD itself was approximately 50.77%, and if these three sludge pretreatments were applied, the total ARGs removal efficiency of the whole pretreatment-AD process could be improved up to 52.50%-75.07%. The ultrasonic pretreatment was more efficient than alkaline and thermal hydrolysis pretreatments. Although thermal hydrolysis reduced ARGs obviously, the total ARGs rebounded considerably after inoculation and were only removed slightly in the subsequent AD process. Furthermore, it was found that the total ARGs concentration significantly correlated with the amount of 16S rRNA gene during the pretreatment and AD processes, and the bacteria carrying ARGs could be mainly affiliated with Proteobacteria.

AB Purpose Pharmaceuticals are becoming one of the largest environmental concerns when it comes to the water treatment industry. Increased usage of these chemicals poses a serious risk to ecology and human health due to their leakage into surface waters. In the present study, carbide derived carbon (CDC) was used for the first time as a new adsorbent to remove ibuprofen from synthetic water and wastewater effluent. Methods The morphology, chemical composition, surface area and surface charge of the CDC particles were investigated using the transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, BET analysis and zeta potential measurements. The effects of CDC dosage, temperature, initial pH and agitation speed on the adsorption process were examined by using batch adsorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherms were investigated. Results Adsorption and kinetic equilibrium data demonstrate that the adsorption of ibuprofen onto the CDC obeys the Langmuir isotherm model and the kinetics follow the pseudo-2nd order mechanism. The thermodynamic results reveal that ibuprofen adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous. The ibuprofen removal by CDC was mainly controlled by the electrostatic forces at high pH of the feed solution and by the dispersive interactions in acidic media. The ibuprofen removal is promoted at high temperature, high agitation speed and low pH. The highest adsorption capacity of ibuprofen onto the CDC was 367 mg/g at pH 3. Furthermore, the CDC efficiently removed ibuprofen from spiked treated sewage effluent. Conclusions The obtained data indicate that the CDC provides a fast and efficient adsorptive removal of ibuprofen both from a model aqueous solution and treated sewage effluent.

AB Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) harbours large amounts of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the variation and fate of these emerging pollutants during sludge treatment processes must be thoroughly studied to reduce their potential risks to human health. In this study, 7 pilot-scale CSTR anaerobic digesters were established with the same seed sludge and fed with the same thermal hydrolysis pre-treated sewage sludge, while operating under different conditions. High-throughput quantitative PCR, UPLC-MS/MS and Illumina Hiseq-sequencing were used to systematically evaluate the responses of antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs in sewage sludge to thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment and various anaerobic digestion (AD) conditions. The results showed that thermal hydrolysis effectively reduced the abundance (> 94%) of almost all subtypes of ARGs and MGEs, and it was a powerful technology for reducing tetracyclines, macrolides, and lincosamides. Besides, the abundance of ARGs and MGEs in thermophilic digesters was lower than that in mesophilic digesters, suggesting that thermophilic digesters could be used to avoid the ARGs rebounding. In addition, the thermophilic system further reduced the concentrations of quinolones. For the digesters operated under the mesophilic conditions, a longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) facilitated the removal of antibiotics, ARGs, and MGEs. Furthermore, the microbial community and MGEs had important effects on the persistence and proliferation of ARGs in AD process. The findings of this study provide effective clues for controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance and suggest the optimal operating conditions of digesters.

AB In the last few years, the issue of new dangerous micropollutants, penetrating from municipal wastewater into the environment, which can pose a threat to animals and plants, but also humans, has become very topical. These substances, the originator of which is our developed society, are completely out of the ordinary standards of wastewater treatment, and most of the commonly used purification technology is ineffective against them. The persistent and bioaccumulative nature of these substances brings major risk to wild live plants and animals because it affects their endocrine systems. It causes transcription of DNA and RNA. The immediate danger to humans is primarily the bioaccumulation potential of these substances and their binding to a solid soil matrix where they can be leached into groundwater and contaminated with drink water sources. The escape of these substances into the environment is primarily connected with the abundant use of chemical additives in various industries, with a separate chapter being agriculture, where the massive use of chlorine-based chemical pesticides for long years has completely infested a large amount of soil. Wastewater is one of the main gates of micropollutants entering the aquatic environment, especially those that are part of pharmaceutical products, such as hormonal contraceptives, which contain synthetic hormones that cause severe sexmutagens changes in fish. However, the increased occurrence of micropollutants is not only related to the fact that these substances are abundantly overused, but also that the detection methods were able to capture these substances during the sub 20 years. From the time perspective, we are not yet able to determine their future environmental developments, and we do not know about interactions exist between them and other substances in the frame of sewage and treatment process, when that may induce new substances that can often be more dangerous than origins mother substances. Our aim should, therefore, be to make the processes and technologies for removing these substances from wastewater as efficiently as possible so as to prevent their free distribution to the environment. This section of the publication attempts to summarize the current knowledge of hazardous micropollutants in wastewater and the possibilities of their elimination.

AB The iodinated X-ray contrast medium diatrizoate is known to be very persistent in current wastewater treatment as well as in environmental compartments. In this study, the potential of anaerobic processes in soils, sediments, and during wastewater treatment to remove and transform diatrizoate was investigated. In anaerobic batch experiments with soil and sediment seven biologically formed transformation products (TPs) as well as the corresponding transformation pathway were identified. The TPs resulted from successive deiodinations and deacetylations. The final TP 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA) was stable under anaerobic conditions. However, DABA was further transformed under air atmosphere, indicating the potential for the mineralization of diatrizoate by combining anaerobic and aerobic conditions. With the development of a methodology using complementary liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques, all identified TPs were quantified and the mass balance could be closed without having authentic standards for four of the TPs available. The detection and quantification of diatrizoate TPs in groundwater, in technical wetlands with anaerobic zones, and in a pilot wastewater treatment plant established for anaerobic treatment highlights the transferability and up-scaling of the results attained by laboratory experiments to environmental conditions.

AB The growth and composition of microorganisms found in a municipal wastewater treatment plant were investigated in the presence of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) [ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and clofibric acid] in batch reactors at varying organic loadings. Overall, the data suggest that microbial growth inhibition was correlated to organic loading rather than PhAC concentration. Significant inhibition ranging from 34 to 43% was observed under the lowest organic loading for all PhACs other than clofibric acid. No inhibition was observed at the highest organic loading. Higher microbial inhibition was not observed with increased PhAC concentration for a given organic loading. These results indicate that the presence of PhAC may affect microbial growth especially under lower organic loading conditions. Further validation is require with additional PhACs, organic substrates, and a wider loading range. In addition, significant microbial shifts were observed in the presence of ketoprofen and naproxen. These data suggest that, in addition to their effect on overall microbial growth, PhACs may affect the microbial ecology and additional research should be carried out to identify PhACs that have the potential of affecting ecologically important microorganisms in wastewater treatment processes and aquatic environments in general.

AB This article describes the development of a short pre-treatment method that allows the simultaneous analysis of free estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and their sulphate and glucuronide conjugated forms. For a range of matrices, from sewage effluent to river water, the developed methodology based on solid-phase extraction and fractionation technique with ultra-performance liquid chromatography system showed effective separation of the targeted estrogens. The detection limits of this method ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 ng L-1 for river water. The recoveries for river water and sewage effluent varied from 63% to 127%. The problems of matrix effects and ion suppression or enhancement were allowed quantitatively for in the analysis using standard addition. The developed method was used successfully to detect estrogens and their conjugates in both raw and treated wastewater, and river water at a location in Japan. High concentrations of the free estrogens estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and estriol were found in the influent (22.6, 77.2, 64.6 ng L-1, respectively) but only E1 was still present at a high concentration in the effluent which was reflected in the downstream river concentration. Estrone-3-sulphate was detected up to 18.0 ng L-1 in influent water sample and 1.1 ng L-1 in downstream water. For the sulphate conjugates, removal efficiencies varied from 35 to 88%. Glucuronide conjugates were detected only once in the sewage influent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eleven selected antibiotics in the East River, South China, were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-EI-MS-MS). Erythromycin, roxitromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine and trimethoprim were detected with frequencies of more than 75%, and average concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 67.4 ng l(-1). The other three compounds' (sulfathiazole, sulfacetamide and spiramycin) concentrations were below detection limits. In general, the concentrations of sulfonamides and trimethoprim were higher than those of macrolides. The concentrations of macrolides showed a spatial distribution pattern of delta > lower reach > middle reach (or urban area > agriculture area), while sulfonamides and trimethoprim did not have a significant spatial pattern. Principal component analysis and comparison with wastewater were further used to explore source information of the antibiotics. The results suggested that macrolides in the East River were mainly associated with domestic sewage, while sulfonamides and trimethoprim may be more related to agriculture wastewater, especially livestock industrial wastewater. It is suggested that to ensure/improve the drinking water quality in the region, a better pollution control of livestock industry in the lower and middle reaches is of critical importance.

AB This work focuses on the validation and application of solid phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC) analysis of important endocrine disruptors compounds (EDC) from different classes in highly complex wastewater matrix. The endocrine disruptors investigated included three different categories: pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), trimethoprim (TMP) and diclofenac (DCF)), hormones (estrone (E1), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)) and plastic materials (bisphenol A (BPA)). The method involves pre-concentration by SPE using Strata-X extraction cartridges followed by HPLC coupled with diode array detector (DAD). As the assumption of homoscedasticity was met for analytical data, ordinary linear regression procedure was applied to the data. The method was considered validated for 7 EDC after consistent evaluation of the key analytical parameters. Recoveries were ranged from 52.3 to 179.6%. Limits of quantification were in the range 6.0-0.4 mu g L-1. The described method was applied to evaluate the occurrence and removal efficiency of EDC in two biological sewage treatment plants (STPs). The influent mean concentrations of E1, E2 and EE2 hormones were 79.54; 175.09 and 102.19 mu g L-1, respectively, while for SMZ, TMP, DCF and BPA were 215.17; 187.01; 218.97 and 87.12 mu g L-1 for STP A, respectively. The efficiencies for the removal of EDCs ranged from 0 to 79.4%.

The selected compounds were carbamazepine, naproxen, and ibuprofen; they are among the most commonly prescribed and widely used pharmaceutical agents worldwide. Samples (200 mL) were pre-concentrated using the solid phase extraction (SPE) enrichment procedure and the analysis of the pharmaceuticals was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV). The overall procedure provided limits of detection (LOD) lower than 0.5 mu g.L(-1)and recoveries of 78-97%. For the carbamazepine compound, the mean concentrations were 60.58, 93.19, and 132 mu g.L-1 for the Bizerte, Jendouba, and Tunis WWTPs, respectively. This pharmaceutical was not detected in the Beja WWTPs. Naproxen and ibuprofens were not detected in the Jendouba WWTP but were found in the three other WWTPs with concentrations ranging from 2.94 to 36.17 mu g.L-1 and from 8.02 to 43.22 mu g.L-1, respectively. From the obtained data, it seems that these WWTPs are not able to eliminate this kind of micro-pollutants.

AB A lab-scale anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor (A/O-MBR) was operated for selected antibiotics tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadiazine (SDZ) and ampicillin (AMP) removal in the wastewater. The effects of solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on antibiotics removal were studied, experiment results showed that almost upper 80% of-antibiotics were removed at any SRT and HRT investigated during the whole A/O-MBR process. The reduction of SRT in phase 3 and 4 decreased selected antibiotics removal efficiency. Further studies showed that at short SRT, the change of HRT usually led to fluctuation of the antibiotics removal efficiencies due to the loading alternation. Meanwhile, batch experiments were performed to investigate antibiotics sorption and biodegradation by activated sludge. No evidence of biodegradation for TC, CTC and OTC was observed during the biodegradability tests, and adsorption was found to be the principal removal mechanism of tetracyclines by activated sludge, and adsorption and biodegradation for AMP. The outcomes of the present study demonstrated that the antibiotics SMX, SDZ, and AMP have the possibilities to be degraded biologically during wastewater treatment after an acclimatization of sludge.

AB Hospital wastewater and effluents from waste stabilization ponds in Kumasi, Ghana, are directly discharged as low quality water into nearby streams which are eventually used to irrigate vegetables. The presence of 12 commonly used antibiotics in Ghana (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, ampicillin, cefuroxime, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline) were investigated in water and lettuce samples collected in three different areas in Kumasi, Ghana. The water samples were from hospital wastewater, wastewater stabilization ponds, rivers and irrigation water, while the lettuce samples were from vegetable farms and market vendors. Antibiotics in water samples were extracted using SPE while antibiotics in lettuce samples were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction followed by SPE. All extracted antibiotics samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. All studied compounds were detected in concentrations significantly higher (p = 0.01) in hospital wastewater than in the other water sources. The highest concentration found in the present study was 15 mu g/L for ciprofloxacin in hospital wastewater. Irrigation water samples analyzed had concentrations of antibiotics up to 0.2 mu g/L. Wastewater stabilization ponds are low technology but effective means of removing antibiotics with removal efficiency up to 95% recorded in this study. However, some chemicals are still found in levels indicating medium to high risk of antibiotics resistance development in the environment. The total concentrations of antibiotics detected in edible lettuce tissues from vegetable farms and vegetable sellers at the markets were in the range of 12.0-104 and 11.0-41.4 ng/kg (fresh weight) respectively. The antibiotics found with high concentrations in all the samples were sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim. Furthermore, our study confirms the presence of seven antibiotics in lettuce from irrigation farms and markets, suggesting an indirect exposure of humans to antibiotics through vegetable consumption and drinking water in Ghana. However, estimated daily intake for a standard 60 kg woman was 0.3 ng/day, indicating low risk for human health. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage-based epidemiology was applied to examine geographic variations in methamphetamine (METH) and ketamine (MET) use in China. Influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from 36 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 18 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Mean METH loads of the cities ranged from 12.5 +/- 14.9 to 181.2 +/- 6.5 mg/1000 inh/d, whereas mean KET loads ranged from <0.2 to 89.6 +/- 27.4 mg/ 1000 inh/d. No clear geographical pattern was observed in METH use, although slightly lower use in north and east China relative to other regions can be suggested. In contrast, an overall increasing trend from the north to the south was evident for MET loads. Apparent METH removal was greater than 80% at most STPs, whereas KET removal was less than 50% at most STPs and was even negative (i.e., measured effluent concentrations were greater than influent concentrations) at a significant number of STPs. Results in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen indicate that METH use in China may have increased substantially since 2012, whereas MET use did not significantly change, if not decreased. Comparison between seizures and estimated consumptions reveals that seizures in most Chinese provinces are far less than consumptions. In several provinces (e.g., Guangdong and Yunan), however, seizures were found to exceed consumptions, indicating that a significant fraction of METH and MET seized in these provinces is destined for consumption in other places.

AB Irrigation with reclaimed wastewater may result in the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and their metabolites in the agroecosystem. In this study, we focused on two highly persistent anticonvulsant drugs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine and two of its metabolites (EP-CBZ and DiOH-CBZ), aiming to elucidate their behavior in agricultural ecosystem using batch and lysimeter experiments. Sorption of the studied compounds by soils was found to be governed mainly by the soil organic matter level. Sorption affinity of compounds to soils followed the order lamotrigine > carbamazepine > EP-CBZ > DiOH-CBZ. Sorption was reversible, and no competition between sorbates in bi-solute systems was observed. The results of the lysimeter studies were in accordance with batch experiment findings, demonstrating accumulation of lamotrigine and carbamazepine in top soil layers enriched with organic matter. Detection of carbamazepine and one of its metabolites in rain-fed wheat previously irrigated with reclaimed wastewater, indicates reversibility of their sorption, resulting in their potential leaching and their availability for plant uptake. This study demonstrates the long-term implication of introduction of PCs to the agroecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFs) constitute a wastewater treatment alternative to small communities due to the low operational cost, reduced energy consumption, and no sewage sludge production. Although much information is available about conventional water quality parameters in SSF constructed wetlands, few data are available regarding specific contaminants. In this paper, we focus on the behavior of three widely used pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, and carbamazepine) in two pilot SSF constructed wetlands planted with Phragmites australis and characterized by different water depths (i.e., 0.3 and 0.5 m). These SSFs partially treat the urban wastewater from a housing development (ca. 200 inhabitants). The three pharmaceuticals and bromide were continuously injected into the two SSFs during a period of 150-200 In, and the effluent concentration was simultaneously measured as 6 h composite samples. Their removal efficiency was calculated from the injected concentration, and the hydraulic parameters were evaluated and compared to bromide as tracer. In this regard, the behavior of clofibric acid was similar to that of bromide, and no sorption into the gravel bed occurred. On the other hand, carbamazepine showed a higher sorption than bromide and clofibric acid, which is attributable to its interaction on the gravel bed. Accordingly, the use of clofibric acid as a hydraulic tracer is proposed, taking into account its low residence time. lbuprofen removal was 81% in the shallow SSF and 48% in the deep one. Differences in removal efficiency could be explained by the less anaerobic environment of the shallow wetland.

AB The occurrence and fate of 36 emerging contaminants, belonging to five different classes, (benzotriazoles, BTRs; benzothiazoles, BTHs; perfluorinated compounds, PFCs; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs and endocrine disruptors, EDCs) were investigated in raw, treated wastewater (both particulate and dissolved phases), and in sludge from a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Athens, Greece. The average concentrations of BTRs, BTHs, NSAIDs and EDCs in raw wastewater ranged between 11 ng L-1 and 727 mu g L-1, while PFCs did not exceed 100 ng L-1. In dewatered sludge, the average concentrations ranged between 0.8 ng g(-1), dw (perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA) and 3895 ng g(-1) dw (nonylphenol, NP). The distribution of emerging contaminants between particulate and dissolved phase was different among the compounds. BTRs and BTHs showed lower solid-liquid distribution coefficients (K-d) than all other compounds. For 9 over the 27 compounds detected in influents, the removal efficiency was higher than 70%, while the others either were removed to a lesser extent or detected at higher concentrations in effluents. Based on this, advanced treatment processes should be applied in the future for achieving adequate emerging contaminants removal in STPs. Regarding removal mechanisms, almost 60% of BTRs and 30 to 75% of BTHs were removed in bioreactors, while the contribution of primary and secondary clarifiers was of minor importance. Sorption to primary sludge was a significant mechanism affecting EDCs fate in STP.

AB Seasonal removal efficiency of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products was monitored in a wastewater treatment plant in esk, Budjovice, Czech Republic, over a period of 1 year (total amount of samples, n = 272). The studied compounds included four UV filters, three analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs and nine anti-hypertensive/cardiovascular drugs. In most cases, elimination of the substances was incomplete, and overall removal rates varied strongly from -38 to 100 %. Therefore, it was difficult to establish a general trend for each therapeutic group. Based on the removal efficiencies (REs) over the year, three groups of target compounds were observed. A few compounds (benzophenon-1, valsartan, isradipine and furosemide) were not fully removed, but their REs were greater than 50 %. The second group of analytes, consisting of 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, tramadol, sotalol, metoprolol, atenolol and diclofenac, showed a very low RE (lower than 50 %). The third group of compounds showed extremely variable RE (benzophenon-3 and benzophenon-4, codeine, verapamil, diltiazem and bisoprolol). There were significant seasonal trends in the observed REs, with reduced efficiencies in colder months.

AB Over the past few years, the presence of steroid estrogens in the environment has become a major concern. In this study, the concentrations of estrone (E1 ), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) were measured in some wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Iran. These samples were collected from the municipal, rural, livestock, commercial, and hospital WWTPs, extracted by dispersive liquid-liquid micro extraction (DLLME) technique, derivatized, and detected by GC/MS. In these treatment plants, various processes including conventional activated sludge (CAS), aerated lagoon (AL), moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), and activated sludge with wetland (AS + WL) are used. The highest concentration of hormones was observed in the influents and effluents of livestock, municipal, commercial, and hospital WWTPs, respectively. The maximum elimination rate was obtained in MBBR followed by AS + WL, CAS and AL. The biodegradation and adsorption rates along with adsorption coefficients of lg k(d) and lg k(oc) were measured for all target compounds.

AB This study aimed at enhancing knowledge on the fate of diclofenac (DF), together with its main human metabolite 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (4'OHDF), during wastewater treatment by using a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The reactor was fed continuously with non-radiolabelled diclofenac for a one month period prior to a single pulse of a C-14-radiolabelled solution of DF and 4'OHDF. The solution spike contained approximately 25% 4'OHDF and 65% DF, which corresponds to the ratio observed in municipal sewage, as well as traces of two other metabolites. The radioactivity was monitored for a total of twelve days in the various output streams. The calculation of the complete mass balance in the system demonstrated that the major part of the radioactivity left the reactor with the permeate (88.7%), while 2.1% was recovered in the excess sludge. Negligible amounts were recovered in the off-gas traps and on the membranes. Chromatographic analyses of effluent samples, by means of HPLC-MS coupled in parallel to a radiodetector, displayed a different pattern than the one of the spiked solution. It showed the occurrence of three additional metabolites.

AB The presence and elimination of 25 emerging contaminants in two full-scale Spanish wastewater treatment plants was studied. The tertiary treatment systems consisted of coagulation, flocculation lamellar settlement and filtration (pulsed-bed sand filters) units, and disinfection was carried out by medium pressure UV light lamps and chlorination. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were found to be the emerging contaminants with the highest concentrations in secondary effluents. Photodegradable emerging contaminants (e.g. ketoprofen, triclosan and diclofenac) were removed by filtration-UV light radiation-chlorination whereas most hydrophobic compounds (e.g. galaxolide and tonalide) were eliminated by coagulation-flocculation followed by lamellar clarification, a unit in which a seasonal trend was observed. Overall mass removal efficiency was about 60%. 1-(8-Chlorocarbazolyl) acetic acid, an intermediate product of the photodegradation of diclofenac, was detected after filtration-UV-chlorination, but not after coagulation-flocculation and lamellar clarification. This study demonstrated potential for general applicability of two established tertiary treatment systems to eliminate emerging contaminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products occurring in municipal sewage are ionizing substances, and their partitioning behaviour is affected by ionic interactions with solid matrices. In activated sludge systems, such interactions have currently not been adequately understood and described, particularly for zwitterionic chemicals. Here we present an assessment of the effects of pH and iron salt dosing on the sorption of ciprofloxacin onto activated sludge using laboratory experiments and full-scale fate modelling. Experimental results were described with Freundlich isotherms and showed that non-linear sorption occurred under all the conditions tested. The greatest sorption potential was measured at pH = 7.4, at which ciprofloxacin is speciated mostly as zwitterion. iron salt dosing increased sorption under aerobic and, to a lesser extent, anoxic conditions, whereas no effect was registered under anaerobic conditions.
   The activated sludge model for xenobiotics (ASM-X) was extended with Freundlich-based sorption kinetics and used to predict the fate of ciprofloxacin in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Scenario simulations, using experimental Freundlich parameters, were used to identify whether the assessed factors caused a significant increase of aqueous ciprofloxacin concentration in full-scale bioreactors. Simulation results suggest that a pH increase, rather than a reduction in iron salt dosing, could be responsible for a systematic deterioration of sorption of ciprofloxacin in the WWTP.

AB The presence of natural estrogens, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (EI) and estriol (M), as well as estrogenic activity in wastewater influents and secondary effluents were investigated in 20 full-scale wastewater treatment plants in Japan. In all of the influent samples, natural estrogens were detected at concentrations above the minimum limits of detection (0.5 ng/L). The concentrations of natural estrogens detected in the effluent of oxidation ditch plants were generally lower than previously reported values. On the other hand, in the conventional activated sludge plants, increments of El during biological treatment were frequently observed although E2 and E3 were removed effectively in the process. The removal rates of natural estrogens or estrogenic activity show no observed statistical relationship with the solids retention time (SRT) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT). However, the plants with high SRT or HRT generally showed high and stable removal of both natural estrogens and estrogenic activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PHARMACEUTICAL RESIDUES; SEWAGE; QUANTITIES
AB This article presents an approach to describing the presence of measurable pharmaceutical residuals originating in municipal sewage, which in turn provides a means of predicting the likely appearance of individual contaminants in effluents and downstream water sources. Trace organic contaminants come from many sources in wastewater. Their health significance is unknown and a problem for toxicologists to define. Analytical technology now enables measurement of many organic contaminants at very low concentrations and for which no adequate understanding of health significance has been developed. The study was conducted to show how a class of contaminants (pharmaceutical residuals) can be described and to demonstrate the presence of unmeasurable residuals. Regulators will increasingly be faced with pressure to assure safety without a clear toxicological basis for measuring risk. This work provides a blueprint for describing the presence and distribution of other groups of trace organic contaminants. It also underscores the urgent need for development of fundamental toxicological principles for assessing potential significance to human health from exposure to trace and ultratrace contaminants and mixtures.-LH.

AB In this study a probabilistic risk assessment was applied to investigate the environmental risks for the European aquatic environment associated with triclosan (TCS) occurrence in treated wastewater. The concentrations of TCS in effluents of European Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) were recorded through literature review, while toxicity data was collected for three groups of aquatic organisms (algae, Daphnia magna and fish). The ratio of Measured Environmental Concentration (MEC) and Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC), expressed as a Risk Quotient (RQ), was calculated for risk characterization, while Monte Carlo simulation was applied to quantify the associated uncertainty. TCS monitoring data was available for 349 STPs located in 15 out of the 50 European countries. Its mean concentrations in STPs effluents ranged between 2.2 ng L-1 and 47,800 ng L-1. Higher TCS concentrations were observed in primarily treated wastewater; whereas no differences among countries or among secondary and tertiary effluents on the basis of the whole set of collected data were found. The 95th percentile of RQ for TCS was higher than 1 (in algae) for rivers with dilution factors (DFs) equal to or lower than 100, when the maximum concentration values were used, whereas the 95th percentile of RQ exceeded 1 for rivers with DFs up to 10, in cases where the calculations were based on mean concentration values. The probability that RQ exceeds 1 in rivers (for algae) ranged from 0.2% (DF = 1000) to 45% (DF = 2), when calculations are based on mean concentration values. The corresponding probabilities in rivers with DFs equal to 2 for Daphnia magna and fish were 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. We propose that TCS monitoring should be intensified, especially on smaller rivers, to verify the findings of this study for possible environmental risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of pH on the degradation of the pharmaceutical diclofenac (DCF) by the solar/photo-Fenton process was investigated using ammonium iron(III) citrate complex (FecitNH(4)). Although the degradation efficiency decreased as the pH increased (in the pH range 5 to 8), the DCF concentration was lower than its limit of detection after 45 min irradiation while 77% of the total organic carbon was removed after 150 min irradiation at initial pH 7 (without further adjustment). A pseudo-first-order kinetics of DCF degradation was observed, which kinetic constant increased with the increase of the concentrations of FecitNH(4) and H2O2. Lower DCF degradation was observed when present in a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent sample, mainly due to the high concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate at pH 7. However, after adjusting the pH to 5, the DCF concentration was lower than its detection limit after 75 min irradiation.

AB This study investigates the effect of psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures on the anaerobic treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater, in terms of biogas production, occurrence of 30 pharmaceutical compounds of veterinary use, 4 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which provide resistance to tetracyclines (tetW), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (ermB) and sulfonamides (sull) antibiotics, as well as class I integron-integrase gene (Mill), related to horizontal gene transfer. The highest methane yield was obtained at a mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C) (323 mL CH4/g TCOD) followed by the yield obtained at thermophilic temperature (53 degrees C) (242 mL CH4/g TCOD). Regarding pharmaceuticals, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, and lincomycin were the most abundant in the slaughterhouse wastewater, being detected predominantly in the solid phase (with median concentrations >200 mu g/kg dry weight). On the other hand, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, lincomycin and ibuprofen were the most predominant in the anaerobic digestate regardless of the treatment temperature. Psychrophilic temperatures (21 degrees C) exhibited moderate to low pharmaceuticals removal, while a large fraction of them were removed at a thermophilic temperature reaching 70-90% removals for tetracycline, macrolides and one sulfonamide (sulfapyridine).
   The highest relative abundance of the quantified ARGs was found at 53 degrees C, suggesting that thermophilic temperatures normally associated with better removals of pathogens do not necessarily show better removals of antibiotic resistance genes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The anti-microbial substance triclosan can partition to sewage sludge during wastewater treatment and subsequently transfer to soil when applied to land. Here, we describe the fate of triclosan in a one-year plot experiment on three different soils receiving sludge. Triclosan and methyl-triclosan concentrations were measured in soil samples collected monthly from three depths. A large fraction of triclosan loss appeared to be explained by transformation to methyl-triclosan. After 12 months less than 20% of the initial triclosan was recovered from each soil. However, the majority was recovered as methyl-triclosan. Most of the chemical recovered at the end of the experiment (both triclosan and methyl-triclosan) was still in the top 10 cm layer, although there was translocation to lower soil horizons in all three soils. Between 16.5 and 50.6% of the applied triclosan was unaccounted for after 12 months either as a consequence of degradation or the formation of non-extractable residues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Namibia is the driest sub-Saharan country in Africa. Namibia's capital, Windhoek, reclaims sewage water for domestic use at the Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (GWRP). Risks associated with sewage effluent and reclaimed sewage should be closely monitored; therefore water at the Gammams Sewage Treatment Plant (GSTP) inlet and outlet, as well as reclaimed water from the GWRP, were assayed using selected bioassays. Samples collected were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assays and chromogenic tests for steroid hormones, neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and inflammatory activity. Estradiol level at the sewage treatment inlet was 78 pg/ml and the treated sewage level showed an 83% to 95% reduction in this, while after reclamation the level was below detection limit. Estrone concentrations at the sewage treatment inlet ranged from 10 to 161 pg/ml. Sewage treatment reduced estrone by between 85% and 92%. After reclamation the level of estrone was below detection limit. Testosterone ranged between 162 and 405 pg/ml at the sewage plant inlet. Sewage treatment removed 96% of the initial testosterone. The residual testosterone was effectively removed by processes in GWRP and after reclamation no testosterone was detected in water. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition at the sewage treatment inlet was 50% while it was only 27% after sewage treatment. After reclamation AChE inhibition was not detected. Only water at the sewage inlet in March and February showed cytotoxicity. High inflammatory activity was detected at the sewage plant inlet. Sewage treatment reduced inflammatory activity by 64%. After reclamation low inflammatory activity was induced. Treated sewage used for reclamation tested positive for most of the biomarkers and can pose a risk to human health. However, reclamation successfully removed these contaminants. Due to the presence of contaminants in the intake water at the reclamation plant, it is essential to routinely monitor the water produced by the reclamation plant for potential residues that can adversely affect human health.

AB Cytostatic drug residues in the aqueous environment are of concern due to their possible adverse effects on nontarget organisms. Here we report the occurrence and removal efficiency of cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) by biological and abiotic treatments including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Cyclophosphamide was detected in hospital wastewaters (14-22,000 ng L-1), wastewater treatment plant influents (19-27 ng L-1) and effluent (17 ng L-1), whereas IF was detected only in hospital wastewaters (48-6800 ng L-1). The highest removal efficiency during biological treatment (attached growth biomass in a flow through bioreactor) was 59 +/- 15% and 35 +/- 9.3% for CP and IF, respectively. Also reported are the removal efficiencies of both compounds from wastewater using hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), ozonation (O-3) and/or UV, either individually or in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrodynamic cavitation did not remove CP and IF to any significant degree. The highest removal efficiencies: 99 +/- 0.71% for CP and 94 +/- 2.4% for IF, were achieved using UV/O-3/H2O2 at 5 g L-1 for 120 min. When combined with biological treatment, removal efficiencies were >99% for both compounds. This is the first report of combined biological and AOP treatment of CP and IF from wastewater with a removal efficiency >99%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ozonation of an effluent from the secondary clarifier of two Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants was performed by using alkaline ozone and a combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Alkaline ozonation achieved only a moderate degree of mineralization, essentially concentrated during the first few minutes; but the addition of hydrogen peroxide eventually led to a complete mineralization. The evolution of total organic carbon (TOC) as a measure of the extent of mineralization and the concentration dissolved ozone were analyzed and linked in a kinetic model whose parameter represented the product of the exposure to hydroxyl radicals and the kinetic constant of indirect ozonation. This rate parameter yielded the highest values during the first part of O-3/H2O2 runs. The kinetic constant for the decomposition of ozone at the end of the run was also measured and computed for the non-oxidizable water matrix and yielded essentially the same values regardless of whether or not hydrogen peroxide was used. A group of 33 organic compounds, mainly pharmaceuticals and some relevant metabolites present in the wastewater effluents, were evaluated before and after the ozonation process using a liquid chromatography-hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap system (LC-QqLIT-MS). The results demonstrate that the ozonation degrades these compounds with efficiencies of over 99% in most cases, even under low mineralization conditions in alkaline ozonation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Several advanced treatments, such as ozonation or activated carbon adsorption, are currently considered for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, little is known on the overall performances of a WWTP upgraded with those processes and the benefits provided regarding the elimination of multiple families of OMPs. In this study, 5 sampling campaigns were performed to determine the removal of 48 OMPs in a WWTP followed by an activated carbon pilot. The primary treatment had no effect on OMPs (removals < 20%), whereas the biological treatment removed OMPs that can be easily sorbed onto sludges or biodegraded (>60%). The additional elimination provided by the advanced treatment was not significant (<10%) for OMPs already well removed in the WWTP) but was substantial (>30%) for recalcitrant OMPs. Removals higher than 60% were obtained for all OMPs (except azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole) over the WWTP and the activated carbon pilot. The adsorption conditions (10 g/m(3) fresh activated 'Carbon addition) were not sufficient to achieve the 80% removal targeted in Switzerland for compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment. A higher dose of activated carbon or the combination with another advanced treatment should be used to achieve a satisfactory removal of those compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distributions of six polycyclic musks were studied in influent, primary and effluent waters from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Guangdong. Five polycyclic musk compounds, 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4-Hinden-4-one (DPMI), 4-acetyl-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butylindan (ADBI), 6-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindan (AHMI), 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexah ydro-4,6,6,7,8,8 -hexa methylcyclopenta(g) -2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetraliydronaphthalene (AHTN) were found in wastewater in the WWTP. DPML HHCB and AHTN were measured at 0.38-0.69, 11.5-146, 0.89-3.47 mu g/l, respectively, in influents. Meanwhile 0.06-0.10 mu g/l DPM1, 0.95-2.05 mu g/l HHCB, 0. 10-0. 14 mu g/l AHTN were detected in effluents, ADBI and AHMI were also detected in some primary waters and effluents. The results suggested that wastewater from cosmetic plants cause high loadings of polycyclic musks to this WWTP. Under the currently applied treatment technology, the removal efficiencies achieved were 61-75% for DPMI, 86-97% for HHCB and 87-96% for AHTN by transfer to sludge as the main removal route.

AB The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method coupled with an automated solid-phase extraction procedure has been developed to identify 22 psychiatric pharmaceuticals, including seven anxiolytic-sedative-hypnotics, six antidepressants, and nine anti-schizophrenia drugs, in wastewater samples from two psychiatric hospital wastewater treatment plants (P-WWTPs) and three municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs) in Beijing, China. Analyte recoveries from splicing experiments in the WWTP influent and effluent at three concentrations ranged from 70% to 110%, excluding sulpiride, ziprasidone, and olanzapine. Method detection limits for five, eight, and nine analytes in the WWTP influent and effluent were 20-80, 1-16, and <1 ng L-1, respectively. High psychiatric pharmaceutical concentrations (e.g., similar to 942 ng L-1 oxazepam, 5552-12,782 ng L-1 clozapine, 2762-9832 ng L(-1)sulpiride, and 2030-4967 ng L-lquetiapine) were frequently observed in P-WWTP influent compared to M-WWTPs. Although P-WWTPs typically had higher removal rates, significantly higher concentrations of the target compounds were observed in the P-WWTP secondary effluent than in the M-WWTP influent (e.g., 752 ng L-1 oxazepam, 8183 ng L-1 clozapine, 10,833 ng L-1 sulpiride, and 1168 ng L-1 quetiapine). Thus, the discharge control of psychiatric pharmaceuticals from psychiatric hospitals requires improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed at determining the presence and removal rate achieved through the main treatment stages of a full-scale wastewater reclamation plant for some classes of Organic Micropollutants. Furthermore, the human health risk due to the reuse of the final effluent containing residual concentrations of these pollutants for non-potable applications was assessed. The 8-months monitoring campaign on the influent and effluent of the treatment stages of the plant highlighted that the main removal took place in the bioreactor, reaching median removal of 99 %, 97 %, 60 % 76 %, 71 %, 96 % and 100 %, for benzoylecgonine, cocaine, methamphetamine, trimetoprim, sulfadiazine, ketoprofene and caffeine, respectively. This result was also confirmed by the application of the principal component analysis. A further abatement, although slight, occurred in the tertiary compartment (made up by filtration, UV disinfection and chlorination) for sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ketoprofen, determining a final median removal of 50 %, 94 % and 98 %, respectively. A significant correlation between the removal processes of the investigated organic micropollutants and the traditional water quality parameters was also found out. The human health risk for incidental ingestion and dermal contact resulted to be always below 1 under average and worst scenarios, which indicates that the risk can be considered acceptable.

AB Six pilot-scale subsurface flow treatment wetlands loaded with primary treated municipal wastewater were monitored over one year for classical wastewater parameters and a set of emerging organic compounds (ECOs) serving as process indicators for biodegradation: caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame, and carbamazepine. The wetland technologies investigated included conventional horizontal flow, unsaturated vertical flow (single and two-stage), horizontal flow with aeration, vertical flow with aeration, and reciprocating. Treatment efficiency for classical wastewater parameters and EOCs generally increased with increasing design complexity and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The two aerated wetlands and the two-stage vertical flow system showed the highest EOC removal, and the best performance in warm season and most robust performance in the cold season. These three systems performed better than the adjacent conventional WWTP with respect to EOC removal. Acesulfame was observed to be removed (>90%) by intensified wetland systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter during the warm season. Elevated temperature and high oxygen content (aerobic conditions) proved beneficial for EOC removal. For EOCs of moderate to low biodegradability, the co-occurrence of aerobic conditions and low content of readily available carbon appears essential for efficient removal. Such conditions occurred in the aerated systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural estrogens are important endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), which may pose adverse effects on our environment. To avoid time-consuming sample preparation and chemical analysis, estimation of their concentrations in municipal wastewater based on their human urine/feces excretion rates has been generally adopted. However, the data of excretion rates available are very limited and show significant difference among countries. In the context of increasing reporting on the concentrations of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater around the world, this study presented a simple method to estimate their human excretion rates based on the concentrations of natural estrogens in raw sewage. The estimated human excretion rates of natural estrogens among ten countries were obtained, which totally covered over 33 million population. Among these, Brazilians had the largest excretion rates with estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as 236.9 and 60 mu g/day/P, respectively, while Iran had the lowest value of 2 mu g/day/P for E1 and 0.5 mu g/day/P for E2. The average estimated human excretion rates of E1, E2, and estriol (E3) are 17.3, 6.4, and 39.7 mu g/day/P, respectively. When the estimated human excretion rates obtained were applied for prediction, the predicted results showed better accuracies than those based on human urinary/feces excretion rates. The method in this study is simple, cost-effective and time-saving, which may be widely applied.

AB Sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct produced in wastewater treatment. Reusing nutrient-rich sludge will diminish the amount of waste ending in soil dumping areas and will promote circular economy. However, during sewage treatment process, several potentially harmful organic chemicals are retained in sludge, but proving the safety of processed sludge will promote its more extensive use in agriculture and landscaping.
   Environmental risk assessment of sludge requires new methods of characterizing its suitability for various circular economy applications. Bioavailable and bioaccessible fractions are key variables indicating leaching, transport, and bioaccumulation capacity. Also, sludge treatments have a significant effect on chemical status and resulting environmental risks. In this study, the concentrations of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), methyl triclosan (mTCS), and selected active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were determined in different sludge treatments and fractions. Passive samplers were used to characterize the bioavailable and bioaccessible fractions, and the sampler extracts along the sludge and filtrate samples were utilized in the bioassays.
   The TCS and PAH concentrations did not decrease as the sludge was digested, but the contents diminished after composting. Also, mTCS concentration decreased after composting. The API concentrations were lower in digested sludge than in secondary sludge.
   Digested sludge was toxic for Aliivibrio fischeri, but after composting, toxicity was not observed. However, for Daphnia magna, passive sampler extracts of all sludge treatments were either acutely (immobility) or chronically (reproduction) toxic. Secondary and digested sludge sampler extracts were cytotoxic, and secondary sludge extract was also genotoxic. The measured chemical concentration levels did not explain the toxicity of the samples based on the reported toxicity thresholds.

AB The stereoselectivity of R,S-venlafaxine and its metabolites R,S-O-desmethylvenlafaxine, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, O,N-didesmethylvenlafaxine, N,N-didesmethylvenlafaxine and tridesmethylvenlafaxine was studied in three processes: (i) anaerobic and aerobic laboratory scale tests; (ii) six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operating under different conditions: and (iii) a variety of wastewater treatments including conventional activated sludge, natural attenuation along a receiving river stream and storage in operational and seasonal reservoirs. In the laboratory and field studies, the degradation of the venlafaxine yielded O-desmethylvenalfaxine as the dominant metabolite under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Venlafaxine was almost exclusively converted to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under anaerobic conditions, but only a fraction of the drug was transformed to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under aerobic conditions. Degradation of venlafaxine involved only small stereoisomeric selectivity. In contrast, the degradation of O-desmethylvenlafaxine yielded remarkable S to R enrichment under aerobic conditions but none under anaerobic conditions. Determination of venlafaxine and its metabolites in the WWTPs agreed well with the stereoselectivity observed in the laboratory studies. Our results suggest that the levels of the drug and its metabolites and the stereoisomeric enrichment of the metabolite and its parent drug can be used for source tracking and for discrimination between domestic and nondomestic wastewater pollution. This was indeed demonstrated in the investigations carried out at the Jerusalem WWTP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study shows the results of an experimental survey conducted over 34 months on 76 full-scale Wastewater Treatment Plants located in central Italy with the aim to determine the influent and effluent concentrations of 13 Organic Micropollutants belonging to the class of illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals and steroids. The survey focused on a large set of plants differing for the main characteristics (e.g. treatment capacity, type of lay-out). Based on the values measured in the influent and effluent, removal efficiency of each contaminant in each plant was also determined, as well as the seasonal variation of the influent concentration. Among the monitored pollutants, some illicit drugs (i.e. Benzoylecgonine, 11 -nor-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and Ketoprofen showed the highest concentrations in the influent and were also the most frequently detected in the wastewater; nonetheless, the plants were capable of removing these pollutants at high extent (median removal value of 70 %, 65 % and 74 %, respectively). On the other side, steroid concentrations were in most cases under the detection limits. About the type of lay-out, the comparison of the efficiency obtained by the different plants showed that combination of secondary and tertiary treatment provides the best removal for most of the target Organic Micropollutants.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation is a practical solution for overcoming water scarcity, especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world. However, there are several potential environmental and health-related risks associated with this practice. One such risk stems from the fact that TWW irrigation may increase antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in soil bacteria, potentially contributing to the global propagation of clinical AR. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been recognized as significant environmental AR reservoirs due to selective pressure generated by antibiotics and other compounds that are frequently detected in effluents. This review summarizes a myriad of recent studies that have assessed the impact of anthropogenic practices on AR in environmental bacterial communities, with specific emphasis on elucidating the potential effects of TWW irrigation on AR in the soil microbiome. Based on the current state of the art, we conclude that contradictory to freshwater environments where WWTP effluent influx tends to expand antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes levels, TWW irrigation does not seem to impact AR levels in the soil microbiome. Although this conclusion is a cause for cautious optimism regarding the future implementation of TWW irrigation, we conclude that further studies aimed at assessing the scope of horizontal gene transfer between effluent-associated ARB and soil bacteria need to be further conducted before ruling out the possible contribution of TWW irrigation to antibiotic-resistant reservoirs in irrigated soils.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a combined pre/post-closure assessment at a long-term wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) site at Fort Gordon near Augusta, Georgia. Here, we assess select endocrine-active chemicals and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure prior to closure of the WWTP. Substantial downstream transport and limited instream attenuation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was observed in Spirit Creek over a 2.2-km stream segment downstream of the WWTP outfall. A modest decline (less than 20% in all cases) in surface water detections was observed with increasing distance downstream of the WWTP and attributed to partitioning to the sediment. Estrogens detected in surface water in this study included estrone (E1), 17-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). The 5ng/l and higher mean estrogen concentrations observed in downstream locations indicated that the potential for endocrine disruption was substantial. Concentrations of alkylphenol ethoxylate (APE) metabolite EDCs also remained statistically elevated above levels observed at the upstream control site. Wastewater-derived pharmaceutical and APE metabolites were detected in the outflow of Spirit Lake, indicating the potential for EDC transport to aquatic ecosystems downstream of Fort Gordon. The results indicate substantial EDC occurrence, downstream transport, and persistence under continuous supply conditions and provide a baseline for a rare evaluation of ecosystem response to WWTP closure.

AB A cost-effective alternative approach capable of determining the prevalence of substance use in communities can complement the existing efforts of combating drug abuse and addiction. In this study, the prevalence of 10 illicit and 19 prescribed psychoactive drugs of potential abuse was determined utilizing wastewater-based epidemiology, and compared in two adjoined urban communities and a rural community. This is the first application of the Monte Carlo simulation method to account multiple uncertainties and propagation of errors associated with the individual parameter of wastewater based epidemiological estimations in the U.S. A significantly higher prevalence of cocaine [3830 (mean difference, MD: 2960) mg/d/1000 people] was found in the central business district while the per-capita consumption rates of amphetamine [738 (MD: 338) mg/d/1000 people] and methamphetamine [1660 (MD: 629) mg/d/1000 people] were higher in a rural community. Among narcotics, the per-capita consumption rate of fentanyl and morphine was significantly higher in urban communities while codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and buprenorphine were dominant in a rural community. The significantly higher prevalence of buprenorphine ("20-30 folds), oxycodone ((similar to)2-3 folds), and alprazolam ((similar to)2-3 folds) determined in these communities compared to the conventional estimates based on the electronically reported prescriptions and drug-related inpatient hospitalizations suggest the abuse of these drugs.

AB The occurrence and dissipation of 14 selected antibiotics comprising tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and chloramphenicols were investigated in two swine wastewater treatment systems in east China in three sampling surveys. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The aqueous samples were unavoidably contaminated with antibiotics and the target antibiotics present in high contaminations were tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, and sulfadiazine, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminants reaching 41.6 x 10(3), 23.8 x 10(3), 13.7 x 10(3), 685.6 x 10(3), and 98.8 x 10(3) ng/l, respectively. The concentration ranges of these compounds were in the same order of magnitude as previously reported values in China and elsewhere. Biological activity can significantly degrade the contaminants but showed low efficiencies of dissipation of other analytes at lower levels of contamination. The removal efficiencies varied for different compounds and depended on their physiochemical properties and the treatment processes utilized at each waste treatment plant. Some target antibiotics were present in feeds obtained from swine farms at a range of average concentrations between 0.1 and 46.8 mu g/kg. However, the extremely high levels of the main contaminants found in these wastewaters cannot be ascribed solely to the pattern of consumption of prescription feeds.

AB The recycling of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation and road cleaning is an important strategy to minimize water scarcity in megacities. However, little is known regarding the potential accumulation of antibiotics contained in reclaimed wastewater in urban soil. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of eight quinolones (QNs), nine sulfonamides (SAs), and five macrolides (MLs) antibiotics in urban surface soil in Beijing and Shanghai, China. QNs, especially norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were the predominant antibiotics in urban surface soil, and NOR revealed the highest average concentration of 94.6 mu g kg(-1). The antibiotic concentrations in urban soil in our study were higher than those detected in agricultural soils after long-term wastewater irrigation and manure fertilization. The concentrations of antibiotics in Shanghai urban soil showed a significant negative correlation with soil pH and a positive correlation with total organic carbon (TOC), reflecting the effect of speciation and soil organic matter content on sorption and retention. In addition, antibiotic concentrations in the urban soil were positively correlated with heavy metal contents, likely due to their coexistence in reclaimed wastewater and the promoting effect of metals on the sorption of antibiotics. In several soil samples, NOR, OFL, CIP, enrofloxacin (ENR), and fleroxacin (FLE) showed higher concentrations than the trigger value of 100 mu g kg(-1) in soil, indicating a potential risk for the environment.

AB Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i, such as Sildenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenafil, mainly prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction) and their generic drug equivalents have been widely marketed and consumed in Korea. From the concentrations detected in wastewater, we could deduce that relatively large amounts of PDE-5i were consumed without a legal prescription. Thus, PDE-5i's presence in the environment via sewage is unavoidable, and their environmental fate within a sewage treatment plant (STP) should be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of three PDE-5i analogs in the influent and effluent of two STPs and the receiving water bodies. The PDE-5i concentration in total reached 62 +/- 12 (STP#1) and 88 +/- 37 ng L-1 (STP#2) in the sewage influent; about 70% of it was Sildenafil in both STPs. However, they were hardly removed by the STPs as the removal efficiency of the STPs was less than 10%+/- 5%. Therefore, the pharmaceuticals were detected in the receiving water (lower than 7 ng L(-1)as a total amount) and the concentration slightly increased downstream of the STPs. A simple mass balance model applied for the compounds in the STP effluent and receiving water bodies also confirmed that the discharged PDE-5i were quite persistent. Lastly, we identified temporal and regional patterns in the consumption of the drugs from daily variations of PDE-5i in the influent to these two STPs. For instance, the levels of PDE-5i in the sewage significantly increased on weekends (from Friday to Saturday), and especially in the area where adult-entertainment businesses are common. We estimated that the amount of PDE-5i consumption in this area was 31% higher than that in the area with fewer nightlife spots. Considering that they are pharmaceutically active and resistant to treatment processes within an STP, it is advised that a regular monitoring and management program for PDE-5i should be developed to prevent the discharge of the pharmaceuticals into the water environment.

AB Wastewater and surface water samples, extracted with four solid-phase extraction cartridges of different chemistries, were suspect-screened for the anticonvulsant lamotrigine (LMG), its metabolites, and related compounds. LMG, three human metabolites, and a LMG synthetic impurity (OXO-LMG) were detected. Preliminary results showed significantly higher concentrations of OXO-LMG in wastewater effluent, suggesting its formation in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, biodegradation experiments with activated sludge demonstrated that LMG is resistant to degradation and that its human metabolite lamotrigine-N-2-glucuronide (LMG-N2-G) is the actual source of OXO-LMG in WWTPs. In batch reactors, LMG-N2-G was transformed, following pseudo-first-order kinetics to OXO-LMG and LMG, but kinetic experiments suggested an incomplete mass balance. A fragment ion search applied to batch-reactor and environmental samples revealed another transformation product (TP), formed by LMG-N2-G oxidation, which was identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Accounting for all TPs detected, a total mass balance at two concentration levels in batch reactors was closed at 86% and 102%, respectively. In three WWTPs, the total mass balance of LMG-N2-G ranged from 71 to 102%. Finally, LMG-N2-G and its TPs were detected in surface water samples with median concentration ranges of 23-139 ng L-1. The results of this study suggest that glucuronides of pharmaceuticals might also be sources of yet undiscovered, but environmentally relevant, transformation products.

AB The elimination of sulfonamides, macrolides and trimethoprim from raw wastewater was investigated in several municipal wastewater treatment plants. Primary treatment provided no significant elimination for the investigated Substances. Similar eliminations were observed in the secondary treatment of two conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems and a fixed-bed reactor (FBR). Sulfamethoxazole, including the fraction present as N-4-acetyl-sulfainethoxazole, was eliminated by approximately 60% in comparison to about 80% in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) independently of the solid retention time (SRT), indicating a positive correlation of the observed elimination to the organic substrate concentration. The elimination for macrolides and trimethoprim varied significantly between the different sampling campaigns in the two CAS systems and in the FBR. In the MBR, these analytes were eliminated up to 50% at SRTof 16 +/- 2 and 33 +/- 3 d. Trimethoprim, clarithromycin and dehydro-erythromycin showed a higher elimination of up to 90% at a SRT of 60-80 d indicating a correlation with reduced substrate loading (SL). Together with the high SRT, the SL may lead to an increased biodiversity of the active biomass, resulting in a broader range of degradation pathways available. Two investigated sand filters showed different elimination behavior. One led to a significant elimination of most macrolides (17-23%) and trimethoprim (74 +/- 14%), while no elimination was observed in the other sand filter investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several micropollutants show low removal efficiencies in conventional sewage treatment plants, and therefore enter the aquatic environment. To reduce the levels of micropollutants in sewage effluent, and thereby the effects on biota, a number of extra treatment steps are currently being evaluated. Two such techniques are ozonation and adsorption onto activated carbon. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of Sweden's first full-scale ozonation treatment plant at removing a number of antibiotics, antimycotics and biocides. The effect of adding granular activated carbon (GAC) on a pilot scale and pilot-scale ozonation were also evaluated. The conventional treatment (13,000 PE) with the add-on of full-scale ozonation (0.55 g O-3/g Total organic carbon (TOC)) was able to remove most of the studied compounds (>90%), except for benzotriazoles and fluconazole (<50%). Adsorption on GAC on a pilot scale showed a higher removal efficiency than ozonation (>80% for all studied compounds). Three types of GAC were evaluated and shown to have different removal efficiencies. In particular, the GAC with the smallest particle sizes exhibited the highest removal efficiency. The results demonstrate that it is important to select an appropriate type of carbon to achieve the removal goal for specific target compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is recognized as a sink of moderate to high lipophilic compounds resistant to biodegradation. Herein, we investigate the presence of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge combining the information provided by mass spectrometry detection, following ultra-performance liquid chromatog-raphy (UPLC), with the use of an accurate spectral database of pesticides and pharmaceuticals. In a first step, the performance of matrix solid-phase dispersion, as sample preparation technique, and two non-target data acquisition strategies (data dependent, DDA, and data independent analysis modes, DIA), used in combination with a UPLC quadrupole time-of-flight system, are assessed using a selection of deuterated compounds added either to freeze-dried sludge samples, or to sludge extracts. Possibilities and limitations of both modes are discussed. Following the DDA approach, a group of 68 micropollutants was identified in sludge from different STPs. Some of them are reported in this compartment for the first time. Finally, semi-quantitative concentration data are reported for a group of 37 pollutants in samples obtained from 16 STPs. Out of them, 10 pharmaceuticals, showing detection frequencies and median sludge residues above 50% and 100 ng g(-1), respectively; are highlighted as pollutants to be monitored in sludge in order to understand their behaviour during the wastewater treatment.

AB One of the most challenging environmental threats of the last two decades is the effects of emerging pollutants (EPs) such as pharmaceutical compounds or industrial additives. Diclofenac and bisphenol A have regularly been found in wastewater treatment plants, and in soils and water bodies because of their extensive usage and their recalcitrant nature. Due to the fact of this adversity, fungal communities play an important role in being able to safely degrade EPs. In this work, we obtained a sewage sludge sample to study both the culturable and non-culturable microorganisms through DNA extraction and massive sequencing using Illumina MiSeq techniques, with the goal of finding degraders adapted to polluted environments. Afterward, degradation experiments on diclofenac and bisphenol A were performed with the best fungal degraders. The analysis of bacterial diversity showed that Dethiosulfovibrionaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Isosphaeraceae were the most abundant families. A predominance of Ascomycota fungi in the culturable and non-culturable population was also detected. Species such as Talaromyces gossypii, Syncephalastrum monosporum, Aspergillus tabacinus, and Talaromyces verruculosus had remarkable degradation rates, up to 80% of diclofenac and bisphenol A was fully degraded. These results highlight the importance of characterizing autochthonous microorganisms and the possibility of selecting native fungal microorganisms to develop tailored biotransformation technologies for EPs.

AB Geochemical and microbiological techniques were used to assess water-quality impacts from the land application of treated municipal wastewater in the karstic Wakulla Springs basin in northern Florida. Nitrate-N concentrations have increased from about 0.2 to as high as 1.1 mg/L (milligrams per liter) during the past 30 years in Wakulla Springs, a regional discharge point for groundwater (mean flow about 11.3 m(3)/s) from the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA). A major source of nitrate to the UFA is the approximately 64 million L/d (liters per day) of treated municipal wastewater applied at a 774 ha (hectare) sprayfield farming operation. About 260 chemical and microbiological indicators were analyzed in water samples from the sprayfield effluent reservoir, wells upgradient from the sprayfield, and from 21 downgradient wells and springs to assess the movement of contaminants into the UFA. Concentrations of nitrate-N, boron, chloride, were elevated in water samples from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and in monitoring wells at the sprayfield boundary. Mixing of sprayfield effluent water was indicated by a systematic decrease in concentrations of these constituents with distance downgradient from the sprayfield, with about a 10-fold dilution at Wakulla Springs, about 15 km (kilometers) downgradient from the sprayfield. Groundwater with elevated chloride and boron concentrations in wells downgradient from the sprayfield and in Wakulla Springs had similar nitrate isotopic signatures, whereas the nitrate isotopic composition of water from other sites was consistent with inorganic fertilizers or denitrification. The sprayfield operation was highly effective in removing most studied organic wastewater and pharmaceutical compounds and microbial indicators. Carbamazepine (an anti-convulsant drug) was the only pharmaceutical compound detected in groundwater from two sprayfield monitoring wells (1-2 ppt). One other detection of carbamazepine was found in a distant well water sample where enteroviruses also were detected, indicating a likely influence from a nearby septic tank.

AB Triclosan (TCS), an emerging contaminant linked to antimicrobial resistance, has been the focus of many surface water studies to date. However, these initial studies have predominantly used sampling locations downstream of large volume (i.e., >0.5 million gallons per day) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This approach overlooks potential inputs from their low volume counterparts as well as non-point sources, such as sewage network leaks, biosolid application to agricultural fields and leach fields associated with septic systems. Here we examine the range of concentrations, overall loading, and potential controls on TCS delivery to the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek (EBBC), a rural to suburban watershed located in southeastern Pennsylvania. TCS measurements were collected from 13 locations in the EBBC during baseflow conditions and immediately following a storm event. A regulatory database review identified WWTP density an order of magnitude greater than the national average, thereby confirming their pervasiveness in rural to urban systems. Detectable concentrations of TCS in the EBBC ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ng/L during baseflow conditions and 0.5 to over 1000 ng/L following a storm event. The lack of a statistical relationship between TCS concentrations and yields with the number of upstream WWTPs and/or volume of treated effluent during both sampling periods confirm the importance of individual WWTP practices and the volume of the receiving water body, while a positive statistically-significant relationship between TCS concentrations and upstream developed open space following the storm event was likely influenced by runoff of spray-applied treated wastewater and/or sewage network leaks. Furthermore, the presence of detectable concentrations of TCS in sub-watersheds with no WWTP systems implies field applied biosolids or treated wastewater, as well as septic tank related leach fields are all viable sources of TCS. These findings suggest we must greatly expand our consideration of sources for emerging contaminants in waterways. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine disruption and high occurrences of intersex have been observed in wild fish associated with municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in urbanized reaches of rivers around the globe. These reproductive effects have often been attributed to the presence of estrogen receptor agonists in effluents. However, recent studies have isolated a number of androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens) that may also contribute to the endocrine disruption observed at sites that are influenced by WWTP outfalls. This study aimed to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of anti-androgenic personal care products (triclosan, chlorophene, dichlorophene, oxybenzone, 1-naphthol, and 2-naphthol), along with a herbicide (atrazine) and representative pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, and venlafaxine) in the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario. Surface water sampling of 30 sites associated with six municipal WWTP outfalls was conducted during a summer low flow. Monthly samples were also collected immediately upstream and downstream of a major WWTP from August to November 2012.
   Atrazine was consistently found in all surface water sampling locations. Many of the target pharmaceuticals and triclosan were detected in WWTP effluents, especially those that did not nitrify. Under low flow conditions, the concentrations of triclosan and several pharmaceuticals increased directly downstream of the WWTPs then decreased rapidly with distance downstream. Chlorophene was either found at trace levels or below detection limits in the effluents while dichlorophene, oxybenzone, 1-naphthol, and 2-naphthol were not detected in any samples. Chlorophene was detected in surface water during the low flow summer period and once during the monthly sampling from August to November. However, the primary source of chlorophene did not appear to be associated with WWTP effluent. This study documents the spatial and temporal occurrence of several antiandrogens and pharmaceuticals in a highly impacted Canadian watershed. It supports previous observations that there is a diversity of contaminants in wastewater effluents and other sources that have the potential to alter endocrine function in wild fish.

AB This study examined the occurrence in wastewater of 11 aromatic biocides, pesticides and degradates, and their fate during passage through US treatment plants, as well as the chemical mass contained in sewage sludge (biosolids) destined for land application. Analyte concentrations in wastewater influent, effluent and sludge from 25 facilities in 18 US states were determined by liquid chromatography electrospray (tandem) mass spectrometry. Dichlorocarbanilide, fipronil, triclocarban, and triclosan were found consistently in all sample types. Dichlorophene, hexachlorophene, and tetrachlorocarbanilide were detected infrequently only, and concentrations of the phenyl urea pesticides diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron, and linuron were below the limit of detection in all matrixes. Median concentrations (+/- 95% confidence interval) of quantifiable compounds in influent ranged from 4.2 +/- 0.8 mu g L-1 for triclocarban to 0.03 +/- 0.01 mu g L-1 for fipronil. Median concentrations in effluent were highest for triclocarban and triclosan (0.23 +/- 0.08 and 0.07 +/- 0.04 mu g L-1, respectively). Median aqueous-phase removal efficiencies (+/- 95% CI) of activated sludge treatment plants decreased in the order of: triclosan (96 +/- 2%) > triclocarban (87 +/- 7%) > dichlorocarbanilide (55 perpendicular to 20%) > fipronil (18 perpendicular to 22%). Median concentrations of organohalogens were typically higher in anaerobically than in aerobically digested sludges, and peaked at 27 600 +/- 9600 and 15 800 +/- 8200 mu g kg(-1) for triclocarban and triclosan, respectively. Mass balances obtained for three primary pesticides in six activated sludge treatment plants employing anaerobic digestion suggested a decreasing overall persistence from fipronil (97 +/- 70%) to triclocarban (87 +/- 29%) to triclosan (28 +/- 30%). Nationwide release of the investigated organohalogens to agricultural land via municipal sludge recycling and into surface waters is estimated to total 258 000 +/- 110 00 kg year(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval), with most of this mass derived from antimicrobial consumer products of daily use. This study addresses some of the data gaps identified by the National Research Council in its 2002 study on standards and practices of biosolids application on land.

AB Consumption of illicit drugs poses health risks to the public and environment. Knowledge on their usage helps better implementations of intervention strategies to reduce drug-related harms in the society and also policies to limit their releases as emerging contaminants to recipient environments. This study aimed to investigate from the daily consumption to treatment efficiency and subsequent discharge of illicit drugs by the Swedish urban populations based on simultaneous collection and analysis of influent and effluent wastewater. Two different weekly monitoring campaigns showed similar drug prevalence in Stockholm and Uppsala, with amphetamine as the most popular drug. Almost all target drug residues were still measurable in effluent wastewater. High removal efficiencies (>94%) were observed for amphetamine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine, whereas ketamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), mephedrone and methamphetamine were the least removed substances (<64%), with the highest discharge observed for MDMA in both catchments (similar to 3.0 g/day in Uppsala;similar to 18 g/day in Stockholm). Our study provides new insights into short-term changes in the use and related discharge of illicit drugs by urban populations. Such wastewater monitoring can provide useful information to public health, forensic and environmental authorities in planning future intervention and regulation policies.

AB This work involves the study of the influence of textural and chemical adsorbent properties on natural organic matter (NOM) removal and the simultaneous adsorption of caffeine and NOM in pharmaceutical wastewater. The performance of a microporous activated carbon, Calgon F400, a synthesized mesoporous carbon from peach stones and a commercial sepiolite in the removal of NOM of a WWTP effluent, and the competitive adsorption of caffeine/NOM were evaluated. It was evidenced that the microporous structure of the adsorbents significantly conditioned the removal of NOM, finding that F400 activated carbon (microporous volume of 0.46 cm(3) g(-1)) led to a NOM removal of 45%. The presence of NOM in the aqueous medium led to worse adsorption parameters, including adsorption capacity at breakthrough time, mass transfer zone length and fractional bed utilization. Additionally, an overshooting in the Total Organic Carbon concentration (TOC/TOC0 = 1.05) was observed in the sepiolite adsorption fixed-bed experiment, due to the displacement of the background NOM. The tested adsorbents were efficient in the removal of caffeine from a pharmaceutical wastewater, finding a competitive effect between the target compound and the background NOM for the active sites.

AB This study investigated biodegradation, transformation and sludge/water partition of two natural estrogens - estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) - in a pilot-scale step-feed anoxic/oxic (A/O) wastewater treatment system. The results show that the total amounts of E1 and E2 (E1 + E2) in the water phase were approximately 9-23% of those in the sludge phase in the reactor tanks. The estrogens accumulated in the return sludge led to the increase in the estrogen concentration in the first-stage anoxic zone. The biodegradation of E1 and E2 in the first-stage aerobic zone was highly efficient. The sludge/water partition coefficients (Log K-d) of E1 and E2 were gradually increased from 2.3 and 2.6 in the first stage to 3.2 and 3.3 in the third stage, respectively, and Log K-d of E2 was higher than that of E1 in each A/O stage. In addition, the Log K-d values of E1 and E2 were larger in the aerobic zones than in the anoxic zones. Under six operation conditions tested, there was a linear relationship between the concentrations of E1 and E2 in the water phase, indicating the transformation between E1 and E2. The calculated mutual conversion equilibrium constant (K) for the transformation between E1 and E2 was significantly higher in the anoxic zones (0.38-0.81) than in the aerobic zones (0.08-0.24).

AB We investigated the occurrence and distribution of 24 selected corticosteroids (CSs) in the surface water of the Zhujiang River (ZR) system in Guangzhou, a highly urbanized river system receiving both treated and untreated municipal wastewater effluents. Twenty-two and sixteen CSs were detected in the tributaries and the main stream of the ZR system, and their concentrations ranged from less than the method quantification limit (fluticasone propionate) to 94 ng/L (clobetasone butyrate) and from 024 ng/L (cortisol) to 72 ng/L (clobetasone butyrate), respectively. We observed higher total CSs (Sigma CSs) concentrations in the tributaries (11-396 ng/L) relative to the main stream (5.5-33 ng/L) due to their proximity to densely populated residential areas. Sigma CSs concentrations in the dry season were generally higher than those in the wet season due to low dilution from decreased river discharge. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis identified untreated domestic sewage to be the dominant source of CSs (t(2), contribution rate: 42.7%) in the urban rivers. Additional source contributions were from naturally attenuated treated and/or raw sewage (t(1), 21.5%) and effluents from wastewater treatment plants (t(3), 26.7%). CSs contribution was dominated by t(2) in the dry season, and the contributions from t(1), t(2), and t(3) showed no significant difference in the wet season. Risk assessment inferred that the ZR system is at medium to high ecological risk from CSs and is therefore a potential threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems. To prevent CSs pollution, our results demonstrate the need to develop effective control strategies to minimize the discharge of untreated waste to nearby rivers and to improve the capacity of wastewater treatment plants in Guangzhou. Further, we demonstrate that the concentrations of cortisone and fludrocortisone acetate are effective chemical indicators to estimate the level of natural and synthetic CSs contamination in urban rivers.

AB The aquatic toxicity of eight preservatives frequently used in personal care products (PCPs) (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, bronopol, diazolidinyl urea, benzalkonium chloride, zinc pyrithione, propylparaben, triclosan and a mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone) was assessed by means of two different approaches: a battery of bioassays composed of single species tests of bacteria (Vibrio fischeri and Pseudomonas putida) and protozoa (Tetrahymena thermophila), and a whole biological community resazurin-based assay using activated sludge. The tested preservatives showed considerable toxicity in the studied bioassays, but with a marked difference in potency. In fact, all biocides except propylparaben and diazolidinyl urea had EC50 values lower than 1 mg L-1 in at least one assay. Risk quotients for zinc pyrithione, benzalkonium chloride, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate and triclosan as well as the mixture of the studied preservatives exceeded 1, indicating a potential risk for the process performance and efficiency of municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). These four single biocides explained more than 95% of the preservative mixture risk in all bioassays. Each individual preservative was also tested in combination with an industrial wastewater (IWW) from a cosmetics manufacturing facility. The toxicity assessment was performed on binary mixtures (preservative + IWW) and carried out using the median-effect principle, which is a special case of the concept of Concentration Addition (CA). Almost 70% of all experiments resulted in EC50 values within a factor of 2 of the values predicted by the median-effect principle (CI values between 0.5 and 2). The rest of the mixtures whose toxicity was mispredicted by CA were assessed with the alternative concept of Independent Action (IA), which showed higher predictive power for the biological community assay. Therefore, the concept used to accurately predict the toxicity of mixtures of a preservative with a complex industrial wastewater depends on degree of biological complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To characterise emissions from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) regarding organic micropollutants, a monitoring study was undertaken in an urban catchment in southwest Stuttgart, Germany. The occurrence of 69 organic micropollutants was assessed at one CSO outfall during seven rain events as well as in the sewage network at the influent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in the receiving water. Several pollutant groups like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), urban biocides and pesticides, industrial chemicals, organophosphorus flame retardants, plasticisers and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were chosen for analysis. Out of the 69 monitored substances, 60 were detected in CSO discharges. The results of this study show that CSOs represent an important pathway for a wide range of organic micropollutants from wastewater systems to urban receiving waters. For most compounds detected in CSO samples, event mean concentrations varied between the different events in about one order of magnitude range. When comparing CSO concentrations with median wastewater concentrations during dry weather, two main patterns could be observed depending on the source of the pollutant: (i) wastewater is diluted by stormwater; (ii) stormwater is the most important source of a pollutant. Both wastewater and stormwater only play an important role in pollutant concentration for a few compounds. The proportion of stormwater calculated with the conductivity is a suitable indicator for the evaluation of emitted loads of dissolved wastewater pollutants, but not for all compounds. In fact, this study demonstrates that remobilisation of in-sewer deposits contributed from 10% to 65% to emissions of carbamazepine in CSO events. The contribution of stormwater to CSO emitted loads was higher than 90% for all herbicides as well as for PAHs. Regarding the priority substance di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), this contribution varied between 39% and 85%. The PAH concentrations found along the river indicate environmental risk, especially during rainfall events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are being detected widely in the aquatic environment due to their global consumption. Some ecotoxicological studies have revealed their implication in different toxic effects and the only mechanism available nowadays to combat with this problem are the wastewater treatment plants, which in function of the system employed seem to be more successful in the pharmaceuticals degradation. The contribution of adsorption and bio-degradation to the overall removal was estimated to be the main reason for their elimination from the environment. For that reason, in this paper the biological degradation, sorption and mass balance in a conventional activate sludge (CAS) WWTP are evaluated. Among of the pharmaceutical studied (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), the most of them (except carbamazepine), had an extraordinary degradation (>80,6). The percentages of the elimination due to microorganism degradation in the secondary treatment, was estimated for all of the pharmaceutical and it was observed that it was very important for ketoprofen and ibuprofen, while for the others pharmaceutical the sorption onto sludge was most predominant that biodegradation in order to eliminate them from the water.

AB Intersex in fish downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) is a global concern. Consistent high rates of intersex in male rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) have been reported for several years in the Grand River, in southern Ontario, Canada, in close proximity to two MWWTPs. The larger MWWTP (Kitchener) recently underwent upgrades that included the conversion from a carbonaceous activated sludge to nitrifying activated sludge treatment process. This created a unique opportunity to assess whether upgrades designed to improve effluent quality could also remediate the intersex previously observed in wild fish. Multiple years (2007-2012) of intersex data on male rainbow darter collected before the upgrades at sites associated with the MWWTP outfall were compared with intersex data collected in postupgrade years (2013-2015). These upgrades resulted in a reduction from 70 to 100% intersex incidence (preupgrade) to <10% in postupgrade years. Although the cause of intersex remains unknown, indicators of effluent quality including nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and estrogenicity improved in the effluent after the upgrades. This study demonstrated that investment in MWWTP upgrades improved effluent quality and was associated with an immediate change in biological responses in the receiving environment. This is an important finding considering the tremendous cost of wastewater infrastructure.

AB Integration of conventional wastewater treatments with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has become of great interest to remove pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from wastewater. However, application of these technologies generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may reach superficial waters through effluents from sewage treatment plants. The main objective of the present study was to elucidate if ROS present in real effluents after biological and then chemical (single ozonation, solar photolytic ozonation, solar photocatalytic ozonation (TiO2, Fe3O4) and solar photocatalytic oxidation (TiO2)) treatments induce oxidative stress in Daphnia magna. For this, the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and the level of lipid peroxidation were determined in Daphnia. The results of oxidative stress biomarkers studied suggest that D. magna is able to cope with the superoxide ion radical (O-2 center dot(-)) present in the treated effluent due to single ozonation by mainly inducing the antioxidant activity superoxide dismutase, thus preventing lipid peroxidation. Lethal effects (measured in terms of immobility) were not observed in these organisms after exposure to any solution. Therefore, in order to probe the ecological efficiency of urban wastewater treatments, studies on lethal and sublethal effects in D. magna would be advisable.

AB The occurrence of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in the environment is becoming a major area of concern due to their undesirable effects on non-target organisms. This study investigated the occurrence and risk of contamination by five antibiotics and three antiretrovirals drugs in a fast-growing peri-urban area in Kenya, with inadequate sewer system coverage. Due to poor sewage connectivity and poorly designed decentralized systems, wastewater is directly released in open drains. Water and sediment samples were collected from open surface water drains, while wastewater samples were collected from centralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Solid-phase extraction and ultrasonicassisted extraction for the aqueous and sediment samples respectively were carried out and extracts analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) using isotopically labeled internal standards. APIs were observed with the detection frequency ranging from 36% to 100%. High mean concentrations of 48.7 mg L-1, 108 mg L-1, and 532 mg L-1 were observed in surface drains for Lamivudine (3 TC), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) respectively. Drain sediments also showed high concentrations of APIs ranging from 2.1 to 13,100 mg kg(-1). APIs in this study exceeded those observed in existing literature studies. JKUAT WWTP removal efficiencies varied from similar to 90.68% to 72.67%. Total APIs emission load of the study area was 3550 mg d(-1) with WWTP effluent contributing higher loads (2620 mg d(-1)) than surface water drains (640 mg d(-1)). Zidovudine (ZDV), nevirapine (NVP), and trimethoprim (TMP) loads in drains, however, exceeded WWTP effluent. Low to high ecotoxicity risk of the individual APIs were observed to the aquatic environment, with high risks for the development of antibiotic resistance in microbiome as determined by the risk quotient (RQ) approach. Risk management through efficient wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment is necessary to suppress the measured concentrations. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present work describes the optimization and validation of a highly selective and sensitive analytical method using solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE LC-MS/MS) for the determination of some frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater received and treated by Sharjah sewage treatment plant (STP). The extraction efficiency of different SPE cartridges was tested and the simultaneous extraction of pharmaceuticals was successfully accomplished using hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced reversed phase Waters (R) Oasis HLB cartridge (200 mg/ 6 mL) at pH 3. The analytes were separated on an Aquity BEH C18 column (1.7 mu m, 2.1 mm x 150 mm) using gradient elution and mass spectrometric analysis were performed in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) selecting two precursor ions to produce ion transition for each pharmaceutical using positive electrospray ionization (+ESI) mode. The correlation coefficient values in the linear calibration plot for each target compound exceeded 0.99 and the recovery percentages of the investigated pharmaceuticals were more than 84%. Limit of detection (LOD) varied between 0.1-1.5 ng/L and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.3-5 ng/L for all analytes. The precision of the method was calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD%) of replicate measurements and was found to be in the ranges of 2.2% to 7.7% and 2.2% to 8.6% for inter and intra-day analysis, respectively. All of the obtained validation parameters satisfied the requirements and guidelines of analytical method validation.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been recognized as a group of chemicals of emerging environmental concern. Results from previous studies have shown that PPCPs are among the most frequently detected anthropogenic contaminants in the environment. Following the reuse of animal waste, reclaimed wastewater and treated sewage sludge (biosolids), PPCPs can enter the terrestrial environment. However, little is known about their fate in receiving soils and particularly their uptake potential by agriculturally important plants. In this work, we review the available literature on this subject, propose future research needs, and discuss possible management practices that can help reduce PPCP plant uptake.

AB Recently, among AOPs, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) on TiO2 is gaining interest. In this study, five different real waters sampled in four different points of the integrated urban water management (IUWM) system were tested with PEC and UV alone, for comparison. This work aims to verify the effect of the PEC suggesting the optimal position in IUWM system where the PEC should be located to obtain the best performance. In groundwaters (GWs), PEC effectively removed atrazine-based compounds (> 99%), trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene (96%), after 15 min of reaction time. However, given the low concentrations of emerging compounds, the synergistic effect of UV radiation with the catalyst and with the polarization of the mesh was not visible, with very few differences compared with the results obtained with UV alone. Pharmaceutical industrial wastewater (IWW) showed a significant increase in biodegradability after 2 h, both if subjected to PEC or UV (200%), despite the absence of COD removal. The PEC applied on IWW from a sewage sludge treatment plant allowed to effectively remove the COD (39.6%) and increase the biodegradability (300%). Good results in terms of COD removal (33.9%) and biodegradability increase (+900%) were also achieved testing PEC on wastewater treatment plant effluent. Except for GWs, PEC allowed significant E-EO savings respect to UV alone (76.2-99.1%).

AB The distribution of consumed cocaine in the Brazilian Federal District (FD) was estimated using the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Sewage samples from eight wastewater treatment plants were analyzed for cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) using solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The highest per capita consumption was noticed for the northern area of the Brazilian Capital (1162 mg day' 10(X) inh(-3)) being 32% higher than the average consumption rate of the investigated region. In this area, a day-to-day investigation revealed an average cocaine consumption of 1800 mg day(-1) 1000 inh(-3) during the weekend. i.e., more than 50% higher than weekdays. An annual street-grade cocaine load of about 2 ton was estimated for the FD considering previous information on the actual purity of seized street drugs as well as consumers between 15 and 64 years old. Sample preservation strategies were also investigated in order to expand the WBE approach to other Brazilian areas. Sample acidification to pH 2.0 presented the smallest relative errors for COC (+11%) and BE (-4%) after a period of three days under typical transport conditions practiced by the Brazilian national postal service.

AB In this study, the presence, composition, and concentrations of organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) were determined in solid materials produced during wastewater treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of these solids, collectively referred to as biosolids, as a source of OWCs to soil and water in contact with soil. Nine different biosolid products, produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants in seven different states, were analyzed for 87 different OWCs. Fifty-five of the OWCs were detected in at least one biosolid product. The 87 different OWCs represent a diverse cross section of emerging organic contaminants that enter wastewater treatment plants and may be discharged without being completely metabolized or degraded. A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 45 OWCs were detected in any one biosolid. The biosolids used in this study are produced by several production methods, and the plants they originate from have differing population demographics, yet the percent composition of total OWC content, and of the most common OWCs, typically did not vary greatly between the biosolids tested. The summed OWC content ranged from 64 to 1811 mg/kg dry weight. Six biosolids were collected twice, 3-18 months apart, and the total OWC content of each biosolid varied by less than a factor of 2. These results indicate that the biosolids investigated in this study have OWC compositions and concentrations that are more similar than different and that biosolids are highly enriched in OWCs (as mass-normalized concentrations) when compared to effluents or effluent-impacted water. These results demonstrate the need to better describe the composition and fate of OWCs in biosolids since about 50% of biosolids are land applied and thus become a potentially ubiquitous nonpoint source of OWCs into the environment.

AB Wastewater analysis is a promising monitoring tool to estimate illicit drug consumption at the community level. The advantage of this technique over traditional surveys and other surveillance methods has been emphasized in recent studies. However, there are methodological challenges that can affect reliability. The objectives of this study were to systematically reduce and assess uncertainties associated with sampling (through a stringent optimization of the sampling method) and the back calculation of per capita drug consumption (through a refined estimation of the number of people actively contributing to the wastewater in a given period). We applied continuous flow-proportional sampling to ensure the collection of representative raw wastewater samples. Residues of illicit drugs, opioids, prescription pharmaceuticals and one artificial sweetener were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. A parameter estimating the number of people actively contributing to wastewater over a given period was calculated from the measured loads of prescription pharmaceuticals, their annual consumption and relative excretion data. For the calculation of substance loads in sewage, uncertainties were propagated considering five individual components: sampling, chemical analysis, flow measurements, excretion rates and the number of people contributing to the wastewater. The daily consumption per 1000 inhabitants was estimated to be almost 1000 mg for cannabis and several hundred mg for cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy. With the best sampling practice and current chemical analysis, we calculated the remaining uncertainty to be in the range of 20-30% (relative standard deviation, RSD) for the estimation of consumed drug masses in the catchment; RSDs for the per capita consumption were lower (14-24%), as one of the biggest uncertainty components (i.e. error in flow measurements) cancels out in the proposed method for the estimation of the number of people contributing to the daily wastewater volume. In this study, we provide methodological improvements that substantially enhance the reliability of the estimation method a prerequisite for the application of this technique to meaningfully assess changes in drug consumption and the success of drug intervention strategies in future studies.

AB Wastewater samples were collected from the main hospital's effluent (HWW), influents and effluents of the old wastewater treatment plant (OWWTP) built in 1990 and the new one (NWWTP) built in 2010 located in Doha, Qatar. Analytical methods were optimized to determine the concentrations of eight selected antibiotics (ABs): penicillin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and clavulanic acid. Samples were prepared through automated solid phase extraction (SPE) before analysis using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with positive ion electrospray. Among the eight target compounds tested, recoveries were obtained in the range of 47.5-98%. The highest concentration of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were detected in the HWW at levels of 5.46 mu g/L and 1.99 mu g/L, respectively. In effluents samples collected from both WWTPs, clavulanic acid was the most prominent compound at concentration of 84.74 mu g/L. The highest concentration of erythromycin (7.20 mu g/L) was detected in the influent sample collected from OWWTP. Amoxicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin were below the detection limit (0.1 mu g/L). There was a significant statistical correlation between the concentrations of most of the studied antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin, clavulanic acid, and metronidazole in all influent samples, whereas the concentration of erythromycin was highly correlated with those of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples. No significant difference (P >= 0.05) was found between concentrations of the targeted antibiotics in the NWWTP and OWWTP. Generally, both treatment plants showed effective removal rates (99.44%) of penicillin and metronidazole. However, clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from the effluent of either plant, even though the effluent passed through the ultrafiltration stage in the new WWTP. The findings reveal that HWW is not the only source of ABs in wastewater but direct disposal onto the sewer system could be the major source. The study calls for further investigation of additional pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants in the wastewater of Qatar as well as their metabolites and biodegradation products as well as application of advanced treatment technologies for highest removal rate and safe water reuse options.

AB Enzymatic treatment can effectively degrade recalcitrant micro-pollutants in wastewater. However, its industrial application is constrained by the high cost of the purified enzyme preparations. This work introduces a novel technique to directly immobilize the in-house crude enzyme extracts (from P. ostreatus) onto the functionalized TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Comprehensive investigations were carried out to understand the interactions between complex crude enzyme extracts and the immobilization support. By simple dilution of the crude enzyme extract, the immobilization efficiency can be significantly improved. The resultant biocatalytic nanoparticles had comparable performance to the immobilized purified commercial enzymes. Finally, the micropollutant degradation capability of the biocatalytic nanoparticles was demonstrated with two micro-pollutants, namely, bisphenol-A and carbamazepine, commonly detected in sewage. The efficient laccase extraction and immobilization on biocatalytic nanoparticles show great promise as a cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment processes for recalcitrant micro-pollutants.

AB The goal of our study was to identify pharmaceuticals, their potential sources and consumption level in two different socioeconomic and geographical regions-Bordeaux, France and Kharkiv, Ukraine. These substances were monitored in rivers water during contrasted seasonal conditions with application of passive samplers. The 21 pharmaceuticals (psychiatric drugs: alprazolam, amitriptyline, diazepam, fluoxetine, nordiazepam, carbamazepine, bromazepam; analgesics: aspirin, paracetamol; broncholidator: clenbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug: diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen; lipid regulator: gemfibrozil; stimulants: caffeine, theophylline) were identified in sites upstream and downstream of urban areas and discharge of wastewaters. Caffeine, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were relatively abundant into the surface water and could be considered as potential anthropogenic markers of wastewater discharges into rivers. A mass balance modeling has been applied to calculate approximate consumption rates for carbamazepine, diclofenac, and caffeine in both regions to assess socio-economic factors linked with pharmaceuticals behavior.

AB We aimed to assess the quality of a midsize river that receives agricultural and urban wastewater. Nuclear abnormalities (NA), comet assays of blood and gills, and gill histopathology were evaluated in fish Astyanax aff. paranae during the summer and winter 2011 at three sites in Parana State, Brazil: (1) a biological reserve (Rebio-reference area); (2) an agricultural site; (3) a downstream site that accumulates agricultural and urban effluents. We found the highest effects of pollutants in fish at the downstream site during the summer. The agricultural site showed an intermediate damage rate, and fish at Rebio generally had the least damage, with the exception of NA. Despite conflicting results from the biomarkers used, we observed an increase in damage associated with the accumulation of pollutants. Pesticides are probable xenobiotics in the agricultural area. Additionally, metals and substances such as pharmaceuticals and ammonia may be present at the downstream site.

AB The detection of antibiotics in water systems has instigated great environmental concern due to the toxicological effects associated with these compounds. Their discharge into the environment results from the ubiquity of use in medical, veterinary, and agricultural practices. Some of the effects of antibiotics include development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it difficult to treat diseases, variation in natural microbial communities, and enzyme activities. In this study, the first comprehensive survey of some frequently used antibiotics namely ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), chloramphenicol (CAP), and ciprofloxacin (CPF) within Lake Victoria Basin of Kenya is presented. Sludge and wastewater samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and hospital lagoons within the study area. Samples were extracted and cleaned by solidphase extraction, and analysis was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All wastewater samples and sludge collected contained quantifiable levels of the selected antibiotics. The highest concentrations were recorded for AMP with WWTPs and hospitals having 0.36 +/- 0.04 and 0.79 +/- 0.07 mu g/L, respectively. In sludge samples, SMX recorded the highest concentrations of 276 +/- 12 ng/g. The high levels in sludge indicate the preferential partition of antibiotics onto solid phase, posing great danger to consumers of crops grown in biosolid-amended soils. The daily discharge loads of antibiotics from nine WWTPs ranged between 80.75 and 3044.9 mg day(-1) with a total discharge of 6395.85 mg day(-1), signifying a high potential of water resource pollution within the region. This report will aid in the assessment of the risks posed by antibiotics released into the environment.

AB Wastewater is one of the major sources of micropollutant release into the environment. In order to reduce the impact of wastewater, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have been set up, in the instance of vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs). Besides, micropollutants could represent a vast diversity of compounds and compound's choice could bias studies focused on their fate. To overcome this bias, non-targeted screening approaches can be performed. Therefore, the diffusion of micropollutants from raw wastewater in the VFCW compartments (wastewater, plants and sludge) as well as their fate have been investigated using this non-target approach with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry. To help the operators in their sludge management, this study will be focused on the following question: Is there a specific distribution of micropollutants according to sludge layers? To eliminate the background contamination found both inside the CW and in the surrounding environment, a control coring was performed in bank. A specific distribution could be observed in the top (191 compounds) and bottom layers (38 compounds). However, a distribution over the whole depth for xenobiotics was observed. Micropollutants classes and the main microbial productivity were preferably found in the top layer. The micropollutants fate could however not be restricted to the sludge compartment. Therefore, the specific micropollutants distribution was analyzed in the outputs of the systemin their interactions with wastewater (effluent, sludge, and reed rhizomes) to understand their fate. In our study, the results highlighted a consistent part of compounds found in at least two or three of these compartments, with a similar trend in each compartment. These results underline the interactions between the compartments and the global issues of micropollutants distribution as well as its wide spreading in the whole CW ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Three high volume septic systems in Ontario, Canada, were examined to assess the potential for onsite wastewater treatment systems to release pharmaceutical compounds to he environment and to evaluate the mobility of these compounds in receiving aquifers. Wastewater samples were collected from the septic tanks, and groundwater samples were collected below and down gradient of the infiltration beds and analyzed for a suite of commonly used pharmaceutical and trace organic compounds. The septic tank samples contained elevated concentrations of several pharmaceutical compounds. Ten of the 12 compounds analyzed were detected in groundwater at one or more sites at concentrations in the low ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 range. Large differences among the sites were observed in both the number of detections and the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds. Of the compounds analyzed, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen were observed to be transported at the highest concentrations and greatest distances from the infiltration source areas, particularly in anoxic zones of the plumes.

AB A multiresidue method was developed to estimate community drug use during two weekends of the 2014 Soccer World Cup via wastewater analyses. Five of the 16 investigated substances were detected in all eight samples. Benzoilecgonine (BE), the major cocaine metabolite, was the most abundant substance (1.9 +/- 0.3 to 4.2 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1) followed by anhydroecgonine (AE) (1.5 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1), phenacetin (PHE) (0.62 +/- 0.06 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mu g L-1), levamisole (LEV) (0.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.23 +/- 0.09 mu g L-1), and cocaine (COC) (0.46 +/- 0.07 to 0.8 +/- 0.1 mu g L-1). COC and BE levels suggested a human consumption origin for the investigated drugs. AE/BE ratios revealed a significant use of smoked crack/free base cocaine. Relationships between the adulterants PHE and LEV evidenced a higher use of crack cocaine in the South-Wing WWTP region. An estimative for cocaine use revealed slightly higher drug consumption during the Soccer World Cup weekends in comparison with a typical weekend in 2012.

AB UV irradiation technology as a membrane bioreactor (MBR) post-treatment was investigated and assessed. Both UV low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) lamps were examined. The technology was installed in a pilot plant treating hospital wastewater to provide the study with adequate field data.
   The effect of the UV irradiation was enhanced with varying dosages of H2O2 to establish an advanced oxidation process (AOP).The efficiency of the pharmaceutical removal process was assessed by examining 14 micropollutants (antibiotics, analgesics, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, cytostatics and X-ray contrast media) which are typically released by hospitals and detected with liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   While the MBR treatment generally showed only a low degradation capacity for persistent pharmaceuticals, much better degradation was obtained by applying UV irradiation and H2O2 as AOP. The "conventional" cost-benefit analysis of the different technology options taking into account both electrical energy consumption and pharmaceutical removal efficiency, revealed clearly better performance of low pressure UV lamps as AOP. However, a holistic comparison between the different scenarios was carried out by evaluating their environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Decisive advantages were highlighted to include this approach in the decision making process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current water quality guidelines for reclaimed wastewater have predominantly addressed risks associated with the presence of microbial organisms. Comparatively, chemical parameters have been largely overlooked or inadequately considered. Acceptable levels of chemical parameters will be dependant on the proposed reuse applications for the water and, in many cases, site-specific factors such as the degree of dilution with water from other sources. However, some general principals for the determination of acceptable levels of chemical contaminants in reclaimed water may be applied universally. This study describes a general risk-assessment approach to the determination of acceptable contaminant concentrations. It provides some analysis of the principal functions of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response relationship characterisation and risk characterisation as they relate to chemical contaminants in reclaimed water. Examples of some key modelling calculations for this process are provided for three selected contaminants (chloroform, 1, 1, 2-trichloroethane and pyrene) during hypothetical irrigation of agricultural areas. Predicted environmental concentrations were calculated and compared with predicted no effect concentrations. The results of the hypothetical modelling exercise indicate that the contaminants considered in this theoretical analysis pose an acceptable risk to human health via the single exposure path considered (uptake through food grown in the irrigated soil).

AB Reuse of wastewater for agricultural irrigation purposes is gaining popularity in water scarce regions. This practice represents a cheap and easy method of wastewater disposal, as well as an alternative to attenuate the water demand for agriculture without compromising fresh water sources. However, during agricultural irrigation, contaminants contained in wastewater migrate to the soil and may eventually reach the aquifer, causing deterioration of groundwater quality. Micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals, have been detected in wastewater used for irrigation around the world; these pollutants have even been found in groundwater, but in lower concentrations than those observed in wastewater. This may be because the micropollutants are retained or removed by soil during the passage of wastewater through the solid matrix. The processes involved in such retention/dissipation may be sorption or biodegradation. In this study, the sorption and mobility of two micropollutants: di-2-ethyl(hexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) were evaluated in three different soil types (Leptosol, Phaeozem and Vertisol) using batch and soil column experiments. The results obtained were compared in order to understand how these compounds mobilize through the soil until they reach the aquifer. The batch sorption experiments showed that both compounds are rapidly sorbed onto the soils. DEHP was strongly sorbed onto the three soils (K-d from 1.8 x 10(4) to 4.2 x 10(4) L kg(-1)), while sorption of 4-NP was weaker (K-d between 15 and 80 L kg(-1)), Conversely, the column experiment results demonstrated that DEHP mobilizes faster than 4-NP through the three soils. The transport of DEHP may be explained by complexation of DEHP with the dissolved organic matter released from the soil or by the attachment to soil colloids. The results obtained in the batch experiments are in line with those reported in the literature, while the observations made in the column experiments were consistent with the field data.

AB Constructed wetlands are often used as decentralized wastewater treatment and as treatment systems for small communities. The effluent is usually discharged in small water courses in which the aquatic ecosystem can be put at risk by pharmaceutical residues present in the effluent. This study describes the performance of a pilot-scale aerated subsurface-flow constructed wetland treating municipal and hospital wastewater. Especially the effect of active aeration on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals is assessed. The removal of metformin and valsartan is significantly increased when continuous aeration is applied (99 +/- 1% vs. 68 +/- 32% for metformin and 99 +/- 1% vs. 17 +/- 19% for valsartan), although the micro-organisms can adapt to degrading metformin also in anoxic conditions. At the hospital site high concentrations of pharmaceuticals are measured in the influent. Atenolol and bisopfolol are efficiently removed (> 75% and > 50%, respectively), although the effluent concentrations of these compounds remain high (up to 0.5 mu g/L). Only limited removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gabapentin and sulfamethoxazole is achieved. Intermittent aeration (50%) provides equally efficient removal of the selected pharmaceuticals as continuous aeration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycyclic musks [cashmeran (DPMI), celestolide (ADBI), phantolide (AHMI), traseolide (ATII), tonalide (AHTN) and galaxolide (HHCB)] in the air, wastewater, sludge samples of a typical cosmetic plant were analyzed. DPMI ADBI, HHCB and AHTN were found in all samples, and ATII was not found in any sample. HHCB and AHTN were the major components in all samples. The polycyclic, musk concentrations were very high in the air of the cosmetic plant, and polycyclic musks were mostly contained in the gas phase at the percentage of 86.35-97.70%. Average polycyclic musk concentrations in effluent were high, and ranged from 0.62 to 32.06 mu g l(-1). The removal efficiency during the active sludge wastewater treatment was also high, resulting from the adsorption of those compounds into the sludge. So the polycyclic musk concentrations were very high in the primary sludge and second sludge, and ranged from 1.78 to 92.45 mg kg(-1) (dry), and from 2.87 to 65.67 mg kg(-1) (dry), respectively. Results suggested that the sludge needed to be further treated to make polycyclic musks less influence to the environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent of a wastewater treatment plant was treated in a pilot plant for reclaimed water production through the denitrification biofilter (DNBF) process, ozonation (O-3), and biologic aerated filtration (BAF). The combined process demonstrated good removal performance of conventional pollutants, including concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (27.8 mg center dot L-1) and total nitrogen (9.9 mg center dot L-1) in the final effluent, which met the local discharge standards and water reuse purposes. Micropollutants (e.g., antibiotics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals) were also significantly removed during the proposed process. Ozonation exhibited high antibiotic removal efficiencies, especially for tetracycline (94%). However, micropollutant removal efficiency was negatively affected by the nitrite produced by DNBF. Acute toxicity variations of the combined process were estimated by utilizing luminescent bacteria. Inhibition rate increased from 9% to 15% during ozonation. Carbonyl compound concentrations (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) also increased by 58% as by-products, which consequently increased toxicity. However, toxicity eventually became as low as that of the influent because the by-products were effectively removed by BAF. The combined DNBF/O-3/BAF process is suitable for the advanced treatment of reclaimed water because it can thoroughly remove pollutants and toxicity.

AB Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble plastic commercially used in laundry and dish detergent pods (LDPs) for which a complete understanding of its fate in the environment and subsequent consequences is lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the US nationwide emissions of PVA resulting from domestic use of LDPs, corroborated by a nationwide, online consumer survey and a literature review of its fate within conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Peer-reviewed publications focusing on the degradation of PVA in critical processes of WWTPs were shortlisted as a part of the literature review, and subsequent degradation data was extracted and applied to a model with a set of assumptions. Survey and model results estimated that approximately 17,200 +/- 5000 metric ton units per year (mtu/yr) of PVA are used from LDPs in the US, with 10,500 +/- 3000 mtu/yr reaching WWTPs. Literature review data, when incorporated into our model, resulted in similar to 61% of PVA ending up in the environment via the sludge route and similar to 15.7% via the aqueous phase. PVA presence in the environment, regardless of its matrix, is a threat to the ecosystem due to the potential mobilization of heavy metals and other hydrophilic contaminants.

AB Outdoor shallow wetland mesocosms, designed to simulate surface constructed wetlands to improve lagoon wastewater treatment, were used to assess the role of macrophytes in the dissipation of wastewater nutrients, selected pharmaceuticals, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Specifically, mesocosms were established with or without populations of Typha spp. (cattails), Myriophyllum sibiricum (northern water milfoil), and Utricularia vulgaris (bladderwort). Following macrophyte establishment, mesocosms were seeded with ARG-bearing organisms from a local wastewater lagoon, and treated with a single pulse of artificial municipal wastewater with or without carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine, and naproxen (each at 7.6 mu g/L), as well as sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine (each at 150 mu g/L). Rates of pharmaceutical dissipation over 28 d ranged from 0.073 to 3.0 d(-1), corresponding to half-lives of 0.23 to 9.4 d. Based on calculated rate constants, observed dissipation rates were consistent with photodegradation driving clofibric acid, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine removal, and with sorption also contributing to carbamazepine and fluoxetine loss. Of the seven gene determinants assayed, only two genes for both beta-lactam resistance (bla(CTX) and bla(TEM)) and sulfonamide resistance (sulI and sulII) were found in sufficient quantity for monitoring. Genes disappeared relatively rapidly from the water column, with half-lives ranging from 2.1 to 99 d. In contrast, detected gene levels did not change in the sediment, with the exception of sulI, which increased after 28 d in pharmaceutical-treated systems. These shallow wetland mesocosms were able to dissipate wastewater contaminants rapidly. However, no significant enhancement in removal of nutrients or pharmaceuticals was observed in mesocosms with extensive aquatic plant communities. This was likely due to three factors: first, use of naive systems with an unchallenged capacity for nutrient assimilation and contaminant removal; second, nutrient sequestration by ubiquitous filamentous algae; and third, dominance of photolytic processes in the removal of pharmaceuticals, which overshadowed putative plant-related processes.

AB Increasing concern in recent years over the occurrence and fate of low-level concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment stimulates research on alternative treatment methods. This paper presents a study of the degradation of sulphamethoxazole, an antibiotic,used on humans and animals in order to treat various bacterial infections, by ozonation. After 4.5 min of treatment, the concentration of sulphamethoxazole was below the HPLC detection limit of 0.6 mgL(-1), indicating degradation efficiency higher than 99.24%. This value is comparable and in some cases higher than published data on the degradation in drinking water. Kinetic analysis of the data indicated an overall first-order reaction with a rate constant of 1.0594 min(-1) at 20 degrees C. The reaction order differs with the second-order reaction observed by other researchers. This change of reaction order could be explained by the different treatment conditions used. Preliminary analysis using the FT-IR technique was also performed in order to obtain information on the structure of the degradation products. Further analysis using a GC-MS is needed in order to elucidate the structure of the degradation products. Finally, based on the experiments performed, ozonation seems to be a promising technique for the degradation of antibiotics, even in wastewater.

AB Wastewater reclamation for municipal irrigation is an increasingly attractive option for extending water supplies. However, public health concerns include the potential for development of antibiotic resistance (AR) in environmental bacteria after exposure to residual pharmaceuticals in reclaimed water. Though scientific studies have reported high levels of AR in soils irrigated with wastewater, these works often fail to address the soil resistome, or the natural occurrence of AR. This study compared AR patterns in sediment Enterococcus isolated from water storage basins containing either reclaimed water or groundwater in central Arizona. Resistance to 16 antibiotics was quantified in isolates to a depth of 30 cm. Results reveal high levels of resistance to certain antibiotics, including lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin, exists in sediments regardless of the water source (groundwater, reclaimed water), and higher AR was not detectable in reclaimed water sediments. Furthermore, multiple-antibiotic-resistance (MAR) was substantially reduced in isolates from reclaimed water sediments, compared to freshwater sediment isolates. Comparing the development of AR in sediment bacteria at these two sites will increase awareness of the environmental and public health impacts of using reclaimed water for irrigation of municipal areas, and illustrates the necessity for control sites in studies examining AR development in environmental microbiota.

AB In the present work we fractioned the effluent water from an urban sewage treatment plant (USTP) of Ribarroja (Valencia, Spain) using the conventional protocol based on DAX8 and XAD4 resins. The fractions were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H-NMR, COSY-NMR, HSQC-NMR, FAB+-MS and also by derivatization with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 10% of trimethylchlorosilane. The four fractions obtained have common spectroscopic features and individual compounds indicating that the fractioning procedure is inefficient at separating different families of compounds. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the derivatized fractions allowed identification of many individual compounds. The main classes of organic compounds present in the effluent are saccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, hydroxyacids, aromatic compounds and steroids. Also we were able to identify in the effluent the emerging pollutants paracetamol and ketoprofen - two best-selling anti-inflammatory drugs used in humans.

AB A simple, fast and reliable analytical method for the determination of phosphodiesterase type V inhibitors in wastewater was developed and validated. The method was based on direct injection followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole as mass analyzer. Transformation products and analogues were included in the target list besides the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil). The method performance was thoroughly investigated, including the analyte stability in wastewater and matrix effect. All target compounds presented linear fits between their LOD and 500 ng/L. The quantification limits ranged from 1.6 to 30 ng/L for all compounds except for n-octylnortadalafil (LOQ: 100 ng/L); precision calculated as intraday repeatability was lower than 30%; accuracy calculated as procedural recovery ranged successfully between 85 and 105% in all cases. The method was applied to samples collected during three week-long monitoring campaigns performed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in three Dutch cities. Only sildenafil and its two metabolites, desmethyl- and desethylsildenafil, were present with normalized loads ranging from LOQ to 8.3, 11.8 and 21.6 mg/day/1000 inh, respectively. Two additional week-long sets of samples were collected in Amsterdam at the time that a festival event took place, bringing around 350,000 visitors to the city. The difference in drug usage patterns was statistically studied: "weekday" versus "weekend", "normal" versus "atypical" week; and results discussed. The metabolite to parent drug concentration ratio evolution during consecutive years was discussed, leading to several possible explanations that should be further investigated.

AB Urban wastewater inputs are a relevant pollution source to rivers, contributing a complex mixture of nutrients, organicmatter and organic microcontaminants to these systems. Depending on their composition, WWTP effluents might perform either as enhancers (subsidizers) or inhibitors (stressors) of biological activities. In this study, we evaluated in which manner biofilms were affected by treated urban WWTP effluent, and how much they recovered after exposure was terminated. We used indoor artificial streams in a replicated regression design, which were operated for a total period of 56 days. During the first 33 days, artificial streams were fed with increasing concentration of treated effluents starting with non-contaminated water and ending with undiluted effluent. During the recovery phase, the artificial streams were fed with unpolluted water. Sewage effluents contained high concentrations of personal care products, pharmaceuticals, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter. Changes in community structure, biomass, and biofilm function were most pronounced in those biofilms exposed to 58% to 100% of WWTP effluent, moving from linear to quadratic or cubic response patterns. The return to initial conditions did not allow for complete biofilm recovery, but biofilms from the former medium diluted treatments were the most benefited (enhanced response), while those from the undiluted treatments showed higher stress (inhibited response). Our results indicated that the effects caused by WWTP effluent discharge on biofilm structure and function respond to the chemical pressure only in part, and that the biofilm dynamics (changes in community composition, increase in thickness) imprint particular response pathways over time.

AB A multi-residue method was developed that allows for the simultaneous determination of psychoactive compounds such as opioids, tranquilizers, antiepileptics (primidone, carbamazepine plus two metabolites), the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine, the antidepressant doxepin, as well as the calcium channel blocker verapamil in raw and treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. After solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB at neutral pH, the analytes were detected by LC electrospray tandem MS in the positive ion mode. With a few exceptions relative recoveries of the analytes exceeded 70%. The limits of quantification were in the low ng/L range. Matrix effects were compensated by using appropriate deuterated or C-13-N-15-labeled surrogate standards. For raw and treated wastewater, concentration factors were lowered to reduce matrix effects. Most analytes (15 of 20) were found in raw and treated wastewater as well as in surface water, and hence, are presumably ubiquitously present in the environment. Antiepileptics, the opium alkaloids morphine and codeine, dihydrocodeine, the two tranquilizers oxazepam and temazepam, the opioid tramadol, doxepin, and verapamil were detected in STP discharges and German rivers at concentrations up to the Ag/L range. In drinking water, only carbamazepine, its metabolite 10,11-dihydroxy-10,11- dihydrocarbamazepine, and primidone were present at concentrations up to 0.020 Ag/L.

AB The continuous discharge of antibiotic pharmaceuticals from incomplete wastewater treatment processes into receiving water bodies has become a matter of both scientific and public concern as antibiotics may exert adverse influences on non-target organisms. In this study, the occurrence of seven most commonly prescribed antibiotics belonging to four therapeutic classes of beta-lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones were investigated in the effluent of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and two river waters: Firozabad Ditch (receiving effluent) and Kan River (not receiving effluent) in Tehran, Iran. In 2016, average consumption rate of target antibiotics in Tehran province was evaluated based on Anatomical Therapeutic chemical (ATC)/Deflned Daily Dose (DDD) system and reported as DDD/1000 inh/day. The highest consumption rate was for amoxicillin (128017.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/day), whereas it remained lower for other compounds (amoxicillin > cefixime > azithromycin > ciprofloxacin > cephalexin > erythromycin > penicillin). Ciprofloxacin (79.62 mg/1000 inh/d) and cephalexin (209.51 mg/inh/d) with highest mass loads were evaluated in the influent of WWTP A and WWTP B, respectively. Ciprofloxacin (24.87 mg/1000 inh/d) and cefixime (90.45 mg/1000 inh/d) were the highest evaluated mass loads in the effluent of Ekbatan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP A) and Tehran Southern wastewater treatment plant (WWTP B), respectively. The calculated risk quotients showed that six out of seven target antibiotics posed a high risk to algae (M. aeruginosa and P. subcapitata) and bacteria (P. putida) in the effluent of WWTPs and the rivers wherein amoxicillin and penicillin posed a higher risk than other antibiotics occurring due to their lowest PNEC.

AB Urban source water protection requires knowledge of sources of fecal contamination upstream of drinking water intakes. Combined and sanitary sewer overflows (CSOs and SSOs) are primary sources of microbiological contamination and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) in urban water supplies. To quantify the impact of sewer overflows, predictive simulation models are required and have not been widely applied for microbial contaminants such as fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in urban drainage networks. The objective of this study was to apply a simulation model to estimate the dynamics of three contaminants in sewer overflows - total suspended solids, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and carbamazepine, a WWMP. A mixed combined and pseudo-sanitary drainage network in Quebec, Canada was studied and modelled for a total of 7 events for which water quality data were available. Model results were significantly correlated with field water quality data. The model confirmed that the contributions of E. coli from runoff and sewer deposits were minor and their dominant source was from sewage. In contrast, the main sources of total suspended solids were stormwater runoff and sewer resuspension. Given that it is not present in stormwater, carbamazepine was found to be a useful stable tracer of sewage contributions to total contaminant loads and also provided an indication of the fraction of total suspended solids originating from sewer deposits because of its similar response to increasing flowrates.

AB Natural steroid estrogens (e. g., 17 beta-estradiol, E2), synthetic steroid estrogens (e. g., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, EE2) and pharmaceutical antibiotics (e. g., ciprofloxacin) are chemicals detected in biosolids and sewage sludges because they partition into the solids fraction during the wastewater treatment process. This research utilized a three-way factorial design (six media two estrogens three antibiotic treatments) to quantify cumulative E2 and EE2 mineralization over 133 d (MAX) in a range of sewage sludge and biosolid samples in the presence (4 and 40 mg kg(-1)) and absence of ciprofloxacin. The same three-way factorial design was utilized to quantify the impact of the six media, E2 or EE2, and ciprofloxacin on cumulative soil respiration over 133 d (RESP). Minimal ciprofloxacin mineralization was observed (< 0.05% over 133 d), but despite its persistence, ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on MAX of E2 or EE2, and, in general, no significant effect on RESP. MAX ranged from 38.38% to 48.44% for E2 but from only 0.72% to 24.27% for EE2 although RESP was relatively similar, ranging from 101.00 to 866.54 mg CO2 in the presence of E2 and from 69.55 to 893.95 mg CO2 in the presence of EE2. The sorption-limited bioavailability of EE2, which is inherently resistant to biodegradation due to chemical structure, as MAX and Freundlich sorption coefficients (K-f) were negatively correlated. As such, the Kf values of EE2 were largest in composted biosolids in which EE2 was particularly resistant to microbial degradation as the MAX of EE2 was < 3%. In contrast, the MAX of E2 showed a positive association with the K-f values of E2 because some steps in the E2 transformation process have been found to occur in the sorbed phase. The MAX of E2 was significantly greater in the biosolid and composted biosolid media than in any other media, whereas the MAX of E2 decreased in the following order: secondary sewage sludge > primary sewage sludge > biosolid D composted biosolid. This suggests that sewage sludges in municipal lagoons and pretreatment holding lagoons are a more favorable media for mineralization of EE2, whereas biosolids in post-treatment storage lagoons are a more favorable media for the mineralization of E2. The presence of ciprofloxacin will have no impact on the potential E2 or EE2 mineralization rates in these cases.

AB The conventional approach for the environmental assessment of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is typically based on the removal efficiency of organic load and nutrients as well as the quantification of energy and chemicals consumption. Current wastewater treatment research entails the monitoring of direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), which have been rarely considered in the environmental assessment of a wastewater treatment facility by life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. As a result of that, the real environmental impacts of a WWTP may be underestimated. In this study, two WVVIPs located in different climatic regions (Atlantic and Mediterranean) of Spain were evaluated in extensive sampling campaigns that included not only conventional water quality parameters but also direct GHG emissions and PPCPs in water and sludge lines. Regarding the GHG monitoring campaign, on -site measurements of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were performed and emission factors were calculated for both WWTPs. GHG direct emissions accounted for 62% of the total global warming potential (GWP), much more relevant than indirect CO, emissions associated with electricity use. Regarding PPCPs, 19 compounds were measured in the main streams: influent, effluent and sludge, to perform the evaluation of the toxicity impact categories. Although the presence of heavy metals in the effluent and the sludge as well as the toxicity linked to the electricity production may shade the toxicity impacts linked to PPCPs in some impact categories, the latter showed a notable influence on freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FETP). For this impact category, the removal of PPCPs within the wastewater treatment was remarkably important and arose as an environmental benefit in comparison with the non -treatment scenario.

AB Attenuation of organic compounds in sewage treatment plants (STPs) is affected by a complex interplay between chemical (e.g. ionization, hydrolysis), physical (e.g. sorption, volatilization), and biological (e.g. biodegradation, microbial acclimation) processes. These effects should be accounted for individually, in order to develop predictive cheminformatics tools for STPs. Using measured data from 70 STPs in the Netherlands for 69 chemicals (pharmaceuticals, herbicides, etc.), we highlighted the influences of 1) chemical ionization, 2) sorption to sludge, and 3) acclimation of the microbial consortia on the primary removal of chemicals. We used semi-empirical corrections for each of these influences to deduce biodegradation rate constants upon which quantitative structure-biodegradation relationships (QSBRs) were developed. As shown by a global QSBR, biodegradation in STPs generally relates to structural complexity, size, energetics, and charge distribution. Statistics of the global QSBR were reasonable, being R-training(2) = 0.69 (training set of 51 compounds) and R-validation(2) = 0.50 (validation set of 18 compounds). Class-specific QSBRs utilized electronic properties potentially relating to rate-limiting enzymatic steps. For class-specific QSBRs, values of R-2 of in between 0.7 and 0.8 were obtained. With caution, environmental risk assessment methodologies may apply these models to estimate biodegradation rates for 'data-poor' compounds. The approach also highlights 'meta data' on STP operational parameters needed to develop QSBRs of better predictability in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concentration levels of six natural and anthropogenic origin steroid estrogens, namely, diethylstilbestrol (DES), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethinylestradiol (EE2), and estradiol-17-valerate (Ev), from different effluents in Beijing were assessed. Sampling sites include two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a chemical plant, a hospital, a pharmaceutical factory, a hennery, and a fish pool. In general, concentrations of estrogens in the effluents varied from no detection (nd) to 11.1 ng/l, 0.7 to 1.2 x 10(3) ng/l, nd to 67.4 ng/l, nd to 4.1 x 10(3) ng/l, nd to 1.2 x 10(3) ng/l, and nd to 11.2 ng/l for DES, E1, E2, EE2, E3, and Ev, respectively. The concentration levels of steroid estrogens from different effluents decreased in the order of pharmaceutical factory and WWTP inlets > hospital > hennery > chemical factory > fish pool. This study indicated that natural estrogens E1, E2, and E3 and synthetic estrogen EE2 are the dominant steroid estrogens found in the different Beijing effluents. For source identification, an indicator (hE = E3/(E1 + E2 + E3)) was used to trace human estrogen excretion. Accordingly, hE in effluents from the hospital and WWTP inlets exceeded 0.4, while much smaller values were obtained for the other effluents. Human excretions were the major contributor of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater. Estimation results demonstrated that direct discharge was the major contributor of steroid estrogen pollution in receiving waters.

AB Antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are contaminants of the environment because of their widespread use and incomplete removal by microorganisms during wastewater treatment. The influence of a mixture of ciprofloxacin (CIP), gentamicin (GM), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)/trimethoprim (TMP), and vancomycin (VA), up to a final concentration of 40 mg/L, on the elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrification, and survival of bacteria, as well as the elimination of the antibiotics, was assessed in a long-term study in laboratory treatment plants (LTPs). In the presence of 30 mg/L antibiotics, nitrification of artificial sewage by activated sludge ended at nitrite. Nitrate formation was almost completely inhibited. No nitrification at all was possible in the presence of 40 mg/L antibiotics. The nitrifiers were more sensitive to antibiotics than heterotrophic bacteria. COD elimination in antibiotic-stressed LTPs was not influenced by a parts per thousand currency sign20 mg/L antibiotics. Addition of 30 mg/L antibiotic mixture decreased COD removal efficiency for a period, but the LTPs recovered. Similar results were obtained with 40 mg/L antibiotic mixture. The total viable count of bacteria was not affected negatively by the antibiotics. It ranged from 2.2 x 10(6) to 8.2 x 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) compared with the control at 1.4 x 10(6)-6.3 x 10(6) CFU/mL. Elimination of the four antibiotics during phases of 2.4-30 mg/L from the liquid was high for GM (70-90 %), much lower for VA, TMP, and CIP (0-50 %), and highly fluctuating for SMZ (0-95 %). The antibiotics were mainly adsorbed to the sludge and not biodegraded.

AB Illicit and legal drugs of abuse, including alcohol, continue to be in the focus of many governmental national and international studies due to the important consequences of their consumption at both individual and social level. Estimation of drug use at the community level from the concentrations of the drugs themselves or their major metabolites measured in wastewater has become an increasingly accepted and extended tool, complementary to the methods traditionally used for this purpose. The present work describes the application of this approach, generally known as wastewater epidemiology, to investigate the latest drug consumption patterns and trends in the European city of Barcelona. To this end, a total of 19 selected drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored at the inlet of one of the main wastewater treatment plants of Barcelona every day during one week in March between 2011 and 2015. Analysis of the selected drugs and metabolites in the wastewater samples was performed by means of two methodologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the concentrations obtained were translated into consumption data. In agreement with official records, alcohol, followed by cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds, and methadone were the most consumed drugs. Alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine consumption were on average 18 mL(14 g)/day/inhabitant (>15), 38 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15-64, and 2.4 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15-64, respectively. As for drug use trends, consumption increased over the 5 years monitored for all drugs, but for heroin and diazepam. Weekly profiles characterized by higher consumption over the weekend as compared to weekdays were observed only for alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA. Extrapolation of the data obtained for the area under study to the national Spanish territory yields consumption figures of 142 t of illicit drugs per year and >2500 million euro turnover per year in the black market.

AB The two oxazaphosphorine compounds cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are important cytostatic drugs used in the chemotherapy of cancer and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Their mechanism of action, involving metabolic activation and unspecific alkylation of nucleophilic compounds, accounts for genotoxic effects described in the literature and is reason for environmental concern. The occurrence and fate of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and surface waters in Switzerland, using a highly sensitive analytical method based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The compounds were detected in untreated and treated wastewater at concentrations of < 0.3-11 ng/L, which corresponded well with concentrations predicted from consumption data and typical renal excretion rates. Weekly loads determined in influent and effluent wastewater were comparable and suggested a high persistence in WWTPs. Furthermore, no degradation was observed in activated sludge incubation experiments within 24 h at concentrations of similar to 100 ng/L. Processes that may be relevant for elimination in natural waterbodies were studied with a set of incubation experiments in the laboratory. After extrapolation to natural conditions in surface waters, a slow dark-chemical degradation (half-lives on the order of years) is the most important transformation process. Degradation by photochemically formed HO center dot radicals may be of some relevance only in shallow, clear, and nitrate-rich waterbodies but could be further exploited for elimination of these compounds by advanced oxidation processes, i.e., in a treatment of hospital wastewater. In surface waters, concentrations ranged from <= 50 to 170 pg/L and were thus several orders of magnitude lower than the levels at which acute ecotoxicological effects have been reported in the literature (mg/L range). However, due to a lack of studies on chronic effects on aquatic organisms and data on occurrence and effects of metabolites, a final risk assessment cannot be made.

AB The ability to remove 31 pharmaceuticals was surveyed during seven sampling campaigns at four horizontal flow constructed wetlands in rural areas of the Czech Republic. The constructed wetlands involved in the study treated wastewater from 55 to 248 PE and have been in operation for 10-22 years. A total of 31 pharmaceuticals belonging to antibiotics, antiepileptics, antiphlogistics (NSAID), antibacterial agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, contrast mediums, diuretics, fibrates (lipid regulators), pain medications and psychoactive drugs (stimulants) were included in the survey. The survey revealed that only 7 substances were detected in all samples of inflowing water (ibuprofen, diclofenac, metoprolol, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, paracetamol and caffeine) and 7 substances were found in more than 75% of the samples of inflowing wastewater (clarithromycin, gabapentin, ketoprofen, triclocarban, triclosan, warfarin and tramadol). Other compounds were found only occasionally and roxithromycin, sulfamerazine and gemfibrozil were always below the limit of quantification in the inflow. The detailed evaluation of the treatment removal was done for 14 substances that were detected in at least 75% of the inflow wastewater samples. The results indicated wide variation in removal efficiency among systems as well as among pharmaceuticals. The highest average removal was found for paracetamol (91%), caffeine (84%) and furosemide (75%). Moderate removal (50-75%) was found for triclosan (65%), hydrochlorothiazine (61%), ibuprofen (55%), clarithromycin (54%) and tramadol (53%). Metoprolol (48%), diclofenac (41%), warfarin (31%), ketoprofen (31%) and gabapentin (14%) removal was insufficient and did not exceed 50%. The correlation analysis revealed only few significant correlations between removal of individual pharmaceuticals and other wastewater parameters. Environmental risk assessment revealed high risk for ibuprofen, paracetamol and clarithromycin in the effluent water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of twenty-one pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were investigated in different steps of the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Southwest China. Concentrations of these PhACs were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that 21 target PhACs were present in wastewater and 18 in sludge. The calculated total mass load of PhACs per capita to the influent, the receiving water and sludge were 4.95 mg d(-1) person(-1), 889.94 mu g d(-1) person(-1) and 78.57 mu g d(-1) person(-1), respectively. The overall removal efficiency of the individual PhACs ranged from "negative removal" to almost complete removal. Mass balance analysis revealed that biodegradation is believed to be the predominant removal mechanism, and sorption onto sludge was a relevant removal pathway for quinolone antibiotics, azithromycin and simvastatin, accounting for 9.35-26.96% of the initial loadings. However, the sorption of the other selected PhACs was negligible. The overall pharmaceutical consumption in Chongqing, China, was back-calculated based on influent concentration by considering the pharmacokinetics of PhACs in humans. The back-estimated usage was in good agreement with usage of ofloxacin (agreement ratio: 72.5%). However, the back-estimated usage of PhACs requires further verification. Generally, the average influent mass loads and back-calculated annual per capita consumption of the selected antibiotics were comparable to or higher than those reported in developed countries, while the case of other target PhACs was opposite.

AB The presence of 17 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to various therapeutic categories was investigated in two hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in North West Province, South Africa. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that ofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and bezafibrate were generally below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the analysed samples. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were the dominant pharmaceuticals in the influent streams with corresponding concentrations ranging from 21 to 119 mu g/L and 0.3 to 63 mu g/L, respectively. Both WWTPs were shown to have the capability to remove some of the target PPCPs, including acetaminophen (76-98%), tetracycline (15-93%), ibuprofen (44-99%), and triclocarban (13-98%). The monitoring of the target PPCPs in both influent and effluent samples of the investigated WWTPs revealed that the discharge of inadequately treated effluents could be contributing to the possible increase in the concentrations of these contaminants in the receiving environmental compartments. Further studies must be focused on the broader characterisation of these matrices in order to assess the potential ecological impacts of this waste disposal practice.

AB The performance of four aerated submerged attached growth bioreactors was studied for the removal of three pharmaceutical micro-pollutants (fluoxetine, mefenamic acid and metoprolol) from municipal wastewater. Two packing materials (polyethylene tapes and polyurethane cubes) were compared and the effects of different organic loads (3.0, 6.0, 9.0 and 12 gCOD m(-2) d(-1)) and of the effluent recirculation were investigated. The obtained solid retention times were in the range of 4-37 d. The reactors packed with polyurethane cubes allowed 11-26% higher biomass accumulation than the ones with polyethylene tapes and higher solid retention times. The low organic loads, high solid retention times and the implementation of effluent recirculation enhanced the removal of the three pharmaceutical compounds. The highest removals were achieved at organic load of 3 gCOD m(-2) d(-1) and 50% of effluent recirculation, with hydraulic residence times of 3.1-4.3 h and the solid retention times of 19-32 d. At this condition, the removals of the fluoxetine, mefenamic acid and metoprolol were up to 95, 82 and 73% respectively. The reactors with polyurethane cubes showed higher removals compared with the ones packed with polyethylene tapes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A solid phase extraction (SPE) method has been developed and applied in conjunction with a previously reported liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) procedure for the determination of illicit drugs and abused pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater and surface water samples at the ng L-1 level. A full method validation was also performed and determined levels of analytical sensitivity were found to lie in the 1-10 ng L-1 range using river water as a test sample matrix and a sample size of 500 mL. The developed procedure was successfully applied for the determination of the chosen analytes in wastewater treatment plants in Dublin, Ireland and rapidly expanding commuter towns in the surrounding counties. Cocaine was detected in 70% of the collected samples in the range of 25-489 ng L-1, its primary metabolite, benzoylecognine (BZE) was also detected in the range of 22-290 ng L-1. Other substances detected included morphine, Tempazepam and the primary metabolite of methadone.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) was investigated in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Xiamen City, China. Special emphasis was placed on their co-occurrence and the mass balances of both dissolved and adsorbed PPCPs in influent, effluent, and sludge samples. Results showed that PPCPs were widely detected and their co-occurrence was observed both in the wastewater and sludge that can be attributed to either their similar usage or similar physicochemical properties. These results further emphasize that some specific PPCPs have the potential as indicators or surrogate compounds to reduce the number of targeted PPCPs. The occurrence and distribution of PPCPs also showed strong spatial variations, as the PPCP mass loads per inhabitant were positively correlated with the urbanization levels. Both the removal efficiencies of dissolved PPCPs from the aqueous phase and mass loss proportion of the total PPCPs were evaluated and compared. Overall, a measured total amount of 8500 g PPCPs entered the seven WWTPs daily via influent with 6640 g in the dissolved form, while 3450 g left the WWTPs. The large mass loads of antibiotics in the sludge and effluents indicated their potential adverse effects to the receiving environment.

AB Pharmaceutical products (PPs) belong to emerging contaminants that may accumulate along with other chemical pollutants in wastewaters (WWs) entering industrial and/or urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In the present study, the technique of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-HRMS) was applied for the analysis of 24 multi-class PPs in WW samples collected at different technological stages of Daugavgriva WWTP located in Riga, Latvia. Caffeine and acetaminophen levels in the range of 7,570-11,403 ng/L and 810-1,883 ng/L, respectively, were the predominant compounds among 19 PPs determined in the WW. The results indicate that aerobic digestion in biological ponds was insufficiently effective to degrade most of the PPs (reduction efficiency <0-50.0%) with the exception of four PPs that showed degradation efficiency varying from 55.0 to 99.9%. Tests of short-term chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis for PP degradation in WW samples were performed, and the results reflected the complexity of different degradation mechanisms and physicochemical transformations of PPs. The toxicological studies of WW impact on Daphnia magna indicated gradual reduction of the total toxicity through the treatment stages at the WWTP.

AB Wastewater reuse is currently considered globally as the most critical element of sustainable water management. The dissolved effluent organic matter (dE(f)OM) present in biologically treated urban wastewater, consists of a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds with diverse structures and varying origin, including dissolved natural organic matter, soluble microbial products, endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products residues, disinfection by-products, metabolites/transformation products and others, which can reach the aquatic environment through discharge and reuse applications. dE(f)OM constitutes the major fraction of the effluent organic matter (EfOM) and due to its chemical complexity, it is necessary to utilize a battery of complementary techniques to adequately describe its structural and functional character. dE(f)OM has been shown to exhibit contrasting effects towards various aquatic organisms. It decreases metal uptake, thus potentially reducing their bioavailability to exposed organisms. On the other hand, dE(f)OM can be adsorbed on cell membranes inducing toxic effects. This review paper evaluates the performance of various advanced treatment processes (i.e., membrane filtration and separation processes, activated carbon adsorption, ion-exchange resin process, and advanced chemical oxidation processes) in removing dE(f)OM from wastewater effluents. In general, the literature findings reveal that dE(f)OM removal by advanced treatment processes depends on the type and the amount of organic compounds present in the aqueous matrix, as well as the operational parameters and the removal mechanisms taking place during the application of each treatment technology.

AB This paper reports the application of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the monitoring of one city in the UK in years 20142018 as a means of 1) exploring relative temporal changes of illicit drug usage trends across 5 sampling weeks in 5 years, (2) assessing policy impact in reducing drug consumption, focussing particularly on mephedrone, which was classified as a class B drug in the UK in 2010, and the effects of subsequent regulation such as the novel psychoactive substances (NPS) bill of 2016, (3) investigating temporal changes in consumption of prescription pharmaceuticals vs illicit drug usage, and (4) comparing consumption of prescription drugs with WBE to enable more accurate verification of prescription drugs with abuse potential. Mephedrone was quantified only for the first two years of the study, 20142015, and remained undetected for the next three years of the study. This shows that given enough time changes in drug policy can have an effect on drug consumption. However, after the introduction of the 2016 NPS bill, between the third and fourth study years, there was an observable increase in the consumption of classic drugs of abuse such as cocaine, MDMA and ketamine suggesting a shift away from novel psychoactives. The unique prescription dataset allowed for a more accurate calculation of heroin consumption using morphine by examining other sources morphine. Additionally, for compounds with controlled prescription like methadone, trends in consumption estimated by wastewater and trends in prescription correlated. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool for examining whole populations and determining the efficacy and direction of government actions on health, as it can, alongside prescription and wider monitoring data, provide a clear insight into what is being consumed by a population and what action is needed to meet required goals.

AB This paper presents the analysis of caffeine and carbamazepine transport in the subsurface as a result of wastewater release in the Sorek creek over the outcrops of the carbonate, Yarkon-Taninim, aquifer in Israel. Both caffeine and carbamazepine were used as indicators of sewage contamination in the subsurface. While carbamazepine is considered conservative, caffeine is subject to sorption and degradation. The objective of the study was to quantify differences in their transport under similar conditions in the karst aquifer. Water flow and pollutant transport in a "vadose zone-aquifer" system were simulated by a quasi-3-D dual permeability numerical model. The results of this study show that each of these two pollutants can be considered effective tracers for characterization and assessment of aquifer contamination. Carbamazepine was found to be more suitable for assessing the contamination boundaries, while caffeine can be used as a contaminant tracer only briefly after contamination occurs. In instances where there are low concentrations of carbamazepine which appear as background contamination in an aquifer, caffeine might serve as a better marker for detecting new contamination events, given its temporal nature. The estimated caffeine degradation rate and the distribution coefficient of a linear sorption isotherm were 0.091 d(-1) and 0.1 L kg(-1), respectively, which imply a high attenuation capacity. The results of the simulation indicate that by the end of the year most of the carbamazepine mass (approximately 95 %) remained in the matrix of the vadose zone, while all of the caffeine was completely degraded a few months after the sewage was discharged.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 42 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), 4 steroid estrogens and 15 phthalates in the effluents of 12 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 11 northern cities of China. Of the 61 emerging organic pollutants (EOPs), 49 EOPs were detected, and the detection frequencies of 18 compounds were over 90%. PPCPs were the predominant species and contributed to approximately half of the total EOP concentrations in the most of the investigated WWTPs. The four EOPs with the highest mean concentrations of the 49 were metoprolol (798.0 ng L-1), carbamazepine (597.5 ng L-1), sulpiride (543.5 ng L-1) and dimethyl phthalate (502.6 ng L-1). The levels of some detected EOPs showed positive correlations with the total nitrogen level. In the ecological risk evaluation, roxithromycin, diclofenac acid, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, clindamycin, sulpiride, ibuprofen, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and dimethyl phthalate exhibited high or medium risks in the effluents. Four representative compounds, diclofenac acid, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and dimethyl phthalate, could be selected as indicators for predicting overall EOP levels.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove organic matter, phosphorus, and nitrogen but not other pollutants such as Pharmaceutical Activated Compounds (PhAC). Purpose: This study involves the development of an approach based on a fuzzy version of a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method called TOPSIS which issues such as technology used in each WWTP, atmospheric temperature, hydraulic retention time or population equivalent can help in the decisions to design WWTPs when the efficiency of PhAC removal must be considered. Methodology: Eleven alternatives (WWTPs) located in the Southeast of Spain involving two technologies (MBR and CAS) and considering different ways of quantifying each technology in the TOPSIS ranking were studied. Findings: The resolution of the multi-criteria problem allowed the most efficient WWTPs in the removal of each PhAC to be classified, indicating that the criterion of technology was not overly important. However, some criteria were more relevant than others. Novelty: The current methodology can also be applied to the design of WWTPs to remove different PhAC, considering other criteria with the possibility of reusing wastewater.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the water environment. One of the main removal routes of DCF in wastewater is sludge adsorption, and the mechanisms need to be investigated. In this study, the effects of adsorption time, temperature, pH value, and ionic strength on the adsorption of DCF on suspended particles (SP), secondary sedimentation tank sludge (SSTS) and concentrated sludge (CS) were investigated. The results showed that most of the adsorption of DCF by the three matrices was conducted in the first 4 h and equilibrium was achieved at 8 h. The adsorption kinetics were well fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and the rate constants were 0.29-0.88 mg center dot(mu g center dot min)(-1), with chemical adsorption as the dominant one. Adsorption isotherm conformed to Freundlich, Langmuir and Linear adsorption isotherm models. The order of adsorption capacity was: CS > SSTS > SP, which was proportional to the organic matter content and specific surface area of the adsorbents. The decrease of the pH value and the increase of ionic strength promoted the adsorption of DCF. The results can provide data support for the removal of DCF from different treatment unit types in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Three sites in the Front Range of Colorado, USA, were monitored from May through September 2003 to assess the presence and distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil irrigated with reclaimed water derived from urban wastewater. Soil cores were collected monthly, and 19 pharmaceuticals, all of which were detected during the present study, were measured in 5-cm increments of the 30-cm cores. Samples of reclaimed water were analyzed three times during the study to assess the input of pharmaceuticals. Samples collected before the onset of irrigation in 2003 contained numerous pharmaceuticals, likely resulting from the previous year's irrigation. Several of the selected pharmaceuticals increased in total soil concentration at one or more of the sites. The four most commonly detected pharmaceuticals were erythromycin, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and diphenhydramine. Typical concentrations of the individual pharmaceuticals observed were low (0.02-15 mu g/kg dry soil). The existence of subsurface maximum concentrations and detectable concentrations at the lowest sampled soil depth might indicate interactions of soil components with pharmaceuticals during leaching through the vadose zone. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates that reclaimed-water irrigation results in soil pharmaceutical concentrations that vary through the irrigation season and that some compounds persist for months after irrigation.

AB Partial nitritation-Anammox (PN/A) process has been recognized as a sustainable process for biological nitrogen removal. Although various antibiotics have been ubiquitously detected in influent of wastewater treatment plants, little is known whether functional microorganisms in the PN/A process are capable of biodegrading antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate simultaneous nitrogen and antibiotic removal in a lab-scale one-stage PN/A system treating synthetic wastewater containing a widely-used antibiotic, sulfadiazine (SDZ). Results showed that maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 86.1% and SDZ removal efficiency of 95.1% could be achieved when treating 5 mg/L SDZ under DO conditions of 0.5-0.6 mg/L. Compared to anammox bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) made a major contribution to SDZ degradation through their cometabolic pathway. A strong correlation between amoA gene and SDZ removal efficiency was found (p < 0.01). In addition, the degradation products of SDZ did not exhibit any inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli. The findings suggest that it is promising to apply the PN/A process to simultaneously remove antibiotics and nitrogen from contaminated wastewater.

AB Estimates of cocaine consumption are currently resulting from population surveys, consumer interviews and crime statistics. A new approach ("sewage epidemiology") based on the analysis of cocaine (COC) and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), in water samples was applied to 10 river sites and 30 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Belgium. Each river site was sampled twice, during the summer of 2007 and the winter of 2007-2008, while each WWTP was sampled on a Sunday and a Wednesday, during the summer-autumn of 2007 and the winter of 2007-2008. This sampling strategy allowed for the evaluation of spatial and seasonal variations in the occurrence of COC and BE in waste- and surface water. WWTP Brussel-Noord was sampled for 19 consecutive days to evaluate daily and weekly variations in the presence of COC and BE in wastewater. For 7 WWTPs, influent and effluent water samples were collected to investigate the removal of COC and BE during the wastewater treatment process. Analysis of water samples was performed using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Measured concentrations were further converted into an amount of used cocaine, called cocaine equivalents, as previously described in the literature. Results showed no significant difference in cocaine use between the investigated seasons. A constant cocaine consumption was observed during the week (Monday-Friday) with peaks during the weekend for WWTP Brussel-Noord. The COC/BE ratio in water samples was significantly higher during winter, most probably due to a slower hydrolysis of cocaine in low-temperature water. COC and BE were removed in the investigated WWTPs with a removal efficiency of >93%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A wide variety of pharmaceuticals are discharged in water courses on a daily basis due to their incomplete removal from effluent in treatment plants. The aim of the current study was to assess the occurrence, fate and removal of pharmaceuticals from effluent and sludge samples collected in the biggest sanitary sewer plant in Southern Brazil. In total, 13 pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent through UHPLC-MS/M - paracetamol and caffeine recorded the highest concentrations, 137.98 and 35.29 mu g L-1, respectively. The treated effluent presented 11 compounds. Antibiotics were the class recording the widest diversity; metronidazole showed the lowest concentration (0.023 mu g L-1) and sulfamethoxazole presented the highest concentration (1.374 mu g L-1) in influent samples. Seven pharmaceuticals were absorbed by the sludge; among them, one finds caffeine, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which were quantified both in the effluent and in the sludge. On the other hand, doxycycline, fenbendazole, norfloxacin and tetracycline were only detected in sludge samples - their concentrations ranged from 0.026 to 5.034 mg kg(-1). Clindamycin, oxytetracycline, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim concentrations increased throughout the treatment. There were high paracetamol and caffeine removal rates (>97%), and it may have happened due to degradation, photodegradation or chemical reaction. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin removal rate exceeded 83% mainly due to their sorption by sludge. Finally, the mass balance analysis highlighted high pharmaceutical loads (511.466 g d(-1)) discharged into recipient waterbodies. This outcome demands broadening the removal of these pharmaceuticals from sewage.

AB Five types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) substances were selected as pollutants in this study. The effects of the removal of these pollutants and the microbial succession process in a granular sludge membrane bioreactor (GMBR) were investigated. Results showed that wastewater containing PPCPs influenced the performance of granular sludge. The removal of the five PPCPs from the GMBR had different effects. The removal rates of prednisolone, norfloxacin and naproxen reached 98.5, 87.8 and 84 %, respectively. The degradation effect in the GMBR system was relatively lower for sulphamethoxazole and ibuprofen, with removal efficiency rates of 79.8 and 63.3 %, respectively. Furthermore, the microbial community structure and diversity variation of the GMBR were analysed via high-throughput sequencing technology. The results indicated the structural and functional succession of the microbial community based on the GMBR process. The results indicate the key features of bacteria with an important role in drug degradation.

AB Microcosm constructed wetlands systems established with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and planted with Typha spp. were used to evaluate their ability to remove pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid from wastewaters. Seasonal variability of these systems' performances was also evaluated. Overall, removal efficiencies of 96%, 97% and 75% for ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid, respectively, were achieved under summer conditions after a retention time of 7 days. In winter, a maximum loss of 26% in removal efficiency was observed for clofibric acid. Removal kinetics was characterized by a fast initial step (>50% removal within 6 h) mainly due to adsorption on LECA but, on a larger timescale, plants also contributed significantly to the system's performance. Despite the fact that further tests using larger-scale systems are required, this study points to the possible application of these low-cost wastewater treatment systems for dealing with pharmaceuticals contaminated wastewater.

AB It is widely recognised that inadequate removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater may lead to their presence in surface waters. Hospitals are key point-sources for pharmaceuticals entering municipal waterways, and rural hospitals are of concern as receiving wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may be smaller, less advanced and thus less efficient. While most research has focused on urban settings, here we present results from a rural `'source-to-sink'' study around a hospital. The aim was to determine the contribution of pharmaceuticals discharged to a municipal wastewater system, and, to assess pharmaceutical removal efficiency in the WWTP. Samples were collected daily for one month to assess water quality and pharmaceuticals in the broader water cycle: (i) raw water supply; (ii) treated hospital tap water; (iii) hospital wastewater discharge; (iv) combined WWTP influent; and (v) final WWTP effluent. Target compounds included analgesics/antiinflammatories, antibiotics, psychiatric drugs, and a synthetic estrogen hormone. Concentrations ranged from: 3 ng/L (carbamazepine) to 105,910 ng/L (paracetamol) in hospital discharge; 5 ng/L (ibuprofen) to 105,780 ng/L (paracetamol) in WWTP influent; and 60 ng/L (clarithromycin) to 36,201 ng/L (paracetamol) in WWTP effluent. WWTP removal ranged from 87% (paracetamol) to <0% (carbamazepine and clarithromycin), and significant correlations with water quality characteristics and WWTP flow data were observed for some compounds. Results suggested that the hospital is an important source of certain pharmaceuticals entering municipal wastewater, and associated water quality parameters are impacted. Pharmaceutical persistence in the WWTP effluent highlighted the direct pathway these compounds have into receiving surface water, where their impact remains uncharacterised. Rural regions may face future challenges mitigating environmental risk as WWTP infrastructure ages, populations grow and pharmaceutical use and diversity continue to increase. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The behaviour and fate of carbamazepine (CBZ) in urban wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and its possible effects on the system's efficiency, and on mixed microbial communities, has been studied. The experimental microfiltration MBR system, with capacity to treat 10.8 m(3) d(-1) of urban wastewater, operated with a pre-denitrification configuration with high sludge and hydraulic retention time. The CBZ concentration assayed was higher than in the usual urban wastewater, in order to provoke a strong biomass reaction. Influent, effluent, and all bioreactors of the MBR system were analysed in order to calculate a CBZ balance. Bench-scale experiments and respirometric analyses were performed, with and without the presence of CBZ, to evaluate its influence on the bacterial activity. The respirometric assays showed variations in the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the presence of CBZ. Negative effects were detected in the MBR bacterial community during the initial period of dosing. However, the effects were not permanent and the biomass spiked with CBZ had behaviour similar to that of the biomass without CBZ after a few hours. Biodegradation was not detected during the MBR treatment. The system showed an inefficient elimination of CBZ (less than 10%) with a high concentration in the effluent. The small percentage of CBZ removal was associated with the sludge retention and eliminated by the purge. All CBZ present in the influent was accounted for, and even an increase in the total amount of CBZ was registered in the permeate. During and after the experimental process, CBZ did not significantly affect the efficiency of the MBR system, and the quality of the effluent was not affected by the dosing of CBZ in terms of COD and nitrogen removal.

AB The electrochemical method is an attractive alternative to other methods of wastewater treatment because of its environmental respectability and ease of operation. This study introduces the application of the electrochemical method for treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater.
   Electrochemical degradation of phenol was evaluated at two typical anodes, Ti/RuO2-Pt and Ti/IrO2-Pt, as a treatment method in toxic aromatic compounds discharged by chemical plants, petroleum refineries and pharmaceutical factories. According to the results, the electrochemical process for effective removal of phenol and ammonium was achieved in the presence of NaCl, in which phenol could be readily mineralized. For electrochemical reduction of nitrate, the Cu-Zn alloy cathode and the Ti/IrO2-Pt anode were used in an undivided cell. The Cu-Zn alloy cathode has a significant capacity of electrochemical reduction of nitrate. Under the conditions of 10mA/cm(2), addition of 500 mg/L NaCl and the parallel connection, the nitrate-N decreased from 50.0 mg/L to 9.8 mg/L for the 240-min electrolysis. Neither ammonia-N nor nitrite-N was detected at the end of electrolysis.
   Moreover, a series of experiments were performed with two types of practical electrochemical treatment systems (treatment capacities of 4m(3)/hr and 0.5m(3)/hr) using effluents from an anaerobic digester (EAD) of cattle wastewater, supernatants from primary sedimentation in a sewage plant (SPS) and domestic wastewater to evaluate the systems' treatment abilities. As a result, for both EAD and SPS, the 4 m(3)/hr system was found to remove 87 to 91% of T-P, 74 to 96% of T-N, 70 to 94% of NH4-N, 88 to 91% of TOC and 75 to 87% of COD. Similarly, the 0.5 m(3)/hr system was able to remove 62 to 90% of T-P, 83 to 92% of T-N, 90 to 100% of NH4-N, 75to 83% of TOC and 80 to 100% of COD. On the other hand, a pilot plant of an electrochemical treatment system (0.3 m(3)/hr) was successfully developed by treating domestic wastewater, pond water containing algae and wastewater from hog raising, in which electrocogulation and electrooxidation processes were used. In this system, the removal of T-N, T-P, NH4-N and COD from domestic wastewater and pond water containing algae was approximately 90%, while the removal of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) of algae was approximately 100%.

AB This study is the first to investigate the pharmaceutical burden from point sources affecting the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Kristianstads Vattenrike, Sweden. The investigated Biosphere Reserve is a > 1000 km(2) wetland system with inflows from lakes, rivers, leachate from landfill, and wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs). We analysed influent and treated wastewater, leachate water, lake, river, and wetland water alongside sediment for six model pharmaceuticals. The two WWTPs investigated released pharmaceutical residues at levels close to those previously observed in Swedish monitoring exercises. Compound-dependent WWTP removal efficiencies ranging from 12 to 100 % for bendroflumethiazide, oxazepam, atenolol, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were observed. Surface-water concentrations in the most affected lake were aeyen100 ng/L for the various pharmaceuticals with atenolol showing the highest levels (> 300 ng/L). A small risk assessment showed that adverse single-substance toxicity on aquatic organisms within the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is unlikely. However, the effects of combinations of a large number of known and unknown pharmaceuticals, metals, and nutrients are still unknown.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) constitute a group of chemicals of concern because of their potential toxicity when reaching aquatic environments. Wastewaters are one of the main pathways of introduction into the environment of the chemical compounds used in PPCPs because, in most cases, wastewater treatment facilities are not 100% efficient in their removal. This problem is accentuated in rural zones and isolated communities where conventional treatment systems are too expensive to build and operate. Waste-stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands (CWs) are natural wastewater treatment systems which are used to improve the quality of sewage from small communities because of their low cost and easy maintenance. There is growing interest in combining the two technologies to make a more robust system, taking into account their respective strengths and weaknesses.
   In this work, a combined macrophyte pond-CW system was evaluated for the presence at three sampling points (influent, pond effluent and CW effluent) of fifteen steroid hormones and six benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers (BUVSs). None of the targeted BUVS compounds were detected in either the influent or effluent, probably because of the particular characteristics of the population served by the wastewater system. In contrast, eight different steroid hormone compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from 17.3 to 247.7 ng.L-1 in influent samples and from 8.1 to 22.1 ng.L-1 in final effluent samples. The pond-CW system showed high elimination rates of steroid hormone residues with average removal efficiencies of over 77%. This efficacy was confirmed in the ecological risk assessment evaluation that was performed. Final effluents showed a low ecological risk associated with steroid hormones in contrast to the medium-high ecological risks found in the influent samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence of emerging contaminants in environmental waters is directly related to their removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the flow rate of the receiving waters. Mediterranean rivers are characterized by important fluctuations in the flow rates and heavy contamination pressures from extensive urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. This translates in contamination levels most often higher than in other European basins. This paper reviews the data regarding the levels of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs detected in wastewaters and gives an overview of their removal by conventional treatment technologies applying activated sludge. Pharmaceutically active compounds and illicit drugs are selected as two important groups of emerging environmental contaminants that have raised an increasing interest in the scientific community. Their removal in WWTP, the influence of hydrological conditions in the receiving rivers, and dilution factors are described and examples are provided for selected WWTP and rivers in Catalonia (NE Spain).

AB The occurrence of azole antifungals in the environment presents one of the emerging concerns due to their ecotoxicological threat as well as their potential contribution to the evolution of drug resistant fungi in the environment. In this study, the occurrence of eight commonly prescribed azole antifungal drugs was seasonally determined in influent and effluent water samples from three wastewater treatment plants and a drinking water treatment plant in South Africa. In addition, the risk quotient (RQ) method was employed to investigate the potential ecological and human health risks associated with their presence in the wastewater and/or drinking water. Clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and miconazole were detected at least once in the water samples, while posaconazole and voriconazole were not detected in any of the samples for all seasons at which the samples were collected. Fluconazole was detected at higher frequency (about 96%) with a concentration up to 9959.0 ng L-1. Clotrimazole had the second highest frequency of detection (about 33%) with a concentration up to 143.3 ng L-1. Statistically significant temporal variation in clotrimazole (p < 0.05) and spatial variation in fluconazole (p < 0.05) were observed. In general, the preliminary ecological risk assessment based on risk quotient (RQ) calculation indicated that there is currently no high risk against aquatic organisms (Algae, Daphnia and Fish) related to the azole antifungals. Meanwhile, human health risk assessment demonstrated that fluconazole represented high risk in drinking water. Furthermore, risk estimates showed a potential for the detected concentrations of fluconazole and itraconazole in water samples to pose moderate to high risk for development of antifungal drug resistance. Some of the azole antifungal drugs are ubiquitous in the wastewater and future monitoring and validation studies should be conducted for those drugs that seem to pose human health and ecological risks.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater often contains high levels of antibiotic residues and serves as an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and ARGs. Here, we designed a lab-scale simulation reactor, including up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), anoxic-oxic tank (A/O), and four separate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) i.e., UV, Ozonation, Fenton, and Fenton/UV, to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 ARGs from a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d-operation. Among all treatment units, UASB provided the greatest contribution (85.8 +/- 16.1%) for the removal of 18 antibiotics. The mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin (62.5-80.9%), while sorption to sludge (73.9%) was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in UASB. Meanwhile, the substantial decrease of ARG absolute abundance (log reduction by 0.1-3.1 fold) through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment (1.2-3.8 log units) from the influent to the A/O unit. Fenton/UV combination was the most effective AOP for the removal of ARGs. Finally, the optimum operating conditions for the removal of ARGs using Fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high ARG elimination. Overall, this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real PWWTPs for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and ARGs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work focuses on the treatment of real effluents from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (RE) with solar photo-Fenton (5 mg and 20 mg L-1 Fe, pH similar to 3 and 50 mg L-1 initial H2O2 concentration) at pilot plant scale. In some experiments RE was spiked with 15 different (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan) emerging contaminants (ECs) at 100 and 5 mu g L-1 each which were added directly into RE prior to treatment. All experiments showed successful degradation of ECs in real effluents from different municipal wastewater treatment plants at low iron concentration (5 mg L-I). Although the most degradation took place during the Fenton process, photo-Fenton was necessary to degrade all ECs below their limit of detection (LOD). In the case of the RE containing 52 ECs (determined by HPLC-QTRAP-MS), four of them could not be degraded to their LOD and were still present, although at extremely low concentrations (nicotine 47 ng L-1, cotinine 11 ng L-1, chlorfenvinphos 99 ng L-1, and caffeine 8 ng L-1). ECs were easily degraded by (OH)-O-center dot without substantial competition with the organic content of the RE.

AB An investigation was carried out in the New York City Watershed for the presence of selected pharmaceuticals. In four seasonal sampling events between August 2003 and May 2004, surface water was collected from eight reservoir keypoints and effluent was collected from four wastewater treatment plants. We evaluated the following twelve compounds: amoxicillin, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, cephalexin, estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and valproic acid. In the treated effluents, carbamazepine was detected most frequently (100%; concentration range: 22-551 ng/L), followed by atenolol (94%; ND - 14,200 ng/L), trimethoprim (83%; ND - 37,000 ng/ L), ibuprofen (61%; ND - 14,600 ng/L), and caffeine (49%; ND - 37,200 ng/L), while estrone was detected once (56 ng/L). In the reservoir keypoint samples, only ibuprofen (2.5%; ND 932 ng/L) and caffeine (2.9%; ND - 177 ng/L) were detected. The other analytes were not detected in any sample. It is expected that investigation of other wastewater treatment plants in the New York City Watershed would show that their effluents are also a potential source of pharmaceuticals, but that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to be detected in the Watershed's surface waters.

AB Clofibric acid (CA) is widely used as regulator of lipid levels in blood; it is considered one of the residual drugs that have a high persistence in the aquatic environment. After wastewater treatment, only a small amount of CA can be removed. The aim of this work was to investigate the reduction of CA in contaminated wastewater using calcined anionic clay ZnAl-CO3, which was chosen for its higher adsorption capacity, recyclability, and non-regeneration of sludge. The maximum retention amount, Q(m), exceeded 2220 mg g(-1), and the value of Delta H degrees suggested a physical process. The removal rate achieved 90 %, and the remaining quantity was widely below the tolerance thresholds. Retention was achieved by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate molecules. Recycling tests clearly suggested that this material is recyclable, promising, and very effective compared to other adsorbents. This retention contributes to the attenuation of persistent lipid regulator.

AB Land application of recycled manure produced from biosolids and reclaimed wastewater can transfer pharmaceutical chemicals to terrestrial environments, giving rise to potential accumulation of these residues in edible plants. In this study, the potential for plant uptake of 13 pharmaceutical chemicals, and the relation between the accumulation features within the plant and the physicochemical properties were examined by exposing pea and cucumber to an aqueous solution containing pharmaceutical chemicals. Ten of 13 compounds tested were detected in plant leaves and stems. Comparison of the plant uptake characteristics and the octanol water partition coefficient of pharmaceutical chemicals showed that compounds with an intermediate polarity such as carbamazepine and crotamiton could be easily transported to plant shoots. Moreover, these results suggest the possibility of highly hydrophilic pharmaceutical chemicals such as trimethoprim and sulfonamides to be accumulated in plant roots owing to their low permeability in root cell membranes.

AB Sorption is an important mechanism for removal of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in biological wastewater treatment. In an effort to deepen our understanding of this process, this work investigated the underlying thermodynamic parameters. Biomass was harvested from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and sorption experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures. Sorption of EE2 to activated sludge was spontaneous (Delta G values were between -16 and -11 KJ/mol), enthalpy-driven (Delta H values were -37 KJ/mol (MBR) and -48 KJ/mol (SBR)), and entropy-retarded (Delta S values were -74 (MBR) and -119J/mol/K (SBR)). Although EE2 is nonpolar, hydrophobic interactions were not dominant driving forces. The thermodynamic data also suggested that EE2 sorption to biomass was primarily physisorption, but it also included low-level chemisorption. The FT-IR results suggested that chemical reactions were not significant enough to shift the detectable chemical bonding characteristics of the biomass functional groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and removal of ten bisphenol analogues (BPs) in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and laboratory scale activated sludge bioreactor (ASBR) were studied. All targeted BPs except for tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) were detected in the four WWTPs (W1, W2, W3 and W4) in the ng/L and ng/g dry weight range in wastewater and activated sludge, respectively, indicating that in addition to BPA, the BPA substitutes were widely used in our daily life and industrial production. Discrepant results regarding the removal efficiencies of BPs by different wastewater treatment processes were obtained. The removal rates were 55.6%, 24.4%, -10.1%, 71.4%, 38.9%, 58.0%, 39.1% and 6.4% in W1, 65.4%, 32.8%, 44.7, -13.5%, 20.1%, -29.6%, -25.1% and 99.4% in W2, 11.6%, 48.8%, 38.9%, 22.0%, 99.0%, -29.2%, -56.5% and 32.6% in W3, 33.9%, 30.5%, 17.4%,-47.6%, 62.9%, 83.0%, 4.4% and -4.3% in W4, for BPA, BPB, BPE, BPF, BPS, BPZ, BPAF and BPAP, respectively. The removal of ten targeted BPs in lab-scale continuous flow conventional ASBR and the key factors were investigated. The simulated laboratory-scale ASBR were highly effective in removing BPA, BPB, BPE, BPF, BPM and BPS with removal efficiencies of >94.3%, while BPZ, BPAP, BPAF and TCBPA were recalcitrant to elimination in the stimulated bioreactor with removal efficiencies of 71.3 +/- 13.7%, 55.1 +/- 21.2%, 47.4 +/- 9.5% and 45.3 +/- 16.6%, respectively. Protonation, hydrophobicity and molecular features of BPs were critical for their elimination in wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aerated lagoons, typically used by small communities, often provide limited removal of wastewater nutrients. Given increasingly stringent wastewater standards, it is imperative that effective, but economical and easy-to-operate, treatment technologies be developed. The Submerged Attached Growth Reactor (SAGR (R)) is a treatment process developed to perform nitrification near freezing temperatures. Previous tests on full-scale installations have shown that SAGR could consistently remove ammonia to below current Canadian standards and provide additional total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand removal. In this study, we evaluated removal of polar chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides, at SAGR installations in two Manitoba First Nations communities (MCN and LPFN) under cold winter conditions. Both showed some removal of diclofenac, naproxen, clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim, likely by biotransformation. Average naproxen removal was 21% (2.53 x 10(3) ng L-1) in MCN and 64% (1.58 x 10(3) ng L-1) in LPFN. Atenolol was well-removed by SAGR, by 80% on average (range of 64%-94%). Clarithromycin, metoprolol, and trimethoprim removal was similar within and between systems, ranging from 54% to 76% (30.8-3.07 x 10(2) ng L-1 removed). Carbamazepine was detected in nearly all samples, but was not well-removed, consistent with other treatment studies. Overall, results showed that SAGR technology could moderately remove CECs, while providing the designed treatment performance for other parameters. This work will help to improve our understanding of wastewater treatment in small and/or remote communities with limited infrastructure and challenging cold-weather conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Passive samplers (SPMDs, semi-permeable membrane devices; POCIS, polar organic chemical integrative samplers) were deployed in Lake Ontario near Pickering, Ajax, and Port Hope, Ontario in 2008 and complemented with detailed water quality indicator and water current measurements. The intent was to examine the influences of source inputs and limnological features on the distribution and dilution patterns of several organic wastewater-associated chemicals (OWCs) in dynamic nearshore waters. Generally, concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 11 ng/L for most pharmaceuticals and up to 25 ng/L for gemfibrozil and 28 ng/L for caffeine based on previously determined POCIS sampling rates. Musk (HHCB and AHTN) and triclosan (TCS) concentrations were estimated using laboratory-derived sampling rates as part of this study (4.3-7.9 L/d) and ranged up to 10 ng/L for musks and 1.5 ng/L for TCS near Pickering-Ajax. Nitrate and conductivity maps indicated that alongshore currents were primary drivers of distribution and transport for tributary discharges and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents parallel to shore. Organic wastewater chemicals like HHCB, AHTN, TCS, gemfibrozil, and venlafaxine were greatest in the vicinity of the Pickering-Ajax WWTP and then dramatically declined. Ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and especially caffeine concentrations exhibited more uniform distributions both within and between the Pickering-Ajax and Port Hope study areas suggesting that transport via alongshore currents may contribute to a regional background of the relatively more persistent OWCs that may not be captured in onshore-offshore gradient studies.

AB Naproxen is an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that has been detected in natural and engineered aquatic environments. The primary aim of this research was to study chemical transformations of naproxen following chlorine oxidation, which is common in water and wastewater treatment systems. Synthetic waters containing elevated concentrations of naproxen were oxidized by free chlorine at naproxen:chlorine molar ratios of 0.02-3:1 and pH values of 5-9. The formation of naproxen products was dependent on pH, chlorine dosage and contact time. This study demonstrates that naproxen readily reacts with free chlorine and forms disinfection products. The formation of specific reaction products can vary depending on the characteristics of the water or wastewater and treatment operating conditions. More research is needed to identify intermediate and chemical reaction end products and to understand the reaction kinetics of naproxen chlorination for a range of water and wastewater treatment conditions. A secondary aim of this research was to study effects of naproxen and its chlorination products on biofilm processes, which are common in water and wastewater treatment systems and natural aquatic environments. A bioreactor was fed a naproxen solution and then fed a solution at the same naproxen concentration following contact with free chlorine. Results indicate that naproxen was not degraded biologically for the conditions of this study. In contrast, the naproxen solution containing products of chlorination caused an adverse response by discharging biomass from the bioreactor. Results therefore demonstrate that naproxen products of chlorination can adversely affect a biofilm process, which potentially can impact the performance of biofilm processes in natural and engineered aquatic environments. More research is needed to study naproxen chlorination reactions at low concentrations and in complex matrices, and to understand the toxicological relevance of naproxen and its products of chlorination in natural and engineered aquatic environments.

AB Aqueous sampling rates for 25 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were determined on the commercially available passive Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS). To date, POCIS calibration has only been carried out for a handful of compounds. Uptake rates were 0.040 to 2.462 L/d under conditions of flowing water; quiescent conditions resulted in uptake rates between 0.016 and 0.223 L/d. The uptake of many PPCPs appears to be boundary-layer controlled, as indicated by higher sampling rates under flowing conditions. Sampling rates were corrected for analyte dissipation rates, and some correlations with octanol-water partition coefficients were noted. Field deployments of POCIS in wastewater effluent and surface waters had time-weighted average concentrations derived from laboratory calibrations that were consistent with regular grab samples. This work indicates that POCIS can be used as a quantitative tool for measuring PPCPs in the aquatic environment.

AB A key uncertainty of wastewater-based epidemiology is the size of the population which contributed to a given wastewater sample. We previously developed and validated a Bayesian inference model to estimate population size based on 14 population markers which: (1) are easily measured and (2) have mass loads which correlate with population size. However, the potential uncertainty of the model prediction due to in-sewer degradation of these markers was not evaluated. In this study, we addressed this gap by testing their stability under sewer conditions and assessed whether degradation impacts the model estimates. Five markers, which formed the core of our model, were stable in the sewers while the others were not. Our evaluation showed that the presence of unstable population markers in the model did not decrease the precision of the population estimates providing that such as acesulfame remained in the model. However, to achieve the minimum uncertainty in population estimates, we propose that the core markers to be included in population models for other sites should meet two additional criteria: (3) negligible degradation in wastewater to ensure the stability of chemicals during collection; and (4) < 10% in-sewer degradation could occur during the mean residence time of the sewer network.

AB Several parameters of the method, solid-phase extraction (SPE)-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), were optimized to investigate the presence and partitioning of 18 antibiotics (including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, macrolides, and beta-lactams) during various processing stages at two typical pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) in northern China. Oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC), and tetracycline (TC) were all detected in each stage of both PWWTPs. Antibiotics were largely removed through biological units of both PWWTPs, with removal efficiencies of 62.0 to 78.3 %. Mass balance analyses indicated that degradation (44.8-53.7 % for PWWTP1 and 40.1-59.6 % for PWWTP2) was the major mechanism responsible for the removal of tetracyclines, whereas the contribution of sorption by sludge (12.6-20.0 % for PWWTP1 and 18.7-33.5 % for PWWTP2) was less significant for the investigated pharmaceuticals. Although there was significant removal of tetracyclines through PWWTPs, large amounts of tetracyclines were still discharged through the effluent (up to 32.0 +/- 6.0 mg L-1) and dewatered sludge (up to 5,481.1 +/- 123.0 mg kg(-1)), which increased the risk of selecting for antibiotic resistance in the receiving water and soil environments.

AB A total of 76 wastewater samples were randomly collected from pharmaceutical, textile, and detergent-manufacturing industries as well as the Agbara Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Thirty-eight samples each in 2-L plastic containers were collected for morning and evening effluent used for this study. Composite samples were later developed and the physico-chemical properties of these samples determined. The physico-chemical properties of the composite wastewater influenced the selected microbial population adapted to utilization of detergent components. The optimum temperature range of the composite wastewater was 33.9-34.3 degrees C while the mean optimum pH ranged from 6.9-8.8 for the laboratory simulated biodegradation of test detergents. Although, the fungal consortium was eliminated as the medium approached the alkaline pH, this is as a result of the metabolites produced. The macroelements, the BOD and the hydrocarbon concentration of the composite effluent were above the EU and FEPA limits for discharged effluent. The composite effluent was thereafter spiked with test detergents (Elephant, Omo, Klin, Ariel Persil, Teepol, and SDS) at 0.01% (w/v) and its progressive degradation monitored for 30 days. The microbial detergent-degraders population changed between Day 0 and 15, thereafter it stabilized. The heterotrophic bacterial count from the seventy-six randomly collected effluent samples was 42.9 x 10(6) cfu/ml, while the mean bacterial detergent-degrader population was 20.94 x 10(6) cfu/ml. The mean fungal population from the randomly collected effluent sample was 4.5 x 10(6) cfu/ml. The bacterial detergent-degraders characterized and identified include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus majodoratus, Klebsiella liquefasciens, Enterobacter liquefasciens, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus albus, Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca and Brevibacterium sp., while the fungal detergent-degrader included; Mycellophthora thermophila, Geomyces sp., Alternaria alternata, Fusarium sp., Aspergillus flavus and Asperigillus oryzae. The primary biodegradability of synthetic detergent was confirmed by the Methylene Blue-Active Substance (MBAS) method. Gas chromatography (GC) provided the convincing evidence of synthetic detergent mineralization within the 30 day period in a sewage treatment plant. The detection of unusual peaks in the GC profiles provided the scientific evidence of inclusion of certain hydrocarbons in detergent formulation outside that of industry specifications. The unusual peaks are attributable to inclusion of certain chemical optical brighteners (C-17-C-24). Linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS) which is the principal synthetic detergent component are thus biodegradable and its use in detergent formulation is environment-friendly.

AB The plant nutrients consumed in human society today are lost through the established wastewater treatment systems in industrialised countries as well as via insufficient or non-existent handling of sewage in the developing world. New sanitation systems have been designated to overcome this failure. The source separated wastewater streams collected within these systems contain a high nutrient content, and can be used as fertiliser as well as soil conditioner after appropriate storage and/or treatment. Application in agriculture with existing techniques is feasible. However, pathogens and pharmaceuticals contained in these fertiliser types are a potential hazard. Nevertheless, storage and appropriate treatment can minimise the risks. The products deriving from these systems have a high potential to preserve available plant nutrient resources and deficiencies in agriculture as well as being able to substitute synthetic plant nutrients and at the same time prevent unwanted environmental nutrient over-enrichment.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence and removal of 10 steroid hormones (4 androgens, 3 progestagens and 3 estrogens) in two WSP systems, Mafisa and Mzumbe in Morogoro, Tanzania. All 10 steroid hormones were detected in the influent of both WSP systems in the dry as well as in the rainy season. The concentrations of steroids in influent wastewater ranged from 0.1 ng/L for 17-OH-pregnenolone to 445 ng/L for estrone and from below limit of detection for 17-OH-pregnenolone to 45 ng/L for estrone in effluent. During dry season, the overall mean standard deviation removal efficiency for the 10 steroids were 70 +/- 21% for Mzumbe WSP and 97 +/- 3% for Mafisa WSP. During the rainy season the overall mean removal efficiency for all the steroid hormones were 52 +/- 32% for Mzumbe WSP and 94 +/- 8% for Mafisa WSP. Risk was characterized by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) for fish and humans. 46% of the total RQs calculated were above one, indicating high risk. Low RQs were estimated for androgens and progestagens but the estrogen concentrations measured in the WSP systems and Morogoro River indicated a high risk for fish. However, estrogens appeared not to pose an appreciable risk to human health from water intake and fish consumption. The results indicated that WSP systems are quite effective in removing steroid hormones from wastewater. Thus, low technology systems such as WSP systems are suitable techniques in low income counties due to relatively low costs of building, operating and maintaining these systems.

AB The goal of this study is to investigate the occurrence and removal of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) during wastewater treatment processes and understand the role of enhanced nitrification treatment in removing EOCs. The influent and effluent of each treatment step at two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. A suspect screening method was applied with a comprehensive self-compiled suspect list. The list is composed of 1225 EOCs in 5 categories: pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, industrial chemicals, and metabolites. A total of 292-341 suspect hits were retrieved. The structures of 56 out of 86 selected suspect hits were further validated. The estimated influent concentrations of different EOCs varied from several ng L-1 to less than a hundred mu g L-1. Paracetamol, caffeine, benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazole, DEET, gabapentin, metformin, N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, atenolol acid, triethanolamine, and triethylphosphate were detected in the influent with high abundance. The results also revealed that many EOCs, such as fexofenadine, citalopram, flecainide, had low removal efficiencies. Seasonal effects were larger than the location influence on EOC removal. The secondary biological treatment played the most crucial role in EOC removal, whereas other steps except the enhanced nitrification step had a minor contribution. The enhanced nitrification step substantially removed a small number of EOC suspects. Notably, a reverse transformation from product to parent was also observed. This study provides systematic information on the occurrence and removal of EOCs in WWTPs and first important insights into the roles of the enhanced nitrification step in wastewater treatment.

AB The removal of six endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (NP), was investigated in 20 rural wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) located in a county of Zhejiang Province, China. These WWTFs adopted one of the four treatment processes: activated sludge (AS), constructed wetland (CW), stabilization pond (SP), and micro-power biofilm reactor (MP). Results indicate that all the six EDCs were detected in wastewater samples with NP showing a maximum detection frequency (97%) and a maximum influent concentration (5002 ng L-1). After biological treatment, the concentrations of E2, E3 and NP decreased remarkably, while El, EE2 and BPA exhibited varying removal efficiencies that depended on the specific treatment process and sampling season. In general, the centralized AS process outperformed those decentralized processes (i.e., CW, SP and MP) and a higher removal of El, EE2, NP and BPA in the AS process was observed in summer (>70%) than in winter. Among the three decentralized processes, the removal of EDCs in the SP process was limited, especially for El, EE2 and BPA (18-46%) in winter. Due to an incomplete removal, the total concentration of target EDCs increased obviously in the mixing and downstream sections of a local river receiving the effluent from a typical WWTF (practicing AS). This study reveals that the design and operation of rural WWTFs should be optimized if an effective removal of EDCs is to be achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB According to International Diabetes Federation estimates, China has the highest rate of diabetes in the world. To monitor the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in near real-time, a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, was used. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was applied to estimate the consumption of metformin in Dalian from 2015 to 2018. Quantification of metformin was undertaken using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and N-methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) derivatization prior to GC-MS analysis. The concentrations of metformin in eleven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) ranged from 1.7 mu g/L to 239.0 mu g/L, with an average value of 68.3 mu g/L. For metformin consumption, there was a gradual increase from 12.1 mg/d/capita in 2015 to 28.4 mg/d/capita in 2018. Meanwhile, the prevalence of metformin in the Dalian population ranged from 1.6% in 2015 to 3.8% in 2018. Similarly, the prevalence of DM showed an increasing trend from 12.2% in 2015 to 21.6% in 2018, which is consistent with the data predicted by traditional surveys (15.2-19.8%). Additionally, the prevalence of DM in 2015 estimated based on WBE was 12.2%, which agreed with the results from the traditional survey (12.3%). These results indicated that the proposed method provided a feasible way to reveal the prevalence of DM through metformin monitoring by the WBE approach. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Ozone and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) reaction kinetics were measured for 14 antibacterial compounds from nine structural families, to determine whether municipal wastewater ozonation is likely to result in selective oxidation of these compounds' biochemically essential moieties. Each substrate is oxidized by ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant, k(O3,app)' > 1 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), at pH 7, with the exception of N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole (k(O3,app)' is 2.5 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) k(O3,app)' values (pH 7) for macrolides, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, vancomycin, and amikacin appear to correspond directly to oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. Initial reactions of ozone with N(4)-acetylsulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, lincomycin, and beta-lactams do not lead to appreciable oxidation of biochemically essential moieties. However, ozone oxidizes these moieties within fluoroquinolones and lincomycin via slower reactions. Measured k(O3,app)' values and second-order center dot OH rate constants, k(center dot OH,app') were utilized to characterize pollutant losses during ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent. These losses were dependent on k(O3,app)', but independent of k(center dot OH,app)". H,app- Ozone doses >= 3 mg/L yielded >= 99% depletion of fast-reacting substrates (k(O3,app)' > 5 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) at pH 7.7. Ten substrates reacted predominantly with ozone; only four were oxidized predominantly by center dot OH. These results indicate that many antibacterial compounds will be oxidized in wastewater via moiety-specific reactions with ozone.

AB While wastewater treatment standards have been progressively increasing, emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals can nonetheless pass through treatment and end up in our watersheds. Pharmaceuticals in the parts-per-billion range can impact fish behavior, survival, and recruitment in the wild. However, the ecological risk posed by whole municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), a complex mixture, is not clear. This knowledge gap is particularly evident for early lifestages (ELS) of fish, and because effluent discharge events are typically short, the effects of short-term MWWE exposures to ELS fish are particularly important from an environmental perspective. Here we tested the effects of rapid 30-min exposures, and short-term 24- and 72-h exposures to MWWE on development, behaviors, and stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, larvae, and juveniles. We obtained 24-h composite samples of tertiary-treated MWWE that contained a mixture of chemicals with affinities for serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and ion-channel receptors. Embryos exposed to 5%, 10%, and 50% MWWE experienced developmental delays in somitogenesis and hatching rate, although there was no effect on survival. Embryonic photomotor responses were affected following 30-min and 24-h exposures to 10% and 50% MWWE, and larval visual motor responses were reduced from 24-h exposure to 10% MWWE. Exposure to 10% MWWE dulled the juvenile cortisol and lactate response following an acute air-exposure. Compromised behavioral and stress performances demonstrate the capacity of MWWE to impact phenotypes critical to the survival of fish in the environment. Taken together, we found that zebrafish were sensitive to toxic effects of MWWE at multiple life-stages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A lab-scale system consisting of a methanogenic and an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was operated for seven months to investigate major pollutants' and polar organic micropollutants' removal from domestic wastewater under three different organic loading rates (OLRs). For all OLR values tested, the system achieved efficient COD (> 84%) and NH4-N removal (> 96%); both reactors contributed to the decrease of organic loading, while the aerobic bioreactor was exclusively responsible for the removal of ammonium nitrogen. The increase of OLR from 0.20 +/- 0.10 to 2.10 +/- 0.20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) resulted to increase of the detected volatile fatty acids in the anaerobic reactor and increase of the produced biogas to 172.7 +/- 25.3 mL L reactor(-1)d(-1). All target micropollutants were partially removed during different experimental phases; their removal ranged between 31% (5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 5TTR) and 97% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole, OH-BTH). Except benzotriazole (BTR) and OH-BTH, both reactors contributed significantly to the removal of target micropollutants, while the addition of extra aerobic MBBR as a final polishing step enhanced only OH-BTH removal. Use of experimental and literature data showed that the increase of organic loading enhanced the removal of three out of five target micropollutants, while the key factor responsible for this effect was COD concentration in influent wastewater. The modelling of micropollutants' removal efficiency using biodegradation kinetics calculated in batch experiments showed satisfactory correlation between predicted and measured values for most target compounds.

In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 50 phenolic compounds in wastewater was developed. Deconvolution technology was used to identify contaminants that are covered by co-extracted materials. A mass spectral library containing all 50 silylated phenolic compounds was first established and used for deconvolution. Twelve typical phenolic compounds were selected to optimize the sample preparation procedures. Solid-phase extraction using a C18 cartridge coupled with an HLB cartridge was used for pre-concentration and dichloromethane was used for elution. The solutes were derivatized and analyzed by GC-MS. The blank and matrix spike recoveries ranged from 57.46% to 136.4% and 47.87% to 114.8%, respectively. Method detection limits ranged from 3.64 to 97.64 ng L-1. The relative standard deviations of all the recovery experiments were lower than 13.6%. The instrument limits of quantification ranged from 0.7 to 87.7 pg. The method has been applied to analyze the influents and effluents of 5 Chinese STPs. Except for regulated phenolic compounds (phenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol), three un-regulated phenolic compounds, including 2-chlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol were identified in the effluent wastewater. The detected concentrations of un-regulated phenolic compounds could possibly cause environmental effects, indicating that immediate attention is required to prevent complications.

AB In this study, the concentration probability distributions of 82 pharmaceutical compounds detected in the effluents of 179 European wastewater treatment plants were computed and inserted into a multimedia fate model. The comparative ecotoxicological impact of the direct emission of these compounds from wastewater treatment plants on freshwater ecosystems, based on a potentially affected fraction (PAF) of species approach, was assessed to rank compounds based on priority. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, the multimedia fate model accounts for regressions to estimate pH-dependent fate parameters. An uncertainty analysis was performed by means of Monte Carlo analysis, which included the uncertainty of fate and ecotoxicity model input variables, as well as the spatial variability of landscape characteristics on the European continental scale. Several pharmaceutical compounds were identified as being of greatest concern, including 7 analgesics/anti-inflammatories, 3 beta-blockers, 3 psychiatric drugs, and 1 each of 6 other therapeutic classes. The fate and impact modelling relied extensively on estimated data, given that most of these compounds have little or no experimental fate or ecotoxicity data available, as well as a limited reported occurrence in effluents. The contribution of estimated model input variables to the variance of freshwater ecotoxicity impact, aswell as the lack of experimental abiotic degradation data for most compounds, helped in establishing priorities for further testing. Generally, the effluent concentration and the ecotoxicity effect factor were the model input variables with the most significant effect on the uncertainty of output results.

AB A pilot plant for ozonation and UV-disinfection received effluent from a German municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) to test the removal of pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and musk fragrances from municipal wastewater. In the original STP effluent, 5 antibiotics (0.344.63 mug l(-1)), 5 betablockers (0.18-1.7 mug l(-1)), 4 antiphlogistics (0.10-1.3 mug l(-1)), 2 lipid regulator metabolites (0.12-0.13 mug l(-1)), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (2.1 mug l(-1)), 4 ICM (1.1-5.2 mug l(-1)), the natural estrogen estrone (0.015 mug l(-1)) and 2 musk fragrances (0.14.73 mug l(-1)) were detected by LC-electrospray tandem MS and/or GC/MS/MS. ICM, derived from radiological examinations, were present with the highest concentrations (diatrizoate: 5.7 mug l(-1), iopromide: 5.2 mug l(-1)). By applying 10-15 mg l(-1) ozone (contact time: 18 min), all the pharmaceuticals investigated as well as musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) and estrone were no longer detected. However, ICM (diatrizoate, iopamidol, iopromide and iomeprol) were still detected in appreciable concentrations. Even with a 15 mg l(-1) ozone dose, the ionic diatrizoate only exhibited removal efficiencies of not higher than 14%, while the non-ionic ICM were removed to a degree of higher than 80%. Advanced oxidation processes (O-3/UV-low pressure mercury arc, O-3/H2O2), which were non-optimized for wastewater treatment, did not lead significantly to a higher removal efficiency for the ICM than ozone alone.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems is related to sewage effluents. Due to the possible adverse effects on wildlife and humans, degradation and removal of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites during wastewater treatment is an increasingly important task. The present study was part of a proof of concept study at a medium sized country hospital in western Germany that investigated efficiency of advanced treatment processes to remove toxic potencies from sewage. Specifically, the efficiency of treatment processes such as a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and ozonation to remove endocrine disruptive potentials was assessed. Estrogenic effects were characterized by use of two receptormediated in vitro transactivation assays, the Lyticase Yeast Estrogen Screen (LYES) and the Estrogen Receptor mediated Chemical Activated LUciferase gene expression (ER CALUX (R)). In addition, the H295R Steroidogenesis Assay (H295R) was utilized to detect potential disruption of steroidogenesis. Raw sewage contained measurable estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated potency as determined by use of the LYES (28.9 +/- 8.6 ng/L, 0.33x concentration), which was reduced after treatment by MBR (2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/L) and ozone (1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/L). Results were confirmed by use of ER CALUX (R) which measured concentrations of estrogen equivalents (EEQs) of 0.2 +/- 0.11 ng/L (MBR) and 0.01 +/- 0.02 ng/L (ozonation). In contrast, treatment with ozone resulted in greater production of estradiol and aromatase activity at 3x and greater concentrations in H295R cells. It is hypothesized that this is partly due to formation of active oxidized products during ozonation. Substance-specific analyses demonstrated efficient removal of most of the measured compounds by ozonation. A comparison of the ER-mediated responses measured by use of the LYES and ER CALUX (R) with those from the chemical analysis using a mass-balance approach revealed estrone (El) to be the main compound that caused the estrogenic effects. Overall, treatment of sewage by use of MBR successfully reduced estrogenicity of hospital effluents as well as substances that are able to alter sex steroid production. However, after ozonation, effluents should undergo further investigations regarding the formation of endocrine active metabolites. The results obtained as part of this study demonstrated applicability of in vitro assays for monitoring of endocrine-modulating potency of treated sewage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin was identified among the top 10 of high priority pharmaceuticals detected in aquatic environment. Potassium ferrate(VI) is a strong oxidant which possesses very high redox potential and has been widely studied in water disinfection and removing organic and inorganic pollutants. There has been one published work to detail the removal of phosphorus as well as micro-pollutants including ciprofloxacin by ferrate in wastewater treatment. However, developing a simple ciprofloxacin detection method and study of feasibility of its treatment by ferrate was the objective of this work. Solid phase extraction (SPE) and UV/vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm was employed to analyse CIP. A series of jar test experiments was carried out to evaluate the ferrate performance for CIP reduction. Results demonstrated that a SPE coupled with simple UV/vis spectrophotometric method can detect CIP with detection limit of 10 mu g/L for model wastewater samples. Ferrate can remove at least 60% of CIP from model wastewater even at very low ferrate doses (<0.3 mg/L). Besides, with increasing in ferrate dose up to 1 mg/L as Fe, the removal efficiency of CIP was higher than 80%. However, increasing ferrate dose further did not show significant increasing in CIP removal. Initial pH of CIP model wastewater samples has no obvious influence on CIP removal, while final solution pH (adjusted and after dosing ferrate) affected the performance of ferrate treatment significantly. CIP removal efficiency by ferrate decreased significantly if final pH of the waste water solution was greater than CIP's pK(a) (i.e. pH > 8). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are exogenous substances that cause adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, subsequent to the changes in endocrine function. Recent studies have shown that wastewater treatment plant effluents play an important role in the release of EDCs into aquatic environments. Therefore, in this study, influent and effluent samples from three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Istanbul were analysed for the presence of the principal EDCs. These chemicals include steroids and synthetic organic chemicals. Thus, the occurrence and fate of EDCs of great health concern were monitored at three WWTPs in Istanbul. Furthermore, these WWTPs are employing different treatment processes. Therefore, the EDC removal performances of different treatment regimes were also evaluated. Phytosterol was the most abundant EDC in the influent samples. Second group of compounds at high influent levels were alkyl phenols. Pesticide levels of all three WWTP influent samples were low. Pasakoy Advanced WWTP is more effective at eliminating EDCs. Kadikoy Primary WWTP exhibits the lowest EDC elimination efficiencies. To the best of our knowledge, this work comprises the first detailed report on the occurrence and behaviour of both natural and synthetic EDCs in WWTPs of Istanbul and Turkey. The steroid estrogen levels of this study are higher than the previously documented values, except the levels given for Gaobeidian WWTP in Beijing, China. This is attributed to higher population densities of Beijing and Istanbul and as well as to lower individual water consumption rates in the two cities.

AB The transport and fate of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated in the Dan Region Reclamation Project (SHAFDAN), Tel-Aviv, Israel. Soil samples were taken from seven subsections of soil profiles (150 cm) in infiltration basins of a soil aquifer treatment (SAT) system. The transport characteristics were studied from the release dynamics of soil-resident CBZ and, subsequently, from applying a pulse input of wastewater containing CBZ. In addition, a monitoring study was performed to evaluate the fate of CBZ after the SAT. Results of this study indicate adsorption, and consequently retardation, in CBZ transport through the top soil layer (0-5 cm) and to a lesser extent in the second layer (525 cm), but not in deeper soil layers (25-150 cm). The soluble and adsorbed fractions of CBZ obtained from the two upper soil layers comprised 45% of the total CBZ content in the entire soil profile. This behavior correlated to the higher organic matter content observed in the upper soil layers (0-25 cm). It is therefore deduced that when accounting for the full flow path of CBZ through the vadose zone to the groundwater region, the overall transport of CBZ in the SAT system is essentially conservative. The monitoring study revealed that the average concentration of CBZ decreased from 1094 +/- 166 ng L-1 in the recharged wastewater to 560 +/- 175 ng L-1 after the SAT. This reduction is explained by dilution of the recharged wastewater with resident groundwater, which may occur as it flows to active reclamation wells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In highly urbanized areas, surface water and groundwater are particularly vulnerable to sewer exfiltration. In this study, as an alternative to Microbial Source Tracking (MST) methods, we propose a new method combining microbial and chemical fecal indicators (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) analysis both in water and sediment samples and under different meteorological conditions. To illustrate the use of this method, wastewater exfiltration and subsequent infiltration were identified and quantified by a three-year field study in an urban canal. The gradients of concentrations observed suggest that several sources of fecal contamination of varying intensity may be present along the canal, including feces from resident animal populations, contaminated surface run-off along the banks and under bridge crossings, release from contaminated banks, entrainment of contaminated sediments, and most importantly sewage exfiltration. Calculated exfiltration-infiltration volumes varied between 0.6 and 15.7 m(3)/d per kilometer during dry weather, and between 1.1 and 19.5 m(3)/d per kilometer during wet weather. WWMPs were mainly diluted and degraded below detection limits in water. E. coli remains the best exfiltration indicator given a large volume of dilution and a high abundance in the wastewater source. WWMPs are effective for detecting cumulated contamination in sediments from a small volume source and are particularly important because E. coli on its own does not allow source tracking.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) may cause harmful effects in living beings, and advanced treatment is required to improve wastewater treatment plant efficiency. In this context, this study aimed to assess the performance of a hybrid anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor coupled with a membrane distillation system (AnOMBR-MD) for removing PhACs and estrogenic activity from municipal sewage. Human health and environmental risks of produced water were also assessed. The removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon and PPO43- reached 97.2% and 98.0%, respectively. N-NH4+ accumulated in the bioreactor since anaerobic treatment can not remove it. Salinity increase in the bioreactor caused a great change in the microbial community, with Chao 1 and Shannon indexes higher in the sludge after 50 days of operation than in the sludge used as inoculum. Estrogenic activity of municipal sewage spiked with PhACs was >3 times higher than the expected value calculated by the additive model (2 ?g L-1E2-eq.), which indicates that some of the PhACs effects increased in the presence of others. Estrogenicity was not detected in distillate samples, which greatly reduced human health risks to acceptable values. Of the 7 PhACs selected in this study, only betamethasone, fluconazole, and prednisone were detected in the distillate. However, the overall removal of PhACs by the AnOMBR-MD system was higher than 96.4%. The chronic environmental risk considering the estrogenic activity was classified as high because of the detection limit in the yeast estrogen screen (YES), which supports the need for improving bioassay sensibility. The results demonstrated that the use of the YES assay combined with detection and identification of micropollutants allowed an effective assessment of the overall treatment performance.

AB The occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in wastewaters and the inability of the conventional wastewater treatments plants to deal with them have been pointed out several times over the last few years. As a result, remnants of those compounds released into the aquatic environment present a potential risk for public health. Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been proposed as environmentally friendly, low-cost alternative systems with satisfactory results for different types of contaminants. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of a CW system, planted with the halophyte Juncus acutus, to eliminate bisphenol A (BPA) and two antibiotics, namely ciprofloxacin (CIP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under different operating conditions. The behavior of Escherichia coli and enterococcal populations in terms of changes in their resistance profile for the selected antibiotics and the abundance of two resistance genes (qnrA and sul1) were also examined. BPA and CIP were significantly removed by the CW, with an overall removal of 76.2% and 93.9% respectively and with the plants playing a vital role. In contrast, SMX was not significantly eliminated. Moreover, fluctuations in the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria were observed. Treatment processes affected the response of the two selected bacterial indicators, depending on the conditions employed in each case. Furthermore, increased levels of resistance genes were monitored in the system effluent. This study indicates that CWs, as tertiary wastewater treatment systems, may demonstrate high removal rates for some but not all EOCs. This implies that each EOC identified in the feed stream should be tested assiduously by analyzing the final effluents before their reuse or discharge into water bodies.

ID WASTE-WATER; TREATMENT SYSTEMS; COLLECTION; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN
AB Municipal wastewater contains a mixture of brown (feces and toilet paper), yellow (urine), and gray (kitchen, bathroom and wash) waters. Urine contributes approximately 70-80% of the nitrogen (N), 50-70% of the phosphorus (P) load and 60-70% of the pharmaceutical residues in normal domestic sewage. This study evaluated the impact of different levels of source separation of urine on an existing biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. A process model of an existing biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant was used. Increasing the amount of urine diverted from the water reclamation facilities, has little impact on effluent ammonia (NH3-N) concentration, but effluent nitrate (NO3-N) concentration decreases. If nitrification is necessary then no reduction in the sludge age can be realized. However, a point is reached where the remaining influent nitrogen load matches the nitrogen requirements for biomass growth, and no residual nitrogen needs to be nitrified. That allows a significant reduction in sludge age, implying reduced process volume requirements. In situations where nitrification is required, lower effluent nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations were realized due to both the lower influent nitrogen content in the wastewater and a more favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for denitrification. The external carbon requirement for denitrification decreases as the urine separation efficiency increases due to the lower influent nitrogen content in the wastewater and a more favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for denitrification. The effluent phosphorus concentration decreases when the amount of urine sent to water reclamation facilities is decreased due to lower influent phosphorus concentrations. In the case of chemical phosphate removal, urine separation reduces the amount of chemicals required.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a concern due to its potential adverse effect on human health and ecology. In this research study, the occurrence of three selected pharmaceuticals-erythromycin (ERY), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), trimethoprim (TMP), and an antimicrobial/antifungal agent triclosan (TRL) was monitored at two Southern California wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Between April and October of 2017, 77 composite samples were analyzed. Results from the study revealed the presence of all four pharmaceuticals in the influent at both WWTPs. Of the four pharmaceuticals, SMZ had the highest concentration (WWTP1, 1860 ng L-1, and WWTP2, 2146 ng L-1). In WWTP1, the concentrations of ERY, TRL, and TMP ranged from 33 to 278 ng L-1, 146 to 410 ng L-1, and 410 to 1021 ng L-1, respectively, while in WWTP2, their concentrations ranged from 16.7 to 209 ng L-1, 0 to 160 ng L-1, and 407 to 672 ng L-1, respectively. Even though both plants employed secondary biological treatment protocols, their removal efficiencies are remarkably different. WWTP1 is relatively more effective in the removal of ERY, TRL, and TMP with a removal efficiency of 46%, 63%, and 61%, respectively, while at WWTP2 only 4% TMP was removed, and no removal of ERY and TRL was observed. Both plants were unable to remove SMZ. Pharmaceuticals are bioactive compounds, and as such, even at low concentration levels, they may adversely affect the environment and will require additional treatment to ensure that treated wastewater meets the specific water quality criteria for reuse.

AB The occurrence and removal of 19 antibiotics (including four macrolides, eight sulfonamides, three fluoroquinolones, three tetracyclines, and trimethoprim) were investigated in two ecological (constructed wetland (CW) and stabilization pond (SP)) and two conventional wastewater treatment processes (activated sludge (AS) and micro-power biofilm (MP)) in a county of eastern China. All target antibiotics were detected in the influent and effluent samples with detection frequencies of >90%. Clarithromycin, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin-H2O were the dominant antibiotics with maximum concentrations reaching up to 6524, 5411, 964 and 957 ng/L, respectively; while the concentrations of tiamulin, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethizole and sulfisoxazole were below 10 ng/L. Although the mean effluent concentrations of target antibiotics were obviously lower than the influent ones (except ciprofloxacin), their removals were usually incomplete. Principal component analysis showed that the AS and CW outperformed the MP and SP processes and the AS performed better than the CW process in terms of antibiotics removal. Both the AS and CW processes exhibited higher removal efficiencies in summer than in winter, indicating biological degradation could play an important role in antibiotics removal. Because of the incomplete removal, the total concentration of detected antibiotics increased in the mixing and downstream sections of a local river receiving the effluent from a typical wastewater treatment facility practicing AS process. Nowadays, ecological wastewater treatment processes are being rapidly planned and constructed in rural areas of China; however, the discharge of residual antibiotics to the aquatic environment may highlight a necessity for optimizing or upgrading their design and operation.

In this study, the mobility and sorption-desorption behavior of carbamazepine, naproxen and diclofenac were studied in soil layers sampled from a plot irrigated with secondary-treated wastewater (STWW). Carbamazepine and diclofenac were significantly retarded in the 0-5 cm soil sample rich in soil organic matter (SOM): carbamazepine was not affected by the water quality (freshwater versus STWW), whereas diclofenac exhibited a higher retardation factor (RF) in the freshwater system. Naproxen exhibited significantly lower RFs than diclofenac but with a similar trend higher retardation in the freshwater versus STWW system. In the 5-15 cm soil sample containing low SOM, naproxen was highly mobile while carbamazepine and diclofenac were still retarded. In the 1525 cm sample, all compounds exhibited their lowest RFs. Sorption data suggested that SOM governs the studied PCs' interactions with the soil samples. However, higher carbon-normalized sorption coefficients were measured for the PCs in the 15-25 cm sample, suggesting that both quantity and the physicochemical nature of SOM affect sorption interactions. While both naproxen and carbamazepine exhibited reversible sorption isotherms, diclofenac exhibited pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis. This study suggests that carbamazepine and diclofenac can be classified as slow-mobile compounds in SOM-rich soil layers. When these compounds pass this layer and/or introduced into SOM-poor soils, their mobility increases significantly. This emphasizes the potential transport of PCs to groundwater in semiarid zones due to intensive irrigation with reclaimed wastewater in SOM-poor soils. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals after discharged from hospital into wastewater was clarified experimentally by using a new lab-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment reactor. The 43 target compounds belong to nine therapeutic classes (antivirals, antibacterials, anticancer drugs, psychotropics, antihypertensives, analgesic-antipyretics, contrast media, herbal medicines, and phytoestrogens) were selected with inclusion of 16 newly estimated compounds. The efficiency of the present reactor was estimated by comparing the reaction rate constant of the solid-water partition coefficients (log K-d) between liquid and solid samples and half-life during 48-h experiment obtained by using hospital effluents with those obtained by using STP wastewater. The results that no significant difference in removal efficiency was observed between both water samples (P > 0.05) indicate high reliability of the present lab-scale reactor. The actual rates of removal when hospital effluent was applied varied widely (mean, 59 +/- 40%) independent of type of the pharmaceuticals. More than 90% of 17 compounds were removed after 8 h of treatment. However, the values for psychotropics (mean, 19 +/- 26%) and contrast media (mean, 24 +/- 17%) were generally low, indicating high stability. The log K (d) values ranged from 1.3 to 4.8. Notably, clarithromycin, acridine, and glycitein could be removed in both liquid and solid phases. The dominant removal mechanisms were found to be different for individual pharmaceutical. These results suggest the effectiveness of introduction of the lab-scale biological treatment system for development of a new solution for discharge of pharmaceuticals from hospital.

AB A method for simultaneous determination of four benzodiazepines (bromazepam (BMZ), carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP) and nordiazepam (NDZ)) and four barbiturates (barbital (BTL), pentobarbital (PTB), phenobarbital (PNB) and secobarbital (SCB)) in river water and wastewater using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-(electrospray) tandem mass spectrometry (LC-(ESI)MS/MS) was developed. LC-(ESI)MS/MS analysis was performed in positive and negative modes for benzodiazepines and barbiturates, respectively, and in selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.2-5ng/L for benzodiazepines and 2.5-50ng/L for barbiturates. Precision (repeatability and reproducibility between days) expressed as %RSD (n=5) was lower than 17% for low concentration (depending on the matrix between 50 and 250ng/L for barbiturates, and between 5 and 25ng/L for benzodiazepines), and lower than 15% for high concentration (between 200 and 1250ng/L for barbiturates, and between 20 and 125ng/L for benzodiazepines). Low matrix effect was observed for all compounds, except for BTL (75%) and PTB (-48%) in wastewater. The method was applied to water samples from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) and the rivers Ebre, Ter and Llobregat, located in Catalonia. CBZ was the target compound found at the highest concentration in river water (2.1-3.3ng/L). In both influent and effluent wastewater samples, PNB, BMZ, CBZ, DZP and NDZ were determined at concentration levels ranging from 5.0 to 2337.3ng/L.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals classified as emerging contaminants (EC) in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water generates uncertainty concerning the interactions that could be occurred with aquatic organisms and living beings. Thus, the monitoring of hospital wastewater is of great importance to identify the main classes of pharmaceuticals that could be discharged to the municipal sewage system and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This work described the implementation and validation of a highly selective and sensitive analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the detection and quantification of these emerging compounds. The solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was employed using Oasis HLB cartridges. For LC-MS/MS analysis, the chromatographic separation was conducted in a C-18 Kinetex column (Phenomenex), and detection was achieved in an AB SCIEX QTrap 3200 tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The quantitative analysis was performed by using the internal standard (IS) method with isotopically labeled analogs. The implemented method presented good linearity within the concentration range of 0.1-400 mu g L-1 showing correlation coefficients (R-2) ranged from 0.991 to 0.999. The limits of detection (LODs) were from 0.02 to 0.59 mu g L-1, while the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.07 to 1.80 mu g L-1. The analytical method was successfully applied to the analysis of wastewater samples discharged by a public hospital in San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, in two sampling periods: May 2017 and March 2018.

AB The presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the environment is of growing concern and effluents from wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) are one of the major sources. This research combines the outputs of a multimillion pound UK program of work to evaluate the fate of APIs in the wastewater treatment process. A combination of analysis of measured data and modelling has been applied to 18 APIs, representing a wide range of medicinal application and physico-chemical characteristics. Some isomers (for atorvastatin) and metabolites (for sertraline, carbamazepine and erythromycin) were also included. High variability was observed between removal rates for individual APIs between WwTW, which after statistical analysis could not be explained by the nominal WwTW process (e.g. activated sludge or trickling filter). Nor was there a clear relationship between API removal and physicochemical parameters such as pKa, charge or log Kow. A publically available sewage process model. SimpleTreat 4.0 which has been rigorously validated and is now being used for exposure assessment with REACH legislation for organic chemicals and within the Biocidal Products Regulation by the European Medicines Agency for APIs, was used to estimate removal rates with which to compare with measured data. SimpleTreat provided estimates of removal rates within +/- 30%of observed values for the majority of the APIs measured, with the use of readily available WwTW specific parameters such as flow, total suspended solids and BOD data. The data and correlations provided in this study provide support for any future considerations regarding the management of API discharge to the aquatic environment.

AB Microbial degradation rates were measured for 19 pharmaceuticals in estuarine and coastal surface water samples. Antipyrine, carbamazepine, cotinine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim were the most refractory (half-lives, t(1/2) = 35 to > 100 days), making them excellent candidates for wastewater tracers. Nicotine, acetaminophen, and fluoxetine were labile across all treatments (t(1/2) = 0.68-11 days). Caffeine, diltiazem, and nifedipine were also and relatively labile in all but one of the treatments (t(1/2) = 3.5-13 days). Microbial degradation of caffeine was further confirmed by production (CO2)-C-14. The fastest decay of non-refractory compounds was always observed in more sewage-affected Jamaica Bay waters. Degradation rates for the majority of these pharmaceuticals are much slower than reported rates for small biomolecules, such as glucose and amino acids. Batch sorption experiments indicate that removal of these soluble pharmaceuticals from the water column to sediments is a relatively insignificant removal process in these receiving waters.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is a concentration process based on the natural phenomena of osmosis. It is nowadays considered a breakthrough technology that can be potentially used for concentrating suspensions and solutions, including wastes such as sewage. The diluted nature of sewage restricts the treatment technologies that can be applied. Then, sewage concentration by FO could represent a habilitating technology enabling the application of a wider range of treatment alternatives. This research studied sewage and pre-filtered sewage concentration by a FO. Thin-film-composite (TFC) and cellulose triacetate (CTA) FO membranes were considered. Results showed that TFC membranes presented higher fluxes than CTA, when operated with clean water and sewage. Filtration experiments were done using sewage and filtered sewage as feeds. Even though differences in formed fouling layers were identified by scanning electron microscopy, observed fluxes were similar. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was done to study the elemental composition of the fouling layers. Results revealed nitrogen contents in the range 10-13%, suggesting a relevant role of protein. At tested conditions, TFC membrane showed little apparent ammonia rejection due to permeation to the draw solution. Ammonia permeation was independent of applied osmotic potential, and was mainly related with the ammonia concentration difference through the membrane. Results show that concentration of sewage by forward osmosis would be technically feasible, and its application could potentially improve energy recovery from sewage. However, main drawback that needs to overcome is a low water-flux, which translates into high membrane requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressants are a widely prescribed group of pharmaceuticals that can be biotransformed in humans to biologically active metabolites. In the present study, the distribution of six antidepressants (venlafaxine, bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and paroxetine) and five of their metabolites was determined in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and at sites downstream of two WWTPs in the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) caged in the Grand River downstream of a WWTP were also evaluated for accumulated antidepressants. Finally, drinking water was analyzed from a treatment plant that takes its water from the Grand River 17 km downstream of a WWTP. In municipal wastewater, the antidepressant compounds present in the highest concentrations (i.e., > 0.5 mu g/L) were venlafaxine and its two demethylation products, O- and N-desmethyl venlafaxine. Removal rates of the target analytes in a WWTP were approximately 40%. These compounds persisted in river water samples collected at sites up to several kilometers downstream of discharges from WWTPs. Venlafaxine, citalopram, and sertraline, and demethylated metabolites were detected in fathead minnows caged 10 m below the discharge from a WWTP, but concentrations were all <7 mu g/kg wet weight. Venlafaxine and bupropion were detected at very low (<0.005 mu g/L) concentrations in untreated drinking water, but these compounds were not detected in treated drinking water. The present study illustrates that data are needed on the distribution in the aquatic environment of both the parent compound and the biologically active metabolites of pharmaceuticals. Environ.

AB An extensive study on the presence of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals with potential for abuse in sewage waters was made for the first time in the Netherlands. A total number of 24 target drugs were investigated in influent and effluent wastewater using liquid chromatography coupled to a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. This powerful analyzer has allowed not only the detection and identification of the compounds under investigation, but also their quantification at very low levels, which is highly innovative in the field of drugs of abuse. Samples were taken from five sewage treatment plants (STPs) during a whole week. The selected STPs served four cities of different size and an international airport. Daily variances of drug loads were demonstrated and removal efficiencies calculated for each drug and STP individually. Twelve target compounds were found in at least one influent or effluent, and highest concentrations were observed in influents collected from more urbanized areas. The compounds more frequently detected were amphetamine. benzoylecgonine. cocaine and THC-COOH together with the pharmaceuticals codeine, oxazepam and temazepam. Established week trends in consumption of drugs showed distinct differences between individual drugs. A slightly different occurrence pattern was observed in wastewaters from the airport. Thus, methamphetamine was only detected at Schiphol, a fact that was interpreted to be caused by consumption of this drug by travelers. Despite the fact that the Netherlands has frequently been criticized for its liberal drug policy the results from this study did not reveal higher drug consumption than found elsewhere, with the exception of cannabis.

AB The increasing presence of pharmaceutical products (PPs) and other organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic systems has become one of the major global environmental contamination concerns. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are one of the major sources of PPs discharge into natural waters due to the deficiencies of conventional treatment processes to deal with these micropollutants. Numerous new treatment processes and technologies have been investigated for the removals of CECs in wastewaters with more or less success. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of a hybrid bioreactor (HBR) of a combined crosslinked tyrosinase and laccase aggregates and hollow fiber micro filtration (MF) membrane to remove a mixture of 14 PPs from municipal wastewater at environmentally relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L. After a 5 -day continuous operation, the HBR achieved complete removal of all tested PPs. Results also highlight that these high performances result from a synergistic action of the MF membrane and the insoluble enzymes. The biocatalyst retained nearly 70% of its initial enzymatic activity over the treatment period. The removal of PPs is unlikely to result from their sole sorption on the membrane. Overall, the results suggest that the HBR is well suited to the biocatalysts (i.e. insolubilized tyrosinase and laccase). The results invite to further investigate how the HBR can be tailored with various types of enzymes and membranes for either specific or non-specific target substrates and to further explore the applicability of this technology for the continuous treatment of wastewater at environmentally relevant concentration of PPs.

AB This study evaluated the impact of secondary municipal effluent discharge on carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations in small and medium rivers in northern Germany and compared the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) calculated with four well-established models. During a 1-year sampling period, secondary effluent grab samples were collected at four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) together with grab samples from the receiving waters upstream and downstream from the wastewater discharge points. The carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS-MS) after solid phase extraction. In the secondary effluents, 84-790 ng/L carbamazepine, 395-2100 ng/L diclofenac, and 745-5000 ng/L metoprolol were detected. The carbamazepine, diclofenac, and metoprolol concentrations analyzed in the rivers downstream from the secondary effluent discharge sites ranged from <5 to 68, 370, and 520 ng/L, respectively. Most of the downstream pharmaceutical concentrations were markedly higher than the corresponding upstream concentrations. The impact of wastewater discharge on the MECs in rivers downstream from the WWTPs was clearly demonstrated, but the correlations of the MECs with dilution factors were poor. The smallest rivers exhibited the largest maximum MECs and the widest ranges of MECs downstream from the wastewater discharge point. Three of the four tested models were conservative, as they showed higher PECs than the MECs in the rivers downstream from the WWTPs. However, the most detailed model underestimated the diclofenac concentrations.

AB Sewage sludge- and waste oil sludge-derived materials were tested as adsorbents of pharmaceuticals from diluted water solutions. Simultaneous retention of eleven antibiotics plus two anticonvulsants was examined via batch adsorption experiments. Virgin and exhausted adsorbents were examined via thermal and FTIR analyses to elucidate adsorption mechanisms. Maximum adsorption capacities for the 6 materials tested ranged from 80 to 300 mg/g, comparable to the adsorption capacities of antibiotics on various activated carbons (200-400 mg/g) reported in the literature. The performance was linked to surface reactivity, polarity and porosity. A large volume of pores similar in size to the adsorbate molecules with hydrophobic carbon-based origin of pore walls was indicated as an important factor promoting the separation process. Moreover, the polar surface of an inorganic phase in the adsorbents attracted the functional groups of target molecules. The presence of reactive alkali metals promoted reaction with acidic groups, formation of salts and their precipitation in the pore system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effects of municipal biosolids on microbial N-2-fixation in agricultural soil were assessed in a 3-month laboratory study which included analysis of metals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. Reference agricultural soil was amended with organic manure or municipal biosolids from a southern Ontario wastewater plant, with a biosolids-only treatment included to evaluate metabolic activity in this inoculum. Microbial N-2-fixation in reference and manure-amended soils were similar (p = 0.144) over 3 months and lower than in biosolids-amended soil (p = 0.001); however, differences among soil treatments decreased over time, with no significant difference at test termination. In general, one-time application of biosolids caused short-term stimulation of N-2-fixing activity with a return to reference conditions within 3 months. Although no residual effects were detected, biosolids introduced elevated levels of metals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products (particularly analgesics), and viable bacteria; long-term effects caused by repeat applications (as commonly practiced) requires further investigation.

AB In this paper, the occurrence and elimination of eight selected antibiotics mainly for human use, including chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, sulfonamide and macrolide groups, were investigated at four sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. The most frequently detected antibiotics in the present study were ofloxacin, norfloxacin, roxithromycin, erythromycin- H2O (the main degradation product of erythromycin) and sulfamethoxazole. The concentrations of these compounds in raw influents and final effluents at the four STPs ranged from 10 to 1978 ng L-1 and from 9 to 2054 ng L-1, respectively. The other analytes were detected only in a few samples from the four STPs. Antibiotics could not be eliminated completely at the four STPs, with the highest elimination efficiency reaching to 81%. Analysis of the dissolved daily mass flow showed that fluoroquinolones were mostly eliminated from the sewage, and high concentrations of these compounds were found in secondary sludge. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observed elimination of fluoroquinolones in the STPs was due to their sorption to the sludge, but not biodegradation. Macrolides, especially erythromycin-H2O, were stable in sewage during the treatment process, and in fact even higher concentrations were found in the final effluents than in the raw sewages. Sulfamethoxazole was also found in raw influent and final effluent, indicating that it could withstand different treatment processes in the STPs. Remarkable differences in the daily environmental loads (the sum of the amounts in the final effluent and sludge) of the five most frequently detected antibiotic compounds were found in the range of 0.5-828 g at the four STPs.

AB Concentrations of the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine (Cbz), oxcarbazepine (OxCz) and their main metabolites were predicted in a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) and in the vicinity of its submarine outfall located in a Mediterranean coastal zone. Refined predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated in effluents based on consumption data and human excretion rates. PECs were estimated in the sea using the hydrodynamic MARS 3D model integrating meteorological data, oceanic conditions (wind, tide, atmospheric pressure), freshwater and sewage inputs. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were compared to PECs to assess the estimation relevance. In the coastal zone, PEC and MEC were in the same magnitude range. Modeling of Cbz diffusion and advection just above the submarine outfall showed the influence of the thermocline during summer, with low diffusion of Cbz from the bottom to the surface. This work allowed understanding the dispersion of target compounds and deserved further development for a better acknowledgement of vulnerability at local scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contamination of surface water by antibacterial pharmaceuticals (antibacterials) from clinical settings may affect aquatic organisms, plants growth, and environmental floral bacteria. One of the methods to decrease the contamination is inactivation of antibacterials before being discharged to the sewage system. Recently, we reported the novel method based on electrolysis for detoxifying wastewater containing antineoplastics. In the present study, to clarify whether the electrolysis method is applicable to the inactivation of antibacterials, we electrolyzed solutions of 10 groups of individual antibacterials including amikacin sulfate (AMK) and a mixture (MIX) of some commercial antibacterials commonly prescribed at hospitals, and measured their antibacterial activities. AMK was inactivated in its antibacterial activities and its concentration decreased by electrolysis in a time-dependent manner. Eighty to ninety-nine percent of almost all antibacterials and MIX were inactivated within 6 h of electrolysis. Additionally, cytotoxicity was not detected in any of the electrolyzed solutions of antibacterials and MIX by the Molt-4-based cytotoxicity test. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Illicit drugs and their metabolites represent a new class of emerging contaminants. These substances are continuously discharged into wastewater which have been detected in the aquatic environment in concentrations ranging from ng.L(-)7(1) to mu g.L-1. Our study detected the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) in a subtropical coastal zone (Santos Bay, SP, Brazil) within one year. Water samples (surface and bottom) were collected from the Santos Submarine Sewage Outfall (SSOS) area. COC and BE were measured in the samples using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Concentrations ranged from 12.18 to 203.6 ng.L-1 (COC) and 8.20 to 38.59 ng.L-1 (BE). Higher concentrations of COC were observed during the end of spring, following the population increase at summer season. COC and its metabolite occurrence in this coastal zone represent a threat to coastal organisms.

AB Concentrations and percent loadings of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and other emerging contaminants released from healthcare facilities (2 hospitals and a long-term care facility) to a sewage treatment plant (STP) in a large urban sewershed were evaluated. An additional hospital outside the sewershed was also monitored. Fourteen of the 24 steroids/hormones and 88 of the 117 PhACs and emerging contaminants were detected at least once. Commonly used substances, including cotinine, caffeine and its metabolite 1,7-dimethylxanthine, ibuprofen and naproxen (analgesics), venlafaxine (antidepressant), and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (insect repellant), were detected in all samples at all sites. Concentrations detected in the large specialty hospital outside the sewershed were similar to those within the sewershed. Cytotoxic drugs (tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide) and x-ray contrast media (iopamidol and diatrizoic acid) were infrequently detected in hospital effluents. Analysis for antibiotics indicated that azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole were consistently detected in hospital wastewaters, as was triclosan (antibacterial agent). Fifteen compounds individually contributed greater than 1% to the total PhAC and emerging contaminant load to the STP from the 2 hospitals in the sewershed, and 9 compounds in the STP effluent exceeded ecotoxicological criteria. The present survey demonstrates that point source discharges from healthcare facilities in this sewershed make a small contribution to the overall PhAC and emerging contaminant loading compared with the total concentrations entering the receiving STP.

AB Anticancer drugs used in cancer treatment are excreted unchanged or as metabolites by feces and urine in hospitals and households. These drugs enter the municipal sewage system but wastewater treatment plants are not capable of removing all of these micro pollutants. In many countries such as Brazil, sanitation departments do not provide service, nor have access to all of the population, therefore most sewage is still released into untreated receiving bodies. This study analyzes the consumption of anticancer drugs in a Brazilian hospital located in one of the 10 municipalities with the best sanitation index in the country. It estimates its environmental risk in aquatic matrixes by the European Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use. Among the 20 drugs analyzed, the three most consumed (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluoruracil, and cytarabine) show a predicted environmental concentration value greater than the action limit of 0.01 mu g/L recommended by the guideline. The risk assessment was performed on all pharmaceuticals consumed to get a greater awareness of risk. Results do not indicate local environmental risk but, considering that the study was performed under the best sanitation scenario, it cannot be extrapolated in the other municipalities. The study highlights that development of suitable methodologies should be considered to perform environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in developing countries sanitation conditions.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are inefficient in the removal of many organic pollutants. The presence of these contaminants in the final sludge represents a source of environmental pollution due to the increasing use of biosolids in land application. A biotechnological approach which employed the fungus Trametes versicolor in a sludge-bioslurry reactor was assessed in order to remove several groups of emerging pollutants. Biological fungal activity was monitored by means of ergosterol and laccase determinations. Fifteen out of 24 detected pharmaceuticals were removed at efficiencies over 50% after the treatment, including eight completely degraded. Removal ranged between 16-53% and 22-100% for the brominated flame retardants and the UV-filters, respectively. Only two of all the detected compounds remained unchanged after the treatment. Although elimination results are promising, the toxicity of the final sludge increased after the treatment. This finding is contrary to the toxicity results obtained in similar treatments of sludge with T. versicolor in solid-phase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage treatment plant (STP) is the major point source of antibiotic contamination, yet the advanced treatment of antibiotic polluted STP effluent has not been given necessary attention. This study is conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency, kinetic, and behavior of sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides antibiotics from STP effluent in a hybrid constructed wetland (HCW) and a layered biological filter (LBF) at different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). The results showed that the removal efficiency of antibiotics in all the HLRs was ranked as follow: quinolones of HCW (70-95%) > macrolides of HCW (58-77%) > tetracyclines of both systems (59-67%) > quinolones of LBF (28-64%) > macrolides of LBF (13-25%) > sulfonamides of both systems (<0%). The optimal HLR is 1.0 m/day for quinolones and 2.0 m/day for tetracyclines-macrolides in the HCW, and 6.4 m/day for quinolones-tetracyclines in the LBF, respectively. Although HCW performed better on the removal of most antibiotics, LBF exhibited stronger total loading toleration and higher removal loading ability to antibiotics. Among them, quinolones were markedly removed by multiple effect of substrate adsorption, microbial anaerobic degradation, and photolysis in the HCW (planted), and by filter sorption and interception in the LBF (unplanted); adsorption is the dominant elimination approach for tetracyclines in both systems; plant uptake plays a significant role on the removal of macrolides in the HCW.

AB The occurrence of triclosan (TCS), a general purpose antibacterial agent contained in numerous consumer and personal-care products, in the aquatic environment is well known. To a lesser degree, the formation of chlorinated and brominated derivatives of TCS during the chlorination of the antibacterial has also been reported. Presumably due to the lack of authentic standards, very few reports have been published on the levels of these halogenated TCSs in the environment. For this purpose, we have synthesized six selected halogenated derivatives of TCS, namely, 3-Cl-, 5-Cl-, 3,5-Cl-2-, 3-Br-, 5-Br-, and 3,5-Br-2- TCSs, with supporting H-1-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) data for their structural assignments. Using these model compounds together with sensitive analytical methods, we were able to identify and quantify the above compounds together with their precursor compound TCS in Canadian municipal wastewater and biosolid samples for the first time. While detected in all influent (range from 1.4 to 24.1 ng L-1) and biosolid (range from 7.7 to 274 ng g(-1)) samples, the concentrations of these chlorinated TCS were generally from 100- to 1,000-fold lower than TCS in the same sample. Even lower levels (< 20 ng/g in 85 % of the results) of brominated TCS were found in biosolids, and they were mostly undetected in sewage.

AB Nowadays, there is an increasing concern over the presence of contaminants in the aquatic environment, where they can be introduced from wastewater after their incomplete removal in the treatment plants. In this work, degradation of selected emerging pollutants in the aqueous and solid phases of sewage sludge has been investigated after anaerobic digestion using two different digesters: mesophilic and thermophilic. Initially, sludge samples were screened by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) for identification of emerging contaminants in the samples. In a second step, a target quantitative method based on LC coupled to tandem MS was applied for selected pollutants identified in the previous screening. The behaviour of the compounds under anaerobic conditions was studied estimating the degradation efficiency and distribution of compounds between both sludge phases. Irbesartan and benzoylecgonine seemed to be notably degraded in both phases of the sludge. Venlafaxine showed a significant concentration decrease in the aqueous phase in parallel to an increase in the solid phase. The majority of the compounds showed an increase of their concentrations in both phases after the digestion. Concentrations in the solid phase were commonly higher than in the aqueous for most contaminants, indicating that they were preferentially adsorbed onto the solid particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the Duliujian River, 12 water environmental parameters corresponding to 45 sampling sites were analyzed over four seasons. With a statistics test (Spearman correlation coefficient) and multivariate statistical methods, including cluster analysis (CA) and principal components analysis (PCA), the river water quality temporal and spatial patterns were analyzed to evaluate the pollution status and identify the potential pollution sources along the river. CA and PCA results on spatial scale revealed that the upstream was slightly polluted by domestic sewage, while the upper-middle reach was highly polluted due to the sewage from feed mills, furniture and pharmaceutical factories. The middle-lower reach, moderately polluted by sewage from textile, pharmaceutical, petroleum and oil refinery factories as well as fisheries and livestock activities, demonstrated the water purification role of wetland reserves. Seawater intrusion caused serious water pollution in the estuary. Through temporal CA, the four seasons were grouped into three clusters consistent with the hydrological mean, high and low flow periods. The temporal PCA results suggested that nutrient control was the primary task in mean flow period and the monitoring of effluents from feed mills, petrochemical and pharmaceutical factories is more important in the high flow period, while the wastewater from domestic and livestock should be monitored carefully in low flow periods. The results may provide some guidance or inspiration for environmental management.

AB The removal efficiencies (REs) of twenty-seven pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (eight analgesic/anti-inflammatories, six antibiotics, four beta-blockers, two antihypertensives/diuretics, three lipid regulators and four psychiatric drugs) were evaluated in a pilot-scale two-stage mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) system treating thickened sewage sludge from a pilot-scale A(2)O (TM) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) which was fed with wastewater from the pre-treatment of the full-scale WWTP Murcia Este (Murcia, Spain). The MAD system was long-term operated using two different sets of sludge retention times (SRTs) for the acidogenic (AcD) and methanogenic (MD) digesters (phase I, 2 and 12 days; and phase II, 5 and 24 days, in AcD and MD, respectively). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were used to estimate the absolute abundance of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi and investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of their communities in the AcD and MD effluents. The extension of the SRT from 12 (phase I) to 24 days (phase II) in the MD was significantly linked with an improved removal of carbamazepine, clarithromycin, codeine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, lorazepam, and propranolol. The absolute abundances of total Bacteria and Archaea were higher in the MD regardless of the phase, while the diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities was lower in phase II, in both digesters. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots showed strong negative correlations among phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and between genera Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina throughout the full experimental period. Strong positive correlations were revealed between the relative abundances of Methanospirillum and Methanoculleus and the methanogenesis performance parameters (volatile solids removal, CH4 recovery rate and %CH4 in the biogas), which were also related to longer SRT. The REs of several PhACs (naproxen, ketoprofen, ofloxacin, fenofibrate, trimethoprim, and atenolol) correlated positively (r > 0.75) with the relative abundances of specific bacterial and archaeal groups, suggesting their participation in biodegradation/biotransformation pathways.

We used novel in situ mesocosms to conduct replicated experiments to study how the addition of low-level concentrations of sewage effluent (nominally 2.5 ppm) affects river biofilms in two contrasting Chalk river systems, the Rivers Kennet and Lambourn (high/low sewage impact, respectively). 16S sequencing and qPCR showed that community composition was not significantly changed by the sewage effluent addition, but class 1 integron prevalence (Lambourn control 0.07% (SE +/- 0.01), Lambourn sewage effluent 0.11% (SE +/- 0.006), Kennet control 0.56% (SE +/- 0.01), Kennet sewage effluent 1.28% (SE +/- 0.16)) was significantly greater in the communities exposed to sewage effluent than in the control flumes (ANOVA, F = 5.11, p = 0.045) in both rivers. Furthermore, the difference in integron prevalence between the Kennet control (no sewage effluent addition) and Kennet sewage-treated samples was proportionally greater than the difference in prevalence between the Lambourn control and sewage-treated samples (ANOVA (interaction between treatment and river), F = 6.42, p = 0.028). Mechanisms that lead to such differences could include macronutrient/biofilm or phage/bacteria interactions. Our findings highlight the role that low-level exposure to complex polluting mixtures such as sewage effluent can play in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The results also highlight that certain conditions, such as macronutrient load, might accelerate spread of antibiotic resistance genes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The validation of a sensitive and reliable analytical procedure for the determination of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in solid environmental samples is reported in this study. Initially, two types of derivatization were used for the identification of the 13 target PPCP standards (acylation and silylation), but silylation proved to be better in sensitivity as it detected all of the analytes under investigation. Samples were extracted using an ultrasonicator, concentrated and re-dissolved in 100 mL water, then cleaned-up using C18 cartridges before silylation that preceded the Gas chromatography-mass Spectrometry detector (GC-MS) analyses. The optimized method provided a linear response over the range of 10-400 ng center dot g(-1)with r(2)> 0.992 and satisfactory recoveries (>45.6%) for the 13 compounds of interest. In this study, the variation of the sonication temperature, type of organic solvent for extraction, and types of cartridge were used to optimize the extraction procedure. A good repeatability (within day) and reproducibility (between days) with a relative standard deviation (RSD) that was equal or less than 13% for all the PPCPs were achieved with the developed extraction procedures for the irrigated soil and sewage sludge samples. The limits of detection (LODs) of the tested compounds varied from 0.1 ng center dot g(-1)(aspirin) to 1.4 ng center dot g(-1)(doxycycline) and from 0.1 ng center dot g(-1)(codiene) to 1.7 ng center dot g(-1)(doxycycline) for soils and sewage sludge samples, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the sludge of wastewater treatment plants and soils of an irrigated golf course. Among the tested emerging pollutants, paracetamol showed the highest concentration value of 98.9 ng center dot g(-1)in the sludge, and for the irrigated soil (0 to 10 cm), the concentration ranged from 1.16 ng center dot g(-1)(aspirin) to 8.57 ng center dot g(-1)(ibuprofen).

AB Several studies on waste-or drinking water treatment processes as well as on groundwater have recently shown that some pharmaceutical residues (PRs) are redox-sensitive. Hence, their (bio) degradation depends on the redox conditions prevalent in the aquifer. Groundwater, providing raw water for drinking water production, is often anoxic and aeration is a widespread treatment method applied mainly to eliminate unwanted iron and manganese from the water. As a side-effect, aeration may trigger the elimination of PRs. Within the present study the influence of aeration on the fate of a number of wastewater derived analgesics and their residues as well as several antimicrobial compounds was investigated. For this purpose, anoxic groundwater was transferred into stainless steel tanks, some of which were aerated while others were continuously kept anoxic. Results prove that the degradation of six phenazone type compounds is dependent on oxygen availability and compounds are efficiently removed under oxic conditions only. Concerning the antimicrobials, doxycycline and trimethoprim were better removed during aeration, whereas a slightly improved removal under anoxic conditions was observed for clindamycin, roxithromycin and clarithromycin. The study provides first laboratory proof of the redox-sensitivity of several organic trace pollutants. In addition, results demonstrate that aeration is an effective treatment for the elimination of a number of wastewater derived PRs.

AB Triclosan (TCS); a widely used antimicrobial biocide, exists in several pharmaceutical and personal care products. Due to its wide usage, TCS is detected in wastewater at varying concentrations. Biological treatability of TCS and its effect on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency were investigated running laboratory-scale pulse-fed sequencing batch reactors with acclimated and non-acclimated cultures. The culture was acclimatized to TCS by gradually increasing its concentration in the synthetic feed wastewater from 100 ng/L to 100 mg/L. There were no effects of TCS on COD removal efficiency up to the TCS concentration of 500 ng/L for both acclimatized and non-acclimatized cases. However, starting from a concentration of 1 mg/L, TCS affected the COD removal efficiency adversely. This effect was more pronounced with non-acclimatized culture. The decrease in the COD removal efficiency reached to 47% and 42% at the TCS concentration of 100 mg/L, under acclimation and non-acclimation conditions respectively. Adsorption of TCS into biomass was evidenced at higher TCS concentrations especially with non-acclimated cultures. 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloroanisole were identified as biodegradation by-products. The occurrence and distribution of these metabolites in the effluent and sludge matrices were found to be highly variable depending, especially, on the culture acclimation conditions.

AB Among the release solutions for reducing the discharge of organic and persistent contaminants in the aquatic environment, the use of a tertiary treatment in addition to existing conventional wastewater treatment processes is considered. The use of micro-grain activated carbon in a fluidized bed is a promising technique investigated in this study. The effluents from a large-scale pilot system were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (QToF). Several strategies were deployed, namely molecular fingerprint comparison, suspected and non-target analyses, identification of refractory compounds to treatment, and finally, quantification of identified compounds. The evaluation of the molecular fingerprints provided evidence of the overall effect of the tertiary treatment on the treated wastewater quality. The suspected approach highlighted the presence of 83 pharmaceuticals and pesticides as well as transformation products in the effluents. The non-target approaches also highlighted compounds refractory to tertiary treatment, such as illicit drugs or some pharmaceuticals. The identification and quantification of identified compounds underscored the suitability of micro-grain activated carbon in eliminating many classes of pharmaceuticals with various physicochemical properties, such as anti-hypertensive, analgesic, anti-viral, antidepressant and even various pesticides.

AB The removal efficiency (RE) of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a major determinant of the environmental impact of these contaminants. However, RE data are available for only a few chemicals due to the time and cost required for conventional target analysis. In the present study, we applied non-target screening analysis to evaluate the RE of polar contaminants, by analyzing influent and effluent samples from a Swedish WWTP with direct injection UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS. Matrix effects were evaluated by spiking the samples with isotope-labeled standards of 40 polar contaminants. For 85% of the compounds, the matrix effects in the influent and effluent were not significantly different. Approximately 10000 compounds were detected in the wastewater, of which 319 were identified by using the online database mzCloud. Level 1 identification confidence was achieved for 31 compounds for which we had reference standards, and level 2 was achieved for the remainder. RE was calculated from the ratio of the peak areas in the influent and the effluent from the non-target analysis. Good agreement was found with RE determined from the target analysis of the target compounds. The method generated reliable estimates of RE for large numbers of contaminants with comparatively low effort and is foreseen to be particularly useful in applications where information on a large number of chemicals is needed.

AB Attenuation of pharmaceuticals due to natural sunlight is expected to be an important removal pathway in wastewater treatment plants using treatment lagoon systems. In this work, the photolysis of two antidepressants, amisulpride and desipramine, has been investigated in both ultrapure water and wastewater under simulated solar irradiation. Results showed that for amisulpride short irradiation times (t(1/2) approximately 3 h in pure water and 4 h in wastewater) were adequate to degrade the parent compound while a longer exposure period was required for desipramine (t(1/2) of approximately 36 h in pure water), although its degradation is enhanced almost three times by indirect photolysis in wastewaters. A significant number of transformation products (TPs) were identified for both pharmaceuticals by high-resolution mass spectrometry. In general, TPs formed are not persistent although acute toxicity tests for desipramine and its TPs showed an increase of the mixture toxicity after solar irradiation, suggesting that some TPs may be more toxic than the parent compound. In wastewaters collected from treatment lagoons, only amisulpride and one of its major TPs, TP 357, were detected. This indicates that long solar exposure times may be necessary for an effective elimination of these substances in lagoon systems or that photolysis may not be the main removal pathway for these particular compounds.

AB Carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic pharmaceutical agent commonly found in wastewater, is highly recalcitrant to standard wastewater treatment practices. This study investigated the mixture toxicity of carbamazepine transformation products formed during ultraviolet (UV) photolysis using three standard ecotoxicity assays (representing bacteria, algae and crustaceans). UV-treatment of 6 mg L-1 carbamazepine solution was carried out over a 120 min period and samples were removed periodically over the course of the experiment. Quantification results confirmed the degradation of carbamazepine throughout the treatment period, together with concurrent increases in acridine and acridone concentrations. Ecotoxicity was shown to increase in parallel with carbamazepine degradation indicating that the mixture of degradation products formed was more toxic than the parent compound, and all three ecotoxicity endpoints were still inhibited >60% relative to control populations upon dosing with 90+min UV-treated carbamazepine solution. Single compound toxicity testing also confirmed the higher toxicity of measured degradation products relative to the parent compound. These results show that transformation products considerably more toxic than carbamazepine itself may be produced during UV-treatment of wastewater effluents and/or photo-induced degradation of carbamazepine in natural waters. This study highlights the need to consider mixture toxicity and the formation and persistence of toxicologically relevant transformation products when assessing the environmental risks posed by pharmaceutical compounds.

AB The significant rise in contamination of wastewater, water and ground water or sediments with PPCPs is a clear evidence that nowadays applied treatment methods are inefficient in removal of these contaminants. In this study a novel cotton based adsorbent is used for efficient sorption of napmxen (NAP), caffeine (CAF) and triclosan (TCS). The adsorption of tested contaminants differed significantly: the highest amount of PPCPs sorbed was noted for TCS sorption onto CMT9 137 mg g(-1), whereas the lowest adsorbed amount, 19.73 mg g(-1), was observed for NAP sorption onto CMT13. The presence of co-solute affected both the mechanism of sorption and the amount of PPCPs sorbed: in the presence of TCS the sorption of NAP was changed from chemical to physical. Similarly, in the presence of TCS the mechanism of NAP sorption onto CMT13 changed from chemisorption to diffusion inside the pores. The presence of CAF definitely increased NAP sorption and partitioning. The presence of TCS increased CAF sorption, whereas the presence of NAP in the solution increased CAF sorption only onto CMT11. The NAP sorption in the presence of CAF was significantly enhanced and data confirmed that diffusion through the pores is the most often observed mechanism of selected PPCPs sorption onto CMTs. It is believed that the synthesized cotton-based adsorbents offer a unique opportunity for the sustainable PPCP removal from wastewater.

AB Minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, commonly used veterinary pharmaceuticals, were searched in four urban, two livestock and two slaughterhouse effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the north of Portugal. A simple method that includes solid-phase extraction followed with analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector was established and applied to the simultaneous determination of the five pharmaceuticals in WWTP effluents. This method, which is expeditious, inexpensive and available in most laboratories, showed to be useful for screening for problematic levels of drugs in WWTP effluents. It is known that several livestock and slaughterhouse effluents (pre-treated or treated) are discharged to the urban network before discharge into the environment. The presence of these drugs in such effluents can constitute a significant environmental problem that should be addressed, by the monitoring of these drugs and by implementation of methodologies that contribute to their decrease/elimination from wastewaters. Minocycline (<= 6 mu g L-1), oxytetracycline (<= 7 mu g L-1), tetracycline (<= 6 mu g L-1) and enrofloxacin (<2 mu g L-1) could be detected and/or quantified in three urban effluents. Detectable levels of enrofloxacin (<2 mu g L-1) and quantifiable levels of tetracycline (<= 15 mu g L-1) were found in the slaughterhouse effluents.

AB The presence of human pharmaceuticals in sewage-impacted ecosystems is a growing concern that poses health risks to aquatic wildlife. Despite this, few studies have investigated the uptake of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in aquatic organisms. In this study, the uptake of 9 APIs from human drugs was examined and compared in neonate bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) residing in pristine (Myakka River) and wastewater-impacted (Caloosahatchee River) tributaries of Florida's Charlotte Harbor estuary. The synthetic estrogen used in human contraceptives (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and 6 of the selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine) used in human antidepressants were observed at detectable and, in some cases, quantifiable levels in plasma of Caloosahatchee River sharks. Comparatively, only venlafaxine was detected in the plasma of a single Myakka River shark at a level below the limit of quantitation. These results suggest that sharks residing in wastewater-impacted habitats accumulate APIs, a factor that may pose special risks to C leucas since it is one of few shark species to regularly occupy freshwater systems. Further research is needed to determine if the low levels of API uptake observed in Caloosahatchee River bull sharks pose health risks to these animals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Discharge of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may contribute to deleterious effects on aquatic life. Release to the environment occurs both through WWTP effluent discharge and runoff following land applications of biosolids. This study introduces Enhanced Biological TOrC Removal (EBTCR), which involves continuous bioaugmentation of TOrC-degrading bacteria for improved removal in WWTPs. Influence of bioaugmentation on enhanced degradation was investigated in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), using bisphenol A (BPA) as the TOrC. The reactors were operated with 8 cycles per day and at two solids retention times (SRTs). Once each day, the test reactor was bioaugmented with Sphingobium sp. BiD32, a documented l3PA-degrading culture. After bioaugmentation, BPA degradation (including both the dissolved and sorbed fractions) was 2-4 times higher in the test reactor than in a control reactor. Improved removal persisted for >5 cycles following bioaugmentation. By the last cycle of the day, enhanced BPA removal was lost, although it returned with the next bioaugmentation. A net loss of Sphingobium sp. BiD32 was observed in the reactors, supporting the original hypothesis that continuous bioaugmentation (rather than single-dose bioaugmentation) would be required to improve TOrCs removal-during wastewater treatment. This study represents a first demonstration of a biologically based approach for enhanced TOrCs removal that both reduces concentrations in wastewater effluent and prevents transfer to biosolids.

AB We lack a clear understanding of how wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) process parameters, such as redox environment, impact pharmaceutical fate. WWTPs increasingly install more advanced aeration control systems to save energy and achieve better nutrient removal performance. The impact of redox condition, and specifically the use of microaerobic (low dissolved oxygen) treatment, is poorly understood. In this study, the fate of a mixture of pharmaceuticals and several of their transformation products present in the primary effluent of a local WWTP was assessed in sequencing batch reactors operated under different redox conditions: fully aerobic, anoxic/aerobic, and microaerobic (DO concentration, approximate to 0.3 mg/L). Among the pharmaceuticals that were tracked during this study (atenolol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and phenytoin), overall loss varied between them and between redox environments. Losses of atenolol and trimethoprim were highest in the aerobic reactor; sulfamethoxazole loss was highest in the microaerobic reactors; and phenytoin was recalcitrant in all reactors. Transformation products of sulfamethoxazole and desvenlafaxine resulted in the reformation of their parent compounds during treatment. The results suggest that transformation products must be accounted for when assessing removal efficiencies and that redox environment influences the degree of pharmaceutical loss.

AB The occurrence and seasonal variation of 50 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Xiamen, China was investigated over a period of one year. Among the targets, 39 PPCPs were detected in the influent. The highest concentration was observed for acetaminophen, with the average concentration in the influent of 2963.5 ng/L. The seasonal variation of PPCPs in the influent was observed. For most pharmaceuticals, highest concentrations were in March 2013, followed by December 2012, while the concentrations were lower in August 2012 and May 2013. Among the detected PPCPs, 14 targets could be removed more than 50% in the WWTP. The activated sludge treatment process contributed to most of PPCP removal, while the adsorption to the particles in the primary treatment and the transformation under UV radiation in the disinfection treatment also contributed to the PPCP removal. Among the detected PPCPs in the influent, 36 PPCPs could be detected in the final effluent of the WWTP. Significantly higher concentrations of PPCPs were observed in effluent samples collected in March 2013 compared to other seasons, suggesting higher concentrations of PPCPs could be discharged into the surrounding seawater during this period.

AB The use of illicit drugs causes unquestionable societal and economic damage. To implement actions aimed at combating drug abuse, it is necessary to assess illicit drug consumption patterns. The purpose of this paper was to develop, optimize, validate and apply a procedure for determining new psychoactive substances (NPSs) and classic drugs of abuse and their main metabolites in wastewater samples by using solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Moreover, detailed validation of the procedure was conducted. The developed SPE-HPLC-MS/MS procedure (within the sewage-based epidemiology strategy) allowed for the simultaneous, selective, very sensitive, accurate (recoveries >= 80.1%) and precise (CV <= 8.1%) determination of new and classic psychoactive substances in wastewater samples. This study is characterized by new scientific elements, especially in terms of the freeze-thaw and post-preparative stability of the selected psychoactive substances. This is the first time that NPSs (mephedrone and ketamine), the main metabolites of heroin (6-acetylmorphine, 6-AM) and marijuana (11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC-COOH) have been detected and monitored in Poland. This study is also the first to corroborate the data available from the EMCDDA and EUROPOL report and indicates that the retail market for cocaine is expanding in Eastern Europe.

AB Due to the regulation on bisphenol A (BPA) in several industrialized countries, the demand for other bisphenol analogues (Bps) as substitutes for BPA is growing. Eight BPs were determined in sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. Total concentrations of BPs (Sigma BP) in sludge ranged from <LOQ to 25700 ng g(-1). The highest concentrations of Sigma BP were found in sludge collected from WWTPs that received discharges from the paper and textile industries. The profiles of BPs were dependent on the proportions of industrial wastewater treated at each of the WWTPs. The sludge from industrial WWTPs contained elevated proportions of BPA, whereas sludge from domestic WWTPs was dominated by bisphenol F (BPF), suggesting use of BPF in certain industrial products in Korea. No significant correlations were found between BPs and the WWTP characteristics. The average per-capita emissions of BPs ranged from 0.04 (BPP) to 886 g capita(-1) d (BPA) through WWTP discharges. The emission fluxes of Sigma BP through industrial WWTPs were 2-3 orders of magnitudes higher than those calculated for domestic WWTPs, indicating that industrial discharges are the major source of BPs into the Korean environment. This is the first nationwide survey of BPs in sludge from Korean WWTPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonamides (SAs) were frequently detected in various environmentalwater bodies because of their incomplete removal duringwastewater treatment process, and this may lead to a negative effect on aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated six SAs and three of their acetylated metabolites in the influents, effluents, and the receiving river waters from four typical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, China. The results indicated that sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine and sulfamethoxazole had the highest detection frequency. Moreover, sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole had its maximum concentrations (216 ng/L and 200 ng/L, respectively) in the influent during dry season. To evaluate the compound degradability, the removal efficiency of each individual sulfonamide was calculated, and a modified method to assess it was recommended considering the widespread inter-conversion between SAs and their metabolites. Finally, regarding the effluent and river water, potential environmental risk based on the Hazard quotients (HQs) was estimated towards three diverse non-targeted organisms. Sulfamethoxazole was assessed with the highest HQ (>3.6), being the sole sulfonamide that would pose a risk to algae in the effluents and river waters. Thus, SAs emission needs to be further reduced fromWWTPs into the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of five endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), bisphenol A (BPA) and norethindrone (NET) was investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and receiving river (Suzhou River and Yangtze River) of Shanghai. Selected EDCs in WWTPs influents ranged from 1.02 to 3560 ng L-1, which dominated by NP and BPA. Target compounds detected in effluents were from N.D. to 1136 ng L-1, with NP as most prevalent. The removal rates of target compounds varied from negative of NET to 99 % of BPA. Except of NET, efficiently removal rates (> 70 %) were observed in WWTPs. Biological treatment was the major removal stage of selected EDCs in WWTPs. Furthermore, the selected EDCs were detected from N.D. to 424 ng L-1 in receiving river. The correlation analysis suggested EDCs pollution in receiving river might be mainly contributed by WWTPs effluents. The risk quotient of NP (RQ > 1) was higher than any other pollutants, indicating its relatively higher potential risk for the aquatic organism. These results will provide significant background data to future EDCs pollution control and management in Shanghai, China.

AB Guadalquivir River (South of Spain) is among the major freshwater sources of the European Atlantic basin. Until now scientific efforts have been focused on contamination by heavy metals and some priority pollutants in Guadalquivir River. However, the presence of "emerging contaminants", such as pharmaceutically active compounds, has not yet been studied. In this work the occurrence and risk assessment of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds, belonging to different therapeutic groups, in Guadalquivir River during its course through Seville city are reported. Wastewater effluents from four wastewater treatment plants discharging into Guadalquivir River and river water samples were analyzed. All studied pharmaceutically active compounds, except sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, estrone and clofibric acid, were detected in effluent wastewaters at concentration levels up to 28.9 mu g L(-1). Among the pharmaceutically active compounds found in effluent wastewater, seven were present in Guadalquivir River samples at concentration levels up to 0.75 mu g L(-1), which indicated an important dilution from effluent discharge. Environmental risk assessment reveals that potential ecotoxicological risk cannot be expected on Guadalquivir River at measured concentration levels. Only, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil showed a medium risk for the environment. The risk for acute toxic effects in the environment with the current use of active pharmaceutical ingredients is unlikely. However, the results do not rule out the potential for chronic environmental effects.

AB Ninety-nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were analyzed in influent, final effluent, and biosolids samples from a wastewater treatment plant employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR). High concentrations in influent were found for acetaminophen, caffeine, metformin, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, paraxanthine, ibuprofen, and naproxen (10(4)-10(5) ng/L). Final effluents contained clarithromycin, metformin, atenolol, carbamazepine, and trimethoprim (>500 ng/L) at the highest concentrations, while triclosan, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, triclocarban, metformin, caffeine, ofloxacin, and paraxanthine were found at high concentrations in biosolids (>10(3) ng/g dry weight). PPCP removals varied from -34% to >99% and 23 PPCPs had >= 90% removal. Of the studied PPCPs, 26 compounds have been rarely or never studied in previous membrane bioreactor (MBR) investigations. The removal pathway showed that acetaminophen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, codeine, metformin, enalapril, atorvastatin, caffeine, paraxanthine, and cotinine exhibited high degradation/transformation. PPCPs showing strong sorption to solids included triclocarban, triclosan, miconazole, tetracycline, 4-epitetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, paroxetine, and ofloxacin. Trimethoprim, oxycodone, clarithromycin, thiabendazole, hydrochlorothiazide, erythromycin-H2O, carbamazepine, meprobamate, and propranolol were not removed during treatment, and clarithromycin was even formed during treatment. This investigation extended our understanding of the occurrence and fate of PPCPs in an MBR process through the analysis of the largest number of compounds in an MBR study to date.

Elimination of these drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is often incomplete and residues reach surface water. Their presence in the natural environment depends on consumption patterns, excretion fraction and the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment. This study compiled the total consumption of cytostatic drugs in Catalonia (NE Spain) and provides data on the occurrence and risk of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment by calculating predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). PECs were estimated using publicly available consumption data in the period of 2010-2012, published or calculated excretion values and wastewater elimination rates for a suite of 132 compounds. This allows predicting the range of concentrations in effluent wastewaters and receiving waters. Out of the 132 cytostatics, mycophenolic acid and hydroxycarbamide had a PEC value higher than 10 ng L-1. PECs were compared with MECs (measured environmental concentrations) to evaluate the reliability of the estimation. A risk assessment was conducted to determine the potential adverse effects of cytostatics in the environment. All the risk quotients calculated using EC50 in Daphnia magna were below 1, showing no significant risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active components in the aquatic environment has been recognised as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry. One key component, which is found in considerable concentrations in European natural waters and is only partially eliminated during biological wastewater treatment is ibuprofen (IBU). This paper studies the application of classic Fenton, photo-assisted Fenton, H2O2/UV and peroxymonosulphate (POMS) oxidation for degrading IBU from wastewater. It is seen that the applied advanced oxidation processes are capable of effectively degrading the IBU, with the photo-assisted Fenton oxidation having the highest efficiency. The IBU in the mixture (at an initial concentration of 22 mg/L) is completely removed by a H2O2 concentration of 0.024 and 0.03 mg/L for the photo-assisted Fenton and classic Fenton oxidation, respectively. A POMS concentration of 37mg/L is required to remove all IBU. No complete mineralization is obtained: a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal by 89 and 88% was obtained for a H2O2 concentration of 0.023 and 0.03 mg/L for photo-assisted Fenton and classic Fenton, respectively. A POMS concentration of 37 mg/L resulted in a 86% reduction of COD. Finally, the main degradation products produced during the Fenton oxidation are identified and are similar to those identified in other studies dedicated to oxidative IBU removal.

AB Paracetamol has been remarked as one of the most heavily used and prescribed drugs nowadays. The presence of paracetamol in the sewage effluent with the average concentration of 0.01 mg/L has been reported in this paper. This study investigated the removal of paracetamol from synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis treatment method under natural solar irradiation. Compound parabolic collecting reactor was used as a treatment medium. The effect of each variable (pH, concentration of TiO2 and initial concentration of paracetamol) on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of paracetamol was investigated by using the single-variable-at-a-time method. Central composite design based on the response surface methodology was used to optimize TiO2 and paracetamol concentrations. Experimental results and analysis of variance analysis showed that the model was significant with the high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9883. The optimum conditions of 1.0 g/L of TiO2 concentration and 0.06 g/L of paracetamol initial concentration were predicted for the maximum removal efficiency of 88%. Finally, the performance of UV lamp and natural sunlight in the photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol was compared and discussed in detail. The in situ experimental results in this study have proven the reliability of the solar operation on the photocatalysis treatment process.

AB In this study, the performance of a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) to treat real municipal wastewater was assessed at low temperatures (7 to 20 degrees C) in Nordic regions. First, the effect of low temperatures on membrane fouling was evaluated by monitoring trans-membrane pressure. A significant membrane fouling was observed when the sludge temperature inside the MBR unit was below 10 degrees C with a 75% permeability drop, thus indicating high deterioration of the membrane performance at low temperatures. Moreover, increasing values of sludge volume index (SVI) during low temperatures showed high deterioration of sludge settleability. As for the pollution removal, MBR achieved high performances primarily for pathogens and emerging micro pollutants. The average log reductions of 1.82, 3.02, and 1.94 log units were achieved for norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and adenoviruses, respectively. Among the four trace organic compounds (TrOCs), the average removal efficiencies of bisoprolol, diclofenac and bisphenol A were 65%, 38%, and >97%, respectively. However, carbamazepine was not efficiently removed (-89% to 28%). Regarding trace metals, an average removal of >80% was achieved for Cd, Pb, and V. For the rest of the metals, the removal capacities were between 30 and 60%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of trace tetracycline, tetracycline resistant bacteria (TRB) and tetracycline resistant genes (TRGs) in an improved anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was investigated in this study. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and conventional heterotrophic plate count method were used to measure eight tet genes (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetE, tetM, tetO, tetS and tetX) and TRB, respectively. The TRB percent of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) is about 1.31-24.1% in WWTP influent. Tet gene abundance in the WWTP varied greatly among the gene types. The concentrations of TRGs in effluent samples ranged from 7.11 x 10(-9) to 1.53 x 10(-4) copies/copy 16S rRNA gene. TRB and THB, tetM and tetO, tetE and tetX, but not the others, showed a significant correlation with each other (p < 0.01). The relationships between ribosomal protection protein genes, enzymatic modification gene and corresponding concentrations of antibiotics were found to be considerably significant (R-2 = 0.898, p < 0.01 for ribosomal protection protein genes and R-2 = 0.872, p < 0.05 for enzymatic modification gene).

AB The emission sources of biocidal active substances in households have been under discussion since these substances have been detected frequently in municipal wastewater and receiving surface water bodies. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the products responsible for the emission of these substances to wastewater.
   We analysed the wastewater of two streets for a set of biocidal active substances. Time-proportional sampling was conducted for one week of each season during one year in each street. The 14 substances analysed with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (BIT), C-12-benzalkonium chloride, carbendazim, 5-chloro-2-methyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one (CMIT), dichlorooctylisothiazolinone (DCOIT), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), diuron, icaridine, 2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one (OIT), piperonyl butoxide (PBO), triclosan, tebuconazole, terbutryn and tetramethrin. Using data available from household product inventories of the two streets, we searched the lists of ingredients for the products possibly being responsible for the emissions.
   Except for four substances, all substances have been detected in at least 10% of the samples. Highest concentrations were measured for C-12-benzalkonium chloride with an average concentration in the daily samples of 7.7 mu g/L in one of the streets. Next to C-12-benzalkonium chloride, BIT, DEET and icaridine were detected in all samples in average concentrations above 1 mu g/L in at least one street. The results show that washing and cleaning agents were important sources for preservatives such as BIT and OIT, while triclosan was apparently mainly emitted through personal care products. The mosquito repelling substances DEET and icaridine were found throughout the year, with highest emissions in summer and autumn.
   In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the sources of biocidal active substances in municipal wastewater are complex and that measures for the prevention of the emission of biocidal active substances into the aquatic environment have to be carried out under different legislations. This has to be taken into account discussing emission reduction at the source.

AB The impact of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) introduced both individually and in mixtures was ascertained on the performance of laboratory-scale wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). When introduced individually at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M, no significant differences were observed with respect to chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia removal. Microbial community analyses reveal that although similarity index values generally decreased over time with an increase in PhAC concentrations as compared to the controls, no major microbial community shifts were observed for total bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities. However, when some PhACs were introduced in mixtures, they were found to both inhibit nitrification and alter AOB community structure. Ammonia removal decreased by up to 45% in the presence of 0.25 mu M gemfibrozil and 0.75 mu M naproxen. PhAC mixtures did not however affect COD removal performance suggesting that heterotrophic bacteria are more robust to PhACs than AOB. These results highlight that the joint action of PhACs in mixtures may have significantly different effects on nitrification than the individual PhACs. This phenomenon should be further investigated with a wider range of PhACs so that toxicity effects can more accurately be predicted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In wastewater treatment, micro- and ultra-filtration membranes are used for the separation of the activated sludge (biomass) from the treated water. This offers the advantages of a complete removal of solids and bacteria, as well as most of the viruses, namely those attached to the suspended solids. Compared to the conventional activated sludge process (CAS) this technology allows a much higher biomass concentration (MLSS) whereby the reactor volume and the footprint decreases. With increasing MLSS, the viscosity of the sludge increases, which leads to reduced oxygen transfer rates. Depending on the type of membrane and membrane module, the pre-treatment has to be more sophisticated to prevent clogging and sludging of the modules.
   Due to fouling and scaling, the flux through the membranes will decrease with time. The decrease depends on the water quality as well as on the measurements taken to minimize fouling. Mainly, three strategies are available: lowering the flux, increasing the "crossflow" and cleaning of the membranes. Different strategies including backwash and chemical cleaning "in situ", "on air" and "ex situ" can be applied. It has been proven more effective to apply preventive regular cleaning.
   Besides the energy demand for oxygen supply - which is typically in the range of 0.3 kWh/m(3) for municipal wastewater - the energy for fouling prevention is substantial. Immersed membranes need approximately 0.4 to 1 kWh/m(3) -:or the coarse bubble aeration, whereas tubular modules require 1 to 4 kWh/m3 pump energy.
   For proper design of industrial wastewater treatment, the verification of applicability and the development of adequate cleaning strategies, it is a precondition to run pilot tests for a sufficient period of time with the wastewater to be treated. More than 100 industrial wastewater treatment membrane bioreactors (MBR) are in operation in Europe. Data of three case studies for a sewage sludge dewatering plant in UK (12,000 m(3)/d), a plant for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater in Germany (3,600 m(3)/d), as well for revamping of an chemical WWTP > 2,000 m(3)/d in Italy, are given.
   MBRs will be used in future wherever high quality effluent is required, because of a sensitive receiving water body or due to the fact of water reuse as process water. MBRs are a perfect pre-treatment in industrial applications when further treatment with nanofiltration or reverse osmosis is considered.
   The technique is advanced and can be applied both in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. Higher operational costs must be balanced by superior effluent quality.

AB The occurrence and fate of 48 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different urbanization areas in Xiamen, China was investigated over one year. Results showed that PPCPs were widely detected, but the major PPCPs in the influent, effluent, and sludge were different. Spatial and seasonal variations of PPCP levels in the influent and sludge were observed. The removal efficiencies for most PPCPs were similar among the three WWTPs, although they employed different biological treatment processes. Furthermore, the mass loadings per inhabitant of most pharmaceuticals had a positive correlation with the urbanization levels, indicating that most pharmaceutical usage was higher in the urban core compared to the suburban zones. The total mass loadings of all the 48 PPCPs in the effluent and waste sludge showed close proportions, which suggested the importance of proper waste sludge disposal to prevent a large quantity of PPCPs from entering the environment.

AB In the present study, wastewater and sludge samples of two major hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan were analyzed by developing an HPLC-UV method for the possible occurrence of five frequently used fluoroquinolone antibiotics i.e. ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. The highest detected concentration was for moxifloxacin in both wastewater (224 mu g/L) and sludge samples (219 mu g/kg. The highest concentration of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and gemifloxacin were found to be 66,18,58 and 0.2 mu g/L respectively. Risk quotient (RQ) was also calculated based on maximum measured concentrations and the RQ values were very high particularly for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The maximum RQ values for ofloxacin against Vibrio fisheri, Pseudomonas putida, fish, Daphnia, Green algae and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were 3300, 66,000, 124, 46, 3300 and 6000, respectively. In case of ciprofloxacin, RQ values were found to be 1750 and 3500 against green algae and Microcystis aeruginosa, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rivers containing effluents from water treatment plants are complex soups of compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals to natural hormones. Male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 3 weeks to effluent waters from the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant in St. Paul, MN. Fish were tested for their competitive nest holding behavior. Changes in vitellogenin were measured and these were correlated to changes in gene expression using a 22,000 gene microarray developed specifically for fathead minnows. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in both liver and testis, which correlate to phenotypic changes of vitellogenin induction and reduced competitive behavior. We also compared by real-time PCR the expression changes in key genes related to steroid biosynthesis and metabolism in fish exposed to the effluent as well as in fish exposed to a model estrogen and a model androgen. While the gene expression signature from effluent-exposed fish shared some elements with estrogen and androgen signatures, overall it was different, underscoring the complexity of compounds present in sewage and their different modes of action.

AB Sewage input into a karst aquifer via leaking sewers and cesspits was investigated over five years in an urbanized catchment. Of 66 samples, analyzed for 25 pharmaceuticals, 91% indicated detectable concentrations. The former standard iodinated X-ray contrast medium (ICM) diatrizoic acid was detected most frequently. Remarkably, it was found more frequently in groundwater (79%, median: 54 ng/l) than in wastewater (21%, 120 ng/l), which is supposed to be the only source in this area. In contrast, iopamidol, a possible substitute, spread over the aquifer during the investigation period whereas concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher in wastewater than in groundwater. Knowledge about changing application of pharmaceuticals thus is essential to assess urban impacts on aquifers, especially when applying mass balances. Since correlated concentrations provide conclusive evidence that, for this catchment, nitrate in groundwater rather comes from urban than from rural sources, ICM are considered useful tracers.

AB Adsorption of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using sludge-derived biochar made of various wastewater sludges was investigated. The sludge-derived biochar had relatively large Brunauer-Emmet-Teller specific surface areas that were beyond 110.0 m(2)g(-1) except the biochar made from the sludge collected from traditional sludge drying bed. The mesopore capacity was more than 57 % of the total pore capacity of all sludge-derived biochar except that made from the sludge dried through traditional sludge drying bed technique. High adsorption capacity of sludge-derived biochar was observed with a highest adsorption capacity of 19.80 +/- 0.40 mgg(-1). High correlation between the adsorption capacity of sludge-derived biochar and the volatile content in the sludge source was observed. The Freundlich model (r(2) values were in the range of 0.961-0.998) yielded the best fit with the experimental data of all the produced biochar. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were readily adsorbed onto sludge-derived biochar. These findings suggest a new approach for the pollution control of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using low-cost sludge-derived biochar.

AB The selection of a natural bacterial consortium from an activated sludge system and the verification of the capability of these organisms for hormone biodegradation are important to the wastewater treatment process. An enrichment aerobic reactor was seeded with activated sludge and synthetic wastewater with estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and hormones were used as the sole external carbon sources. From 16S rRNA sequencing analyses, the entire structure of the bacterial community and the bacterial genera present in the system were identified. The enrichment, obtained from the supply of hormones in the system, made it possible to obtain a bacterial consortium able to perform the degradation of hormones. Aerobic bacteria were highly capable of degrading the natural hormones (24 h); synthetic hormone was degraded by 84.5% (34 days), and bacteria were selected in the presence of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol. The authors suggest that Emticicia, Nubsella, and Sphingobacterium, bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum, were responsible for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol biodegradation. Emticicia was first reported as being supposed to be a hormone-degrading bacterium.

AB This study aims to evaluate the occurrence of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in wastewater sludge and their removal during anaerobic digestion. The significant occurrence of 18 TrOCs in primary sludge was observed. These TrOCs occurred predominantly in the solid phase. Some of these TrOCs (e.g. paracetamol, caffeine, ibuprofen and triclosan) were also found at high concentrations (>10,000 ng/L) in the aqueous phase. The overall removal of TrOCs (from both the aqueous and solid phase) by anaerobic digestion was governed by their molecular structure (e.g. the presence/absence of electron withdrawing/donating functional groups). While an increase in sludge retention time (SRT) of the digester resulted in a small but clearly discernible increase in basic biological performance (e.g. volatile solids removal and biogas production), the impact of SRT on TrOC removal was negligible. The lack of SRT influence on TrOC removal suggests that TrOCs were not the main substrate for anaerobic digestion. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The excess sludge from Up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor operated on source separated toilet wastewater is a potential source of nutrients and organic matter. It can be further stabilized and dried by composting and applied as a soil amendment. Presence of pathogens, heavy metals and micropollutants in the compost derived from anaerobic sludge is thus undesirable. This paper focuses on removal of micropollutants, typically present in domestic wastewater, via composting of UASB sludge with waste wood. Estrone, diclofenac, ibuprofen, metoprolol, carbamazepine, galaxolide and triclosan were spiked to a mixture of UASB sludge and waste wood. Their concentrations were monitored during 92 days of composting at controlled temperature conditions. All studied micropollutants were removed at various rates with overall removal ranging from 99.9% for ibuprofen, diclofenac and estrone to 87.8% for carbamazepine. Accumulation of methyltriclosan as by-product of triclosan degradation was observed. The prospects and limitations of the integration of a composting process into Source Separated Sanitation concepts are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thirty four (34) of the fifty (50) selected Nigerian based pharmaceutical businesses, mainly acting as local manufacturers and major importers of medicines were interviewed using questionnaires to ascertain their waste management practices, knowledge of waste management policies and subjection to regulatory control. This study indicated that like its counterpart industry in other countries of the world, the Nigerian pharmaceutical industry generated both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. However, the wastes were not categorized, poorly managed by 91.2% of the respondents, while 58.8% of the health and safety personnel had little or no modern knowledge of waste management. Furthermore, 73.5% of the respondents claimed that they were aware of the regulatory requirements on waste, but no adherence was observed. The industry did not benefit from the strict supervisions of regulatory agencies. Pharmaceutical waste was improperly disposed and all the secondary manufacturers (79.4%) discharged wastewater without removal of pharmaceuticals. This study highlighted the urgent need to train personnel in the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities. Management of waste should be planned, documented, implemented and sustained.

AB The fate of two differently labelled radioactive forms of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was studied during the membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. The laboratory- scale MBR specially designed for studies with radioactive compounds was operated using a synthetic wastewater representative of the pharmaceutical industry and the activated sludge was obtained from a large-scale MBR treating pharmaceutical wastewater. By applying in MBR a concentration of 8 g/L mixed liquor solid suspension and a sludge retention time of 25 days over the whole test period (35 days), the removal performance of C-, N- and P-ranged between 80% and 95%. Balancing of radioactivity could demonstrate that real mineralization is <1%, while radioactivity mainly remained sorbed in the reactor, resulting in a removal of approximately 80%. The same metabolite pattern in the radiochromatograms for the two different labelling protocols led us to assume that the elimination pathway does not involve the removal of the ethinyl group from EE2 molecule.

AB The fate of enrofloxacin present in raw sewage at a swine-breeding facility was investigated by liquid-liquid extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Samples were collected in the storage pits of each pigsty and in a nonaerated lagoon used to stock the sewage. In the pigsties, the sewage was mixed with 10% olive oil groundwater, following a certified procedure (cod. Cer 020301) which reduces the bad odors and produces a better manure. This sewage treatment for 8 months in the lagoon dramatically reduced the amount of enrofloxacin to levels under the detection limit of 0.6 mug.L-1. The results stress the importance of correct sludge management in limiting the impact of enrofloxacin in the environment.

AB The present research aims at giving an insight into the increasingly important issue of water pollution due to emerging contaminants. In particular, the source and fate of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac have been analyzed at catchment scale for the Llobregat River in Catalonia (Spain). In fact, water from the Llobregat River is used to supply a significant part of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. At the same time, 59 wastewater treatment plants discharge into this basin. GREAT-ER model has been implemented in this basin in order to reproduce a static balance for this pollutant for two field campaigns data set. The results highlighted the ability of GREAT-ER to simulate the diclofenac concentrations in the Llobregat Catchment; however, this study also pointed out the urgent need for longer time series of observed data and a better knowledge of wastewater plants outputs and their parameterization in order to obtain more reliable results.

AB This study evaluated the chronic impact and biodegradability of sulfamethoxazole under anaerobic conditions. For this purpose, a lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor was operated in a sequence of different phases with gradually increasing sulfamethoxazole doses of 1 to 45 mg/L. Conventional parameters, such as COD, VFA, and methane generation, were monitored with corresponding antimicrobial concentrations in the reactor and the methanogenic activity of the sludge. The results revealed that anaerobic treatment was suitable for pharmaceutical industry wastewater with concentrations of up to 40 mg/L of sulfamethoxazole. Higher levels exerted toxic effects on themicrobial community under anaerobic conditions, causing the inhibition of substrate/COD utilization and biogas generation and leading to a total collapse of the reactor. The adverse long-term impact was quite variable for fermentative bacteria and methanogenic achaea fractions of the microbial community based on changes inflicted on the composition of the residual organic substrate and mRNA expression of the key enzymes.

AB Carbamazepine is frequently detected in waters and hardly eliminated during conventional wastewater treatment processes due to its complicated chemical structure and resistance to biodegradation. A carbamazepine-degrading bacterium named CBZ-4 was isolated at a low temperature (10 degrees C) from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Strain CBZ-4, which can use carbamazepine as its sole source of carbon and energy, was identified as Pseudomonas sp. by the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The composition and percentage of fatty acids, which can reveal the cold-adaptation mechanism of strain CBZ-4, were determined. Strain CBZ-4 can effectively degrade carbamazepine at optimal conditions: pH 7.0, 10 degrees C, 150 r/min rotation speed, and 13% inoculation volume. The average removal rate of carbamazepine was 46.6% after 144 hr of incubation. The biodegradation kinetics of carbamazepine by CBZ-4 was fitted via the Monod model. V-max and K-s were found to be 0.0094 hr(-1) and 32.5 mg/L, respectively.

AB In recent years, worldwide awareness of an aquatic environment polluted by organic trace pollutants, e. g. pharmaceutical residues and industrial chemicals, has risen tremendously. The present paper outlines similarities and differences in how to face the organic trace pollutants occurring in the natural and urban water cycles in Germany and China. Our joint review clearly shows that this emerging environmental problem is in both countries being widely discussed on a scientific level and it is evidently perceived in a comparable way. However, while the state of knowledge, which is still unsatisfactory, induces further investigations in China, the research activities in Germany have already led to first full-scale applications to remove trace pollutants. While Germany seems to be one step ahead, China possibly is in a better position for a later trace pollutants removal due to the massively increasing use of membrane bioreactors as a key technology for the necessary expansion of wastewater treatment capacities.

AB In India, sewage (partially-treated/untreated) is randomly used for irrigation because of easy availability and presence of residual organics and nutrients. However, data on the occurrence of contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in sewage is scarce in Indian perspective. Herein, for the first time, we present a quantitative contamination profiling of selected PPCPs and antibiotic resistance in untreated and biologically-treated sewage from three different sewage treatment plants, located in northern and central part of India. Profiling of PPCPs were done using LC-ESI-MS/MS whereas antibiotic resistance was analyzed using gradient PCR and qPCR techniques. PPCPs were detected both in untreated and treated samples (0.4 - 1340 mu g/L). A reduction in ARB and ARG load (2-3 log) and an increase in ARG copy number with respect to beta lactams and tetracycline were observed in treated sewage. Triclosan, estrone and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, ubiquitous in all samples, could be used as markers for performance monitoring of sewage treatment facilities. The results obtained in this study help evaluate health and ecological risks associated with the presence of CECs in treated sewage used for irrigation and frame future policies.YY

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to purposefully eliminate antibiotics and therefore many previous investigations have been carried out to assess their fate in biological wastewater treatment processes. In order to consolidate previous findings regarding influencing factors like the solid and hydraulic retention time an intensive monitoring was carried out in a municipal WWTP in Germany. Over a period of 12 months daily samples were taken from the in- and effluent as well as diverse sludge streams. The 14 selected antibiotics and one metabolite cover the following classes: cephalosporins, diaminopyrimidines, fluoroquinolones, lincosamide, macrolides, penicillins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines.
   Out of the 15 investigated substances, the removal of only clindamycin and ciprofloxacin show significant correlations to SRT, temperature, HRT and nitrogen removal. The dependency of clindamycin's removal could be related to the significant negative removal (i.e. production) of clindamycin in the treatment process and was corrected using the human metabolite clindamycin-sulfoxide. The average elimination was adjusted from -225% to 3% which suggests that clindamycin can be considered as an inert substance during the wastewater treatment Process. Based on the presented data, the mass flow analysis revealed that macrolides, clindamycin/clindamycin-sulfoxide and trimethoprim were mainly released with the effluent, while penicillins, cephalosporins as well as sulfamethoxazole were partly degraded in the studied WWTP. Furthermore, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are the only antibiotics under investigation with a significant mass fraction bound to primary, excess and digested sludge. Nevertheless, the sludge concentrations are highly inconsistent which leads to questionable results. It remains unclear whether the inconsistencies are due to insufficiencies in sampling and/or analytical determination or if the fluctuations can be considered reasonable for digesters. Hence, future investigations have to address antibiotic's temporal dynamics during the sludge treatment to decide whether or not the widely reported standard deviations of sludge concentrations reflect realistic fluctuations.

AB The presence of acid pharmaceuticals in water environments poses a potential threat to ecosystems and human health. Recent research has shown that photo oxidation processes are much more effective for removing these pharmaceuticals. However, the existence of humic acid (HA) could inhibit the clearance efficiency of this process. In this study, we investigated the photochemical degradation of six selected acid pharmaceuticals in surface water and effluent from wastewater treatment plants using the UV/H2O2 process. The results showed that HA can act as a photo sensitizer or a .OH sink, and its concentration had a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of acid pharmaceuticals. Most of these pharmaceuticals were inhibited during this process when HA was added to deionized water solutions. In addition, the effects of chloride, bicarbonate, and nitrate on the degradation of these pharmaceuticals were different. The removal efficiency of these acid pharmaceuticals is lower in natural samples than in deionized samples because of the complex constituents in the latter.

AB Based on a monitoring program over the course of a year, we characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of selected micropollutants in an urban watershed within the city of Leipzig, Germany. Micropollutants; revealed a ubiquitous presence in untreated and treated wastewater, surface water and groundwater. The loads of 4-nonylphenol in the effluents of the municipal wastewater treatment plant followed a seasonal trend, whereas the loads of all other micropollutants were highly variable and not correlated to seasons. In the surface water, load seasonality of caffeine, galaxolide and tonalide resulted from a rapid removal with increased water temperature. The loads of 4-nonylphenol and of caffeine in the colder months increased when rainfall occurred. In the groundwater, complex spatial and temporal patterns were apparent and were related to varying input, retardation and removal processes. As a consequence, an assessment of micropollutants in urban waters should consider different micropollutants' temporal and spatial variability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Obtaining representative information on illicit drug use and patterns across a country remains difficult using surveys because of low response rates and response biases. A range of studies have used wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a complementary approach to monitor community-wide illicit drug use. In Australia, no large-scale WBE studies have been conducted to date to reveal illicit drug use profiles in a national context. In this study, we performed the first Australia-wide WBE monitoring to examine spatial patterns in the use of three illicit stimulants (cocaine, as its human metabolite benzoylecgonine; methamphetamine; and 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)). A total of 112 daily composite wastewater samples were collected from 14 wastewater treatment plants across four states and two territories. These covered approximately 40% of the Australian population. We identified and quantified illicit drug residues using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. There were distinctive spatial patterns of illicit stimulant use in Australia. Multivariate analyses showed that consumption of cocaine and MDMA was higher in the large cities than in rural areas. Also, cocaine consumption differed significantly between different jurisdictions. Methamphetamine consumption was more similar between urban and rural locations. Only a few cities had elevated levels of use. Extrapolation of the WBE estimates suggested that the annual consumption was 3 tonnes for cocaine and 9 tonnes combined for methamphetamine and MDMA, which outweighed the annual seizure amount by 25 times and 45 times, respectively. These ratios imply the difficulty of detecting the trafficking of these stimulants in Australia, possibly more so for methamphetamine than cocaine. The obtained spatial pattern of use was compared with that in the most recent national household survey. Together both WBE and survey methods provide a more comprehensive evaluation of drug use that can assist governments in developing policies to reduce drug use and harm in the communities.

AB To establish their environmental concentrations and to support surface water protection programs, we have undertaken a preliminary study of the concentrations of selected acidic and neutral pharmaceutical residues (clofibric acid, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine) in Taiwanese river and wastewater samples. These pharmaceutical residues were extracted from the water samples through the Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE). The analytes were then identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry with dual-polarity electrospray ionization in the product ion scan mode. The limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 0.5 and 20 ng l(-1) for 250 ml samples of water. We investigated the intra- and interbatch precision and accuracy at two levels of concentration. The selected analytes were detected at concentrations ranging from <0.5 to 960 ng l(-1) in wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the aquatic environment from wastewater effluents is a concern in many countries. Although many studies have been conducted to evaluate the APIs removal efficiencies and emissions to the environment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), most of these studies considered the aqueous and sludge phases, disregarding the suspended particulate matter (SPM) phase. To try to understand the role of the SPM, the occurrence of five most common antibiotics and three antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) commonly used in Kenya were investigated in this study. APIs partitioning and mass loading in influents and effluents of three different WWTPs: trickling filters, stabilization ponds, and decentralized fecal sludge system, were evaluated. API concentration levels ranging from LOQ (limit of quantification) to 92 mu gL(-1) and LOQ to 82.2 mgkg(-1) were observed in aqueous samples and solid samples respectively, with SPM accounting for most of the higher concentrations. The use of the aqueous phase alone for determination of removal efficiencies showed underestimations of API removal as compared to when solid phases are also considered. Negative removal efficiencies were observed, depending on the compound and the type of AATP. The negative removals were associated with deconjugation of metabolites, aggregated accumulation of APIs in the WWTPs, as well as unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling. Compound characteristics, environmental factors, and WWTPs operation influenced WWTPs removal efficiencies. Wastewater stabilization ponds had the poorest removals efficiencies with an average of -322%. High total mass loads into the WWTPs influent and effluent of 22,729 and 22,385 mg day(-1 )1000 PE-1 were observed respectively. The results aims at aiding scientists and engineers in planning and designing of WWTPs. Findings also aim at aiding policy-making on pharmaceutical drug use and recommend proper wastewater management practices to manage the high mass loading observed in the WWTPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The activated sludge process is the most common method of secondary municipal wastewater treatment; solids retention time (SRT) is the key control parameter for this process. Typically, operating at long SRT is considered only for nitrification, but there are additional benefits of high SRT operation. This paper presents experimental and literature evidence to demonstrate three major additional benefits of long SRT operation: increased oxygen transfer efficiency; improved biomass particle size distribution, which results in more efficient clarification with fewer effluent particles and suspended solids; and enhanced removal of many emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting compounds. This paper presents experimental results from several treatment plants that showed increasing oxygen transfer efficiency and particle size with increasing SRT, and evidence documenting improved removal of emerging contaminants and biodegradable organic carbon. A long-term survey of three treatment plants concludes that operating at higher SRT is not as energy intensive as typically assumed. Water Environ. Res., 84, 42 (2012).

AB Wastewater effluent contains synthetic and natural hormones, often in complex mixtures, that may be associated with reproductive abnormalities in fish and other aquatic biota. We exposed the sentinel invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia to the natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), a synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), and a synthetic progestin, medroxyprogestone in a 7-day test. These compounds had no significant effect on reproduction or survival even at 10(6) times the concentrations at which reproductive effects have been documented in several fish species. C. dubia is routinely used for screening the toxicity of wastewater effluent. However, in the standard chronic 7-day exposure the endpoints of survival and reproduction were insensitive to several synthetic and natural vertebrate hormones. The C. dubia 7-day chronic toxicity test is probably not a useful monitoring tool for vertebrate hormones and their pharmaceutical analogs unless other sensitive endpoints such as maturation rates, molt frequency, and offspring sex ratios are incorporated in a practical manner.

AB Estrogenic compounds enter waterways via effluents from wastewater treatment works (WWTW), thereby indicating a potential risk to organisms inhabiting adjacent receiving waters. However, little is known about the loads or concentrations of estrogenic compounds that enter Australian WWTWs, the efficiency of removing estrogenic compounds throughout the various stages of tertiary WWTW processes (which are common in Australia), nor the concentrations released into estuarine or marine receiving waters, and the associated risk for aquatic taxa residing in these environments. Therefore, seven estrogenic compounds, comprising the natural estrogens estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3), the synthetic estrogen (EE2), and the industrial chemicals bisphenol A (BPA), 4-t-octyl phenol (4-t-OP) and 4-nonyl phenol (4-NP), in wastewater samples were quantified via liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) after solid-phase extraction at different stages of wastewater treatment and associated receiving waters. The concentrations of the target compounds in wastewater ranged from < LOQ (limit of quantification) to 158 ng/L for Tanilba Bay WWTW and < LOQ to 162 ng/L for Belmont WWTW. Most target compounds significantly declined after the secondary treatment phase. Appreciable removal efficiency throughout the treatment process was observed with removal from 39.21 to 99.98% of influent values at both WWTWs. The reduction of the natural estrogens (E1, E2 and E3) and 4-t-OP were significantly greater than EE2, BPA, and 4-NP in both WWTWs. Risk quotients (RQs) were calculated to assess potential ecological risks from individual estrogenic compounds. In predicted diluted effluents, no targeted compounds showed any ecological risk (RQ <= 1.65 x 10(-2)) at both WWTWs. Similarly, all RQs for shore samples at both WWTWs were below 1. Finally, the hazard index (HI), which represents combined estrogenic contaminants' ecological risk, indicated no mentionable risk for predicted diluted effluents (HI = 0.0097 to 0.0218) as well as shoreline samples (HI = 0.393 to 0.522) in the receiving estuarine or marine waters.

AB The occurrence of several classes of emerging contaminants (ECs) was assessed in the River Lambro basin, one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas of Italy. The study aims were to identify the main sources of ECs, quantify their amounts circulating in the water cycle, and study their fate in the aquatic environment. More than 80 ECs were selected among pharmaceuticals (PHARM), personal care products (PCPs), disinfectants (DIS), illicit drugs (IDs), perfluorinated compounds (PERF), alkylphenols and bisphenol A (Alk-BPA), and anthropogenic markers (AM). Specific analytical methods were developed for quantitative analysis based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ECs were measured in rivers upstream and downstream of the main city (Milan), and in untreated and treated wastewater from Milan to assess the contribution to river contamination, and in superficial and deep groundwater in the city area to study the relationship between river and groundwater contamination. Samples were collected in a two-year monitoring campaign. Almost all ECs were ubiquitous in untreated wastewater, at concentrations up to the mu g/L range, and the most abundant classes were PHARM and AM. Removals during different wastewater treatment processes were studied and the most stable substances were PHARM, PCPs and PERF. The mass loads increased for all the classes of ECs along the River Lambro basin. A mass balance was done in the river basin and allowed to identify the main sources of contamination, which were domestic, from treated or untreated wastewater, for PHARM, PCPs and IDs, mainly industrial for PERF, and both industrial and domestic for Alk-BPA. The study of AM helped to identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater. A substantial contribution of surface water to groundwater contamination was observed. This study improves the knowledge on occurrence, sources and fate of multiple classes of ECs in a highly urbanized area providing useful information to help the establishment of EU regulations for ECs.

AB Oceans are the ultimate sink for many of the over 100 million man-made substances. Until now, monitoring was limited to a reduced number of targeted persistent organic pollutants, reaching open waters mainly via atmospheric deposition. However, the composition and fate of the thousands of pollutants reaching the marine environment though wastewater discharges from coastal sources remain largely unexplored. By combining a newly developed nontarget screening (NTS) workflow and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), we have identified over 500 sewage-derived contaminants occurring in the ocean. Samples from the NE Atlantic contained this anthropogenic imprint at distances over SO km from the coastline and >500 m depth, beyond the continental margin. The range of identified compounds spans from pharmaceuticals and personal care products to food additives and industrial chemicals, including several that have never been reported in the environment, as they escaped conventional targeted analytical methods. Predicting the effects of the continuous input of this chemical "cocktail" on marine ecosystems is a formidable challenge, since 40% of the detected compounds lack information regarding their use and ecotoxicity.

AB Phthalates are widely used in plastic and personnel care products. Being non-steroid endocrine disrupting compounds, their exposure have toxic effects on aquatic life and human health. The aim of this study was a comparative assessment of their fate and risk in full scale wastewater treatment along with influence of seasonal variations. Four priority phthalates, Diethylphthalate (DEP), Dibutylphthalate (DBP), Benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were chosen for this study and wastewater treatment plants investigated were designed as nutrient removal based sequencing batch reactor (SBR), conventional activated sludge process (ASP) and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) with polishing pond. Results showed that the main removal mechanism of phthalates was biotransformation with removal contribution of 74% in SBR, 65% in conventional ASP and 37% in UASB. Overall removal of phthalates was maximum in the treatment combination UASB and pond (83%) followed by SBR (80%) and conventional ASP (74%). Seasonal influences on occurrence, removal and risk of these phthalates were also studied. The concentration of DEP, DBP and DEHP in untreated wastewater increased by 2, 7 and 2 mu g/L, respectively in summer. However in sludge, only large molecular weight phthalates BBP and DEHP increased in winter by 3 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg, respectively. Seasonal variations in removal of phthalates were discrepant in each process with better removal during summer. Risk assessment of phthalates to aquatic life showed that there is no potential risk of DEP, DBP and BBP from effluents of treatment plants however risk quotient of DEHP was in the range of 27-73 in both seasons which indicate probable risk to aquatic organisms. Phthalate risk to human beings estimated by daily intake of phthalates was in the range of 0.3 +/- 0.1 to 20 +/- 0.7 ng/kg/d and far below their respective reference dosages, demonstrating the potential of these treatment plants to reduce the risk of phthalates.

AB Antibiotic contamination attracts growing concerns because of their deleterious effects on the ecosystem and human health. In this study, 43 antibiotics in wastewater from a variety of sources and water of the Yangtze River in Chongqing City in western China were measured. Thirty compounds were detected, and their concentrations were highest in leachates from the municipal solid waste treatment facilities (landfills and incineration plants) with total concentrations of 3584-57,106 ng/L. The total concentrations in influents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were comparable (401-7994 ng/L versus 640-8945 ng/L). The concentrations in raw sewage from swine farms (with a total of 10,219-39,195 ng/L) and poultry farms (1419-36,027 ng/L) were noticeably higher than those from other farms (54.0-5516 ng/L). Fluoroquinolones were the dominant antibiotics contributing over 50% in all the sources, and sulfonamides and imidazole fungicides contributed 3.2-34%, whereas tetracyclines and macrolides had minor contributions. The overall antibiotic removal rates were highest in solid waste treatment facilities (88% on average), comparable between municipal and industrial WWTPs (61%), and lowest in animal farms (39%). The mass loads to the investigated municipal WWTPs via influent wastewater ranged from 7.80 to 1531 kg/year (53.2-2482 mu g/day per capital). The influent mass loads to the industrial WWTPs and farms were 3.7-50 kg/year and 0.9-5437 g/year, respectively. We estimated that the mass inventories of antibiotics from these sources to the environment via effluent discharges were approximately 2044 kg for municipal WWTPs, 61 kg for industrial WWTPs, and 34 kg for animal farms in the whole city. Antibiotic concentrations in the Yangtze River water were substantially low (< 492 ng/L, with a mean of 57.8 ng/L) suggesting dissipation during the movement.

AB The site-specific daily fluctuations and scale-dependent variability of influent water quality, particularly concentrations of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs), have not yet been well described. In this study, raw wastewater from three distinct sewershed scales was sampled including a centralized wastewater treatment facility in Boulder, Colorado (population similar to 125,000) and two decentralized wastewater catchments in Golden, Colorado (clustered system population 400, and septic system population 32). Each site was sampled hourly for 26 h and samples were subsequently analyzed in triplicate for 32 TOrCs using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and stable isotope dilution. Detection frequency (DF) of the various TOrCs was positively correlated with sewershed size with the greatest DF of the targeted TOrCs at the Boulder site and with decreasing DF with decreasing sewershed size. Site-specific fluctuations were both scale and compound-specific. The 11 TOrCs detected greater than 75% of the time across all three sites were used to further investigate and quantify variability and to develop a statistical model to investigate the flow-dependence and time-dependence of TOrC variability. Sewershed scale was inversely correlated to variability with coefficients of variation ranging from 0.24 to 0.96, 0.39 to 2.22, and 0.32 to 3.93 for the Boulder, cluster, and septic sites, respectively. A significant linear relationship was observed between concentration and flow and concentration and the concentration at prior time points for most TOrCs at the Boulder site. This suggests less variable influent concentrations result from dispersion and mixing in the conveyance system and a larger number of discrete inputs. A notable exception was the chlorinated flame retardant TCPP, which is likely associated with a high concentration, low-flow industrial input. A significant linear relationship between flow and concentration and sequential time points was not common at the decentralized sites. Scientists and engineers developing decentralized treatment systems must consider a larger range of influent qualities, particularly with respect to TOrCs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital effluents are the sources for complex high percentage of micropollutants and till date no specific treatment have been investigated for the removal of pollutants. These effluents and their complex characteristics pose resistance to unit operation which undergoes in hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In other words such complex contaminants are unable to removed completely through conventional treatment processes. The pharmaceutical residues entering into the environment may pose a serious threat to the water resources around the world. In past few years environmental scientists are more concerned towards the effluent generated from medical care facilities, community health centers and hospitals. In this study, seven multi-specialty hospitals with non-identical pre-treatment were selected for 3-aspects i.e. conventional wastewater characteristics, high priority pharmaceuticals and microbial analyses. The present work is to evaluate efficacy of advanced wastewater treatment methods with regard to removal of these 3-aspects from hospital effluents before discharge into a sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on test results, two out of seven treatment technologies i.e. MBR and CW effectively reducing conventional parameters and pharmaceuticals from secondary and tertiary treatments except regeneration of microbes were observed in tertiary level by these two treatments. The result also suggests that, MBR exhibited 100% elimination of ibuprofen, carbamazepine, frusemide while CW indicated 100% elimination of ofloxacin. Furthermore, two combinations of advanced oxidation process viz. ozonation (O-3) and peroxone process (O-3-H2O2) were demonstrated to oxidize pharmaceuticals. The operational key factors for AOP involve pH, O-3 supply, contact time, and H2O2 concentrations. Based on pharmaceuticals reduction efficiencies, the conventional O-3 alone is more efficient as compared to combine O-3-H(2)O2 treatment. Hence results confirmed that, MBR coupled with ozone process proved as an optimal technology among the seven technologies for the pre-treatment of hospital effluent. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and wastewater products are emerging environmental concerns for manifold reasons, including the potential of some compounds found in these products for endocrine disruption at a very low chronic exposure level. The environmental occurrences and sources of these contaminants in the water, soil, sediment and biota in European nations and the United States are well documented. This work reports a screening-level emission and fate assessment of thirty compounds, listed in the National Reconnaissance of the United States Geological Survey (USGS, 1999-2000) as the most frequently detected organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams and rivers. Estimations of the surface water fate factors were based on Level II and Level III multimedia fugacity models for a 1000 km(2) model environment, the size of a typical county in the eastern United States. The compounds are categorized into three groups based upon the sensitivity of their predicted surface water fate factors to uncertainties in their physicochemical property values and the landscape parameters. The environmental fate factors, mass distributions, and loss pathways of all of the compounds are strongly affected by their assumed modes of entry into the environment. It is observed that for thirteen of the thirty organic wastewater contaminants most commonly detected in surface waters, conventional treatment strategies may be ineffective for their removal from wastewater effluents. The surface water fate factors predicted by the fugacity models were used in conjunction with the surface water concentrations measured in the USGS reconnaissance to obtain emission flux estimates for the compounds into U.S. streams and rivers. These include estimated fluxes of 6.8 x 10(-5) to 0.30 kg/h km(2) for the biomarker coprostanol; 1.7 x 10(-5) to 6.5 x 10(-5) kg/h km(2) for the insect repellent N, N-diethyltoluamide; and 4.3 x 10(-6) to 3.1 x 10(-5) kg/h km(2) for the steroid estriol.

AB One of the main risks associated with effluents from both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) is the release of micropollutants (MPs) in receiving water bodies. However, the impact of MPs present in the effluents of OSSFs in the aquatic environment has not been studied so far. The current study evaluates the impact of the effluents of OSSFs and small-to-large scale WWTPs on natural waters. The discharge of 74 MPs was assessed including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The sampling was carried out within a Swedish catchment and included three sites that are exclusively affected by OSSFs and other sites that are mainly affected by WWTPs or a mixture of sources (7 sites, 28 samples). Results show that although OSSFs serve a much smaller total number of people, the MPs emitted from OSSFs reached the aquatic environment in significant quantities (concentrations of >150 ng L-1 of Sigma MPs). The composition profiles for sites affected by WWTPs were similar and were dominated by sucralose (27% of the Sigma MPs), caffeine (27% of the Sigma MPs), lamotrigine (10% of the Sigma MPs), desvenlafaxine (5% of the Sigma MPs), and diclofenac (4% of the Sigma MPs). In contrast, the sites affected by OSSFs showed high variability, exhibiting a different profile from those affected by WWTPs and also from each other, demonstrating that OSSFs are not homogeneous sources of MPs. Some specific compounds, such as diethyltoluamide (DEET) and caffeine, were proportionally much more important at sites affected by OSSFs than at sites affected by WWTPs (representing a much higher percentage of the Sigma MPs in the OSSFs). In contrast, PFASs did not show high concentration variation among the different sampling sites and the composition profiles were relatively similar, indicating that these substances follow different routes of entry into the aquatic environment.

AB The performance of a biomass adapted to Oncological Ward Wastewater (OWW) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared with that of a municipal WWTP, on the removal of pharmaceutical molecules and more specifically on their overall resistance and purifying ability in the presence of pharmaceutical cocktails. Sorption and biotransformation mechanisms on two antineoplastics, one antibiotic and a painkiller were evaluated. Sludge acclimated to OWW allowed for a 34% increase in the removal rate and in the minimum inhibition concentration. The percentage of the amounts of specific pharmaceutical compounds removed by biotransformation or by sorption were measured. These results are positive, as they show that the observed removal of pharmaceutical molecules by biomass acclimated to OWW can mostly be attributed to developed biotransformation, unlike the biomass from the municipal WWTP for which sorption is sometimes the only removal mechanism. The biotransformation kinetic and the solid-water distribution coefficients in this study show good agreement with literature data, even for much higher pharmaceutical concentrations in OWW.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been used in effluent treatment in order to degrade the composites that persist in the environment even after conventional treatment. This work employs AOP (known as the photo-Fenton process) to study the degradation of the pharmaceutical acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, dipyrone and paracetamol in different effluents from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). The data collected from the different effluents, which were obtained by mean of a chromatographic analysis, showed that 3 out of the 4 pharmaceuticals analysed were detected in concentrations that ranged from 0.29mg.L-1 to 3.96mg.L-1. The photodegradation study using UV-C radiation showed that the photo-Fenton process managed to degrade between 71.9% and 100% of the pollutants. Furthermore, it promoted the conversion of 66.5% of organic material, as the lumped kinetic model satisfactorily represents the kinetics of the process. The toxicity trials verified that the photo Fenton process did not generate toxic intermediaries once the seeds had germinated.

AB In the current study a high sensitive analytical method was developed for the determination of 60 steroids including glucocorticoids (GC), mineralocorticoids (MC), and progestogens (PG) in WWTP effluents and surface water using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). The limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 0.02 ng/L (cortisone) to 0.5 ng/L (drospirenone) in surface water and from 0.05 ng/L (betamethasone) to 5 ng/L (chlormadinone) in treated wastewater. After optimization, the developed method was applied to WWTP effluents, rivers, and streams around Germany. Numerous steroids have been detected during the sampling campaign and predominant analytes from all steroid types were determined. Moreover, the occurrence of dienogest, mometasone furoate, flumethasone pivalate, and the metabolites 6 beta-hydroxy dienogest, 6 beta-hydroxy triamcinolone acetonide, 7 alpha-thiomethyl spironolactone, and 11 alpha-hydroxy canrenone is reported for the first time. In addition, this study revealed the ubiquitous presence of topically applied GC monoesters betamethasone propionate, betamethasone valerate, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone propionate in WWTP effluents and surface water.

AB Research has shown that exposure to androgens and progestogens can cause undesirable biological responses in the environment. To date, however, no detailed or direct study of their presence in wastewater treatment plants has been conducted. In this study, nine androgens, nine progestogens, and five estrogens were analyzed in influent and final effluent wastewaters in seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Beijing, China. Over a period of three weeks, the average total hormone concentrations in influent wastewaters were 3562 (Wujiacun WWTP)-5400 ng/L (Fangzhuang WWTP). Androgens contributed 96% of the total hormone concentrations in all WWTP influents, with natural androgen (androsterone: 2977 739 ng/L; epiandrosterone: 640 +/- 263 ng/L; and androstenedione: 270 +/- 132 ng/L) being the predominant compounds. The concentrations of synthetic progestogens (megestrol acetate: 41 25 ng/L; norethindrone: 6.5 +/- 3.3 ng/L; and medroxyprogesterone acetate: 6.0 +/- 3.2 ng/L) were comparable to natural ones (progesterone: 66 36 ng/L; 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-progegnen-3-one: 4.9 +/- 1.2 ng/L; 21 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone: 8.5 +/- 3.0 ng/L; and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone: 1.5 +/- 0.95 ng/L), probably due to the wide and relatively large usage of synthetic progestogens in medical therapy. In WWTP effluents, androgens were still the dominant class accounting for 60% of total hormone concentrations, followed by progestogens (24%), and estrogens (16%). Androstenedione and testosterone were the main androgens detected in all effluents. High removal efficiency (91-100%) was found for androgens and progestogens compared with estrogens (67-80%), with biodegradation the major removal route in WWTPs. Different profiles of progestogens in the receiving rivers and WWTP effluents were observed, which could be explained by the discharge of a mixture of treated and untreated wastewater into the receiving rivers.

AB This article describes the development of an enhanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the analysis of a selected group of 57 organic contaminants in wastewater This. group comprises 39 pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutical classes and 10 of their most frequent metabolites. Six pesticides and two disinfectants were also included. The LC-MS method was developed using a hybrid quad rupole/linearion trap (Q TRAP) analyzer operating in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode (in both positive and negative electrospray ionization) in combination with a time-of flight (TOF) mass analyser. The application of both techniques provided very good results in terms of accurate quantification and unequivocal identification. Quantification was based on the use of a linearly accelerating (LINAC) high-pressure collision cell, which enable the analysis of a high number of compounds with enough acquisition data points for an optimal peak definition in SRM. Unequivocal identification was provided by the acquisition of at least two SRM transitions and by obtaining accurate mass measurements of the identified compounds with errors lower than 2 ppm. As an alternative for compounds where a second transition cannot be detected by Q-Trap-MS, the application of survey scans in enhanced product ion (EPI) was evaluated.
   The analytical performance of the method was evaluated in effluent wastewater samples. Linearity of response over three orders of magnitude was demonstrated (R-2 > 0.99 for most compounds). matrix effects resulting in suppression of the response were frequently observed, between 2-50% for most of compounds, except 4-DAA and 4-AA, which exhibit higher values (68%). Signal enhancement was also detected in 16 compounds. Method limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.1-50 ng L-1. Finally, the methodology was successfully applied to the evaluation of the efficiency of two ozone-based treatments applied to the effluent from the secondary clarifier of a municipal wastewater treatment facility. Preliminary results are presented demonstrating that ozonation of wastewaters degrade pharmaceuticals with a high efficiency. Removals higher than 90% were reached for most of target analytes.

AB The present study examines the contribution of combined sewer overflows (CSO) to loads and concentrations of trace contaminants in receiving surface water. A simple method to assess the ratio of CSO to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents was applied to the urban River Spree in Berlin, Germany. The assessment indicated that annual loads are dominated by CSO for substances with removal in WWTP above similar to 95%. Moreover, it showed that substances with high removal in WWTP can lead to concentration peaks in the river during CSO events. The calculated results could be verified based on eight years of monitoring data from the River Spree, collected between 2000 and 2007. Substances that are well removed in WWTP such as NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) were found to occur in significantly increased concentration during CSO, while the concentration of substances that are poorly removable in WWTP such as EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) decreased in CSO-influenced samples due to dilution effects. The overall results indicate the potential importance of the CSO pathway of well-removable sewage-based trace contaminants to rivers. In particular, high concentrations during CSO events may be relevant for aquatic organisms. Given the results, it is suggested to include well-removable, sewage-based trace contaminants, a substance group often neglected in the past, in future studies on urban rivers in case of combined sewer systems. The presented methodology is suggested for a first assessment, since it is based solely on urban drainage data, which is available in most cities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stability of the selected urinary biomarkers of six illicit drugs and two therapeutic opioids in municipal wastewater was studied in order to determine errors associated with their possible transformation in the sewer. The stability was assessed in experiments conducted at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C in order to simulate typical winter and summer temperature conditions in the sewer system. Among fourteen substances tested, the most unstable compounds were morphine-3-beta-D glucuronide (MG), 6-acetyl morphine (6-AM), cocaine (COC) and 6-acetyl codeine (6-AC), while all other investigated compounds appeared to be relatively stable over a period of 72 h. The transformation of all degradable compounds followed pseudo-first order kinetics with significantly longer half-times (t(1/2)) at winter conditions. At 20 degrees C, t(1/2) of MG, 6-AM, COC and 6-AC was 7 h, 87 h, 35 h and 58 h, respectively, while the corresponding tip, values at 10 degrees C were 18 h, 139 h, 173 h and 87 h. The main transformation mechanism of MG, 6-AM and 6-AC was most probably their enzymatic hydrolysis to morphine (MOR) and codeine (COD), while COC transformation to benzoylecgonine (BE) was primarily governed by chemical hydrolysis. The results indicate that the effect of the observed transformation of urinary biomarkers of COC and 6-AM on the estimates of COC and heroin consumption are relatively small (<10%) if the in-sewer hydraulic retention time is lower than 12 h. Acidification of the wastewater samples proved to be the good way to stabilise the wastewater samples for the analysis of all selected compounds, except for I 1-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). This finding should be taken into account when selecting the preservation technique for multiresidual analyses of different groups of illicit drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban surface waters face several stressors associated with industry and urban water management. Over much of the past century, the wastewater treatment in Berlin, Germany, relied on inefficient sewage farms, which resulted in severe eutrophication and sediment contamination in the recipient surface waterbodies. A prominent example is Lake Tegel, where a multitude of management measures were applied in the last decades for the purpose of ecosystem restoration. In this study, we analyzed sediment cores of three lakes with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy: Lake Tegel, Lake Groer Wannsee, which is environmentally similar but has a different management history, and Lake Userin, which serves as a reference located in a nature protection area. Multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and self-organizing maps) were used to assess the sediment quality and to reconstruct the management history of Lake Tegel. Principal component analysis established two main gradients of sediment composition: heavy metals and lithogenic elements. The impact of the management measures was visualized in the lake sediment composition changing from high abundance of heavy metals and reducing redox conditions to less-impacted sediments in recent layers. The clustering techniques suggested heterogeneity among sites within Lake Tegel that probably reflect urban water management measures. The abundance of heavy metals in recent lake sediments of Lake Tegel is similar to a lake with low urban impact and is lower than in Lake Groer Wannsee suggesting that the management measures were successful in the reduction of heavy metals, which are still a threat for surface waters worldwide.

AB This article presents the most popular methods of sewage sludge management and analytical techniques which could be a powerful tool in designing new sewage sludge management methods. Chemical analysis is also described as a vital point at the subsequent stages of technological processes control and sewage sludge quality assessment. It is also an instrument essential to maintaining control of processed sewage sludge introduced to the environment as ready-to-use materials. The sludge management method is conditioned by the compliance with legal acts concerning sludge management. The most important of these contain information regarding allowable concentrations of pollutants which can be released into the environment, and the most important declarations concerning sewage sludge management. Various analytical techniques and preparation methods that can be used during the monitoring of the managed and processed sewage sludge are described. The most important are chromatographic techniques, methods based on inductively coupled plasma, and mass spectrometry based methods.

AB Parabens (p-hydroxy benzoic acid esters) are antimicrobial agents, used widely as preservatives in personal care products (PCPs), pharmaceuticals, foods, and beverages. PCPs that contain parabens are a major source of these chemicals in sewage treatment plants (STPs). Very few studies have demonstrated the occurrence of parabens in wastewater. In this study, the occurrence and fate of six parabens, methyl-(MeP), ethyl-(EtP), propyl-(PrP), butyl-(BuP), hepty-(HpP) and benzyl-(BzP) parabens, and five of their metabolites (4-HB, 3,4-DHB, OH-MeP, OH-EtP and BA) were studied in five STPs in India. The concentrations of parent parabens (E(6)parent parabens) in five STPs ranged between 131 and 920 ng/L in influent; 16 and 67 ng/L in effluent; and 104 and 1090 ng/g, dry weight, in sludge samples. The sum concentrations of five paraben metabolites (E(5)paraben metabolites) in five STPs ranged between 4110 and 34,600 ng/L in influent; 2560 and 3800 ng/L in effluent; and 1220 and 35,900 ng/g, dry weight, in sludge samples. These values were higher than those reported for many industrialized countries. We calculated the mass loadings, removal efficiencies, and environmental emissions of parabens based on the measured concentrations in influents, effluents, and sludge. The mean removal efficiencies of parent parabens and their metabolites ranged from 80% to 100% and 28% to 76%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the scientific community has focused and prioritised research on "emerging pollutants". The term "emerging pollutants" stands for the substances that are released in the environment for which currently no regulations are established for their environmental monitoring. Their occurrence is reported worldwide in a range of aquatic environments, such as lakes, rivers, freshwater catchments, estuaries, reservoirs and marine waters. Nevertheless, due to their large number (ranging in an order of thousands), only few of these compounds are toxicologically evaluated. Published data concerning occurrence and potential toxicological effects is limited. The contamination source of the aquatic environment is mainly the effluents from the sewage treatment plants (STPs). Reliable methods are available for residue analysis of these pollutants down to low ng L-1 levels. However, an urgent need is highlighted for the investigation (primarily in environmental media and following in biological ones) of the toxicity and transformation pathways of all emerging pollutants. The aims of this mini-review are to briefly present: (a) the major classes of emerging pollutants; (b) the reasons why these substances constitute an environmental issue; and (c) developments and applications of environmental analysis in this field.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in the aquatic environment has become well established, and their presence is of potential concern because they are designed to produce biological response in the target receptor, may bear intrinsic toxicity (e.g. cytostatic agents, antibiotics) and they possess the potential to foster and maintain drug resistance. For both risk assessment and risk management purposes, it is important to identify the major sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Healthcare facilities may be major sources of the discharges of these compounds into municipal sewers. In this study, we investigated the contributions to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from two hospitals and two long-term care homes of nine compounds. Twenty-four hour composite samples were collected over 5 consecutive days from the effluents of these facilities. The WWTPs receiving sewage from these facilities were also sampled on the same days to facilitate mass balance calculations. The results showed that the healthcare facilities contributed a greater proportion of the antibiotic compounds to the WWTPs than the other target compounds; with maximum contributions of ciprofloxacin by hospitals and long-term care homes of 26.7 and 37%, respectively.

AB Pharmaceutical products (PPs) are consumed worldwide and are continuously released into hydrological environments, but are not efficiently removed by sewage treatment plants. Their occurrence within the dissolved phase has been extensively studied, but only a few articles concern solid matrices. The mechanisms and extent of sorption depend on the properties of both the molecules (degradability, charge, hydrophobicity) and the matrices (clay content, organic matter content), making the spatio-temporal distribution of PPs in natural environments complex and poorly elucidated. To improve our understanding of PP distribution at a catchment scale, this study investigated different groups of molecules with varying solubility and charges, in water, suspended particulate matter, bed-load and pond sediments. The Egoutier stream, which collects the sewage effluents from two health institutions sewage effluents, is a good candidate for this investigation. Results indicate that PP occurrences in the different particulate compartments were mainly regulated by their wastewater occurrences and charges. Particulate phases all along the Egoutier stream were characterized by a limited clay content (i.e. less than 1%) and significant organic carbon content (i.e. between 0.3% and 18.0%) favouring non-specific adsorption. Therefore, neutral PPs, exhibiting higher discharge rates, persistence and hydrophobicities in comparison with cationic and anionic molecules, were the most abundant PPs in the particulate phases of this catchment. In bed-load sediments, global PP spatial distributions reflected discharge sites and sedimentary accumulation zones, mostly that of organic matter. Spatial distributions of the more hydrophobic and persistent PP in the particulate phases thus followed the stream sedimentary dynamic. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, we have evaluated the occurrence and distribution of 78 pharmaceuticals in different aquatic marine environments from the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain) for the first time. The obtained results revealed that pharmaceuticals were present in seawater at total concentrations ranging 61-2133 and 16-189 ng L-1 in coastal and oceanic transects, respectively. Potential marine pollution hotspots were observed in enclosed or semi-enclosed water bodies (Cadiz Bay), showing concentrations that were one or two orders of magnitude higher than in the open ocean. The presence of these chemicals in local sewage treatment plants (STPs), one of the main contamination sources, was also assessed, revealing total concentrations of up to 23 mu g L-1 in effluents. PhACs with the highest detection frequencies and concentrations in the sampling region were analgesics and anti-inflammatories followed by antibiotics in the case of samples from Cadiz Bay or caffeine in oceanic seawater samples. Risk quotients, expressed as ratios between the measured environmental concentration (MEC) and the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) were higher than 1 for two compounds (gemfibrozil and ofloxacin) in effluent of Jerez de la Frontera sewage treatment plant (STP). No high environmental risk was detected in both coastal and oceanic sampling areas, although the information available about the effects of these chemicals on marine biota is still very limited and negative effects on non-target species cannot be discarded.

AB Sorption isotherms of Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC), pharmaceutical granules, PolyEtherBlocAmide (PEBA) membrane and sewage sludges were measured at various temperatures using three different experimental gravimetric methods: the saturated salt method, the Dynamic Vapor System (DVS) apparatus and a simultaneous gravimetric and calorimetric measurement techniques using a Setaram TGA-DSC111. A comparison between the salts method and DVS is proposed at ambient temperature for the MCC, the pharmaceutical granules and the PEBA membrane. The comparison between the static method and the DVS shows that the results are consistent as long as the apparent moisture content in the material is high. When the apparent diffusion coefficient becomes low, the difficulty to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium appears in the saturated salts method. Then, DVS and TGA-DSC apparatus were used to investigate the desorption isotherms for the MCC between the ambient temperature and 90degreesC. Finally, an application on biological products is proposed: the desorption isotherms for two sewage sludges coming from the same wastewater treatment plant were determined with the DVS and the TGA-DSC equipments at 45degreesC. The accuracy of the TGA-DSC is good as long as the apparent diffusion coefficient is above 10(-9) m(2)/s. When this threshold value is overstepped, the desorption isotherms are overestimated.

AB At the end of August 2019, in Warsaw, the sewage collection system of the Wastewater Treatment Plant malfunctioned. During the subsequent 12 days, over 3.6 million m(3) of untreated sewage was introduced from the damaged collector directly into the Vistula River. It is one of the biggest known failures of its kind in the world so far. In this study we investigated to what extent the incident contributed to the increased discharge of anti-inflammatory drugs into the environment. The study covered the section from the point of discharge to the city of Torun (ca. 170 km downstream). It was found that in the river waters downstream of the damaged collector, the concentrations of selected pharmaceuticals increased considerably in comparison with the waters upstream of the collector. The highest concentrations were observed for paracetamol (102.9 mu g/L), ibuprofen (5.3 mu g/L) and diclofenac (4.8 mu g/L). We also measured to what extent and at what rate these pollutants were distributed along the river. The effects of the incident were observed in further parts of the river after 16 days. In the study we also detected elevated concentrations of ibuprofen and diclofenac in the bottom sediments collected 6 weeks after the failure. Measurements of the levels of pharmaceuticals in estuarial and marine waters in the vicinity of the mouth of the Vistula River indicate that the incident did not significantly increase the load of these pollutants in the waters of the southern Baltic Sea.

AB The occurrence of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) was investigated in the six sewage treatment plants (STPs) of Beijing, China. Of the 13 objective antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine and sulfamethizol were detected in the influents with the average concentrations of 1.2 +/- 0.45, 0.29 +/- 0.25, 0.048 +/- 0.012, 0.35 +/- 0.52 and 0.33 +/- 0.21 mu g center dot L-1, respectively, and those in the effluents were 1.4 +/- 0.74, 0.22 +/- 0.19, 0.021 +/- 0.008, 0.22 +/- 0.21and 0.01 +/- 0 mu g center dot L-1, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole was the predominant compound detected, and was found in all wastewater samples with the other two compounds sulfapyridine and sulfamerazine. It should be noted that sulfadiazine was first reported in wastewaters, and the concentration levels of all detected compounds except for sulfamethizol (detected once in the effluent samples) in the influents were observed to be similar to those in the effluents. From the data in this study, it can be found that sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine and sulfadiazine could be partly removed in anoxic and aerobic treatment unit and vice versa in anaerobic process, which led to their low or even negative removal rates in the effluents. The increase on the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine in the effluents was found probably due to the biotransformation of their acetylated forms in anaerobic treatment unit. In addition, it was observed that the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine could partly occur during the anoxic and aerobic process, while sulfamerazine was partly eliminated in the anaerobic and anoxic units.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as an emerging class of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we conducted the first nationwide survey to understand the distribution and environmental risk of 72 PPCPs in surface waterways of Sri Lanka. Forty-one out of 72 targeted compounds were detected with total concentrations ranging between 5.49 and 993 ng/L in surface waterways in Sri Lanka. The highest level of PPCP contamination was detected in an ornamental fish farm. Sulfamethoxazole was found with the highest concentration (934 ng/L) followed by N,N-diethyl-meta-oluamide (202 ng/L) and clarithromydn (119 ng/L). Didofenac, mefenamic add, ibuprofen, trimethoprim, and erythromycin were detected ubiquitously throughout the country. Our data revealed that hospital and domestic wastewater, and aquaculture activities potentially contribute to the presence of PPCPs in Sri Lankan waterways. The calculated risk quotients indicated that several locations face medium to high ecological risk to aquatic organisms from ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, didofenac, mefenamic acid, tramadol, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tridocarban, and tridosan. The aforementioned compounds could affect aquatic organisms from different trophic levels like algae, crustacean and fish, and also influence the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. These findings emphasize that a wide variety of pharmaceuticals have become pervasive environmental contaminants in the country. This data will serve to expand the inventory of global PPCP pollution. Further monitoring of PPCPs is needed in Sri Lanka in order to identify PPCP point sources and to implement strategies for contaminant reduction in wastewater to protect the aquatic ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.

AB Endocrine active contaminants (EACs) in environmental samples can pose a range of toxicological threats to ecosystems, especially through their impacts on reproductive pathways mediated by the estrogen receptor. The physicochemical properties of known organic EACs vary greatly and typically require different sample preparation techniques to identify different classes of compounds. EAC sources are similarly diverse, including both endogenous compounds and anthropogenic chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and their transformation products, which are often disposed of to sewers at their end of use. Looking for EACs in sewage sludge proposes a bottom-up, or end-of-use and treatment approach to discover environmentally relevant EACs, since many EACs accumulate in sludges even after application of robust wastewater treatment processes. This study demonstrates an extraction and analytical method capable of detecting a broad spectrum of known and suspected EACs via High Resolution Liquid Chromatography Quadropole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) suspect screening of fourteen California sewage sludge samples. Spike-recovery experiments were performed using twelve carefully selected surrogates to assess different extraction solvents, sample weights, extraction pH values, procedures for combining extracts with different extraction pH's, and solid phase extraction cartridges. Using LC-QTOF-MS, identifications of several other organic compounds in the samples were made, a goal unachievable with unit resolution mass spectrometry. Suspect screening of California sludge samples discovered 118 compounds including hormones, pharmaceuticals, phosphate flame retardants, recreational drugs, antimicrobials, and pesticides. Additionally, 22 of these identified compounds are predicted to interfere with estrogen receptors or other reproductive/developmental pathways based on the VEGA QSAR toxicity prediction model.

AB Pharmaceuticals and contrast media have been detected in hospital effluents, sewage treatment plants, surface water, and ground water. Only little is known about their elimination during sewage treatment and effects of possible biotransformation products against bacteria. The modified Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT, OECD 302 B) and a test simulating biological sewage treatment (modified OECD 303 A test) were used to assess the biodegradability of the widely used ionic iodinated contrast agent diatrizoic acid (diatrizoate). Effects against sewage sludge bacteria were studied in the two test systems by monitoring the biomarkers quinones, polyamines, phospholipids and adenosine triphosphate. Diatrizoate was biotransformed into 2,4,6-triiodo-3,5-diamino-benzoic acid in the ZWT. 2,4,6-Triiodo-3,5-diamino-benzoic acid was stable under the test conditions of the ZWT. Diatrizoate was not eliminated in the OECD 303 A simulation test. It was not adsorbed by the sewage sludge. No effects of the test compound or its aerobic transformation products against the bacteria present in the sewage sludge were detected using phospholipids, quinones, polyamines, and adenosine triphosphate as biomarkers.

AB Norfloxacin is often found in wastewater treatment plants, groundwater, and even drinking water causing environmental concerns because of its potential undesirable effects on human health or aquatic ecosystems. However, conventional treatments cannot deal with norfloxacin efficiently. This work proposes an efficiently enzymatic degradation of norfloxacin by chloroperoxidase (CPO). 82.18% degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was achieved after 25 min reaction time at pH 5.0 with an enzyme concentration of 1.5 x 10(-9) mol L-1. HPLC-MS was used to determine the intermediates or final products. The product analysis and determination of the chemical oxygen demand indicated if the enzymatic degradation by CPO was carried out before the usually existing bioremediation techniques (usually activated sludge) in sewage treatment plant, the effluent containing norfloxacin can be decontaminated more efficiently and thoroughly than that only by activated sludge treatment. The eco-toxicity tests using a green algae, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, indicated that the toxicity of degraded products of norfloxacin was lower than the parent norfloxacin molecule. CPO-catalyzed degradation of norfloxacin is a promising alternative for treating effluent containing norfloxacin.

The pharmaceutical reacted in 1 h yielding three products that were separated by chromatographic techniques and characterized by spectroscopic features. Two unusual products 2-(4-(3-(chloro(2-chloropropan-2-yl)amino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and 2-(4-(3-formamido-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide were obtained along with 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide. When the reaction was stopped at shorter times only 2-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and the dichlorinated product were detected. Tests performed on the seeds of Lactuca sativa show that chlorinated products have phytotoxic activity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, removal efficiency and seasonal variation of 22 antibiotics, including eight fluoroquinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, were investigated in eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Beijing, China. A total of 14 antibiotics were detected in wastewater samples, with the maximum concentration being 3.1 ug L-1 in the influent samples and 1.2 mu g L-1 in the effluent samples. The most frequently detected antibiotics were ofloxacin, norfloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and roxithromycin; of these, the concentration of ofloxacin was the highest in most of the influent and effluent samples. Eighteen antibiotics were detected in the sludge samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10(-1) to 2.1 x 104 mu g kg(-1). The dominant antibiotics found in the sludge samples were the fluoroquinolones, with ofloxacin having the highest concentration in all the sludge samples. The antibiotics could not be removed completely by the STPs, and the mean removal efficiency ranged from -34 to 72%. Of all the antibiotics, the fluoroquinolones were removed comparatively more efficiently, probably due to their adsorption to sludge. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in the sludge samples was also studied. The concentrations of antibiotics in winter were higher than in spring and autumn. Since the total levels of the fluoroquinolones detected in the influent samples were lower than the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 8.0 mu g L-1, the residues of these antibiotics would be unlikely to have adverse effects on microorganisms involved in sewage treatment processes.

AB A portion of administered pharmaceuticals are excreted unmetabolised by patients and can be found in hospital effluent and municipal sewage. Some pharmaceuticals such as anti-tumour agents are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and fetotoxic. Little is known about their environmental impact. Therefore, the biodegradability of the widely used anti-tumour agent ifosfamide (IF) was assessed with the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B) and a test simulating biological sewage treatment. The biodegradation was monitored by DOC and GC/MS. The concentration of IF in hospital effluent, communal sewage and the effluent from a communal sewage treatment plant (STP) was analysed as well as calculated by the amounts of water and IF used in hospitals. The expected concentration of IF in German surface waters was calculated. IF was not biodegradable in the Zahn-Wellens test and the STP simulation test. It was not adsorbed by the sewage sludge. The concentrations measured in the hospital effluents, the STP influent and the STP effluent were of the same order of magnitude as the calculated ones, indicating that no adsorption, biodegradation or other elimination of IF took place to any noticeable extent.

AB The quality of anaerobic sludge and struvite from black water treatment system, aerobic sludge from grey water treatment system and effluents of both systems was assessed for organic micropollutant content in order to ensure safety when reusing these products. Use of anaerobic black water sludge and struvite as soil amendments is recommended based on the low micropollutant content. Aerobic grey water sludge is recommended for disposal, because of the relatively high micropollutant concentrations, exceeding those in sewage sludge. Effluents of black and grey water treatment systems require post-treatment prior to reuse, because the measured micropollutant concentrations in the effluents are above ecotoxicological thresholds.

AB The occurrence of twenty pharmaceutical compounds was quantitatively determined in effluents from two major Oslo city hospitals, Rikshospitalet and Ulleval, along with influent, sludge and final effluent from the city's VEAS wastewater treatment works ( WTW). Composite hospital effluents were collected over a twelve week period and were showed to contain paracetamol, metoprolol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, 17 beta-Estradiol, estriol, estrone, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, doxycycline, chlorotetracycline, demeclocycline, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Three pharmaceuticals were not detected above the limit of detection; cefuroxime, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and meclocycline. Composite influent, sludge and effluent samples were collected from VEAS WTW over a seven week period. The influent into VEAS WTW contained all of the same selected substances detected in the hospital effluents, except for oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline, demeclocycline, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. The percentage of pharmaceuticals entering the works from the hospitals was <10% for all of the selected compounds. VEAS sludge samples contained a different pro. le of substances reflecting their physico-chemical properties. Hydrophobic antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, were detected in all of the collected sludge samples. Their absence in the collected influent samples suggests that they enter the works bound to effluent particles, with the dissolved fraction observed in the hospital effluents partitioning onto particulate matter within the sewerage network. The final effluent from VEAS WTW contained reduced concentrations of many pharmaceuticals, including paracetamol, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. For other compounds, such as metoprolol, diclofenac and trimethoprim, there were often higher concentrations in the effluent than the influent. These effluent concentrations represent median inputs varying from low g day(-1) ( e. g. paracetamol and ibuprofen) to nearly 200 g day(-1) ( e. g. metoprolol and trimethoprim) into Oslofjord. A simple risk assessment showed that the antibiotic ciprofloxacin may at times pose an acute risk to the Oslofjord aquatic environment.

AB Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an antimicroibial disinfectant agent used in a wide array of consumer products. An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by reverse phase, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization (negative)-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-EST(-)-MS/MS; in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode) was developed, optimized and validated for the determination of triclosan in wastewater/sewage treatment plant (WSTP) effluent and surface waters from the upper Detroit River (Canada). The mean recoveries ( +/-%RSD) of triclosan and the internal standard 2-HO-tlibromodiphenyl ether (2'-HO-BDE-28) spiked to surface water and WSTP effluent samples ranged similarly from 104 +/- 8% and 91 +/- 10%, respectively, and method limits of quantification were in the low ppb/high ppt range. However, ESI(-) enhancement was found for both analytes due to sample matrix effects, as indicated by % process efficiencies (a measure of ESI(-) enhancement/suppression), which were in the 111-128% range. We report the first known assessment of triclosan in the Detroit River watershed of the Great Lakes, which preliminarily examined the presence and UV-treatment effects on triclosan in effluent from the major WSTP serving the City of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and fate in surface waters of the upper Detroit River. Triclosan in WSTP effluent decreased 22% after final UV treatment to a mean concentration of 63 ng/L. Concentrations were further reduced to 4 and 8 ng/L (a > 90% reduction) in surface water samples from sites downstream on the Canadian shoreline of the Detroit River, which was due to dilution. Two hydroxylated tribrominated diphenyl ethers, which are structurally similar to triclosan, were also detected in WSTP effluent and surface water samples. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to a widespread usage and a lack of biodegradability, Synthetic Musk Compounds (SMC) can be found as ubiquitous environmental pollutants, which enter the environment especially via domestic wastewater. We investigated the occurrence and fate of six Polycyclic and two Nitro Musk Compounds in water and sediment samples from 13 locations along the river Saale in the municipal area of Halle (Saale), Germany on a monthly basis for one year. Sample analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and Galaxolide (R) (HHCB) was by far the most abundant analyte in all water samples. The remaining substances could be detected at least once, but mostly in concentrations below their respective Limits of Quantification. Highest concentrations for all detected compounds were determined in final effluent of the local sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on statistical analysis of the data obtained, a second, much smaller emission source could be identified in the examined area. In sediment samples five out of eight analytes could be detected. The analyte contents were very variable, depending on the sediment's character.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their transformation products (TPs) have been generally detected in the aquatic environment. They threaten human health and increase environmental risk, but knowledge on their fate and attenuation in environmental ecosystems is still lacking. In this study, 13 parent pharmaceuticals and 8 of their TPs in wastewater containing rivers were investigated. We detected all of the compounds except carboxyibuprofen and sulfacetamide in at least one site in all sampling points and found that sewage treatment plants were the principal source of these substances. The majority of parent pharmaceuticals were attenuated in Yangtze River and Qinhuai River, but only a small number were attenuated in the Yunliang River. All detected TPs except 4-chlorobenzoic acid were attenuated in the three rivers. Photodegradation, sorption to sediments, and biotransformation may be important attenuation processes for these substances. We found the largest extent of attenuation in the Yangtze River, where conditions for attenuation were most favorable. Extents of attenuation values for some substances obtained by active and passive sampling were roughly the same; thus, using a polar organic chemical integrative sampler may be an appropriate method for determining the extent of attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.
