AB The present paper reports a detailed study that is based on the monitoring of naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in Mbokodweni River and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located around the city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Target compounds were extracted from water samples using a multi-template molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction prior to separation and quantification on a high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photo diode array detector. The analytical method yielded the detection limits of 0.15, 1.00, and 0.63 mu g/L for naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, respectively. Solid-phase extraction method was evaluated for its performance using deionized water samples that were spiked with 5 and 50 mu g/L of target compounds. Recoveries were greater than 80% for all target compounds with RSD values in the range of 4.1 to 10%. Target compounds were detected in most wastewater and river water samples with ibuprofen being the most frequently detected pharmaceutical. Maximum concentrations detected in river water for naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac were 6.84, 19.2, and 9.69 mu g/L, respectively. The concentrations of target compounds found in effluent and river water samples compared well with some studies. The analytical method employed in this work is fast, selective, sensitive, and affordable; therefore, it can be used routinely to evaluate the occurrence of acidic pharmaceuticals in South African water resources.

AB Ambient temperature is known to have impact on population health but assessing its impact by the traditional cohort approach is resource intensive. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) could be an alternative for the traditional approach. This study was to provide the first evaluation to see if WBE can be used to assess the impact of temperature exposure to a population in South East Queensland, Australia using selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as biomarkers. Daily loads of eight PPCPs in wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment plant were measured from February 2011 to June 2012. Corresponding daily weather data were obtained from the closest weather station. Missing data of PPCPs were handled using the multiple imputation (MI) method, then we used a one-way between-groups analysis of variance to examine the seasonal effect on daily variation of PPCP5 by seasons. Finally, an MI estimate was performed to evaluate the continuous relationship between daily average temperature and each multiply-imputed PPCP using time-series regression analysis. The results indicated that an increase of 1 C in average temperature associated with decrease at 1.3 g/d (95% CI: -2.2 to ( -0.4), p < 0.05) for atenolol, increase at 36.5 g/d (95% CI: 25.2-47.8, p < 0.01) for acesulfame, and increase at 0.8 g/d (95% CI: 0.02-1.55, p = 0.05) for naproxen. No significant association was observed between temperature and the remaining PPCP5, comprising: caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, hydrochlorothiazide, and salicylic acid. The findings suggested that consumption of sweetened drinks, risk of worsening cardiovascular conditions and pains are associated with variation in ambient temperature. WBE can thus be used as a complementary method to traditional cohort studies in epidemiological evaluation of the association between environmental factors and health outcomes provided that specific biomarkers of such health outcomes can be identified.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is an antibacterial agent found in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). It is potentially bioaccumulative and an endocrine disruptor, being classified as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC). In normal uses, approximately 96% of the used TCC can be washed down the drain going into the sewer system and eventually enter in the aquatic environment. UV photolysis can be used to photodegrade TCC and ecotoxicity assays could indicate the photodegradation efficiency, since the enormous structural diversity of photoproducts and their low concentrations do not always allow to identify and quantify them. In this work, the TCC was efficiently degraded by UVC direct photolysis and the ecotoxicity of the UV-treated mixtures was investigated. Bioassays indicates that Daphnia similis (48 h EC50 = 0.044 mu M) was more sensitive to TCC than Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (72 h IC50 = 1.01 mu M). TCC and its photoproducts caused significant effects on Eisenia andrei biochemical responses (catalase and glutathione-S-transferase); 48 h was a critical exposure time, since GST reached the highest activity values. UVC reduced the TCC toxic effect after 120 min. Furthermore, TCC was photodegraded in domestic wastewater which was simultaneously disinfected for total coliform bacterial (TCB) (360 min) and Escherichia coli (60 min).

AB In the recent years, residual antibiotics are considered to be emerging environmental pollutants due to their continuous input and persistence into the aquatic ecosystem even at low concentrations. Therefore, these are necessary to develop efficient methods for the wastewater treatment. The present paper describes the efficiency of several types of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for the retention of the selected antibiotics (ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, piperacillin, tazobactam, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and thrimetoprim) from aqueous (synthetic) solutions and wastewater samples. The functionalized MWCNTs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained antibiotic percentage of retention was evaluated by quantitative assessment using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with the diode array, fluorescence, and mass spectrometer detector (HPLC-DAD/FD/MS), after the solid-phase extraction (SPE) with Oasis HLB cartridges. The retention percentages of the selected antibiotics from waters ranged between similar to 40 and 97%, with the exception of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The best percentages of retention were obtained for norfloxacin 97.03% and ciprofloxacin 97.10%. The suspensions of the MWCNTs improved the antibiotics removal from wastewaters. Removal of antibiotics from wastewaters using nanotechnology, in order to reduce their negative effects and antibiotic resistance, is a promising tool in the future wastewaters treatment.

AB In this study, the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 31 antibiotics, including 11 sulfonamides (SAs), five fluoroquinolones (FQs), four macrolides (MLs), four tetracyclines (TCs), three chloramphenicols (CAPs), and four other antibiotics (Others), were investigated in 12 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Dalian, China. A total of 29 antibiotics were detected in wastewater samples with the concentration ranging from 63.6 to 5404.6 ng/L. FQs and SAs were the most abundant antibiotic classes in most wastewater samples, accounting for 42.2 and 23.9% of total antibiotic concentrations, respectively, followed by TCs (16.0%) and MLs (14.8%). Sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were the most frequently detected antibiotics; of these, the concentration of ofloxacin was the highest in most of influent (average concentration = 609.8 ng/L) and effluent (average concentration = 253.4 ng/L) samples. The removal efficiencies varied among WWTPs in the range of -189.9% (clarithromycin) to 100% (enoxacin, doxycycline, etc), and more than 50% of antibiotics could not be efficiently removed with the removal efficiency less than 65%. An environmental risk assessment was also performed in the WWTP effluents by calculating the risk quotient (RQ), and high RQ values (> 1) indicated erythromycin and clarithromycin might cause the ecological risk on organisms in surrounding water near discharge point of WWTPs in this area, which warrants further attention.

Ferrate.VI) had the highest reactivity with CIP, with a second-order rate constant of 89 +/- 2 M-1 s(-1) at pH 10.3 +/- 0.3. The rate constants of ferrate.VI) with MET and CBZ under the same conditions were 3.7 +/- 0.3 M-1 s(-1) and 13.1 +/- 0.8 M-1 s(-1), respectively, while no reaction took place with OH-IBU. We also evaluated the removal efficiencies of nine selected pharmaceuticals, including MET, CBZ, CIP and OH-IBU, detected in a real hospital wastewater (HWW) with concentrations ranging from 73 +/- 4 ng L-1 to 159 +/- 8 mu g L-1 by applying Fe.VI) technology. The abatement of the targeted pharmaceuticals depends on their structures. Because Fe.VI) captures electrons during the oxidation process, we proposed to correlate the reactivity of Fe.VI) with the first ionization potential (IP) of the pharmaceuticals. The first IP values of MET, CBZ, CIP, OH-IBU and diclofenac (DFC) were determined by gas-phase UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UV-PES). The UV-PES data were also interpreted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

AB The behavior and fate of pharmaceutical ingredients in coastal marine ecosystems are not well understood. To address this, the spatial and temporal distribution of 15 high-volume pharmaceuticals were measured over a 1-yr period in Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) to elucidate factors and processes regulating their concentration and distribution. Dissolved concentrations ranged from below detection to 313 ng/L, with 4 pharmaceuticals present at all sites and sampling periods. Eight pharmaceuticals were present in suspended particulate material, ranging in concentration from below detection to 44 ng/g. Partitioning coefficients were determined for some pharmaceuticals, with their range and variability remaining relatively constant throughout the study. Normalization to organic carbon content provided no benefit, indicating other factors played a greater role in regulating partitioning behavior. Within the upper bay, the continuous influx of wastewater treatment plant effluents resulted in sustained, elevated levels of pharmaceuticals. A pharmaceutical concentration gradient was apparent from this zone to the mouth of the bay. For most of the pharmaceuticals, there was a strong relationship with salinity, indicating conservative behavior within the estuary. Short flushing times in Narragansett Bay coupled with pharmaceuticals' presence overwhelmingly in the dissolved phase indicate that most pharmaceuticals will be diluted and transported out of the estuary, with only trace amounts of several compounds sequestered in sediments. The present study identifies factors controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved and particulate pharmaceuticals; their partitioning behavior provides an increased understanding of their fate, including bioavailability in an urban estuary.

AB BACKGROUNDCaBi(6)O(10) nanoplates were synthesized by a sonochemical method using a high-power ultrasonic processor. Also, the CaBi6O10 was synthesized by an impregnation-calcination method in order to compare the effect of the synthesis method on the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. In addition, the role of the oxidizing species such as h(+), OH center dot, H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) was evaluated during the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and methylene blue (MB).
   RESULTSThe sample synthesized sonochemically showed a morphology of nanoplates with a thickness around 50 nm and length 1.5 mu m. Also, the sample showed the best photocatalytic activity (i.e. the sample with the highest surface area and a plate-like morphology), degrading CPFX by 56% and MB by 67%. The main species involved in the degradation of CPFX were the OH<bold> radicals</bold>, and in the degradation of MB it was H2O2.
   CONCLUSIONSCaBi6O10 nanoplates were prepared successfully by a sonochemical method, showing the best photocatalytic activity in the degradation of CPFX and MB, mainly attributed to the morphology of the nanoplates. In addition, it was observed that the main species involved in the degradation of CPFX were the OH<bold> radicals and in the degradation of MB</bold>, H2O2. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This paper provides a first review of the contamination level of emerging contaminants (ECs) in aquatic sources of India. Contaminants reported so far belong to pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs), surfactants, and phthalates. A total of 41 publications are reported with a maximum share of pesticides (57%) followed by pharmaceuticals (17%), surfactants (15%), PCPs (7%), and phthalates (5%). The concentration of detected contaminants in all aquatic sources range as not detected (ND) to 10,000 ng/L (pesticides), ND to 14 x 10(6) ng/L (pharmaceuticals), ND to 5,160 ng/L (PCPs), 1.3 x 10(6) to 6.2 x 10(6) ng/L (surfactants), and ND to 0.2 x 10(6) ng/L (phthalates). In surface water and treated wastewater, the maximum concentration of pesticides exceed their prescribed environmental quality standards. Pharmaceuticals such as cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, and citalopram are present up to 2.1 x 10(6) ng/L, 14 x 10(6) ng/L, and 0.4 x 10(6) ng/L, respectively, in treated wastewater, which is the highest measured concentration. A higher risk (hazards quotient >1) to aquatic organisms in surface water has been reported for PCPs, surfactants, and phthalates. The review can act as a framework to nurture future research and regulatory initiatives for monitoring of ECs in remaining aquatic sources. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The frequent detection of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in wastewater and surface waters gives rise of concerns about their ecotoxicological, effects and potential risks to induce antibacterial resistant genes. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/PDS) advanced oxidation processes have been demonstrated to be effective for the elimination of SMX, but there is still a need for a deeper understanding of product formations. In this study, we identified and compared the transformation products of SMX in UV, UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS processes. Because of the electrophilic nature of SO4 center dot-, the second-order rate constant for the reaction of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) with the anionic form of SMX was higher than that with the neutral form, while hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) exhibited comparable reactivity to both forms. The direct photolysis of SMX predominately occurred through cleavage of the N-S bond, rearrangement of the isoxazole ring, and hydroxylation mechanisms. Hydroxylation was the dominant pathway for the reaction of center dot OH with SMX. SO4 center dot- favored attack on -NH2 group of SMX to generate a nitro derivative and dimeric products. The presence of bicarbonate in UV/H2O2 inhibited the formation of hydroxylated products, but promoted the formation of the nitro derivative and the dimeric products. In UV/PDS, bicarbonate increased the formation of the nitro derivative and the dimeric products, but decreased the formation of the hydroxylated dimeric products. The different effect of bicarbonate on transformation products in UV/H2O2 vs. UV/PDS suggested that carbonate radical (CO3 center dot-) oxidized SMX through the electron transfer mechanism similar to SO4 center dot- but with less oxidation capacity. Additionally, SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot- exhibited higher reactivity to the oxazole ring than the isoxazole ring of SMX. Ecotoxicity of transformation products was estimated by ECOSAR program based on the quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis as well as by experiments using Vibrio fischeri, and these results indicated that the oxidation of SO4 center dot- or CO3 center dot- with SMX generated more toxic products than those of (OH)-O-center dot.

AB Membrane application in water reclamation is challenged by fouling which deteriorates membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and solute rejection. Several studies focusing on antifouling membranes incorporated with nanoparticles have been carried out, but these membranes are not yet a viable solution due to their high energy requirements and inability to completely remove or degrade trace organic compounds (TOrCs). Therefore, this study aims at fabricating polyethersulfone (PES) membranes for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by using a unique membrane synthesis approach. PES membranes were synthesised by casting two different solutions before coagulation. Therefore, the synthesis technique was called 'double-casting phase inversion'. The membranes were impregnated with nanohybrid graphene oxide-zinc oxide (GO-ZnO) to increase their hydrophilicity, rejection of pharmaceuticals (by decreasing membrane-solute hydrophobic interactions), resistance to organic fouling and photodegradation properties. The addition of GO-ZnO increased membrane hydrophilicity and pure water permeability. The rejection of TOrCs and antifouling properties were also improved due to a reduction in membrane-solute and membrane-foulant hydrophobic interactions, respectively. In addition to improved TOrC rejection properties and resistance to fouling, GO-ZnO/PES membranes degraded Brilliant Black.

AB Pharmaceutical waste sludge harbors large amounts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and it is necessary to study the reduction of ARGs and MGEs during sludge treatment. Therefore, the antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes of enterococci, and the ARGs and MGEs in genomic DNA were investigated during anaerobic digestion (AD) with microwave (MW), thermal hydrolysis (TH) and ozone pretreatment. Results showed that sludge pretreatment increased the occurrence of the resistance phenotypes and genotypes of enterococci. During AD, the resistance of enterococci to macrolides decreased, except for in the MW-pretreated sludge. Horizontal gene transfer and co-occurrence of ermB and tetM in enterococci resulted in increased tetracycline resistance of enterococci throughout the sludge treatment. MGEs such as intI1, ISCR1 and Tn916/1545 had a significant effect on the distribution of ARGs. AD with pretreatment, especially TH pretreatment, resulted in greater ARGs and MGEs reduction and improved methane production. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R-2 = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.

AB Urban rivers may receive contamination from various sources including point sources like domestic sewage and nonpoint sources (e.g., runoff), resulting in contamination with various chemicals. This study investigated the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (3 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and 17 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)) in six urban rivers of a representative subtropical city, Guangzhou (southern China). Our results showed that EDCs and personal care products were frequently detected in the water phase and sediment phase. 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) was the most predominant compound with the highest concentration of 5050 ng/L in the water phase and 14,400 ng/g dry weight (dw) in the sediment. Generally, higher total concentrations of EDCs and PPCPs were detected in the four urban streams compared to the main stream Zhujiang River and the Liuxi River at the suburb area. A screening-level risk assessment showed that 4-nonylphenol and triclosan (TCS) pose potential risks to aquatic organisms in most sampling sites. For individual taxa, 4-NP may pose risks to various groups of aquatic organisms, while TCS only might pose high risks to algae. Capsule: Higher contamination of EDCs and PPCPs was observed in rivers in urban area; 4-nonylphenol and triclosan showed RQs > 1 in >70% of the reported area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biochar was produced from the fast pyrolysis of Douglas fir (DFBC). Magnetic biochar (MDFBC) was prepared by magnetite (Fe3O4) precipitation onto the biochar's surface from an aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+ solution upon NaOH treatment. The resulting MDFBC was used to remove 4-nitroaniline (4NA), salicylic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BA) and phthalic acid (PA) from water. The surface chemistry and composition of the MDFBC were examined by SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, PZC, XPS, XRD, elemental analysis, and surface area measurements. Batch sorption studies were carried out from pH 2 to 10 and adsorbate concentrations from 25 to 500 mg/L at 15, 25, 35 and 45 degrees C. MDFBC suspensions in the contaminated solutions were vortexed for two min and then magnetically removed. Remediated solutions were then analyzed using UV Visible spectroscopy. The amounts of 4NA, SA, BA and PA adsorbed onto MDFBC was higher at low pH values and decreased with increasing pH. MDFBC sorption at 15, 25, 35 and 45 degrees C was evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, Redlich Peterson, and Toth adsorption isotherm models. Langmuir adsorption capacities at pH 5 and 45 degrees C for 4NA, SA, BA and PA were 114, 109, 90 and 86 mg/g, respectively. Thrice recycled MDFBC using extraction" with methanol (5 x 10 mL) and water (10 mL) had 90% of the original adsorption capacities for 4NA, SA, BA and PA, respectively. The adsorption kinetics of MDFBC and DFBC were far faster than four other biochars (mixed feed, magnetized mixed feed, pinewood and magnetized switchgrass) and also faster than a commercial activated carbon. Equilibrium for MDFBC and its DFBC precursor was reached within 2 min, while the other biochars took between 8 and 20 h. The fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption capacities of MDFBC could be advantageously employed in filtration devices, columns, or as shown here, in batch operations with stirring to speed adsorption, followed by magnetic separation of the adsorbent for regeneration.

AB This study covers three widely detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (NSAIDs), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX), as NSAIDs pollutants. The objective is to evaluate the impact of NSAIDs at their environmental concentrations on microbial community assembly and activity. The exposure experiments were conducted under three conditions (5 mu g L-1 DCF, 5 mu g L-1 DCF+5 mu g L-1 IBP and 5 mu g L-1 DCF+5 mu g L-1 IBP+5 mu g L-1 NPX) in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) for 130 days. Removals of COD and NH4+-N were not affected but total nitrogen (TN) removal decreased. IBP and NPX had the high removal efficiencies (79.96% to 85.64%), whereas DCF was more persistent (57.24% to 64.12%). In addition, the decreased removals of TN remained the same under the three conditions (p > 0.05). The results of oxidizing enzyme activities, live cell percentages and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) indicated that NSAIDs damaged the cell walls or microorganisms and the mixtures of the three NSAIDs increased the toxicity. The increased Shannon-Wiener diversity index suggested that bacterial diversity was increased with the addition of selected NSAIDs. Bacterial ribosomal RNA small subunit (16S) gene sequencing results indicated that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched, while Micropruina and Nakamurella decreased with the addition of NSAIDs. The enrichment of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes indicated that both of them might have the ability to degrade NSAIDs and thereby could adapt well with the presence of NSAIDs.

AB The metabolic diversity present in microbial communities enables cooperation toward accomplishing more complex tasks than possible by a single organism. Members of a consortium communicate by exchanging metabolites or signals that allow them to coordinate their activity through division of labor. In contrast with monocultures, evidence suggests that microbial consortia self-organize to form spatial patterns, such as observed in biofilms or in soil aggregates, that enable them to respond to gradient, to improve resource interception and to exchange metabolites more effectively. Current biotechnological applications of microorganisms remain rudimentary, often relying on genetically engineeredmonocultures (e.g., pharmaceuticals) ormixed-cultures of partially known composition (e.g., wastewater treatment), yet the vast potential of "microbial ecological power" observed in most natural environments, remains largely underused. In line with the Unified Microbiome Initiative (UMI) which aims to "discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems," we propose in this concept paper to capitalize on ecological insights into the spatial and modular design of interlinked microbial consortia that would overcome limitations of natural systems and attempt to optimize the functionality of the members and the performance of the engineered consortium. The topology of the spatial connections linking the various members and the regulated fluxes of media between those modules, while representing a major engineering challenge, would allow the microbial species to interact. The modularity of such spatially linked microbial consortia (SLMC) could facilitate the design of scalable bioprocesses that can be incorporated as parts of a larger biochemical network. By reducing the need for a compatible growth environment for all species simultaneously, SLMC will dramatically expand the range of possible combinations of microorganisms and their potential applications. We briefly review existing tools to engineer such assemblies and optimize potential benefits resulting from the collective activity of their members. Prospective microbial consortia and proposed spatial configurations will be illustrated and preliminary calculations highlighting the advantages of SLMC over co-cultures will be presented, followed by a discussion of challenges and opportunities for moving forward with some designs.

AB In this study, a multistage treatment system was proposed to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic amoxicillin. Ozonation (O-3), and ozonation combined with aerobic biodegradation, were performed. The real pharmaceutical wastewater presented a high concentration of organic matter (TOC: 803 mg C.L-1 and COD: 2775 mg O-2.L-1), significant amoxicillin content (50 mg L-1) and acute ecotoxicity (Aliivibrio fischeri aTU: 48.22). Ozonation proved to be effective for amoxicillin degradation (up to 99%) and the results also indicated the removal of the original colour of the wastewater, with average consumption of 1 g of ozone. However, the ozonation system alone could not achieve complete mineralization. Therefore, a combination of ozonation and biodegradation in a multistage system was proposed in order to improve cost and treatment efficiency. The multistage treatment system presented promising results, achieving degradation of more than 99% of the amoxicillin, more than 98% of the original chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 90% of initial toxicity, with the consumption of approximately 500 mg of ozone. This indicates that this system could prevent dangerous and biorecalcitrant antibiotics from entering water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Activation of H2O2 (HP) and S2O82- (PS) with zero valent aluminum (ZVA, 1 g/L) nanoparticles was investigated for the treatment of the X-ray contrast medium and micropollutant iopamidol (IOPA; C17H22I3N3O8; approximate to 777 g/mol) at pH 3. IOPA (2.6 mu M) degradation was followed in different water matrices (distilled water, tap water, raw surface water and tertiary treated sewage effluent). Both oxidants could be activated with ZVA resulting in a dramatic enhancement of IOPA degradation due to accelerated hydroxyl and sulfate radical formation. The ZVA/PS (0.5 mM) treatment was more effective than ZVA/HP (0.25 mM) oxidation resulting in 95% IOPA removal after 120 min. IOPA and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) abatements were inhibited when IOPA was treated in real water and wastewater. After 120 min treatment, IOPA removals decreased from 95% (PS/ZVA) and 41% (HP/ZVA) in distilled water to 29% (PS/ZVA) and 13% (HP/ZVA) in surface water, respectively. IOPA could not be removed with the PS/ZVA process in treated sewage, although DOC removal was still substantial (28%). For the HP/ZVA combination, 24% DOC accompanied with 20% IOPA removal was achieved after 120 min in the same wastewater sample. Changes in acute toxicity were followed during PS/ZVA treatment of IOPA in distilled and surface water. These results exhibited a fluctuating trend depending on the sensitivity of the test organism (Vibrio fischeri and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and water matrix. A genotoxic activity analysis was also conducted and the UmuChromo assay indicated that the original and treated IOPA solutions were not genotoxic but cytotoxic. The potentials and differences of PS/ZVA and HP/ZVA treatment of an iodinated contrast medium could be demonstrated in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study shows solar photo-Fenton combined with nanofiltration (NF) to treat microcontaminants (MCs) in actual MWTP effluents. Photo-Fenton was operated at circumneutral pH using (S,S)-Ethylened iamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid trisodium salt (EDDS) as the iron complexing agent (Fe:EDDS in a molar ratio of 1:2) and compared with classical photo-Fenton at pH3. Starting H2O2 concentration was 50 mg/L and Fe was 0.1 mM or 0.2 mM. MC degradation was over 90% in all cases and 35 different MCs were monitored by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry enabling the two processes to be compared under real conditions. NF pretreatment enabled photocatalysis to be run at lower flow rates and with higher starting concentrations reducing the surface area of solar collectors and reagents needed. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were also carried out before and at the end of each treatment evaluated and it seemed clear that MC degradation did not produce intermediates with any significant effect on toxicity. In addition, a detailed economic assessment was also performed. Operating costs were higher at circumneutral pH (0.76 (sic)/m(3)) with EDDS than with classical photo-Fenton at pH3 (0.48 (sic)/m(3)).

AB Atenolol is a beta-blocker drug widely consumed for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Approximately 50% of the amount ingested by humans is excreted without any change in its chemical structure. For this reason, this drug has been commonly found in many environmental matrices, like hospital wastewater. The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of atenolol in aqueous solutions by adsorption process using granular activated carbon as solid adsorbent. Adsorption experiments were performed in batch evaluating the effect of pH and contact time parameters. Kinetic of atenolol adsorption in granular activated carbon was evaluated using pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models. Equilibrium isotherms for this system were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The best results found in the adsorption experiments were pH 6, 90 min of contact time. Pseudo-second order was the kinetic model that best described the adsorption of atenolol. Under these conditions it was possible to obtain an efficiency removal of approximately 88%. Freundlich was the best model that fit the experimental data. Results indicate that the proposed process represents significant potential for removal of this contaminant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater produced in pharmaceutical manufacturing plants (PMPs), especially the one coming from organic-synthesis facilities, is characterized by its large variability due to the wide range of solvents and chemical reagents used in the different stages of the production of medicines. Normally, the toxicity of the organic compounds prevent the utilization of biological processes and more powerful treatments are needed becoming advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) a valid alternative. In this work, the efficiency in abatement of pollution by Fenton oxidation (FO) and conductive-diamond electro-oxidation (CDEO) are compared in the treatment of 60 real effluents coming from different processes carried out in a pharmaceutical facility, using standardized tests. In 80% of the samples, CDEO was found to be more efficient than FO and in the remaining 20%, coagulation was found to exhibit a great significance in the COD abatement mechanism during FO, pointing out the effectiveness of the oxidation promoted by the electrochemical technology. Mean oxidation state of carbon was found to be a relevant parameter to understand the behavior of the oxidation technologies. It varied inversely proportional to efficiency in FO and it showed practically no influence in the case of CDEO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in the Ria de Aveiro, was selected to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) at environmentally relevant concentrations. CBZ is an antiepileptic drug widely found in the aquatic environment with toxic effects to inhabiting organisms. However, few studies evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of this drug. The experiment was performed 'by exposing mussels to 0.0, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 CBZ mu g/L, for 96 h and 28 days. To assess the toxicity of the drug, a battery of biomarkers related to mussels general physiological health status and oxidative stress was applied. CBZ was quantified in mussel tissues by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results obtained show that CBZ did not induce oxidative stress. However, our findings,demonstrated that the drug was taken up by mussels even though presenting low bioconcentration factor (BCF) values (up to 2.2). Furthermore, our results demonstrated that after a chronic exposure the physiological parameters, namely the condition and gonadosomatic indices, were negatively affected which may impair organisms' reproductive capacity with consequences to population sustainability.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug
   [GRAPHIC]
   which is persistent in wastewater treatment plants and the environment. It has been frequently detected in plant material after irrigation with treated wastewater. To date, little information is, however, available on the transformation of CBZ in plants. In the present study, the uptake, translocation, and transformation of CBZ was studied in hydroponically grown tomato plants. After 35 days of exposure >80% of the total spiked amount of CBZ was taken by the tomato plants and mainly stored in the leaves. A total of 11 transformation products (TP) (mainly phase-I) were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and their total amount corresponded to 33% of the CBZ taken up. The ratio of CBZ metabolites to CBZ was highest in fruits (up to 2.5) and leaves (0.5), suggesting an intensive transformation of CBZ in these compartments. Further 10 TPs (phase-I and II) were identified by LC-high resolution mass spectrometry screening, likely comprising another 12% of CBZ. On the basis of these experiments and on an experiment with CBZ-10, 11-epoxide a transfounation pathway of CBZ in intact tomato plants is proposed that involves epoxidation, hydrolysis, hydroxylation, ring contraction, or loss of the carbamoyl group, followed by conjugation to glucose or cysteine, but also reduction of CBZ. This transformation pathway and analytical data of CBZ transformation products allow for their determination also in field grown vegetable and for the generation of more accurate exposure data of consumers of vegetable irrigated with treated municipal wastewater.

AB CWPO has proved to be effective for the treatment of representative pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, metronidazole, diltiazem, trimethoprim and ranitidine) in different water matrices (ultrapure water, surface water, WWTP effluent and hospital wastewater). Complete removal of the pollutants and the aromatic intermediates was achieved using the stoichiometric dose of H2O2, a catalyst (Fe3O4/gamma-Al2O3) load of 2 g L-1, pH 3 and temperature of 50-75 degrees C. Accordingly, the ecotoxicity was reduced to negligible values. The degradation was faster when the pharmaceuticals were together, being the reaction time for the elimination of the most refractory species (metronidazole) shortened from 4h to 1 h. The mineralization of the drugs was fairly different, being the most reactive species those containing several aromatic rings (X-TOC similar to 80%) and the most refractory that bearing an imidazolium ring (X-TOC similar to 35%). The water matrix affected the kinetics of the process but in all cases complete conversion of the drugs was reached within 1 h. The presence of dissolved organic matter (surface water) seemed to promote drugs degradation while the occurrence of inorganic ions (real WTTP and hospital effluents) partially inhibited it due to scavenging effects. Remarkably, the process was successfully operated at the typical concentrations of main micropollutant sources (mu g L-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Significant amounts of cephalosporin mycelial dreg (CMD) are still being generated from biopharmaceutical processes, representing both an economic and environmental burden for pharmaceutical factories. This study investigates the microwave (MW) treatment of CMD at a relatively mild temperature (100 degrees C) within 15 min. The results reveal that the MW treatment disintegrates the CMD efficiently and that the residual cephalosporin C (CPC) is almost degraded after sufficient irradiation. MW heating temperature strongly influences the polymer's release. SCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand), soluble proteins and carbohydrates have significant positive correlations to the temperature (r = 0.993, 0.983 and 0.992, respectively; p <0.01). 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicate that the key organic matters relate to temperature as well as microwave energies. Furthermore, more than 99.9% of the residual antibiotics in CMD are degraded by MW irradiation without antibacterial activities that are proven by the possible degradation pathway we elucidate. These results suggest that microwave irradiation treatment not only disintegrates CMD and destroys mycelial cells but also degrades the residual cephalosporin antibiotics, which implies the possibility for practical applications.

AB Pharmaceuticals and antibiotics have taken relatively little attention as contaminants in the natural environments. Ciprofloxacin (CP) as a second-generation fluoroquinolone is found in the wastewater generated from pharmaceutical product and industry. This research has assessed the efficacy of the next generation carbon family adsorbent, graphene nanosheet (GNS) to remove the CP from the water samples. Both adsorption experiments and the first principles of calculations (DFT) were applied to explore the molecular interaction between CP and GNS. The effects of initial concentration of CP, pH, shaking time and temperature of solution on adsorption content were investigated. In the neutral pH region (pH 6.0), the adsorption process was desirable. The shaking time to obtain equilibrium condition was 220 min and the experimental kinetic data were fitted with Elovich model. The equilibrium data were perfectly fitted to both Sips and Hill models. Ab-initio calculations demonstrated that CP could be adsorbed onto GNS by an electrostatic interaction being in good compromise with the experimental results.

AB This study reports the first comprehensive data set of characteristic concentrations of four artificial sweeteners: acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), saccharin (SAC), and cyclamate (CYC), and their ratios with nutrients, for untreated septic system wastewater. Samples were collected from the tanks of 19 different septic systems from across Ontario, Canada; these had a variety of usages, from single-family cottages to multiple-dwelling (campground or resort) facilities and had no additional treatment systems. The artificial sweetener concentrations and their relative proportions were highly variable in some cases, both temporally for several individual tanks and from site-to-site. Variability tended to be lower for multiple-dwelling compared to single-dwelling systems. This variability likely reflects differing use of artificial sweetener-containing products. The median concentrations for the complete data set of all four artificial sweeteners (in a range of 10 to 60 g/L) were of a similar order of magnitude, but slightly higher, than has generally been reported for wastewater treatment plant influent (though these vary substantially globally). Both SUC and ACE provided adequate positive linear relationships for dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the septic tanks, while a summation of ACE and SUC concentrations also gave a strong correlation. In contrast, CYC and SAC showed poor linear correlation with these nutrients. These reported ranges for artificial sweetener concentrations and ratios with nutrients may be used in future studies to estimate the contributions of nutrients or other wastewater constituents (e.g., pharmaceuticals, bacteria, and viruses) from domestic septic systems to groundwater, including water supply or irrigation wells, and nearby surface water bodies.

AB Paracetamol has been remarked as one of the most heavily used and prescribed drugs nowadays. The presence of paracetamol in the sewage effluent with the average concentration of 0.01 mg/L has been reported in this paper. This study investigated the removal of paracetamol from synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis treatment method under natural solar irradiation. Compound parabolic collecting reactor was used as a treatment medium. The effect of each variable (pH, concentration of TiO2 and initial concentration of paracetamol) on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of paracetamol was investigated by using the single-variable-at-a-time method. Central composite design based on the response surface methodology was used to optimize TiO2 and paracetamol concentrations. Experimental results and analysis of variance analysis showed that the model was significant with the high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9883. The optimum conditions of 1.0 g/L of TiO2 concentration and 0.06 g/L of paracetamol initial concentration were predicted for the maximum removal efficiency of 88%. Finally, the performance of UV lamp and natural sunlight in the photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol was compared and discussed in detail. The in situ experimental results in this study have proven the reliability of the solar operation on the photocatalysis treatment process.

AB The adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol, a toxic by-product of triclosan commonly found in wastewater treatment plant effluents, was studied on paper sludge/wheat husks biochar. By using response surface methodology, the optimum conditions and effects of pH, temperature, initial 2,4-DCP concentration and time were determined. The solution pH was found to be the most influential parameter whereas the optimum adsorption conditions were predicted as: C-0 = 40.28 mg L-1, T = 326 K, pH = 2.8, t = 143 min, where a 99.95% adsorption could be achieved. Both Langmuir and Freundlich provided a good fit for the experimental data, indicating a surface and multi-layer adsorption. Kinetically, the process primarily followed the pseudo-second order model (chemisorption). By comparing the adsorption capacity at equilibrium of our main biochar (q(e) = 9.28 mg g(-1)) to 3 biochars prepared from different biomasses (q(e) values 1.57-2.96 mg g(-1)), it was concluded that pH-dependent electrostatic interactions and non-covalent pi-electron donor-acceptor mechanisms play the most important role. Finally, there was indication that high concentrations of Ca and K may promote the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and enhance adsorption.

AB The occurrence of 15 pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was assessed in both influent and effluent samples. PACs were quantified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The sampling campaign was carried out during summer (n = 13) to assess the variation in both the influent concentrations and the removal efficiencies in similar climatic conditions. Among the selected PACs, all were quantified in influent samples but two of them were not systematically detected mainly due to the high quantification limit. PACs were detected at mu g L-1 levels with a maximum concentration of 96.7 mu g L-1 for Acetaminophen. The mean mass balance of the whole PAC pool during tracking was 448.5 and 26.3 g day(-1) in influents and effluents respectively. However, the removal efficiency varied depending on the sample (e.g. between -20 and 50% for Diclofenac). The fate of PACs during water treatment therefore depends on the removal quality in general, highlighted by the removal of nitrogen or BOD5. As a result, effluent concentrations were variable, unlike influent concentrations which were used to correctly assess the consumption behaviour of the population around the sampled WWTP. Although the daily mass loads were comparable with those found in other studies in Europe for the same type of WWTP, the estimated consumption sometimes exhibited significant differences with the theoretical one. These differences depend on the mode of consumption, i.e. whether the therapeutic class treats chronic or episodic diseases, and on the scale gap between estimated and theoretical concentrations.

AB Industrial fermentations for the production of pharmaceuticals generate large volumes of organic wastes which disposal is, nowadays, an environmental and economic issue. In the present paper, the feasibility of energy and plant nutrients recovery from the pharmaceutical organic waste originated from a fermentative biomass used for the daptomycin production was investigated. To achieve this aim, an integrated anaerobic digestion-digestate composting treatment was evaluated, with the purpose of energy (biogas) and organic fertiliser (compost) production. Moreover, the effectiveness of the integrated biological treatment for xenobiotic degradation (e.g. daptomycin) was evaluated. The biomass was initially anaerobically treated to assess its suitability for the production of biogas. The yield in bio-methane obtained when the organic waste was treated in co-digestion with agricultural by-products was 396 Nm(3) tVS(-1). Once optimized the anaerobic digestion process, the produced digestate was composted in a pilot scale apparatus. The composting of the digestate produced an organic amendment rich in macro-nutrients (27.1, 6.2 and 17.8 g kg(-1) of total N, P and K, respectively) and compatible with the Italian legislation concerning the production of fertilisers. No traces of daptomycin were detected in the compost, confirming the suitability of the integrated anaerobic-aerobic treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals. Thus, through the anaerobic-aerobic treatment, it was demonstrated that energy and nutrients may be recovered from an organic waste which disposal, nowadays, is difficult.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceutical products (PPs) from various therapeutic classes was studied in urban sediments collected upstream a small dam in Orleans, France. Since PPs are globally distributed contaminants since the 1950s, their spatial and historical distribution was documented in order to better understand the impact of recent urban management on the chemical quality of sediments. Concentrations of the PPs mainly ranged between 1 and 10 ng g(1) within the two cores. The chronology of core LOI13-2, based on radionuclide analysis (Cs-137 and Pb-210), enabled the characterization of the changes or shift in PPs over the last 50 years, impacted by the effluent deflections i) of a large wastewater treatment plant in 1989, and ii) of 3 smaller wastewater treatment plants between 2003 and 2009. In most cases the deepest occurrence of each PP in the core matched the market authorization date of different pharmaceuticals, indicating that some PPs can be used as chronomarkers. The study reveals that recent management of effluent discharges within the watershed improved the chemical quality of these sediments. In view of the persistence of PP pollution in trapped sediments, a total stock of 763 +/- 565 g for the selected PPs was estimated at the millstream scale. Superficial sediments therefore represent a potential source of downstream pollution in the event of the removal of a small existing dam. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: In this work, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is utilized to estimate the environmental footprint of solar Fenton oxidation at pilot scale used as a polishing step of secondary-treated urban effluents. All inputs (e.g. natural resources, raw materials, etc.) and outputs (e.g. emissions, etc.) of the process were quantitatively defined and/or estimated. The system under study includes raw materials, energy, land use, chemicals, local transportation needs, and air-/waterborne emissions.
   RESULTS: The main environmental hotspots of this system were identified (i.e. energy consumption and use of chemicals). The environmental sustainability of this technology was found to be high, since its environmental footprint for the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater was found to be only 8.7 kg CO2 m(-3), which is approx. 1.6% of the total CO2 emissions of the treatment of the daily effluents of a Cypriot resident. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios were investigated, in order to further enhance its overall environmental performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the majority of the environmental impacts of this process could be attributed to indirect emissions, tracing back to electricity generation, followed by emissions from the chemicals used. The most critical improvement identified herein, is the use of a renewable energy source. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In this work, a novel catalyst of Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 was prepared and the degradation of thymol in reverse osmosis concentrate using ozonation was explored. The operational parameters, such as ozone dosage (8-48 mg.min(-1)), initial thymol concentration (20-100 mg.L-1), initial pH value (3-11), and catalyst Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 dosage (0.2-1.0 g), were studied focusing on the thymol degradation and COD removal. The results indicated that the increase in ozone dosage, initial pH value, and Fe3O4@SiO2@Yb2O3 dosage accelerated the thymol degradation and COD removal, while the increase in initial thymol concentration hampered the effect of ozonation. A pathway of thymol degradation by catalytic ozonation was proposed based on the intermediates detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer and ion chromatography. This paper can provide basic data and technical alternative for pollutant removal from reverse osmosis concentrate by ozonation.

AB Industrial discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment in some middle-and low-income countries is not sufficiently regulated. The phytotoxicity of metronidazole (FLAGYL)one of the most commonly used over the counter (OTC) antibiotics, to soybean (Glycine max) is investigated. Relative growth rate (RGR) expressed in gram per gram per day (gg(-1)d(-1)) was applied to plants destructively harvested at maturity (42 d), to determine the toxicological impact. Differences between mean RGR of the three groups were performed at 0.05 significance level. Multiple comparisons suggest that there was a statistical significant difference among mean RGR for all treatment groups. Metronidazole is toxic to soybean plants (Glycine max) based on dose-response criterion. There is a need to enforce treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater effluent by Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies (PMCs) before discharge into the environment.

AB The investigations on seasonal and spatial distribution of 12 selected wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals (WWMPs) belonging to different therapeutic classes were conducted in three major urban rivers of Yangpu District, Shanghai, East China. The potential mechanisms for the removal of WWMPs in the rivers were also experimentally investigated. The detection frequencies of most WWMPs were in the range of 56-100%, with the exception of clofibric acid, which was not detected during the storm events. The median concentrations ranged from not detected to 5821 ng/L (caffeine) and the maximum concentration was 8662 ng/L, found in caffeine. Part of WWMPs such as paracetamol and caffeine showed significant seasonal variation (P < 0.05), while most of pharmaceuticals displayed limited concentration fluctuation under different seasons for relative low levels. The spatial pattern of most WWMPs has not showed obvious difference in the three rivers (P > 0.05). WWMPs could come from different sources, such as wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, untreated domestic wastewater, or some unknown sources. Lab-scale tests showed that the biodegradation and adsorption were the main removal pathways for WWMPs with lesser contribution from photodegradation and hydrolysis.

AB This study gives a full overview of the chemical oxidation by ozone of selected xenobiotics usually present in effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants. A qualitative and quantitative overview of literature data was made, and describes the ozonation efficiency and processes for the elimination of 12 xenobiotics (pesticides and pharmaceuticals). A database was built, compiling literature results of experimental ozonation assays in laboratory and real-scale conditions. Special attention was paid to selecting the data and compiling reliable results on removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters. An original study was performed in a semi-batch reactor applying ozone on secondary effluent spiked beforehand with a cocktail of 12 xenobiotics. The results of this study were compared with the literature data to evaluate the influence of the kinetic competition of xenobiotics in spiked wastewater in the determination of kinetic rate constants. These 12 xenobiotics were classified into three groups (high-/medium-/low-oxidizable) according to the ranges of their direct kinetic rate constants (k(O3)). A best effective ozone dose between 0.2 and 0.4 g(O3) gDOC(-1) is proposed for the elimination of xenobiotics. The predominant elimination pathway between direct and indirect oxidation was identified for each xenobiotic.

AB Propranolol is a human pharmaceutical beta-blocker that has been detected in municipal wastewater effluents at ng/L to low mg/L. To assess the potential of this compound to affect fish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for a life cycle in a flow-through system to nominal propranolol concentrations of 0.87 ng/L, 8.7 ng/L, 87 ng/L, 870 ng/L, and 8700 ng/L. Measured propranolol concentrations were below detection for the 2 lowest exposure concentrations, and were 76 ng/L, 580 ng/L, and 7800 ng/L for the 3 highest exposure concentrations. During the 162-d to 165-d exposure, no significant changes in weights or lengths were seen in fathead minnows, although the highest concentration of propranolol did cause a 15% decrease in survival of larval and juvenile stage fish compared with controls. At maturity, there were no significant changes in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in propranolol-exposed male or female fish. Female gonadosomatic index was significantly decreased in fish exposed to the highest concentrations of propranolol, probably because of increased egg-laying. Fathead minnows from all propranolol exposures produced more eggs than control fish, with fish exposed to 7800 ng/L propranolol producing 70% more eggs per female (p = 0.060), and having significantly increased clutch size (p = 0.008). Egg quality, % fertilization, % hatching, and % deformities in F1 fry were unaffected by propranolol exposure of fish. Propranolol exposure caused no effects in fathead minnows, except at the highest exposure concentration (7800 ng/L), where there were slight decreases in survival of juvenile minnows, and indications of increased reproduction. The present study is important because it is the first to assess the potential for effects in fish exposed to propranolol for a life cycle. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB Reclaimed water has emerged as a potential irrigation solution to freshwater shortages. However, limited data exist on the persistence of antibiotics in reclaimed water used for irrigation. Therefore, we examined the fate of nine commonly-used antibiotics (ampicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, oxacillin, oxolinic acid, penicillin G, pipemidic acid, and tetracycline) in differentially treated wastewater and reclaimed water from two U.S. regions. We collected 72 samples from two Mid-Atlantic and two Midwest treatment plants, as well as one Mid-Atlantic spray irrigation site. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests and Kruskal Wallis tests. Overall, antibiotic concentrations in effluent samples were lower than that of influent samples. Mid-Atlantic plants had similar influent but lower effluent antibiotic concentrations compared to Midwest plants. Azithromycin was detected at the highest concentrations (of all antibiotics) in influent and effluent samples from both regions. For most antibiotics, transport from the treatment plant to the irrigation site resulted in no changes in antibiotic concentrations, and UV treatment at the irrigation site had no effect on antibiotic concentrations in reclaimed water. Our findings show that low-level antibiotic concentrations persist in reclaimed water used for irrigation; however, the public health implications are unclear at this time.

AB The unchecked production and use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) for the treatment of infections in human and livestock has increased in Pakistan, which resulted in large amount of antibiotics in water bodies. In the current study, the prevalence and associated ecological risk of three FQs were investigated in wastewater bodies and sludge samples of Kahuta and Hattar industrial zones. The average concentrations of ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR) and levofloxacin (LEV) in the waste-water samples were slightly higher in Kahuta (i.e. 58, 32.9, and 36.7 mu g L-1 respectively), than those in Hattar sites (i.e. 42.1, 41.2, and 48.9 mu g L-1 respectively). However, the concentrations of CIP, ENR and LEV in the sludge samples were significantly higher (i.e. 159; 153 and 164 mu g kg(-1) respectively) in Hattar sites, compared to those in Kahuta sites (i.e. 129, 58 and 91 mu g kg(-1) respectively). The uses of FQs in the health sector resulted in water pollution and poses the ecological risk to aquatic organisms. The individual risk associated with CIP was highest in Kahuta industrial sites for green algae ranging (2900-9100) followed by M. aeruginosa (5800-18200), cyanobacteria (580-18204) and invertebrates (24.2-75.8). These values suggested that the prevalence of antibiotics in the waste-disposal sites could be potential risk for the aquatic ecosystem, and harmful to biodiversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Chicken feather, which is consisted of keratin, has always been abandoned as solid waste. The utilization technologies of waste keratin have been developed in electric zones and materials fields so far. Recently, numerous new types of adsorbents have been used for antibiotic removal. The chicken feather carbon is supposed to be a potential one. In this study, an activated feather carbon (AFC) was developed as the absorbent of amoxicillin (AMOX) in simulated waste-water. The micropore structures of AFC were detected by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was recorded and analyzed. A BET surface area, as high as 1838.86 m(2)/g, was measured in this study. At the meantime, a rapid adsorption (5 similar to 7 min) and high removal efficiency (99.63%) could be observed. The kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption ofAMOX by AFC was an exothermic physic-adsorption. The interaction between AMOX and AFC surface was supposed to be a multiple-layer adsorption process for it is well fitted with the Freundlich model. The adsorption behavior could be described by pseudo-second-order model almost perfectly in kinetic studies. In addition, effect of pH, ionic strength, and reusability properties were also discussed in this paper. The AFC was proved to be the most rapid, efficient, and economically absorbent for AMOX removal, which was effective enough under various temperatures and saline circumstances. It was also proved useful, convenient, and renewable in dealing with the tough antibiotic pollutant problems and rebuilding of antibiotic sewage treatment facilities.

AB We report a comparative study on the photodegradation of the widely used benzodiazepine psychoactive drug alprazolam (8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4] triazolo[4,3-a][1,4] benzodiazepine, ALP) using direct photolysis, and titanium dioxide photocatalyzed reaction. Titanium dioxide photocatalysts were prepared as nanoparticles by acidic sol-gel methods, calcined at two different temperatures, and their behavior compared with P25 (Degussa type) TiO2. Efficient photodegradation was observed in the photocatalytic process, with over 90% degradation after 90 minutes under optimized conditions. Triazolaminoquinoline, 5-chloro-(5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) benzophenone, triazolbenzophenone, and a-hydroxyalprazolam were identified as the degradation products by fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC-MS. A comparison with the literature suggests that 8H-alprazolam may also be formed. Good mineralization was observed with TiO2 photocatalysts. ALP photodegradation with TiO2 follows pseudo-first order kinetics, with rates depending on the photocatalyst used. The effects of the quantity of the photocatalyst and concentration of alprazolam were studied.

AB The potential for integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) processes to achieve enhanced transformation of pharmaceuticals relative to conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes was assessed. Previous studies have focused on direct comparisons of parallel reactors with and without fixed film carriers and little information is available on the impacts of how varying operating parameters impact the differences in observed pharmaceutical compound (PC) transformation capabilities between CAS reactors and those equipped with both an activated sludge (AS) and fixed film carriers. The testing was carried out using bench scale sequencing batch reactors fed with authentic municipal wastewater and operated at selected combinations of temperature and solids retention time (SRT). PC transformation efficiencies were assessed in a 22 factorial design that employed the IFAS and CAS processes, operated in parallel under identical process conditions. Nitrification rate testing that was conducted to obtain insight into the biomass activity demonstrated that IFAS consistently had improved nitrification kinetics despite lower mixed liquor volatile suspended solids levels thereby demonstrating the contribution of the biofilm to nitrification. Increased transformation of atenolol (ATEN; ranging from 10-60%) and trimethoprim (TRIM; ranging from 30-50%) in the IFAS equipped reactors relative to their respective activated sludge (AS) controls was observed under all experimental conditions. Negligible transformation of carbamazepine was observed in both reactors under all conditions investigated. More than 99% of acetaminophen was transformed in both configurations under all conditions. There was no correspondence between nitrification activity and TRIM removal in the control AS while conditions that stimulated nitrification in the control AS also resulted in enhanced removal of ATEN. The results of this study indicate that the integration of biofilms in AS processes enhances transformation of some PCs.

AB In this study, six human pharmaceuticals in wastewater, sediments, and solid waste samples of five hospitals in Gujrat, Pakistan, were detected by a validated high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method and then their ecological risk assessment was conducted. The pharmaceuticals include paracetamol, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin and were chromatographed on a C-18 column at 254nm using liquid-liquid extraction. The highest concentration obtained was of paracetamol and it was also detected in all the five hospitals and all the sample matrices (max. 696 ng/mL) whereas, the concentration of other pharmaceuticals were also very high although they were not detected in all the sample matrices. Maximum concentrations of other pharmaceuticals detected were naproxen (220 ng/mL), diclofenac (186 ng/mL), ibuprofen (596 ng/mL), amlodipine (303 ng/mL), and rosuvastatin (104 ng/mL). Risk assessment in terms of risk quotient (RQ) was also calculated based on maximum measured concentration and the RQ values were very high for all pharmaceuticals. The maximum RQ values obtained from different pharmaceuticals were paracetamol (696 against daphnia), naproxen (84 against fish), diclofenac (9300 against Oncorhynchus mykiss), ibuprofen (16 000 against Oryzias latipes), and amlodipine (471 against green algae). The results from this study demand for comprehensive monitoring of pharmaceuticals from different points sources and treatment of all type of wastes including hospital waste.

AB The photochemical fate of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) found in the environment has been studied under controlled laboratory conditions applying a sunlight simulator. Aqueous samples containing PPCPs at environmentally relevant concentrations were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) after irradiation. The exposed extracts were subsequently analysed by liquid chromatography combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for studying the kinetics of photolytic transformations. Almost all exposed PPCPs appeared to react with a half-life time (tau (1/2)) of less than 30 min. For ranitidine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, tau(1/2) was found to be even less than 5 min. The structures of major photolysis products were determined using quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QToF) and spectroscopic data reported in the literature. For diclofenac, the transformation products carbazol-1-yl-acidic acid and 8-chloro-9H-carbazol-1-yl-acetic acid were identified based on the mass/charge ratio of protonated ions and their fragmentation pattern in negative electrospray ionization (ESI--QTOF). Irradiation of carbamazepine resulted in three known products: acridine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, whereas acetaminophen was photolytically transformed to 1-(2-amino-5 hydroxyphenyl) ethenone. These photochemical products were subsequently identified in seawater or fish samples collected at sites exposed to wastewater effluents on the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1-3) and other genetic elements as antiseptic resistance gene (qacE Delta 1) and class 1 and class 2 integrons (int1-2) in the upper layer of substrate and in the effluent of microcosm constructed wetlands (CWs) treating artificial wastewater containing diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The bacteria in the substrate and in the effluents were equipped with the sul1-2, int1, and qacE Delta 1 resistance determinants, which were introduced into the CW system during inoculation with activated sludge and with the soil attached to the rhizosphere of potted seedlings of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta' roots (int1). By comparing the occurrence of the resistance determinants in the upper substrate layer and the effluent, it can be stated that they neither were lost nor emerged along the flow path. The implications of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the effluent may entail a risk of antibiotic resistance being spread in the receiving environment. Additionally, transformation products of SMX were determined. According to the obtained results, four (potential) SMX transformation products were identified. Two major metabolites of SMX, 2,3,5-trihydroxy-SMX and 3,5-dihydroxy-SMX, indicated that SMX may be partly oxidized during the treatment. The remaining two SMX transformation products (hydroxy-glutathionyl-SMX and glutathionyl-SMX) are conjugates with glutathione, which suggests the ability of CW bacterial community to degrade SMX and resist antimicrobial stress.

AB Nebivolol (NEB) is one of the top-sold prescription drugs belonging to the third generation of beta-blockers. However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13 ng L-1
   Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254 nm, UV-B at 312 nm and UV-A at 365 nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k = 7.8 x 10(-4) s(-1)). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9 x 10(-4) s(-1) in the presence of the "OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4 x 10(-4) s(-1), Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the C-F bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation energy of aromatic C-F bonds (525 kJ mol(-1)), exceeds the energy of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (>254 nm, i.e., max. 471 kJ (E-)1). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the center dot OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were Phi(deg) = 0.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B Phi(deg) was 0.023 +/- 0.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen. These oxidative species may be formed upon reaction of photo-excited NEB with oxygen. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to synthetic chemicals is a key environmental challenge faced by aquatic organisms. The time and dose effects of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sildenafil citrate on sperm motility and successful fertilisation are studied using the echinoderms, Asterias rubens and Psammechinus miliaris, and the polychaete worm Arenicola marina, all important components of the marine benthos. Motility was reduced for all species when exposed to diclofenac concentrations >= 0.1 mu g/L. Exposure to >= 1.0 mu g/L of ibuprofen affected only P. miliaris gametes and fertilisation success of A. marina. A. rubens and P. miliaris sperm increased in both percentage motility and swimming velocity when exposed to sildenafil citrate at concentrations >= 18 and >= 50 ng/L, respectively. Pre-incubation of sperm with sildenafil citrate significantly increased fertilisation success in A. rubens and P. miliciris but not in A. marina. Pre-incubated A. rubens oocytes fertilised successfully in ibuprofen. According to EU Directive 93/67/EEC, diclofenac is classified as a very toxic substance to gametes of A. rubens, P. miliaris, and A. marina (EC50 = 100-1000 mu g/L) while ibuprofen is classified as very toxic to gametes of P. miliaris but non-toxic to gametes of A. marina (EC50 > 10,000 mu g/L). The present study indicates that diclofenac exposure may have negative impacts on invertebrate reproductive success, whereas ibuprofen potentially may compromise P. miliaris reproduction. This study provides a valuable insight into the mechanisms that allow marine invertebrates to survive and reproduce in contaminated and changing habitats. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work was to assess and compare the removal efficiency of paracetamol and salicylic acid from aqueous medium by a microalgae-based treatment, using either Chlorella vulgaris or Tetradesmus obliquus. Moreover, considering microalgae application in wastewater treatment, the influence of these pharmaceuticals in the algal nutrient removal capacity was evaluated. The removal of paracetamol by T. obliquus (> 40 %) was larger than by C. vulgaris (> 21 %) in batch culture, and this was also observed for salicylic acid (> 93 % by T. obliquus and > 25 % by C. vulgaris). Both strains removed nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) almost completely by the end of the batch culture, but T. obliquus showed the highest efficiency at the steady state conditions of the semicontinuous culture. In spite of this, under the flocculants here tested, the efficiency in the recovery of biomass was much higher for C. vulgaris. These results highlight the importance of strain selection in the application of microalgae for wastewater treatment and, particularly, for the removal of pharmaceuticals.

AB This paper deals with raceway pond reactors (RPRs) as an alternative photoreactor for solar photo-Fenton applications. Raceway pond reactors are common low-cost reactors which can treat large volumes of water. The experiments were carried out with Fe3+:EDDS complex in the secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with a mixture of 100 mu g/L each of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) at circumneutral pH. In a preliminary stage, two operating strategies, sequential addition of iron sulfate and Fe3+:EDDS complex at a 1:2 molar ratio were compared, and Fe3+:EDDS complex was found to be the best option. The effect of liquid depth (10, 15 and 20 cm) was also explored. 90% pharmaceutical removal was achieved with accumulated solar UV energy of around 1 kJ/L. Finally, RPRs and tubular photoreactors with compound parabolic collectors (CPC) were compared under realistic conditions. Pharmaceutical removal efficiency was four times higher, increasing from 0.26 mg/kJ with CPC reactors to 1.07 mg/kJ in the 15-cm-deep RPR. As far as the authors know, this is the first detailed study on the effect of liquid depth in RPRs at circumneutral pH. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing consumption of pharmaceuticals together with their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) implies the occurrence of these compounds in natural water resources. To investigate the natural attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, naproxen and carbamazepine) during vadose zone infiltration, unsaturated column (L 26.67 cm, empty set 7.62 cm) experiments, filled with a sandy -loamy soil, were performed using two input concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g L-1). The software Hydrus 1D was used to simulate experimental data. Caffeine and acetaminophen were never detected at the column outlet indicating a low environmental concern. On the other hand, attenuation of the detected pharmaceuticals could be reproduced by a combination of retardation and removal approaches. Carbamazepine is among the selected contaminants the most persistent. A dependence of removal rates on input concentrations was detected for sulfamethoxazole (mu(w) from 2.78 d(-1) to 1.16 d(-1)) and naproxen (mu(w) from 1.16 d (-1) to 0.63 d(-1)) attributed mainly to decreased metabolism of microorganisms when a higher input concentration is applied. Two transformation products (TPs) (N4-Acetylsulfamethoxazole and epoxycarbamazepine) derived from sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine transformation, respectively, were detected during the experiment with the highest input concentration.

AB This study investigated the i) kinetics, and ii) proportion of photolysis of 30 relatively stable active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) during artificial UV irradiation for 28 d in ammonium acetate buffer, filtered and unfiltered river water. Buffer was included to control removal kinetics under stable pH conditions and without particulate matter. Dark controls were used to determine removal due to other processes than photolysis and calculate the proportion of photolysis of the total removal. The removal of each API in each matrix was determined using online solid phase extraction/liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE/LC-MS/MS). Most APIs transformed during the 28 d of UV irradiation and the dark controls showed that photolysis was the major removal process for the majority of the APIs studied. The half-lives ranged from 6 h (amitriptyline) in unfiltered river water to 884 h (37 d, carbamazepine) in buffer. In unfiltered river water, the proportion of APIs with short half-lives (<48 h) was much higher (29%) than in the other matrices (4%), probably due to additional organic carbon, which could have promoted indirect photolysis. Furthermore, two APIs, memantine and fluconazole, were stable in all three matrices, while alprazolam was stable in buffer and unfiltered river water and four additional APIs were stable in buffer. Considering the relatively long-term UV-exposure, this study enabled the investigation of environmentally relevant half-lives in natural waters. Many APIs showed high persistence, which is environmentally concerning and emphasizes the importance of further studies on their environmental fate and effects. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

The aim of this survey was to detect the potential anthropogenic influences of point sources such as wastewater treatment plants and diffuse pollution such as runoff water from roads on the raw water used for drinking water treatment. The programme comprised seven sampling campaigns within 2 years each with up to 20 sampling sites. In total, the programme included 84 anthropogenic compounds from pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media, sweeteners, industrial chemicals (benzotriazoles, melamines and benzothiazoles) and pesticide metabolites. Cyclamate occurred with the highest median concentration of 44 mu g l(-1) in untreated wastewater and acesulfame occurred with a concentration of 20 mu g l(-1) in treated wastewater. In runoff water from roads, the most relevant compounds were tolyltriazole with 2.3 mu g l(-1) and the desphenyl-chloridazon with 1.2 mu g l(-1). In the stream waters, the highest median concentrations were found for melamine and acesulfame both at 0.61 mu g l(-1). High elimination during conventional wastewater treatment was observed for 5 out of 49 compounds. These are acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, aciclovir, cyclamate, ibuprofen and saccharin. Based on the survey results, we propose a set of nine compounds to be used as indicators for wastewater, untreated wastewater and runoff water from roads for an efficient surveillance. The indicators are intended to detect anthropogenic influences in surface, ground and drinking water.

AB Trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals are frequently detected in the urban water cycle, including wastewater, surface water and groundwater, as well as drinking water. These also include human metabolites (HMs), which are formed in the human body and then excreted via urine or feces, as well as transformation products (TPs) formed in engineered treatment systems and the aquatic environment. In the current study, the occurrence of HMs as well as their TPs of the anticonvulsants carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) were investigated using LC tandem MS in effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surface water and groundwater. Highest concentrations were observed in raw wastewater for 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOHCBZ), 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-cabamazepine (100HCBZ) and CBZ with concentrations ranging up to 2.7 +/- 0.4, 1.7 +/- 0.2 and 1.07 +/- 0.06 mu g L-1, respectively. Predictions of different toxicity endpoints using a Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) expert system query indicated that several HMs and TPs, in particular 9-carboxy-acridine (9-CA-ADIN) and acridone (ADON), may exhibit an increased genotoxicity compared to the parent compound CBZ. As 9-CA-ADIN was also detected in groundwater, a detailed investigation of the genotoxicity of 9-CA-ADIN is warranted. Investigations of an advanced wastewater treatment plant further revealed that the discharge of the investigated compounds into the aquatic environment could be substantially reduced by ozonation followed by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration.

AB Due to the well-known endocrine disrupting ability of bisphenol A (BPA), its production and usage have been regulated. Consequently, other bisphenol analogues (BPs) have been used as the replacement of BPA. Despite their widespread use, few studies have investigated the occurrence and fate of BPs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we conducted a city-wide monitoring survey and collected the wastewater and sludge samples from seven WWTPs in Xiamen, China over seven days. The concentrations of dissolved and adsorbed BPs in the influent and effluent, together with the BP concentrations in the sludge were determined. Five BPs, including BPA, BPAF, BPE, BPF, and BPS, were widely detected. The medium concentrations of BPA, BPAF, BPE, BPF, and BPS were 1318, 0.282, 3.70, 50.0, and 48.0 ng/L in the influent, 177, 0.714, 3.64, BLD, and BLD in the effluent, and 343, 3.09, BLD, 56.5,1.01 mu g/kg in the sludge. Spatial variations were observed, which implied the industrial origin of BPA. The efficiencies of BP removal from aqueous phase were evaluated, and results showed that BPA, BPF, and BPS were highly removed with removal efficiencies higher than 78%, while BPAF and BPE were resistant in WWTPs. Mass load calculations showed that 2075 g BPs entered into the WWTPs in Xiamen City each day, while 246 g and 63 g were discharged via effluent and excess sludge, respectively. Mass balance analysis showed that BPS and BPA were mainly biodegraded, BPF were mainly adsorbed and biodegraded, BPAF was resistant to biodegradation, while BPE was resistant to both biodegradation and adsorption.

AB Wastewater treatments can eliminate or remove a substantial amount of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), but there may still be significant concentrations of them in effluents discharged into surface water bodies. Beirolas wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is located in the Lisbon area and makes its effluent discharges into Tagus estuary (Portugal). The main objective of this study is to quantify a group of 32 PhACs in the different treatments used in this WWTP. Twelve sampling campaigns of wastewater belonging to the different treatments were made in 2013-2014 in order to study their removal efficiency. The wastewaters were analysed by solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (UPLC-MS/MS). The anti-diabetics were the most frequently found in wastewater influent (WWI) and wastewater effluent (WWE) (208 and 1.7 mu g/L, respectively), followed by analgesics/antipyretics (135 mu g/L and < LOQ, respectively), psychostimulants (113 and 0.49 mu g/L, respectively), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (33 and 2.6 mu g/L, respectively), antibiotics (5.2 and 1.8 mu g/L, respectively), antilipidemics (1.6 and 0.24 mu g/L, respectively), anticonvulsants (1.5 and 0.63 mu g/L, respectively) and beta blockers (1.3 and 0.51 mu g/L, respectively). A snapshot of the ability of each treatment step to remove these target PhACs is provided, and it was found that global efficiency is strongly dependent on the efficiency of secondary treatment. Seasonal occurrence and removal efficiency was also monitored, and they did not show a significant seasonal trend.

AB Occurrence of diazepam and its metabolites, nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam in the water environment in Beijing was investigated. Samples were collected from four rivers flowing through the city and from all the thirteen sewage treatment plants in the urban area. Average influent concentrations of diazepman, temazepam, and oxazepam in 2013 summer ranged from 0.9 to 7.1, 1.5 to 3.4, and 2.9 to 12.4 ng L-1, respectively, whereas nordiazepam concentrations were below quantification limit on the majority of sampling dates. No significant seasonal variation in influent concentrations was observed. Removal during treatment was low for diazepman (<50%), temazepam (<20%), and oxazepam (<20%), consistent with previous findings reported in the literature. Wastewater-based epidemiology approach was applied to back-calculate population size-normalized diazepam consumption (using temazepam as biomarker) in Beijing, which was found to be at least 3.8 times more of the national average. Diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam were widely detected in surface waters, with concentrations greater than concentrations in sewage influents at many sampling points, strongly indicating direct discharge of wastewater of high diazepam concentrations into the surface waters in the city.

AB We studied the toxicological interaction of 46 micropollutants from a biologically treated wastewater effluent in mixtures with silica, amine-modified silica, titanium dioxide and magnetite nanoparticles. The pollutants tracked in this work were polar pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups, some of their metabolites and artificial sweeteners, the concentrations of which were mostly in the tens to hundreds of ng L-1 range. The results showed particularly high adsorption for furosemide, gemfibrozil and the aminopyrine metabolite 4FAA. There was preferential adsorption of the less polar compounds on the less polar nanoparticles. The total amounts of compounds adsorbed and quantified were 13.4, 4.8, 10.8 and 7.1 mu g g(-1) for SiO2, SiO2-NH2, TiO2 and Fe3O4, respectively. The toxicity of wastewater-nanoparticle mixtures was assessed using the bioluminescent cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 CPB4337. The interactions were quantified by means of the combination index (CI)-isobologram method. The binary mixtures of wastewater with SiO2, SiO2-NH2 and TiO2 displayed antagonism for the lower affected fractions, which corresponded to the lower concentrations. For higher effects and for the Fe3O4 nanoparticles over the whole tested range, the mixtures were additive leading to synergism for the higher affected fractions. No internalization was observed. The results showed that the reduced toxicant bioavailability due to the interaction with nanoparticles is relevant for micropollutants at environmental concentrations. The amount of anthropogenic pollutants retained by metal oxide nanoparticles has significant toxicological effects.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims at evaluating the degradation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in urban wastewater effluents using a UV-C-driven oxidation processes in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the phytotoxicity and ecotoxicity of the treated samples were investigated against one plant species (Sinapis alba) and a crustacean (Daphnia magna), respectively. The efficiency of the process to remove E. coli and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli was also assessed.
   RESULTS: Complete degradation of CIP was achieved within 15 min of treatment under the optimum concentration of the oxidant ([H2O2]= 10 mg L-1). The degradation rate of the antibiotic fitted pseudo-first-order kinetics. An increase in both shoot inhibition and root inhibition was observed, until 60 min of treatment, beyond which, the phytotoxic effect was eliminated. The results demonstrated the ability of the UV-C process to reduce the toxicity towards D. magna by 40%, comparatively, to the untreated wastewater. The inactivation of E. coli and CIP-resistant E. coli was achieved within 2 min of treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The UV-C/H2O2 process was successfully applied for the removal of CIP at low environmental concentration level. The treatment process was able to achieve a significant reduction of phyto-and eco-toxic effects, as well as E. coli harbouring resistance to CIP. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC) is an effective treatment step for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater or drinking water. Different test methods are commonly used for evaluating the capability of a GAC depending on the raw material and activation method. Several of these methods have been tested with one GAC and different size fractions obtained by grinding and sieving: batch experiments with two distinct modes of agitation (magnetic stirring and horizontal agitation), laboratory-scale adsorbers (LSA), rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) and differential column batch reactors (DCBR). It was found that magnetically stirred batches and DCBR are well suited for minimizing the effects of film diffusion. However, magnetic stirring reduces the particle size especially for large grains and long experimental periods. For fixed-bed adsorbers (LSA and RSSCT), it was shown that increasing the contact time of the water with the GAC at high throughputs can significantly improve the removal of OMP even after 100,000 bed volumes. However, permeability losses in RSSCT even with tap water have to be considered as a severe drawback. Correlations have been established between the loading achieved in a batch after 24 h and the carbon usage rate (CUR) at which the same loading was reached in an RSSCT. As expected, RSSCT removed OMP more efficiently than batch experiments at the same CUR.

AB A metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) matrix of MIL-100(Fe) loading N-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) nanoparticles as a novel photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile two-step strategy including preparation of neutral NTiO2 sol and caging N-TiO2 nanoparticles. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by a series of techniques including XRD, ICP, BET, UV-vis, XPS and TEM. Photocatalytic activity of the samples was assessed based on degradation of methylene blue or rhodamine B dye in model wastewater under visible-light irradiation. The as-synthesized samples essentially maintain the typical MOFs structure and porous property of MIL-100(Fe), which exhibits well confinement effect on TiO2 nanoparticles. A significant finding is that the quantum dots-like N-TiO2 nanoparticles (< 2 nm) with an appropriate mass percentage of 32% highly disperse in cages of MIL100(Fe) with 1.9 nm of pore size and obtain narrowed band gap. But agglomeration of N-TiO2 nanoparticles occurs as TiO2 content increases to 50%. Meanwhile, nitrogen atoms are successfully incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. The optimal catalyst obtains 99.1% and 93.5% of final removal rate, respectively for methylene blue and rhodamine B, presenting the enhanced photocatalytic performance by comparison with the pure MIL-100(Fe). The composite exhibits more excellent sedimentation efficiency and reusability than pure N-TiO2. A possible mechanism of the photocatalysis process is presented in detail.

AB In this study, the photo-induced degradation of azithromycin (Azi), erythromycin (Ery) and tylosin (Tyl) was investigated. The three macrolides are regularly found in different kinds of water, and are thus considered a potential environmental risk. In search of efficient ways for elimination, the compounds were systematically irradiated with a polychromatic UVC light source emitting 185, 254 and discretely further up to 580 nm. Due to their specific structural features, the macrolides possess different optical absorption characteristics leading to photodegradation pathways with dissimilar kinetic properties. Hence, the photodegradation products and their kinetics were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high-resolution time of -flight mass spectrometry. Among the degradants, i.e. the products formed during UV irradiation, both sugar moieties and lactone macrocycles were observed. Applying a first order kinetic model, the half-life of Azi was determined as 1.0-3.7 min, that of Ery as 1.0-14.2 min depending on the reaction conditions. The two compounds possess much lower absorption cross-sections than Tyl, in particular at 254 nm. Their half-lives appeared at least three times higher than that of Tyl that has t(1/2) of 0.2-1.0 min. Based on quantum efficiency considerations, it was assumed that the degradation of Ery and Azi was mainly due to hydroxyl radical formation, which originated from water irradiation below 200 nm, whereas Tyl experienced predominantly photo induced degradation. The photodegradants of Azi exhibited half-lives of over 200 min, whereas most of the photo-products of Ery and Tyl showed half-lives of less than 10 min. Photodegradation processes were investigated at pH 3, pH 7 and pH 9 and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Both the educts and the photo products were degraded more rapidly under neutral and acid conditions.

AB In the present study, a mixture of treated wastewater and surface water was used to rewet a degraded fen peatland site during a three-year rewetting experiment. We studied the behavior and effects of micropollutants by means of hydrological, physico-chemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological monitoring. The highest concentrations of micropollutants in the treated wastewater were found for the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac, some metabolites, the sweetener acesulfame, tolyl- and benzotriazole and diatrizoate. In the underlying, shallow groundwater where treated wastewater application for rewetting had been expected to have the greatest impact due to seeping and evapotranspiration processes, only a sporadic occurrence of micropollutants was found. The influence of dilution by groundwater movements was examined by applying a geohydrological model. The sorption of micropollutants onto the peaty soil also played a role, as found for carbamazepine. Further processes such as photolysis, microbial decay under low redox conditions and plant uptake can be assumed to be relevant for the removal of many substances. Ecotoxicity tests with the soil before and after rewetting did not indicate any negative impact on the soil habitat quality by wastewater application, but clearly pointed at ecotoxicologically relevant geogenic arsenic concentrations at the study site. Although a positive effect on receiving surface water systems is expected if wastewater is applied on land instead of discharged to water bodies, the rewetted soil may turn into a sink for micropollutants in the long term. Hence, the findings of the present field study encourage further investigations in order to identify the governing processes in the elimination of micropollutants in rewetted peatlands flooded with treated wastewater.

AB Hospital wastewaters are a main source of pharmaceutical active compounds, which are usually highly recalcitrant and can accumulate in surface and groundwater bodies. Fungal treatments can remove these contaminants prior to discharge, but real wastewater poses a problem to fungal survival due to bacterial competition. This study successfully treated real non-spiked, non-sterile wastewater in a continuous fungal fluidized bed bioreactor coupled to a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment for 56 days. A control bioreactor without the fungus was also operated and the results were compared. A denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing approach was used to study the microbial community arisen in both reactors and as a result some bacterial degraders are proposed. The fungal operation successfully removed analgesics and anti-inflammatories, and even the most recalcitrant pharmaceutical families such as antibiotics and psychiatric drugs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important point sources for micropollutants, which are harmful to freshwater organisms. Ozonation of wastewater is a powerful option to abate micropollutants, but may result in the formation of the potentially toxic oxidation by-product bromate in bromide containing wastewaters. This study investigates options to reduce bromate formation during wastewater ozonation by (i) reducing the bromide concentration of the wastewater, (ii) lowering the ozone dose during wastewater treatment and (iii) adding hydrogen peroxide to limit the lifetime of ozone and quench the intermediates of the bromate formation pathway. Two examples demonstrate that a high share of bromide in wastewater can originate from single point sources (e.g., municipal waste incinerators or landfills). The identification of major point sources requires laborious sampling campaigns, but may facilitate the reduction of the bromide load significantly. To reduce the bromate formation by lowering the ozone dose interferes with the aim to abate micropollutants. Therefore, an additional treatment is necessary to ensure the elimination of micropollutants. Experiments at a pilot-plant illustrate that a combined treatment (ozone/powdered activated carbon) allows to eliminate micropollutants with low bromate yields. Furthermore, the addition of hydrogen peroxide was investigated at bench scale. The bromate yields could be reduced by similar to 50% and 65% for a hydrogen peroxide dose of 5 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. In conclusion, there are options to reduce the bromate formation during wastewater ozonation, however, they are not simple with sometimes limited efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extended anaerobic conditions during biological wastewater treatment may enhance the biodegradation of micropollutants. To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites.
   The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%).
   In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), consisting of pharmaceuticals, industrial/household additives, and their transformation products, have been widely detected in surface water bodies and may lead to potential ecological risks. Installing a tertiary treatment step in sewage treatment plants (STP) is an effective method to control their contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale biofilter was set up with natural manganese oxides as carrier materials at a local STP to treat the real secondary effluent. This innovative and simple reactor was on-site operated for approximately 500 days. Some EOCs were effectively removed after adaptation, including 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (98%), gabapentin (97%), tramadol (93%), carbamazepine (91%), benzotriazole (91%), sulfamethoxazole (88%), erythromycin (86%). By contrast, the removal of others can be obtained without adaptation, including diclofenac (91%), carboxy-acyclovir (91%), iomeprol (89%), 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (87%), 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (86%), acyclovir (73%), tolyltriazole (70%). Overall, 80% of the total mass of 15 detected EOCs was eliminated from the secondary effluent. In addition, 53% of UV254 was removed from wastewater, indicating the aromatic content was damaged to a certain extent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The bioregeneration of activated carbon (AC) in biological activated carbon (BAC) systems is limited by sorption-desorption hysteresis and transport between the adsorbent and biomass. In this study, we investigated these limitations and whether a biofilm covering the AC surface is required. Consequently, BAC reactors were operated at different shear stress and AC surface smoothness, since this may affect biofilm formation. The experiments were carried out in BAC and blank reactors treating synthetic wastewater containing the pharmaceutical metoprolol.
   After start-up, all reactors removed metoprolol completely; however, after 840 h the removal dropped due to saturation of the AC. In the blank reactors, the removal dropped to 0% while in the BAC reactors removal recovered to >99%, due to increased biological activity. During the initial phase, the metoprolol was adsorbed, rather than biodegraded. At the end, the AC from the BAC reactors had higher pore volume and sorption capacity than from the blank reactors, showing that the AC had been bioregenerated.
   At high shear (G = 25 s(-1)), the rough AC granules (R-a = 13 mu m) were covered with a 50-400 gm thick biofilm and the total protein content of the biofilm was 2.6 mg/gAC, while at lower shear (G = 8.8 s(-1)) the rough AC granules were only partly covered. The biofilm formation at lower shear (G = 8.8 s(-1)) on smooth AC granules (R-a = 1.6 mu m) was negligible. However, due to the presence of suspended biomass the reactor performance or bioregeneration were not reduced. This showed that direct contact between the AC and biomass was not essential in mixed BAC systems. The microbial analyses of the suspended biomass and the biofilm on AC surface indicated that metoprolol was mainly biodegraded in suspension. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports a green method for the synthesis of Gold@Silver@Silver chloride (Au@Ag@AgCl) core-double shells nanoparticles (NPs) using Momordica charantia leaves extract. The formation of core -double shells structure was confirmed by TEM image and further it was supported by elemental mapping and EDX line profile analysis. In this method, the NPs were synthesized without using any toxic reagents and external halide. The phytochemicals present in the leaves extract were responsible for the formation of the NPs. The photodegradation of pharmaceutical active compounds, such as clofibric acid (CA) and ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous solution was also investigated by Au@Ag@AgCl nanoparticles as a photocatalyst under solar irradiation. The catalyst dose was varied from 0.01 to 0.1 g/L and 0.07 g was found as an optimum amount of catalyst. The plausible degradation mechanisms, reaction kinetics and photolysis products of IBP and CA under solar irradiation were also reported in this study. To the best knowledge of the authors, it was for the first time, we report the synthesis of Au@Ag@AgCl (core-double shells) using Momordica charantia leaves extract. The reduction of 2,4,6-trinitro phenol (2,4,6-TNP) was also investigated using Au@Ag@AgCl as a catalyst. The study indicated that a total of 97.5% of 2,4,6-TNP was reduced. It was observed that 97% of IBP and 98% of CA were degraded using Au@Ag@AgCl nanoparticles as a catalyst. The reactive species, such as center dot O-2(-) and Cl-0 were mainly responsible for the photodegradation of IBP and CA under solar irradiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traces of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other chemicals are demonstrated in effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) and they may affect quality of surface water and eventually drinking water. Treatment of effluents with granular activated carbon (GAC) or ozone to improve removal of APIs and other contaminants was evaluated at two Swedish STPs, Kappala and Uppsala (88 and 103 APIs analyzed). Biomarker responses in rainbow trout exposed to regular and additionally treated effluents were determined. GAC and ozone treatment removed 87-95% of the total concentrations of APIs detected. In Kappala, GAC removed 20 and ozonation (7 g O-3/m(3)) 21 of 24 APIs detected in regular effluent. In Uppsala, GAC removed 25 and ozonation (5.4 g O-3/m(3)) 15 of 25 APIs detected in effluent. GAC and ozonation also reduced biomarker responses caused by unidentified pollutants in STP effluent water. Elevated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in gills was observed in fish exposed to effluent in both STPs. Gene expression analysis carried out in Kappala showed increased concentrations of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A5 and CYP1C3) transcripts in gills and of CYP1As in liver of fish exposed to effluent. In fish exposed to GAC- or ozone-treated effluent water, gill EROD activity and expression of CYP1As and CYP1C3 in gills and liver were generally equal to or below levels in fish held in tap water. The joint application of chemical analysis and sensitive biomarkers proved useful for evaluating contaminant removal in STPs with new technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, including antimicrobials, can be found at trace levels in treated wastewater effluent. Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, Vibrio, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of similar to 5 ppm) can induce a significant Vibrio growth response (68-1,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial -community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of Vibrio in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels.

AB More than 400 new nitrogen containing products were detected upon experimental sunlight photolysis of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). These products were presumably formed through covalent binding of CBZ phototransformation products with DOM molecules. About 50% of these newly formed bound residues contained one nitrogen atom and had a molecular mass between 375 and 525 Da, which was 150 to 200 Da higher than for an average DOM molecule. In addition, a previously unknown CBZ phototransformation product, 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (3-QCA), was identified by liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). 3-QCA was likely formed through oxidative ring cleavage and subsequent decarboxylation of acridine, a well-known phototransformation product of CBZ. Collision induced dissociation experiments and Kendrick mass defect analyses corroborated that about 160 of the new products were formed via covalent binding of 3-QCA with DOM molecules of above-average O/C and H/C ratios. Experiments at lower CBZ concentration suggested that the importance of bound residue formation increases with increasing DOM/CBZ ratios. Photochemically induced bound residue formation of polar contaminants with DOM in the aqueous phase is thus a disregarded pathway along which contaminants can be transformed in the environment. The method presented here offers a new possibility to study the formation of bound residues, which may be of relevance also for other transformation processes in natural waters where radical intermediates are generated.

AB The potential risk of pharmaceuticals in the environment to top-predators is still largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the immunotoxic effects of ten pharmaceuticals individually and as mixtures on a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) B lymphoma cell line. A significant reduction in lymphocyte transformation was observed following an exposure to 12,500 mu g/L 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and 25,000 mu g/L naproxen. Exposure to 12,500 mu g/L 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol decreased the percentage of cell in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle while increasing the percentage of cells in the S phase. Carbamazepine exposure increased the amount of cells in the G(2)/M phase. Binary mixtures showed synergistic effects in lymphocyte transformation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Concentrations inducing toxic effects in the cell line were similar to those affecting fish in previous studies. A reduction of functional activities of the immune system may lead to altered host resistance to pathogens in free-ranging pinnipeds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals, such as beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as their metabolites are introduced into the water cycle via municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in all industrialized countries. As the amino acid sequences of the biological target molecules of these pharmaceuticals the beta-1 adrenergic receptor for beta-blockers and the cyclooxygenase for NSAIDs - are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrates it is reasonable that wildlife vertebrates including fish physiologically respond in a similar way to them as documented in humans. Consequently, beta-blockers and NSAIDs both exhibit their effects according to their mode of action on one hand, but on the other hand that may lead to unwanted side effects in non-target species. To determine whether residuals of beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase inhibitors may pose a risk to aquatic organisms, one has to know the extent to which such organisms respond to the total of active compounds, their metabolites and transformation products with the same modes of action. To cope with this demand, two cell-based assays were developed, by which the total beta-blocker and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity can be assessed in a given wastewater or surface water extract in real time. The measured activity is quantified as metoprolol equivalents (MetEQ) of the lead substance metoprolol in the beta-blocker assay, and diclofenac equivalents (DicEQ) in the NSAID assay. Even though MetEQs and DicEQs were found to surpass the concentration of the respective lead substances (metoprolol, diclofenac), as determined by chemical analysis by a factor of two to three, this difference was shown to be reasonably explained by the presence and action of additional active compounds with the same mode of action in the test samples. Thus, both in vitro assays were proven to integrate effectively over beta-blocker and NSAID activities in WWTP effluents in a very sensitive and extremely rapid manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of 4 typical pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), i.e. clofibric acid (CFA), triclosan (TCS), carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) in sewage sludge was investigated during anaerobic digestions (ADs) under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The performances of ADs were enhanced with ultrasonic, mechanical rotary disc or enzymatic treatments. Ultrasonic pre-treatment could enhance the performances on the removal of PhACs better than ultrasonic post-treatment. CFA, TCS, CBZ, and DCF were finally reduced by 73%, 76%, 73%, and 64%, respectively, during thermophilic AD (TAD) combined with ultrasonic pre-treatment for 30 min at sound energy density 0.05 W/mL at SRT 15 d. For ADs combined with rotary disc pre-treatment or post-treatment, the removal of PhACs would be improved by less than 10%. Three selected enzymes, papain, cellulose and lysozyme showed different effects on the removal of PhACs during ADs. TCS could obtain the best removal, which was up to 82% and 81% in mesophilic AD (MAD) and TAD processes enhanced with lysozyme at SRT 15 d. On the whole, the increases on SRTs would improve the removal of PhACs during ADs and also the enhancement with enzymolyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that can be used as a marker for the cleaning efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. Here, we present the optimization of a fast and easy on-site measurement system based on fluorescence polarization immunoassay and the successful application to wastewater. A new monoclonal highly specific anti-carbamazepine antibody was applied. The automated assay procedure takes 16 min and does not require sample preparation besides filtration. The recovery rates for carbamazepine in wastewater samples were between 60.8 and 104% with good intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variations (less than 15 and 10%, respectively). This automated assay enables for the on site measurement of carbamazepine in wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water authorities and drinking water companies are challenged with the question if, where and how to abate contaminants of emerging concern in the urban water cycle. The most effective strategy under given conditions is often unclear to these stakeholders as it requires insight into several aspects of the contaminants such as sources, properties, and mitigation options. Furthermore the various parties in the urban water cycle are not always aware of each other's requirements and priorities. Processes to set priorities and come to agreements are lacking, hampering the articulation and implementation of possible solutions. To support decision makers with this task, a decision support system was developed to serve as a point of departure for getting the relevant stakeholders together and finding common ground. The decision support system was iteratively developed in stages. Stakeholders were interviewed and a decision support system prototype developed. Subsequently, this prototype was evaluated by the stakeholders and adjusted accordingly. The iterative process lead to a final system focused on the management of contaminants of emerging concern within the urban water cycle, from wastewater, surface water and groundwater to drinking water, that suggests mitigation methods beyond technical solutions. Possible wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques in combination with decentralised and nontechnical methods were taken into account in an integrated way. The system contains background information on contaminants of emerging concern such as physical/chemical characteristics, toxicity and legislative frameworks, water cycle entrance pathways and a database with associated possible mitigation methods. Monitoring data can be uploaded to assess environmental and human health risks in a specific water system. The developed system was received with great interest by potential users, and implemented in an international water cycle network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption with activated carbon is widely suggested as an option for the removal of organic micro pollutants including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. In this study adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) was analyzed and compared in parallel operation at three Swedish wastewater treatment plants with the goal to achieve a 95% PhAC removal. Initially, mapping of the prevalence of over 100 substances was performed at each plant and due to low concentrations a final 22 were selected for further evaluation. These include carbamazepine, clarithromycin and diclofenac, which currently are discussed for regulation internationally. A number of commercially available activated carbon products were initially screened using effluent wastewater. Of these, a reduced set was selected based on adsorption characteristics and cost. Experiments designed with the selected carbons in pilot-scale showed that most products could indeed remove PhACs to the target level, both on total and individual basis. In a setup using internal recirculation the PAC system achieved a 95% removal applying a fresh dose of 15-20 mg/L, while carbon usage rates for the GAC application were much broader and ranged from <28 to 230 mg/L depending on the carbon product. The performance of the PAC products generally gave better results for individual PhACs in regards to carbon availability. All carbon products showed a specific adsorption for a specific PhAC meaning that knowledge of the target pollutants must be acquired before successful design of a treatment system. In spite of different configurations and operating conditions of the different wastewater treatment plants no considerable differences regarding pharmaceutical removal were observed.

AB The fate of four antimicrobials (cefadroxil, CFD; metronidazole, METRO; trimethoprim, TRI; sulfamethoxazole, SMX) was studied in Lemna minor systems and the role of different mechanisms on their removal was evaluated. All micropollutants were significantly removed in batch experiments with active Lemna minor; the highest removal was observed for CFD (100% in 14 d), followed by METRO (96%), SMX (73%) and TRI (59%) during 24 d of the experiment. Calculation of kinetic constants for hydrolysis, photodegradadon, sorption to biomass and plant uptake revealed significant differences depending on the compound and the studied mechanism. For METRO, TRI and SMX the kinetic constants of plant uptake were by far higher comparing to those of the other mechanisms. The transformation products of antimicrobials were identified using UHPLC-QToF-MS. Two were the main degradation pathways for TRI; hydroxylation takes place during both phyto- and photodegradation, while demethylation occurs only in absence of Lemna minor. The operation of a continuous-flow duckweed system showed METRO and TRI removal equal to 71 +/- 11% and 61 +/- 8%, respectively. The application of mass balance and the use of published biodegradation constants showed that plant uptake and biodegradation were the major mechanisms governing METRO removal; the most important mechanism for TRI was, plant uptake.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an important source of pharmaceuticals released into the environment. Understanding how various pharmaceuticals are distributed and handled in WWIPs is a prerequisite to optimize their abatement. Here we investigated the spatial distribution and removal efficiencies pharmaceuticals in China's WWTPs. A total of 35 pharmaceuticals in wastewater samples from 12 WVVTPs at different cities of China were analyzed. Among these detected pharmaceuticals, caffeine showed the highest concentration (up to 1775.98 ng L-1) in the WIMP influent. In addition, there were significant regional differences in pharmaceutical distribution with higher influent concentrations of total pharmaceuticals detected in WVtrFPs in the northern cities than the southern ones. The state-of-the-art treatment processes were generally inefficient in removing pharmaceuticals. Only 14.3% of pharmaceuticals were removed effectively (mean removal efficiency > 70%), while 51.4% had a removal rate of below 30%. The anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (AA0)-membrane bioreactor (MBR) integrated process and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) showed better performance than the MO and oxidation ditch (OD) processes:Ofloxacin, erythromycin-H2O, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and sulfamethoxazole in WWlP effluents exhibited a high or medium ecological risk and deserved special attention.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are being detected widely in the aquatic environment due to their global consumption. Some ecotoxicological studies have revealed their implication in different toxic effects and the only mechanism available nowadays to combat with this problem are the wastewater treatment plants, which in function of the system employed seem to be more successful in the pharmaceuticals degradation. The contribution of adsorption and bio-degradation to the overall removal was estimated to be the main reason for their elimination from the environment. For that reason, in this paper the biological degradation, sorption and mass balance in a conventional activate sludge (CAS) WWTP are evaluated. Among of the pharmaceutical studied (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), the most of them (except carbamazepine), had an extraordinary degradation (>80,6). The percentages of the elimination due to microorganism degradation in the secondary treatment, was estimated for all of the pharmaceutical and it was observed that it was very important for ketoprofen and ibuprofen, while for the others pharmaceutical the sorption onto sludge was most predominant that biodegradation in order to eliminate them from the water.

AB Research on employing advanced oxidation processes (A0P5) for pharmaceuticals removal is gaining interests. However, detrimental effects of background water constituents in complex water matrices are limiting their implementation. In this study, we report red light induced methylene blue photosensitization (MB/Red-light) as a promising alternative for pharmaceuticals removal from wastewater, because of its potential to overcome detrimental effects of background water constituents as experienced in other AOP technologies. In this study, the efficacy of MB/Red-light on degradation of four pharmaceutical compounds, i.e. diclofenac (DFN), metoprolol (MTP), propranolol (PRP) and sulfamethoxazole (SFZ), was investigated. The MB/Red-light photosensitization enabled degradation of three model compounds, i.e. DFN, PRP and SFZ. Degradation rates followed the order of DFN > PRP > SFZ. Singlet oxygen was found to be crucial in pharmaceuticals degradation, and another additional mechanism, i.e. a direct reaction with triplet MB,. also contributed to DFN degradation. The presence of two DFN degradation mechanisms were confirmed by UV-vis light absorbance spectra measurement as well as the identification of degradation products by LC-MS/MS. Effects of three common back ground water constituents were examined to assess the applicability of MB/red-light system in complex water matrices, which suggests that the MB/red-light system has great potential to be used in real wastewater. Higher pH was found to impose positive impact on the efficacy of the proposed system. Last but not least, red light LED is an optimum light source for the proposed MB/Red-light system, because the light emission spectrum of the LED used in this study fits well with the light absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer-methylene blue.

AB The removal of pharmaceutically active compounds by powdered activated carbon (PAC) in municipal wastewater is a promising solution to the problem of polluted recipient waters. Today, an efficient design strategy is however lacking with regard to high-level overall, and specific, substance removal in the large scale. The performance of PAC-based removal of pharmaceuticals was studied in pilot-scale with respect to the critical parameters; contact time and PAC dose using one PAC product selected by screening in bench-scale. The goal was a minimum of 95% removal of the pharmaceuticals present in the evaluated municipal wastewater. A set of 21 pharmaceuticals was selected from an initial 100 due to their high occurrence in the effluent water of two selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Sweden, whereof candidates discussed for future EU regulation directives were included. By using recirculation of PAC over a treatment system using three sequential contact tanks, a combination of the benefits of powdered and granular carbon performance was achieved. The treatment system was designed so that recirculation could be introduced to any of the three tanks to investigate the effect of recirculation on the adsorption performance. This was compared to use of the setup, but without recirculation. A higher degree of pharmaceutical removal was achieved in all recirculation setups, both overall and with respect to specific substances, as compared to without recirculation. Recirculation was tested with nominal contact times of 30, 60 and 120 min and the goal of 95% removal could be achieved already at the shortest contact times at a PAC dose of 10-15 mg/L. In particular, the overall removal could be increased even to 97% and 99%, at 60 and 120 min, respectively, when the recirculation point was the first tank. Recirculation of PAC to either the first or the second contact tank proved to be comparable, while a slightly lower performance was observed with recirculation to the third tank. With regards to individual substances, clarithromycin and diclofenac were ubiquitously removed according to the set goal and in contrast, a few substances (fluconazole, irbesartan, memantine and venlafaxine) required specific settings to reach an acceptable removal.

AB Enzymatic treatment can effectively degrade recalcitrant micro-pollutants in wastewater. However, its industrial application is constrained by the high cost of the purified enzyme preparations. This work introduces a novel technique to directly immobilize the in-house crude enzyme extracts (from P. ostreatus) onto the functionalized TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Comprehensive investigations were carried out to understand the interactions between complex crude enzyme extracts and the immobilization support. By simple dilution of the crude enzyme extract, the immobilization efficiency can be significantly improved. The resultant biocatalytic nanoparticles had comparable performance to the immobilized purified commercial enzymes. Finally, the micropollutant degradation capability of the biocatalytic nanoparticles was demonstrated with two micro-pollutants, namely, bisphenol-A and carbamazepine, commonly detected in sewage. The efficient laccase extraction and immobilization on biocatalytic nanoparticles show great promise as a cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment processes for recalcitrant micro-pollutants.

AB Surface water from 38 streams nationwide was assessed using 14 target-organic methods (719 compounds). Designed-bioactive anthropogenic contaminants (biocides, pharmaceuticals) comprised 57% of 406 organics detected at least once. The 10 most-frequently detected anthropogenicorganics included eight pesticides (desulfinylfipronil, AMPA, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, metolachlor, atrazine, CIAT, glyphosate) and two pharmaceuticals (caffeine, metformin) with detection frequencies ranging 66-84% of.all sites. Detected contaminant concentrations varied from less than 1 ng L-1 to greater than 10 mu g L-1, with 77 and 278 having median detected concentrations greater than 100 mu g L-1 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Cumulative detections and concentrations ranged 4-161 compounds (median 70) and 8.5-102 847 mu g L-1, respectively, and correlated significantly with wastewater discharge, watershed development, and toxic release inventory metrics. Log10 concentrations of widely monitored HHCB, triclosan, and carbamazepine explained 71-82% of the variability in the total number of compounds detected (linear regression; p-values: < 0.001-0.012), providing a statistical inference tool for unmonitored contaminants. Due to multiple modes of action, high bioactivity, biorecalcitrance, and direct environment application (pesticides), designed-bioactive organics (median 41 per site at fig L-1 cumulative concentrations) in developed watersheds present aquatic health concerns, given their acknowledged potential for sublethal "effects to sensitive species and lifecycle stages at low ng L-1.

AB Heavy metals and microbiological contamination were investigated in groundwater in the industrial and coastal city of Thoothukudi. The main sources of drinking water in this area are water bores which are dug up to the depth of 10-50 m in almost every house. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. The study consists of the determination of physico-chemical properties, trace metals, heavy metals and microbiological quality of drinking water. Heavy metals were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and compared with the (WHO in Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) standards. The organic contamination was detected in terms of most probable number (MPN) test in order to find out faecal coliforms that were identified through biochemical tests. A comparison of the results of groundwater samples with WHO guidelines reveals that most of the groundwater samples are heavily contaminated with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium, lead, boron, aluminium, iron and vanadium. The selenium level was higher than 0.01 mg/l in 82 % of the study area and the arsenic concentration exceeded 0.01 mg/l in 42 % of the area. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to the discharge of effluents from copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant and sea food industries. The results showed that there are pollutions for the groundwater, and the total Coliform means values ranged from 0.6-145 MPN ml(-1), faecal Coliform ranged from 2.2-143 MPN ml(-1), Escherichia coli ranged from 0.9 to 40 MPN ml(-1) and faecal streptococci ranged from 10-9.20 x 10(2) CFU ml(-1). The coastal regions are highly contaminated with total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.

AB The paper proposes discussions of some concrete datasets resulted for three solutions of wastewaters management systems applied in case of a Romanian petroleum chemical company. These management options, differing especially in type (centralized or decentralized system) and wastewaters treatment system, were emphasized, mainly by real datasets on treatment performance, polluting species removals, risk of some residuals in treated effluents and natural watercourse nearby, but also environmental impact assessment, using the alternative methodology of global pollution index (I*(Gp)). Interpreting datasets based on in-time analyzed physical-chemical quality indicators and river characteristics, it was estimated the standard quality classification of receiving watercourse as 'medium' (water quality indices, WQI = 55.58 - 67.47), affected more or less by treated effluents discharged in it. The environmental risks of some selected residuals in treated effluents and natural aquatic receptor were assessed by the risk quotient (RQ) which appreciated the risk of residuals toward aquatic life as no to low-medium level, with few exceptions. The impact assessment results conclude an admissible pollution status of natural water receptor due to company wastewaters mechanical-chemical-biological treatment plant activities, in decentralized (I*(Gp) = 1.73) and centralized (I*(Gp) =1.83) system, but generating discomfort effects to aquatic life due to only mechanical-chemical treatment plant operating in decentralized system (I*(Gp) =2.205). Direct discharge of un-treated industrial wastewaters had been interdicted. These real results underline that decentralized systems are reliable, qualitatively efficient and costly effective, offering long-term solution, and that all wastewaters management strategies of petroleum chemical company had been adapted to specific on-site functioning situations.

AB Microalgae are aquatic photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms which cultivation for the fixation of CO2 and the production of biofuels has received large attention. However, the sustainable development of an algal biorefinery is still a challenge. In this context, the valorization of microalgae biomass for a wastewater adsorptive treatment may be an option to explore. Recently, the presence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in natural waters and the associated risks have led to a great concern, especially in the case of pharmaceuticals. In the present work, the elimination of paracetamol from water by biosorption onto microalgae, namely Synechocystis sp., has been studied. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters have been determined and compared with those obtained when using a commercial activated carbon under the same experimental conditions. Although the adsorption kinetics are very similar onto both materials, at the equilibrium, the Langmuir maximum capacity of the activated carbon (278 mg g(-1)) is five times higher than that of Synechocystis sp. (53 mg g(-1)). In any case, it must be considered that the utilization of microalgae may be considered an environmentally friendly process with important associated savings.

AB The composition of wastewater produced in industrial processes can vary dynamically and often randomly. immediate intervention is necessary to preserve the water quality before any parameter of the wastewater exceeds the threshold limit; therefore, the parameters of the wastewater must he determined in real time. Direct laboratory methods have long lead times; indirect methods (refraction, pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc.) would be suitable as they measure indirect values, so correlations must be found between the measured values and the component(s) for analysis. These correlations are often stochastic in nature having a standard deviation of the same magnitude as the measured values. This paper deals with pharmaceutical wastewater with a high sucrose content, the online measurement of its organic material content characterised by chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), refraction and resistance. It finds a correlation between the CODcr and resistance-corrected refraction (r*). To reduce the standard deviation, the concept of cumulative CODcr is introduced. Concentration limit values could be determined to compare with the cumulative CODcr values calculated continuously during the fill up of the wastewater tank. This means that the treatment with the wastewater (into the drain, dilution and transfer) can be decided. The validity of the model is checked by trial calculations based on a high number of measurements.

AB Environmental protection is one of the today's most important concerns, therefore, firms are expected to reduce their environmental loads continuously whilst enhancing their productivity. In our study, a procedure was developed to manage the wastewater of a pharmaceutical process. The parameters of the wastewater, which flows into the sewerage system, are generally below the permitted threshold values, but occasionally exceed the limits. To improve this situation, online measuring equipment was deployed to estimate chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) on the basis of the sugar content of an aqueous solution (BRIX) refractometric method. A mathematical model was developed for data processing and a control module was designed for the decisions. The measuring module was tested for 45 d. The data received were used for testing and monitoring the control module. During the test period it was found that the volume of the water requiring transfer for CODcr removal fell by 50%, whilst no water with parameters above the threshold value flowed into the sewerage system.

AB The removal of Tricaine Methanesulfonate from water in a fixed-bed column packed with pyrolysed paper mill sludge was evaluated for application in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems. Breakthrough adsorption curves were determined for this pharmaceutical, under different operating conditions. In a laboratory scale approach, with synthetic effluent, a bed adsorption capacity of 125 mg g(-1) was obtained under a flux of 56 L min(-1) m(-2), with 400 mg L-1 of MS-222 with 4.5 cm bed depth. The performance of the continuous adsorption in a column packed with biological paper mill sludge-based carbon, using real aquaculture wastewater as matrix, was not significantly affected. Then, scale-up was carried out and the bed depth service time model was applied and provided good predictions. Finally, the thermal regeneration of the exhausted adsorbent was assessed, which revealed satisfactory results for one cycle reusability after saturation; however, considering the nature of its precursor, the use of new adsorbent could be more profitable than its regeneration, functioning also as an additional option for the management of such wastes, (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fabrication of less-fouling and high performance membrane is essential to offer significant cost reductions in membrane bioreactor (MBR) processes. In this regard, nanodiamond (ND) embedded cellulose acetate (CA) nanocomposite membrane was prepared and characterized in a lab-scale submerged MBR system for treating of pharmaceutical wastewater. In order to achieve efficient dispersion and providing more hydrophilic property, NDs were functionalized via heat treatment method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurements were used to determine the surface properties of membranes. To compare the nanocomposite membranes with a pure CA membrane, critical flux, fouling behavior, and anti-fouling properties against extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were investigated. SEM images showed that in the presence of 0.5 wt% of functionalized ND nanoparticles, porous structure appears on the membrane surfaces. The obtained results showed that in presence of functionalized NDs; ND-COOH, surface hydrophilicity of nanocomposite membrane was much higher than that of pristine CA membrane. Higher critical flux was obtained by CA/ND-COOH (0.5 wt.% of NDs) nanocomposite membrane due to the change of surface characteristics. The filamentous bacteria in the MBR resulted in more foulants on the CA membrane surface, while less filamentous bacteria were attached on the CA/ND-COOH nanocomposite membrane. Analysis of extractable EPS showed that the concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates in the EPS and soluble microbial products (SMP) for CA/ND-COOH (0.5 wt.%) membrane are less than other membranes. Also, COD removal for all of the membranes was higher than 90%, whereas only 83.4% removal efficiency was reached in the activated sludge.

AB High concentrations of antibiotics in wastewater can promote antibiotic resistance during -biological wastewater treatment. In this work, ozonation was evaluated regarding its removal efficiency of -antibiotic, antimicrobial activity, and antibiotic resistance selection potency from oxytetracycline (OTC) production wastewater. Doses of 0.4 and 1.2 mg O-3 per mg of initial OTC permitted 100% and 92% OTC removal from OTC solution (OTC, 10 mg/L) and OTC production waste mother liquor (OTC, 702 mg/L), respectively. With the removal of OTC, the OTC solution lost its antibacterial -activity against Streptococcus aureus. The antibiotic resistance selection potency of OTC before and after ozonation was also evaluated. When activated sludge was exposed to OTC (10 mg/L) solution for 18 d, the OTC-resistant bacteria ratio increased from 2.0% to 28.2%, and the relative abundances of tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(X)) and class 1 integron increased from 1.01% to 5.36% (p < 0.05). However, no significant change of OTC resistance was observed in activated sludge exposed to ozonated OTC solution, implying that the antibiotic resistance selection potency of OTC was alleviated by ozonation. This study demonstrated that ozonation can reduce antibiotic resistance selection potency from OTC production wastewater with a reasonable ozone dose.

AB Fenamates are a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are not fully removed during wastewater treatment and can be released to surface waters. Here, near-surface photochemical half-lives were evaluated to range from minutes to hours of four fenamates and the closely related diclofenac. While quantum yields for direct photochemical reactions at the water surface vary widely from 0.071 for diclofenac to < 0.001 for mefenamic acid, all fenamates showed significant reactivity towards singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 1.3-2.8 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) and 1.1-2.7 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Photodecay rates increased in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for diclofenac (+ 19%), tolfenamic acid (+ 9%), and mefenamic acid (+ 95%), but decreased for flufenamic acid (- 2%) and meclofenamic acid (- 14%) after accounting for light screening effects. Fast reaction rate constants of all NSAIDs with model triplet sensitizers were quantified by laser flash photolysis. Here, the direct observation of diphenylamine radical intermediates by transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates one-electron oxidation of all fenamates. Quenching rate constants of these radical intermediates by ascorbic acid, a model antioxidant, were also quantified. These observations suggest that the balance of oxidation by photoexcited triplet DOM and quenching of the formed radical intermediates by antioxidant moieties determines whether net sensitization or net quenching by DOM occurs in the photochemical degradation of fenamates.

AB An artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium was used to remediate a mixture of analgesics (ketoprofen, paracetamol and aspirin) in a stirred-tank photobioreactor. A hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days supported poor treatment because of the formation of p-aminophenol (paracetamol toxic metabolite). Increasing the HRT to 4 days enhanced the bioremediation efficiency. After applying an acclimatization regime, 95% removal of the analgesics mixture, p-aminophenol and COD reduction were achieved. However, shortening the HRT again to 3 days neither improved the COD reduction nor ketoprofen removal. Applying continuous illumination achieved the best analgesics removal results. The harvested biomass contained 50% protein, which included almost all essential amino acids. The detected fatty acid profile suggested the harvested biomass to be a good biodiesel-producing candidate. The water-extractable fraction possessed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. These findings suggest the whole process to be an integrated eco-friendly and cost-efficient strategy for remediating pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) can be used to reduce various pollutants present in livestock wastewater, such as organic matter, nutrients and metals. Very recently these systems have also been used to remove the so called emergent pollutants. These pollutants can be harmful for both microorganisms and plants, two key players in CWs removal processes. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to assess the influence of emergent pollutants, namely antibiotics, on the removal of pollutants from livestock wastewaters, as antibiotics might decrease CWs performance for the treatment of this type of wastewater.
   Microcosms (0.4m x 0.3 m x 0.3 m), simulating CWs, were assembled with Phragmites australis to treat livestock wastewater not doped or doped with 100 mu g/L of enrofloxacin and/or of ceftiofur, two antibiotics commonly used in livestock industry. Four different treatments (Control, Enr, Cef and Mix) were tested, each in triplicate. Wastewater was treated during one-week cycle, after which it was removed and replaced by new wastewater (doped or not), in a total of 8 cycles. At weeks 1,2,4 and 8 treated wastewater was collected and analysed to determine removal rates of nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate), organic matter (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD)), and solids (including total suspended solids (TSS)), as well as, veterinary antibiotics (enrofloxacin and ceftiofur).
   High removal rates (up to 90% depending of the parameter) were observed independently of the presence of the veterinary antibiotics, which were also significantly removed from the wastewater. Generally, measured parameters presented values lower than those expressed in the legislation for wastewater discharge into the aquatic environment.
   Present results indicate that, in tested conditions, the presence of veterinary antibiotics, namely enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, did not influence significantly the biochemical removal processes that occur naturally in CWs during treatment of livestock wastewater, the systems maintaining their performance. Therefore, CWs are a valuable alternative to remove pollutants, including antibiotics, from livestock wastewaters, reducing the impact of this type of effluents into the environment. In addition, this technology can be an efficient/economically viable technology to meet the current wastewater reuse challenges. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glucocorticoid (GC) release into the environment has led to widespread detection of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity in water resources that has been shown to persist throughout conventional and some advanced wastewater treatment processes. Here, we used high performance liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore the reaction of natural (cortisone, cortisol) and synthetic (prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone) GCs with free chlorine (HOCl) to simulate their fate during chemical disinfection of water and wastewater. Generally, GCs react slowly (t(1/2) similar to 7-200 h) with HOCl when compared to other steroid classes, but they yield complex mixtures of transformation products, with at times the majority of product mass comprising structurally identifiable and likely bioactive steroids. For example, we frequently observed chlorination at the C-9 position (e.g., 9-chloro-prednisone), a reaction known to increase GC activity 4-fold. We also identified reaction products in the adrenosterone family of androgens produced via cleavage of the C-17 side-chain on many GCs. Another common transformation pathway was the conversion of endogenous GCs to their more potent synthetic analogs via oxidation at the C-1/C-2 positions, with unsaturation reported to increase GR activity 4-fold (e.g., cortisol to prednisolone). Despite identification of such products, in vitro assays generally suggest GR activity decreases with extent of parent decay during chlorination. Cortisol was the exception, with GR activity only decreasing 2-fold in product mixtures (based on measured EC50 values) despite a 95% reduction in parent concentration, a result attributable to formation of the more potent prednisolone during chlorination. Furthermore, our assay likely underestimates product bioactivity as it did not account for the activity of several identified GC byproducts that first require in vivo activation via C-11 reduction, nor did it consider androgen receptor (AR) activity associated with byproducts from the adrenosterone family. To avoid formation of product mixtures with conserved bioactivity, advanced chemical oxidation processes may represent a more promising approach; we show that GCs react much more rapidly with ozone (t(1/2) similar to 0.4-1.3 min) and produce no observable UV-active products. This suggests disruption of the GC conjugated p-electron and ring systems, thereby likely mitigating biological activity.

AB In the biofilm wastewater treatment process, the start-up period of biofilm process is affected by the biofilm formation on the surface of carriers. Controlling surface charge property of carriers could accelerate the biofilm formation. The surface of conventional biofilm carriers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is negatively charged, as is the surface of bacterial cells of activated sludge, which could lead to electrostatic repulsion between the biofilm carriers and the bacteria. Herein, the conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE) carriers were modified by two kinds of positively charged polymers with different charge strength, which were noted as polyquaternium-10 (PQAS-10) and cationicpolyacrylamides (CPAM), respectively, to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based wastewater treatment process. The results showed that the positive Zeta potential was measured on the surface of modified carriers, whereas the surface Zeta potential of unmodified carriers was negative. It indicated that the modified carriers carried positive charge. Furthermore, the positive charge on the modified PQAS-10 carriers was higher than that on the modified CPAM carriers. The reactor with modified PQAS-10 carriers achieved shorter reactor start-up time and higher attached biomass compared to that with unmodified carriers and modified CPAM carriers. As a result, the removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N and TN in the reactor with the modified carriers were higher than that with the unmodified carriers. These findings demonstrated that the success of electrophilic modification on the surface of carriers was expected to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based reactors and improve the reactor performance in the practical application.

AB In this work electrogenerated active chlorine was used to treat fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics that is highly consumed and frequently found in waste and natural waters. Taking into account the structural variety and diverse molecular forms of these pharmaceuticals, their structure-reactivity relationship toward active chlorine was studied. Three representative fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and levofloxacin were considered. Despite structural differences, the primary by-products evidenced that the major reactive part of fluoroquinolones was the piperazyl ring. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were degraded faster than levofloxacin, due to the fact that secondary amines on ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were more reactive toward active chlorine than tertiary amines on levofloxacin. The reactivity of cationic and neutral fdrms of the fluoroquinolones was also evaluated using both experimental and theoretical procedures. Experimental results evidenced that the neutral forms have higher degradation rates than the cationic structures. Theoretical analysis of net charge on atoms (obtained by the natural bonding orbitals method) indicated that the reactive moieties on the neutral form of antibiotics have a high nudeophilicity. Therefore, this form is more susceptible to electrophilic attacks by chlorine species than the cationic one. Additionally, the environmental impact was evaluated considering the evolution of antimicrobial activity and its correlation with the antibiotics transformations. Finally, simulated hospital wastewater containing norfloxacin was treated. The electrogenerated active chlorine removed 100% of the antimicrobial activity in a short period (40 min), indicating that this system is an interesting option for treating hospital wastewaters and decreasing the negative environmental impact of the input of fluoroquinolones into natural media.

AB In the present study a biological "in vivo" assay, with freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus, was used to define and evaluate the potential impact of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) wastewaters on local wildlife. Samples of both untreated and mechanically and biologically treated WWTP wastewater, were tested in the presence and absence of the formulated sediment for their lethal and sublethal effects. Chronic exposures to wastewater samples caused concentration dependent reduced locomotion, body pigmentation and molting frequency in exposed organisms. The observed effects indicate the overall toxicity and endocrine disruption of the wastewater samples. In contrast stimulations of the feeding rate and growth rate of the test organisms during the chronic exposure to sublethal levels of wastewater samples were observed, indicating an improvement in nutritional quality of the wastewater. The most sensitive exposure endpoint was molting frequency of tested organisms, which indicated the presence of estrogenically active endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Raw wastewater caused up to 42% molting frequency reduction of exposed A. aquaticus when exposed to five times diluted untreated wastewater sample, while undiluted treated wastewater caused a 61% molting frequency reduction. The presence of estrogenically active compounds in the wastewater was confirmed with the yeast estrogen screen assay (YES test), which assigned the highest estrogenic activity to a mechanically and biologically treated wastewater sample, and lower estrogenic activity to all other tested samples. The importance of presence of the formulated sediment was determined, as it lessened the effects of all WWTP wastewater samples in all observed exposures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large number of emerging contaminants (ECs) are known to persist in surface waters, and create pressure on wastewater treatment works (WWTW) for their effective removal. Although a large database for the levels of these pollutants in water systems exist globally, there is still a lack in the correlation of the levels of these pollutants with possible long-term adverse health effects in wildlife and humans, such as endocrine disruption. The current study detected a total of 55 ECs in WWTW influent surface water, 41 ECs in effluent, and 40 ECs in environmental waters located upstream and downstream of the plant. A list of ECs persisted through the WWTW process, with 28% of all detected ECs removed by less than 50%, and 18% of all ECs were removed by less than 25%. Negative mass balances of some pharmaceuticals and metabolites were observed within the WWTW, suggesting possible back -transformation of ECs during wastewater treatment. Three parental illicit drug compounds were detected within the influent of the WWTW, with concentrations ranging between 27.6 and 147.0 ng L-1 for cocaine, 35.6-120.6 ng L-1 for mephedrone, and 270.9-450.2 ng L-1 for methamphetamine. The related environmental risks are also discussed for some ECs, with particular reference to their ability to disrupt endocrine systems. The current study propose the potential of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen to be regarded as priority ECs for environmental monitoring due to their regular detection andpersistence in environmental waters and their possible contribution towards adverse health effects in humans and wildlife.

AB Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used pharmaceutical products with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects that are consistently detected in municipal wastewater systems and in municipal biosolids. Land application of biosolids and irrigation with reclaimed wastewater introduces these compounds into agricultural environments, which is an emerging issue of concern for ecosystem health. In this study, the sorption-desorption behaviour of four commonly consumed NSAIDs, including naproxen (NPX), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KTF), and diclofenac (DCF), was examined in a loam textured soil exposed to either an individual-compound or a mixture of the four NSAIDs. The proportion of NSAIDs adsorbed to the soil in the mixture-compound system was 72%, 55%, 50% and 45%, for diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen, respectively, and differed slightly from the individual compound adsorption. Diclofenac displayed strong sorption and low desorption in both the individual compound and mixture-compound systems. Naproxen and ibuprofen exhibited significant differences between the adsorption isotherms of the individual-compound and mixture-compound systems. Results of this study highlight differences in the sorption behaviour of NSAIDs, when present as mixtures, possibly through multilayer bonding effects or complexation with cationic metals or organo-clays from the soil. Soil organic matter (SOM) may have played a role in determining some of the interactions between the compounds but other factors associated with the mixture-compound system, such as cation bridging or multilayer cooperative adsorption. Desorption data suggests that the mechanisms involved in binding NSAIDs to the soil surface are also influence by the presence of other compounds in a mixture. A reduction in desorption was observed for all four NSAIDs in the mixture-compound system relative to the individual-compound system, but were greatest for naproxen and ibuprofen. The sorption-desorption hysteresis increased for naproxen and ibuprofen in the mixture-compound system. This study suggests that cooperative adsorption plays a role in the interaction of NSAIDs when present as mixtures rather than as individual compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential for nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) in secondary effluent reclamation is noteworthy, but both processes require extensive pre-treatment to prevent membrane fouling and promote system longevity. In this study, performance of direct ultrafiltration (UF) and tertiary membrane bioreactors (tMBRs) as feed pretreatments were assessed on a pilot scale. Both technologies achieved high organic matter removal (87 and 93% for UF and tMBR, respectively). Differences in efficiencies were related to suspended biomass in the tMBR, which enhanced degradation of the dissolved organic substances (<5 mg/L) and also stabilized process performance by minimizing residual fouling. Whichever pre-treatment was applied, RO reached higher rejection coefficients and low fouling levels. Nevertheless, lower normalized flux (12%) was achieved when the UF effluent was fed due to high concentration of organic substances. Membrane autopsies by scanning electron microscopy with dispersive X-ray and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed that organic fouling appears to be predominant on both NF/RO membranes. The main organic foulants identified were polysaccharides and proteins. Inorganic foulants mainly consisted of calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Complete removal of pharmaceutical active compounds was observed for RO, while NF presented moderate retention coefficients (94, 85, 70, and 27% for atenolol, paraxanthine, caffeine and clofibric acid, respectively).

AB Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely consumed by humans as it possesses analgesic activities. A selective molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for ketoprofen was synthesized and applied as a solid-phase extraction sorbent. MIP was synthesized using 2-vinylpyridine, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), toluene/acetonitrile (9:1, v/v), and ketoprofen as a functional monomer, cross-linker, initiator, porogenic mixture, and template, respectively. The polymerization was performed at 60 degrees C for 16 h, and thereafter the temperature was increased to 80 degrees C for 24 h to achieve a solid monolith polymer. Nonimprinted polymer was synthesized in a similar manner with the omission of ketoprofen. Characterization with thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction showed that the synthesized polymers were thermally stable and amorphous. Solid-phase extraction cartridges packed with MIP were used with high-performance liquid chromatography for quantitative analysis of ketoprofen in wastewater. The analytical method gave detection limits of 0.23, 0.17, and 0.09 mu g/L in wastewater influent, effluent, and deionized water, respectively. The recovery for the wastewater influent and effluent spiked with 5 a of ketoprofen was 68%, whereas 114% was obtained for deionized water. The concentrations of ketoprofen in the influent and effluent samples were in the ranges of 22.5-34.0 and 1.14-5.33 mu g/L, respectively. Overall, the analytical method for the analysis of ketoprofen in wastewater was rapid, affordable, accurate, precise, sensitive, and selective. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences.

AB Aqueous solutions of ciprofloxacin (CP) and ibuprofen (IBP) in the presence of LaFeO3 photocatalyst, of H2O2, and of both LaFeO3 and H2O2 were irradiated under visible light. The degradation rate in the presence of both LaFeO3 and H2O2 after 5 h irradiation was more than 90 % for CP and 40 % for IBP, much higher than that with only H2O2 under visible light. For the sake of comparison, the experiments were also carried out in the dark, and both CP and IBP were not significantly converted. The degradation rate was enhanced by the simultaneous presence of small concentration of LaFeO3 (130 mg L-1) and H2O2 (0.003 M). However, tests on the aquatic acute toxicity indicate that the degradation products of CP and IBP induce toxic effects on aquatic organisms, consequently indicating incomplete detoxification after 5 h irradiation. The main degradation product of IBP was 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP), detected in the irradiated solutions by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. 4-IBAP was more toxic and showed a slower photocatalytic degradation than the parent compound. On the contrary, the toxicity of CP degradation products, although not negligible, was comparable to that of CP itself.

AB This research addresses the potential for biochar to remove pharmaceuticals from synthetic urine, thereby allowing the treated urine to be used as a contaminant-free nutrient product. Four biochars and one activated carbon from different source materials were tested: activated coconut carbon, coconut shell, bamboo, southern yellow pine, and northern hardwood. Batch tests were conducted for 24 hours using different compositions of synthetic urine and secondary wastewater effluent with biochar doses of 0.8 and 40 g L-1 and an initial pharmaceutical concentration of 0.2 mmol L-1. Seven pharmaceuticals were tested in this study: acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, citalopram, carbamazepine, and diclofenac. Activated coconut carbon, bamboo, and southern yellow pine biochars had the highest pharmaceutical removal in urine compositions at 40 g L-1, adsorbing greater than 90% of each pharmaceutical. These biochars also demonstrated the ability to remove pharmaceuticals in the presence of nutrients, where the maximum removal of phosphorus and nitrogen was 36% by activated coconut carbon, 9% by bamboo, and 23% by southern yellow pine in all waste waters. Due to the high concentrations of nutrients naturally present in urine, there remains a high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus after biochar treatment. The interactions between biochar, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals suggest that biochar has the ability to remove pharmaceuticals while maintaining nutrient concentrations in solution for future use as a nutrient product.

AB Thirty million people worldwide consume each day nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a heterogeneous group of pharmaceuticals used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies report high NSAID concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents, in surface, ground, and drinking water, and in sediments. NSAIDs are also known to induce toxicity on aquatic organisms. However, toxicity in natural ecosystems is not usually the result of exposure to a single substance but to a mixture of toxic agents, yet only a few studies have evaluated the toxicity of mixtures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity induced by diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and their mixture on a species of commercial interest, the common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of IBP and DCF was determined, and oxidative stress was evaluated using the following biomarkers: lipid peroxidation and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Cyto-genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus test, comet assay, and the specific activity of caspase-3. Results show that DCF, IBP, and a mixture of these pharmaceuticals induced free radical production, oxidative stress and cyto-genotoxicity in tissues of C. carpio. However, a greater effect was elicited by the mixture than by either pharmaceutical alone in some biomarkers evaluated, particularly in gill. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Dioscorea zingiberensis is the main plant source of diosgenin, a precursor for the production of steroid hormones used in the pharmaceutical industry. The extraction process of diosgenin from D. zingiberensis can generate high-acid and high-strength wastewater on a large scale and can threaten the environment. Bioengineering microorganisms to produce diosgenin is an effective way to avoid pollution. However, little is known about the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of diosgenin. We obtained 85,010 unigenes (average length of 1142 bases) from the D. zingiberensis transcriptome through RNA-seq. A large number of unigenes (59,368; 69.83%) were annotated, and 2488 unigenes were assigned to 27 secondary-metabolite pathways. In our database, 66 unigenes encoding up to 40 key enzymes were found to be present in diosgenin biosynthesis pathways. In addition, we found 203 unigenes encoding CYP450 proteins and 47 unigenes encoding UGT proteins that may be involved in modifications of a downstream pathway. The expression patterns of key diosgenin biosynthesis genes were studied to identify the most important members of the enzyme family. These results add to the available genetic data of D. zingiberensis and lay the foundation for the further production of diosgenin using genetic engineering.

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac have been pointed out as important markers for environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals. This study reports on the isolation of bacterial strains capable to degrade these micropollutants from activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). After selective enrichments, one strain able to degrade diclofenac and two strains able to degrade carbamazepine were isolated. The strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Strain Brevibacterium sp. D4 was able to biodegrade 35% of 10 mg L-1 of diclofenac as a sole carbon source; periodic feeding with acetate as a supplementary carbon source resulted in enhancing biodegradation to levels up to 90%, with a concomitant increase of the biodegradation rate. Strains Starkeya sp. C11 and Rhizobium sp. C12 were able to biodegrade 30% of 10 mg L-1 of carbamazepine as a sole carbon source; supplementation with acetate did not improve the biodegradation of carbamazepine by these strains. The activated sludge harboured bacteria capable to degrade the two top priority environmental contaminants and may be potentially useful for biotechnological applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The performance of four aerated submerged attached growth bioreactors was studied for the removal of three pharmaceutical micro-pollutants (fluoxetine, mefenamic acid and metoprolol) from municipal wastewater. Two packing materials (polyethylene tapes and polyurethane cubes) were compared and the effects of different organic loads (3.0, 6.0, 9.0 and 12 gCOD m(-2) d(-1)) and of the effluent recirculation were investigated. The obtained solid retention times were in the range of 4-37 d. The reactors packed with polyurethane cubes allowed 11-26% higher biomass accumulation than the ones with polyethylene tapes and higher solid retention times. The low organic loads, high solid retention times and the implementation of effluent recirculation enhanced the removal of the three pharmaceutical compounds. The highest removals were achieved at organic load of 3 gCOD m(-2) d(-1) and 50% of effluent recirculation, with hydraulic residence times of 3.1-4.3 h and the solid retention times of 19-32 d. At this condition, the removals of the fluoxetine, mefenamic acid and metoprolol were up to 95, 82 and 73% respectively. The reactors with polyurethane cubes showed higher removals compared with the ones packed with polyethylene tapes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is a major waste stream resulting from numerous operations that occur during the production stages of olive oil. The resulting effluent contains various organic and inorganic contaminants and its environmental impact can be notable. The present work aims at investigating the efficiency of (i) jet-loop reactor with ultrafiltration (UF) membrane system (Jacto.MBR), (ii) solar photo Fenton oxidation after coagulation/flocculation pre-treatment and (iii) integrated membrane filtration processes (i.e. UF/nanofiltration (NF)) used for the treatment of OMW. According to the results, the efficiency of the biological treatment was high, equal to 90% COD and 80% total phenolic compounds (TPh) removal. A COD removal higher than 94% was achieved by applying the solar photo-Fenton oxidation process as post-treatment of coagulation/flocculation of OMW, while the phenolic fraction was completely eliminated. The combined UF/NF process resulted in very high conductivity and COD removal, up to 90% and 95%, respectively, while TPh were concentrated in the NF concentrate stream (i.e. 93% concentration). Quite important is the fact that the NF concentrate, a valuable and polyphenol rich stream, can be further valorized in various industries (e.g. food, pharmaceutical, etc.). The above treatment processes were found also to be able to reduce the initial OMW phytotoxicity at greenhouse experiments; with the effluent stream of solar photo-Fenton process to be the least phytotoxic compared to the other treated effluents. A SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats) analysis was performed, in order to determine both the strengths of each technology, as well as the possible obstacles that need to overcome for achieving the desired levels of treatment. Finally, an economic evaluation of the tested technologies was performed in an effort to measure the applicability and viability of these systems at real scale; highlighting that the cost cannot be regarded as a 'cut off criterion', since the most cost-effective option in not always the optimum one.

AB The occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the pesticide atrazine were investigated in seawater samples collected from stations located at effluent dominated sites in the Saudi Arabian coastal waters of the Red Sea. PPCPs were analysed using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A multi component method for the ultra -trace level quantification of 13 target PPCPs in Seawater was developed and validated for the here performed study. The method procedure is described in detail in the supplementary material section. 26 samples from 7 distinct locations (2 directly influenced by continuous sewage release) were chosen for the sampling of surface seawater. Based upon local sales information, 25 target substances (20 PPCPs, 4 pesticides and 1 stimulant) were chosen for the here reported method development. Thirteen PPCPs were detected and quantified in a total of 26 seawater samples. Metformin, diclofenac, acetaminophen, and caffeine were identified as the most abundant PPCPs, detected in maximum concentration higher than 3 mu g/L (upper quantification limit for the here developed method). Concentrations were in the range of 7- > 3000 (metformin), < LOQ - 2379 ng/L (acetaminophen) and 62- > 3000 ng/L (caffeine). The contribution of direct sewage release on the PPCP levels detected was obvious, the target PPCPs were detected in the Al-Arbaeen and Al-Shabab coastal lagoons in high concentrations due to the low water exchange with the open sea and still ongoing sewage releases in the lagoons. Also, substantial amounts of antibiotics were detected in all samples. Levels and distribution profile of the detected PPCPs revealed high level release rates and give raise to concern on potential environmental risks associated with the here document long term exposure on the fragile coastal marine environment of the region but particularly in the nearby protected coral reef environment outside the harbour region of Jeddah.

AB Macrolide antibiotics and azole fungicides are detected widely in the aquatic environment as a result of their increased use in humans and animal livestock disease and their incomplete removal by wastewater treatment plants. In most cases, ecotoxicological tests are performed by using individual chemical substances, but because of the coexistence of a number of chemicals in the environment, organisms are exposed to many chemicals simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to evaluate effects of chemical interactions, adding to potential hazards of individual chemical. Here, we investigated the synergetic effects of combined chemicals (the azole fungicide ketoconazole and either of two macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin and clarithromycin) in growth inhibition testing using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata according to OECD Test guideline 201. Combination index plots, isobolograms, and curve-shift analyses revealed that the combination of macrolide antibiotic and ketoconazole at various ratios resulted in strong synergism that enhanced growth inhibition of P. subcapitata, suggesting the necessity of investigating potential hazard of combined chemicals for regulatory purposes.

AB The ubiquitous presence of trace organic chemicals in wastewater and surface water leads to a growing demand for novel removal technologies. The use of isolated enzymes has been shown to possess the capability for a targeted application but requires a clearer mechanistic understanding. In this study, the potential of peroxidase from horseradish (HRP) and laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus (LccPO) to transform selected trace organic chemicals was studied using mass spectrometry (MS)-based in vitro enzyme as- " says. Conversion by HRP appeared to be more efficient compared to LccPO. Diclofenac (DCF) and sotalol (STL) were completely transformed by HRP after 4 h and immediate conversion was observed for acetaminophen (APAP). During treatment with LccPO, 60% of DCF was still detectable after 24 h and no conversion was found for STL. APAP was completely transformed after 20 min. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NAP) were insusceptible to enzymatic conversion. In pharmaceutical mixtures, HRP exhibited a preference for DCF and APAP and the generally less efficient conversion of STL was enhanced in presence of APAP. Transformation product pattern after treatment with HRP revealed polymerization products for DCF while STL showed cleavage reactions. DCF product formation shifted towards a proposed dimeric iminoquinone product in presence of APAP whereas a generally less pronounced product formation in mixtures was observed for STL. In conclusion, theenzymatic treatment approach worked selectively and efficiently for a few pharmaceuticals. However, for application the investigation and possibly immobilization of multiplex enzymes being able to transform diverse chemical structures is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The increasing use of pharmaceuticals has led to their subsequent input into and release from wastewater treatment plants, with corresponding discharge into surface waters that may subsequently exert adverse effects upon aquatic organisms. Although the distribution of pharmaceuticals in surface water has been extensively studied, the details of uptake, internal distribution, and kinetic processing of pharmaceuticals in exposed fish have received less attention. For this research, we investigated the uptake, disposition, and toxicokinetics of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, methocarbamol, rosuvastatin, sulfamethoxazole, and temazepam) in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (1000-4000 ng L-1) in a flow-through exposure system. Temazepam and methocarbamol were consistently detected in bluegill biological samples with the highest concentrations in bile of 4, 940, and 180 ng g(-1), respectively, While sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, and rosuvastatin were only infrequently detected. Over 30-day exposures, the relative magnitude of mean concentrations of temazepam and methocarbamol in biological samples generally followed the order: bile >> gut > liver and brain > muscle, plasma, and gill. Ranges of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in different biological samples were 0.71-3960 and 0.13-48.6 for temazepam and methocarbamol, respectively. Log BCFs were statistically positively correlated to pH adjusted log K-ow (that is, log D-ow), with the strongest relations for liver and brain (r(2) = 0.92 and 0.99, respectively), implying that bioconcentration patterns of ionizable pharmaceuticals depend on molecular status, that is, whether a pharmaceutical is unionized or ionized at ambient-tissue pH. Methocarbamol and temazepam underwent rapid uptake and elimination in bluegill biological compartments with uptake rate constants (K-u) and elimination rate constants (K-e) at 0.0066-0:0330 h(-1) and 0.0075-0.0384 h(-1), respectively, and half-lives at 18.1-92.4 h. Exposure to mixtures of diclofenac, methocarbamol, sulfamethoxazole, and temazepam had little or no influence on the uptake and elimination rates, suggesting independent multiple uptake and disposition behaviors of pharmaceuticals by fish would occur when exposed to effluent-influenced surface waters.

AB Aromatic amines are one of the most important classes of compounds contributing to surface water mutagenicity due to their widespread occurrence as precursors and transformation products of dyes, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other compound classes. In this study, we implemented a workflow including novel analytical and data evaluation methods aiming to identify aromatic amines in six mutagenic wastewater effluents from a chemical-industrial area in Germany, collected by the passive sampler Blue Rayon. We identified 14 amines including the two potent mutagenic aromatic amines 2,3- and 2,8-phenazinediamine,. which were reported for the first time as environmental contaminants. These two isomers accounted between 4.2 and 86% of the mutagenicity of the blue rayon extracts and may be byproducts of dye production at the studied site.

AB This study investigated the applicability of fluorescence indexes based on the interpretation of excitation emission matrices (EEMs) by PARAFAC analysis and by selecting fluorescence intensities at a priori defined excitation/emission pairs as surrogates for monitoring the behavior of emerging organic compounds (EOCs) in two catchment basins impacted by wastewater discharges. Relevant EOC and EEM data were obtained for a 90 km stretch of the Simeto River, the main river in Sicily, and the smaller San Leonardo River, which was investigated for a 17 km stretch. The use of fluorescence indexes developed by these two different approaches resulted in similar observations. Changes of the fluorescence indexes that correspond to a group of humic-like fluorescing species were determined to be highly correlated with the concentrations of recalcitrant contaminants such as sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, which are typical wastewater markers in river water. Changes of the fluorescence indexes related to tyrosine-like substances were well correlated with the concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine, anthropogenic indicators of untreated wastewater discharges. Chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were correlated with humic-like fluorescence indexes. The observed correlations were site-specific and characterized by different regression parameters for every collection event. Caffeine and carbamazepine showed correlations with florescence indexes in the San Leonardo River and in the alluvial plain stretch of the Simeto River, whereas sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen have always been well correlated in all the investigated river stretches. However, when data of different collection events from river stretches where correlations were observed were combined, good linear correlations were obtained for data sets generated via the normalization of the measured concentrations by the average value for the corresponding collection event. These results show that fluorescence based indexes can be used to monitor the behavior of some trace organic contaminants in wastewater impacted rivers and to track wastewater discharges in streams and rivers.

AB The increasing worldwide consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ibuprofen (IBU) is leading to the widespread and persistent occurrence of these chemicals and their transformation products in soils and waters. Although at low concentrations, the continuous discharge of these micropollutants and the incomplete removal by the actual wastewater treatments can provoke accumulation in the environment with risks for the trophic chain. Non-target organisms as duckweed can be used for the environniental monitoring of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants. In this work, plants of Lama gibba L were exposed to high (020 and 1 mg L-1) and environmentally relevant (0.02 mg L-1) concentrations of IBU to investigate their removal and metabolization capacity. The main oxidized IBU metabolites in humans (hydroxy-IBU and carboxy-IBU) Were determined in tht intact plants and in the growth solutions, together with non-destructiVe physiological parameters and phytotoxic indicators. The IBU uptake increased with the increasing of IBU concentration in the medium, but the relative accumulation of the pharmaceutical and generation of hydroxy-IBU was higher in presence of the lower IBU treatments. Carboxy-IBU was not found in the plant tissue and solutions. The changes observed in growth and photosynthetic performances were not able to induce phyto-toxic effects. Apart from a mean physical-chemical degradation of 82%, the IBU removal by plants was highly efficient (89-92.5%) in all the conditions tested, highlighting the role of L gibba in the biodegradation of emerging contaminants.

AB Municipal wastewater containing 21 pharmaceutical compounds, as well as activated sludge obtained from the aeration tank of the same wastewater treatment plant were used in lab-scale biodegradation experiments. The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and ranged from 13.2 ng/L to 51.8 mu g/L. Activated sludge was characterized in the terms of phylogenetic and catabolic diversity of microbial community, as well as its morphology. Proteobacteria (24.0%) represented the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes (19.8%) and Firmicutes (13.2%). Bioaugmentation of wastewater with activated sludge stimulated the biodegradation process for 14 compounds. The concentration of carbamazepine in non-amended and bioaugmented WW decreased during the first 17 h up to 30% and 70%, respectively. Diclofenac and ibuprofen demonstrated comparatively slow removal. The stimulating effect of the added nutrients was observed for the degradation of almost all pharmaceuticals detected in WW The most pronounced effect of nutrients was found for erythromycin. The results were compared with those obtained for the full-scale WW treatment process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive screening of micropollutants was performed in wastewaters from on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) and urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) in Sweden. A suspect screening approach, using high resolution mass spectrometry, was developed and used in combination with target analysis. With this strategy, a total number of 79 micropollutants were successfully identified, which belong to the groups of per-and polyfluoroallcyl substances (PFASs), pesticides, phosphorus-containing flame retardants (PFRs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results from this screening indicate that concentrations of micropollutants are similar in influents and effhients of OSSFs and WWTPs, respectively. Removal efficiencies of micropollutants were assessed in the OSSFs and compared with those observed in WWTPs. In general, removal of PFASs and PFRs was higher in package treatment OSSFs, which are based on biological treatments, while removal of PPCPs was more efficient in soil bed OSSFs. A novel comprehensive prioritization strategy was then developed to identify OSSF specific chemicals of environmental relevance. The strategy was based On the compound concentrations in the wastewater, removal efficiency, frequency of detection in OSSFs and on in silico based data for toxicity, persistency and bioaccumulation potential.

AB The effect of effluent recirculation on the removal of total nitrogen (TN) and eight pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) was evaluated during 9 months in an experimental hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system applied in the treatment of urban wastewater. An Imhoff tank was followed by three stages of CWs (two 1.5m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF) beds alternating feed-rest cycles, a 2-m(2) horizontal (HF) and a 2-m2 free water surface (FWS) wetland in series). A fraction of the final effluent was recycled back to the Imhoff tank with a recirculation rate of 50% (hydraulic loading rate = 0.37 m d(-1)). The system's performance varied throughout the study. In Period I (summer) consistently high load removal efficiencies of TN (89 +/- 5%) and a removal rate of 6.6 +/- 1.4 g TN m(-2) d(-1) were exhibited. In Period II (fall), the poor performance of the FWS during the senescence of macrophytes caused a large increase in organic matter, solids and nutrient concentrations, drastically deteriorating water quality. The determination of PPCPs was conducted during this period. Recalcitrant compounds, namely sulfamethoxazole, carbamazapine, TCEP and sucralose were negligibly removed in all CWs. However, noteworthy was the;approximate to 30%removal of sucralose in the VF wetland. Caffeine (80%) and fluoxetine (27%) showed similar elimination rates in both VF and HF units, whereas trimethoprim and DEET were significantly better removed in the VF than in the HF. The concentration of the four latter compounds showed a severe increase in the FWS, indicating possible desorption from the sediment/biomass during adverse conditions. Harvesting of the aboveground biomass in this unit returned the system 's performance back to normality (Period III), achieving 77 +/- 7% TN removal despite the winter season, proving effluent recirculation as an effective strategy for TN removal in hybrid CW systems when stringent restrictions are in place.

AB Various species of amoebas belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in many parts of the world. Some strains of these protozoans may exist as parasites and pose risks to human health as causative agents of serious human diseases. Currently in China there IS a lack of information about the distribution of Acanthamoeba strains in the environment. Accordingly, 261 environmental water samples taken from rivers, sewage, and pharmaceutical factory drains were collected in Qinghai Province, China. The material was filtered and then analysed with both LAMP and PCR assays. Of the samples examined, Acanthamoeba DNA was found in 32 (14.68%) samples with the use of LAMP; in 13 of these samples, DNA from this amoeba was also detected using PCR. Sequencing of selected positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the Acanthamoeba 18S rRNA gene and that isolates represent the T4 genotype, known as the Most common strain related to AK cases. The results indicate that surface water, as well as water taken from sewage And pharmaceutical drains, may be a source of acanthamoebic strains potentially pathogenic for humans in China. It has been also demonstrated that LAMP assays is more sensitive than PCR and can be regarded as useful tool for screening the environment for Acanthamoeba spp. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Clindamycin is widely prescribed for its ability to treat a number of common bacterial infections. Thus, clindamycin enters wastewater via human excretion or disposal of unused medication and widespread detection of pharmaceuticals in rivers proves the insufficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants in removing clindamycin. Recently, it has been discovered that attached biofilm reactors, e.g., moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) obtain a higher removal of pharmaceuticals than conventional sludge wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, this study investigated the capability of MBBRs applied in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove clindamycin. First, a batch experiment was executed with a high initial concentration of clindamycin to identify the transformation products. It was shown that clindamycin can be removed from wastewater by MBBR and the treatment process converts clindamycin into the, possibly persistent, products clindamycin sulfoxide and N-des methyl clindamycin as well as 3 other mono-oxygenated products.
   Subsequently, the removal kinetics of clindamycin and the formation of the two identified products were investigated in batch experiments using MBBR carriers from polishing and nitrifying reactors. Additionally, the presence of these two metabolites in biofilm-free wastewater effluent was studied. The nitrifying biofilm reactor had a higher biological activity with k-value of 0.1813 h-1 than the reactor with polishing biofilm (k = 0.0161 h-1) which again has a much higher biological activity for removal of clindamycin than of the suspended bacteria (biofilm-free control). Clindamycin sulfoxide was the main transformation product which was found in concentrations exceeding 10% of the initial clindamycin concentration after 1 day of MBBR treatment. Thus, MBBRs should not necessarily be considered as reactors mineralizing clindamycin as they perform transformation reactions at least to some extent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles were reported to be effective for removal of aqueous pharmaceutical chemicals. However, little is known about its potential application in removing the sediment-sorbed contaminants. To bridge this knowledge gap, we synthesized stabilized Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles using water-soluble carboxymethyl celluloses (CMC) as a stabilizer and tested their effectiveness for removal of aqueous and sediment-sorbed ciprofloxacin (CIP). Fully stabilized Fe-Mn binary oxide nanoparticles (0.05 g/L as Fe) were obtained in the presence of 0.5 g/L of CMC. When compared with non-stabilized Fe-Mn nanoparticles (FMBO), CMC-stabilized Fe-Mn nanoparticles (CMC-FMBO) showed relatively more favorable removal performance and particles stabilization facilitated delivering nanoparticles into sediment for in situ removal of CIP. The CIP removal by CMC-FMBO was highly pH dependent and the optimum pH was 6.0. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model was able to interpret the removal kinetics. When CIP-spiked sediment was treated with the CMC-FMBO, CMC-FMBO exhibited more excellent resistance to the sediment inhibitive effects and higher removal efficiency of CIP, compared to FMBO. This primary research suggests that CMC-FMBO hold the potential for facilitating removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater and sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The transport and concentration distribution of sludge in a high performance anaerobic bioreactor, termed spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor (SSSAB), was directly related to its effective retention of the biomass, as well as its stable operation under high loading rate. Therefore, the transport and concentration distribution of sludge in a lab-scale SSSAB were modelled and investigated in comparison with a same-sized upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBR), and two larger scale SSSABs were used for validating and expanding the application field of the model. The results showed that the model established can effectively describe the sludge transport and concentration distribution in the SSSAB. The SSSAB performed relatively low sludge transport factor compared with the UASBR, proving the favorable sludge retention ability of the SSSAB. The sludge transport factor remained constant with the scale-up of the SSSAB. The model could predict the sludge concentration distribution of a 130 L SSSAB treating traditional Chinese pharmaceutical wastewater. Also, the model can be applied to the SSSAB treating other types of wastewater with biogas production fractions in zone 1 and 2 (f(1) and f(2)) at the ranges of 0.19-0.41 and 0.18-0.41, respectively.

AB A simple and effective method was developed for norfloxacin detection using an innovative magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (MMIP) with the aid of computer simulation. The best two functional monomers are selected according to the docking results. Four kinds of MMIP were synthesized with different functional monomers (methylacrylic acid and acrylamide) and solvents (dimethylsulfoxide and ethanol). The zeta potential was introduced to explain the interaction mechanism between MMIP and norfloxacin when the pH system was optimized. The final MMIP (MMIP-1) possesses a high efficiency recognition for norfloxacin (163.07 mu g mg(-1)) because of the thin layer of MIP (30 nm). Transmission electron microscopy shows uniform morphology for MMIP-1 (460 nm) with a core-shell structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry were used to study the chemical groups and magnetic properties of the materials. MMIP-1 possesses a high imprinting factor (greater than 3). A possible mechanism for the adsorption behavior was briefly explained with the Freundlich model and rate controlled steps. Simulated pharmaceutical wastewater was used for method validation and the method was then used to research using the method with real pharmaceutical wastewater. Because of its good properties, MMIP-1 proved to be an effective material when applied for norfloxacin extraction in complex pharmaceutical wastewater with detection using high performance chromatography.

AB A key uncertainty of wastewater-based epidemiology is the size of the population which contributed to a given wastewater sample. We previously developed and validated a Bayesian inference model to estimate population size based on 14 population markers which: (1) are easily measured and (2) have mass loads which correlate with population size. However, the potential uncertainty of the model prediction due to in-sewer degradation of these markers was not evaluated. In this study, we addressed this gap by testing their stability under sewer conditions and assessed whether degradation impacts the model estimates. Five markers, which formed the core of our model, were stable in the sewers while the others were not. Our evaluation showed that the presence of unstable population markers in the model did not decrease the precision of the population estimates providing that such as acesulfame remained in the model. However, to achieve the minimum uncertainty in population estimates, we propose that the core markers to be included in population models for other sites should meet two additional criteria: (3) negligible degradation in wastewater to ensure the stability of chemicals during collection; and (4) < 10% in-sewer degradation could occur during the mean residence time of the sewer network.

AB The study investigated the pretreatment of real paracetamol (PCT) wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry by Fenton process. At the best experimental conditions (COD/H2O2 = 1/1, Fe+2/H2O2 = 1/70, settling method:centrifuging, pH 6 at settling step), 92.7, 92.7, 95.5, 99.1, 99.9 and 99.4% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), PCT, para-amino phenol (PAP) and aniline were removed, respectively. Changes in the concentrations of these parameters were also investigated for both oxidation and settling steps of Fenton process. It was found that COD and TOC were removed at the settling step (precipitation) whereas PCT, PAP and aniline were removed at the oxidation step. Mass balance calculations were also studied to show the mass distributions of COD in different phases (gas + foam, effluent and sludge). Fenton process was found as an effective method for the pretreatment of real PCT wastewater for discharging in a determined collective treatment plant.

AB This study considers the removal of diclofenac (an important representative of pharmaceuticals and personal care products - PPCPs) from the secondary effluents of Iasi municipal wastewater treatment plant by means of different advanced oxidation processes (homogeneous Fenton, photo-Fenton and photolysis), carried out in a laboratory scale reaction system. The influence of three qualitative or quantitative factors (Fe3+ concentration, the absence/presence of UV-A radiation and H2O2) was studied in 4 h oxidation tests, at both acidic and neutral pH conditions. A 23 full factorial plan was designed to check the influence of the main parameters affecting the process. The removal efficiencies of several process variants were determined by measuring the DCF concentration in the influent and effluent, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Total organic carbon, specific UV absorption at 254 nm and the hydrogen peroxide concentration were determined for each experiment. At acidic pH, the main effects plots showed that both use UV-A radiation and H2O2 addition improve the DCF removal efficiency, Fe concentration having a much smaller effect. DCF removal efficiencies of up to 98% were obtained depending on the operational conditions. At neutral pH, UV-A radiation is the most important factor that contributes to the removal of DCF and the interaction plots demonstrated this fact. The Pareto chart shows that all factors, with the exception of Fe concentration and H2O2 interactions, are influential. DCF removal efficiencies of up to 70% were obtained depending on the operational conditions.

AB The enantioseparation of (S)-amlodipine and (R)-amlodipine from pharmaceutical wastewater by hollow fiber supported liquid membrane was examined. The pH effects of feed solution, concentration of (+)-DBTA, temperature and the flow rates of feed and stripping solution were investigated. A central composite design (CCD) was used for the design of experiment and to determine the significant factors and their interactions. Regression equations were created from the CCD to predict the percentages of extraction and stripping with varying factor levels. The validity of the model was evaluated, and the optimized condition determined by response surface methodology. The highest extraction and stripping performances were 82.0 and 76.0%, respectively.

AB A new approach for a successful treatment concept of industrial cosmetic wastewater is shown. Splitting the wastewater flow into various material streams based on fundamental characteristics enables distinct adapted treatment and disposal methods, respectively. Industrial wastewater still contains valuable and even recyclable materials that should not be disposed of as waste. A holistic treatment of the total wastewater flow comprising diverse material streams is very challenging due to a frequently changing product range. The developed concept provides a functional and yet simple approach by classifying material and wastewater streams that could be treated by distinct adapted processes. Most of the industrial wastewater achieved a quality that allows a cost-effective discharge via the municipal wastewater system.

AB The sorption-desorption of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in sand/soil columns can be used to infer performance of managed aquifer recharge. Removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) from synthetic wastewater, containing 100 mu g.L-1 of each pharmaceuticals, was studied in recirculating sand columns amended with uncoated or methacrylic acid (MAA) coated magnetite nanoparticles. Removal of CBZ and DTZ in MAA-magnetite column (68.34% and 61.91%, respectively) was much higher than that with uncoated magnetite (53.47% and 50.26%, respectively). Rapid decrease of dissolved organic carbon concentrations across nanoparticle amended columns (between 42.28% and 50.08% on Day 1), followed by slow recuperation suggests adsorption-desorption dynamics and competition of dissolved organic matter for sorption sites. Core-level binding energy and charge analysis for Fe(2s) and O(1s) in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests involvement of physisorption process on the NP surfaces.

AB Anaerobic treatment of wastewater and waste organic solvents originating from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries was tested in a pilot anaerobic membrane bioreactor, which was operated for 580 days under different operational conditions. The goal was to test the long-term treatment efficiency and identify inhibitory factors. The highest COD removal of up to 97% was observed when the influent concentration was increased by the addition of methanol (up to 25 g L-1 as COD). Varying and generally lower COD removal efficiency (around 78%) was observed when the anaerobic membrane bioreactor was operated with incoming pharmaceutical wastewater as sole carbon source. The addition of waste organic solvents (>2.5 g L-1 as COD) to the influent led to low COD removal efficiency or even to the breakdown of anaerobic digestion. Changes in the anaerobic population (e.g., proliferation of the genus Methanosarcina) resulting from the composition of influent were observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many transformation products (TPs) from organic micropollutants are not included in routine environmental monitoring programs due to limited knowledge of their occurrence and fate. An efficient method to identify and prioritize critical compounds in terms of environmental relevance is needed. In this study, we applied a strategic screening approach based on a case-control concept to identify TPs formed along wastewater-impacted rivers. Time-integrated samples were collected over one week at both ends of a river stretch downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfall and were analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography interfaced with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToF-MS/MS). The screening procedure of the high-resolution MS (HRMS) datasets consisted of three major steps: (i) screening for parent compounds (PCs) attenuated along the stretch; (ii) prediction of potential TPs from these PCs; and (iii) screening for TPs from this list with an increasing trend along the stretch. In total, 32 PCs decreased along the investigated river stretches. From these PCs, eight TPs had increasing concentrations along the studied stretches and could be tentatively identified. The identification of one TP (benzamide) was confirmed by its corresponding reference standard, while no standards were available for the remaining TPs.

AB BiOCl microspheres with exposed {001} facets have been synthesized through a simple solvothermal method. The adsorption and photocatalytic activities of BiOCl microspheres were evaluated by removal of ibuprofen (IBP) as the model reaction. Parameters including IBP concentration, BiOCl dosage, and inorganic ions were investigated to reveal the role of adsorption in BiOCl-based photocatalysis. We found that the high IBP removal rate by BiOCl is not due to photocatalytic oxidation but to surface adsorption. The combination of ICP/MS, IC, XPS, and FT-IR results directly proved that anion exchange between dissociated IBP and Cl accompanied by the formation of surface complex (O-Bi-OOC-C12H17) onto the BiOCl surface is the main adsorption mechanism. In addition, we also demonstrated that organic compounds with carboxyl group (-COOH) such as diclofenac, benzoic acid, and p-phthalic acid can be adsorbed by BiOCl while organic compounds without carboxyl group such as carbamazepine, nitrobenzene, and p-chloronitrobenzene cannot be adsorbed. We believe that the BiOCl adsorption behavior and mechanism should be considered when discussing its photocatalytic mechanism.

AB Sulfonamides are one of the most frequently used antibiotics worldwide. Therefore, processes that determine their fate in the environment are of great interest. In the present work, biodegradation as biotic process and hydrolysis and photolysis as abiotic processes were investigated. In biodegradation experiments, it was found out that sulfonamides (sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine) and their N (4)-acetylated metabolites were not readily biodegradable. The results showed that decrease of concentrations were in the range from 4% for sulfadiazine to 22% for N (4)-acetylsulfamethazine. Hydrolytic experiments examined at pH values normally found in the environment also showed their resistance. However, photolysis proved to be significant process for decreasing concentrations of sulfonamides and their metabolites in three various aqueous matrices (Milli-Q water, river water, and synthetic wastewater). In addition, influence of ubiquitous water constituents (Cl-, NO3 (-), SO4 (2-), PO4 (3-), and humic acids) was also investigated, showing their different impact on photolysis of investigated pharmaceuticals. The results showed that photolysis followed first-order kinetics in all cases. The obtained results are very important for assesing the environmental fate of sulfonamides and their metabolites in the aquatic environment.

AB The laboratory scale of the two-stage membrane bioreactor (2S-MBR) was investigated to find the optimal hydraulic retention times (HRT) in treatment of selected 10 antibiotics in real hospital wastewater. It showed that elimination of the antibiotics varied, depending upon antibiotic types and HRT. High biodegradation attributed to amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Fluoroquinolones/tetracycline adsorbed highly on anoxic (ANX) sludge, but tended to be biodegraded in the aerobic tank. Sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim were mainly accumulated in the ANX/aerobic sludge. In order to increase biodegradation, 2S-MBR was upgraded to a three-stage MBR (3S-MBR) using the polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads of Pseudomonas putida (TISTR1522) in an entrapped cells reactor (ECR) as a pretreatment unit. Ciprofioxacin (CIP) in a synthetic wastewater was a refractory antibiotic for this feature investigation. It showed improvement of CIP degradation reached to 90% in 3S-MBR as compared to 58% of 2S-MBR. As a result, 24 CIP-transformed products (TPs) were detected. Additionally, 3S-MBR showed better efficacy of nitrogen removals. The SEM and FISH techniques revealed bacterial consortium in the system showing that the beads were well supported P. putida growth as well as synchronizing volume available for other bacteria. This feature makes P. putida being a potential microorganism for CIP biodegradation via bioaugmentation in 3S-MBR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the rise in drug resistance emphasizes the immediate need for managing pharmaceutical products sensibly. The pharmaceutical products end in wastewater due to the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical industries, misuse of antibiotics and improper disposal of expired drugs, which eventually ends in sewers. In the present study we attempted to degrade fluoroquinolones by the process of mycoremediation. Hospital waste water soil sample was collected and screened for fungi which can tolerate norfloxacin. One fungal isolate was able to withstand 2 g/L of norfloxacin which was chosen for degradation studies. Degradation pattern was checked with HPLC, FTIR and SEM analysis. Kinetics studies were carried out to analyze the degradation pattern. The result confirmed that Ganoderma lucidum JAPC1 strain was capable of degrading norfloxacin successfully but was unable to degrade ciprofloxacin.

AB The secondary effluent from biological treatment process in chemical industrial plant often contains refractory organic matter, which deserves to be further treated in order to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In this study, the key role of biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) in enhanced removal of highly recalcitrant 1,2,4-triazole from bio-treated chemical industrial wastewater was investigated. BioMnOx production by acclimated manganese-oxidizing bacterium (MOB) consortium was confirmed through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Pseudomonas and Bacillus were found to be the most predominant species in acclimated MOB consortium. Mn2+ could be oxidized optimally at neutral pH and initial Mn2+ concentration below 33 mg L-1. However, 1,2,4-triazole removal by BioMnOx produced occurred optimally at slightly acidic pH. High dosage of both Mn2+ and 1,2,4-triazole resulted in decreased 1,2,4-triazole removal. In a biological aerated filter (BAF) coupled with manganese oxidation, 1,2,4-triazole and total organic carbon removal could be significantly enhanced compared to the control system without the participation of manganese oxidation, confirming the key role of BioMnOx in the removal of highly recalcitrant 1,2,4-triazole. This study demonstrated that the biosystem coupled with manganese oxidation had a potential for the removal of various recalcitrant contaminants from biotreated chemical industrial wastewater.

AB In Australia, trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) and endocrine active compounds (EACs) have been detected in rivers impacted by sewage effluent, urban stormwater, agricultural and industrial inputs. It is unclear whether these chemicals are at concentrations that can elicit endocrine disruption in Australian fish species. In this study, native rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) and introduced invasive (but prevalent) mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to the individual compounds atrazine, estrone, bisphenol A, propylparaben and pyrimethanil, and mixtures of compounds including hormones and personal care products, industrial compounds, and pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations. Vitellogenin (Vtg) protein and liver VtgmRNA induction were used to assess the estrogenic potential of these compounds. Vtg expression was significantly affected in both species exposed to estrone at concentrations that leave little margin for safety (p < 0.001). Propylparaben caused a small but statistically significant 3x increase in Vtg protein levels (p = 0.035) in rainbowfish but at a concentration 40x higher than that measured in the environment, therefore propylparaben poses a low risk of inducing endocrine disruption in fish. Mixtures of pesticides and a mixture of hormones, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides induced a small but statistically significant increase in plasma Vtg in rainbowfish, but did not affect mosquitofish Vtg protein or mRNA expression. These results suggest that estrogenic activity represents a low risk to fish in most Australian rivers monitored to-date except for some species of fish at the most polluted sites.

AB Enrofloxacin is a synthetic second-generation fluoroquinolone used as an antimicrobial agent exclusively in veterinary medicine. To simulate the treatment of wastewater contaminated by enrofloxacin, four-day long fed-batch runs were carried out according to the Fenton process with an enrofloxacin solution as model, to which hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion were added twice a day. The residual enrofloxacin concentration was practically coincident to that detected at the end of the batch tests. Hydrogen peroxide was almost completely consumed after each feeding period, while the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration decreased gradually within three days, corresponding to a reduction >58%. From the third day on, the TOC falling rate was quite low. A yellow sludge settled due to the precipitation of both Fe(OH)(3) and a complex formed by ferric ion with adsorbed enrofloxacin and/or its oxidation products.

AB Contaminants in septic tank effluent (STE) are expected to be removed by the soil system before discharging to the environment. However, potential contaminants such as phosphorus (P), caffeine and artificial sweeteners do find their way to watercourses impacting aquatic eco systems. In this study, the attenuation of STE P, caffeine and saccharin were investigated in untreated soil and in soil with reduced microbial activity, in aqueous solutions and in the complex matrix of STE. Time series sorption and desorption experiments using batch equilibrium and a column experiment of STE P attenuation were conducted. The results revealed that the soil distribution coefficients (K-d) were: P 81.57 > caffeine 22.16 > saccharin 5.98 cm(3)/g, suggesting greater soil affinity to P adsorption. The data revealed that 80% of saccharin and 33% of caffeine attenuation was associated with microbial activities rather than adsorption processes. However, a complete removal of saccharin and caffeine did not occur during the equilibration period, suggesting their leaching potential. The dominant mechanism of P attenuation was adsorption (chemical and physical), yielding P retention of >73% and 35% for Pin aqueous solution and in STE matrix, respectively, for batch equilibrium. The soil in the column acted as effluent P sink retaining 125 mu g P/g soil of effluent P. The attenuation of 13, caffeine and saccharin in the aqueous solution was greater than in STE, suggesting that the complex composition of STE reduced soil adsorption ability, and that other substances present in STE may be competing for soil binding sites. The data revealed that caffeine and P had similarities in the interaction with soils and thus caffeine may be considered as a STE tracer of anthropogenic source of P in receiving waters.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is a non-steroidal analgesic and antiphlogistic. Due to its tremendous use, DCF can be found in the environment, especially in sewage, but also surface waters, ground and drinking water. Previous studies indicated that DCF can modulate the reproductive physiology of fish by altering the expression of important key enzymes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad-axis (HPG-axis) and might act as an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Other studies, however, demonstrated that DCF does not exhibit any estrogenicity. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether an exposure to DCF can affect reproductive behavior and physiology of adult male X. laevis by analyzing DCF effects on the mate calling behavior of the frogs and on gene expression patterns of key biomarkers of the HPG-axis. In addition, plasma sex steroid levels were determined to gain detailed insights into the mechanisms of DCF action. We could demonstrate that DCF can act as EDC by exhibiting slight estrogenic modes of action. In addition, pharmacological impacts on gonadal steroidogenesis could be revealed leading to imbalances in sex steroid levels and ratios. DCF furthermore altered the calling behavior of exposed males, potentially reducing the mating and reproductive success of the frogs, possibly leading to severe population effects.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial ingredient found in personal care products that include soaps, shampoos, and other sanitation goods. TCS is moderately hydrophobic and has been shown to be resistant to wastewater treatment and thus accumulates in biosolids. Biosolids are commonly applied to agricultural land but little is known about the risk that TCS in biosolids poses to soil fungal communities following land application. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of TCS on the symbiotic colonization of roots in three field crops (soybean, corn, and spring wheat) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils amended with four different types of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, composted, alkaline and hydrolyzed). Crops were grown to maturity in pot-exposure systems under controlled temperature settings. Biosolids treatments were spiked with concentrations of TCS typically found in amended fields. Analysis of AMF colonization by hyphae, and the production of arbuscules and vesicles indicated no significantTCS concentration -dependent effects in the three plant species for any of the biosolids formulations. The data indicate that TCS present in municipal biosolids applied to agricultural lands likely poses minimal risks to AMF or its establishment of a symbiotic relationship in the three species tested.

AB Denatonium is one of the bitterest substances known to man and therefore applied in numerous consumer products to prevent an accidental or intentional consumption. So far no information was available on the occurrence of this compound in the environment. A sensitive targeted method was developed and applied to water samples taken in the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. Denatonium was detected in 100% of the investigated 22 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents with a maximum concentration of 341 ng L-1. Additionally, water samples were taken from the Ammer river over a period of one week and all wastewater impacted samples showed denatonium at concentrations up to 195 ng L-1. Retrospective analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometric measurements of WWTP effluents from Italy and Switzerland confirmed and therefore point to an international occurrence of denatonium as anthropogenic contaminant.

AB In recent years, interest in the presence of chemical and biological pollutants (drugs, pesticides, heavy metals etc.) in sewage water has been permanently increasing and, at the same time, significant effort to eliminate them has been shown. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of ferrates activity on the decomposition of the drug diclofenac (DCF), which is commonly present in sewage water. The main task is to follow the effect of potassium ferrate dosage on DCF degradation and to evaluate the most effective ferrates concentration in solution. Subsequently, real samples of waste water containing a significant amount of various micro-pollutants were treated by the same amount of ferrates as laboratory samples. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for the sample analysis. Ferrates removal effectiveness was determined by comparing the chromatographic peak areas of residual DCF in the treated samples. Removal efficiency of diclofenac is proportional to the concentration of potassium ferrate in the treated solutions.

AB Dissolved ozone flotation (DOF) treatment method was applied to oxidize soluble substances, i.e., emerging micropollutants that are not completely removed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) in cosmetic wastewater treatment. With the DOF method, solid particles float on the top of the treated solution, and soluble substances are oxidized by ozone. Twelve aluminium-based coagulants were used in the experiments: Al 6010, Al 3010, Al 3030, Al 3035, Al 1019, Al 2019, PAX XL19, PAX16, Flokor 1.3, Flokor 1S, Flokor 1.2a, and Megafloc. Of all the coagulants, the two with the highest efficiency were selected: Al 3010 and Al 6010. The results obtained by both treatment methods, DOF and DAF, show similar chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal 79.1% and 78.8%, respectively, and total suspended solids (TSS) removal 95.2% and 94.4%, respectively, for Brenntag 6010. For Brenntag 3010 removal rate of 81.3% and 81.0% COD was observed, and the same 96.3% TSS removal for both DAF and DOF methods. However, extended removal of micropollutants was observed in the DOF method. The headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis was used to identify the compounds in wastewater and to evaluate the effectiveness of both methods that were used. The HS-SPME-GC-MS results confirmed that the DOF process with using coagulant Al 3010 had better removal efficiency compared with DAF. The removal rate of micropollutants including endocrine disruptors for DOF was 96.3% compared with 93.8% when using DAF treatment.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are potential endocrine disrupting compounds that have been detected in the aquatic environment around the world in the low ng/L (nanomolar) range. GCs are used as immunosuppressants in medicine. It is of high interest whether clobetasol propionate (CP), a highly potent GC, suppresses the inflammatory response in fish after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was used to induce inflammation and thus mimic pathogen infection. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 5 <= 1000 nM CP from similar to 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf, and CP uptake, survival after LPS challenge, and expression of inflammation-related genes were examined. Our initial experiments were carried out using 0.001% DMSO as a solvent vehicle, but we observed that DMSO interfered with the LPS challenge assay, and thus masked the effects of CP. Therefore, DMSO was not used in the subsequent experiments. The internal CP concentration was quantifiable after exposure to 10 nM CP for 96 h. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of CP was determined to be between 16 and 33 in zebrafish embryos. CP-exposed embryos showed a significantly higher survival rate in the LPS challenge assay after exposure to 0.1 nM in a dose dependent manner. This effect is an indication of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the regulation pattern of several genes related to LPS challenge in mammals supported our results, providing evidence that LPSmediated inflammatory pathways are conserved from mammals to teleost fish. Anxalb, a GC-action related antiinflammatory gene, was significantly down-regulated after exposure to 0.05 nM CP. Our results show for the first time that synthetic GCs can suppress the innate immune system of fish at environmentally relevant concentrations. This may reduce the chances of fish to survive in the environment, as their defense against pathogens is weakened.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 11 antibiotics in multiple environmental media including river water, suspended particle, sediment, and soil of the East River catchment, South China, were systematically characterized from multiple spatial (area and point) and temporal (seasonal variation and diurnal variation) scales. The results indicated that six to eight antibiotics were detected in these media. The predominant antibiotics and their concentrations varied with environment media because of the varied contamination sources, physicochemical properties of antibiotics, and media. For their spatial distribution, the river environment including water phase, suspended particles, and sediments showed a similar feature with the rule of C (delta) > C (lower reach) > C (middle reach), which may be related to the industrial level and population density. However, the antibiotics in the soils showed a close relationship with the land use types. A diurnal variation of antibiotics at river sections was mainly affected by the tidal change and diurnal domestic sewage discharge feature. Source analysis indicated that domestic sewage was the main source for antibiotic contamination in the river, while irrigation and fertilization using river water and animal wastes were the main reasons for antibiotic contamination in the soils. However, antibiotics may be redistributed in different media in a catchment.

AB The use of consumer products and pharmaceuticals that act as contaminants entering waterways through runoff and wastewater effluents alters aquatic ecosystem health. Traditional toxicological endpoints may underestimate the toxicity of contaminants, as lethal concentrations are often orders of magnitude higher than those found within freshwater ecosystems. While newer techniques examine the metabolic responses of sublethal contaminant exposure, there has been no direct comparison with ontogeny in Daphnia. It was hypothesized that Daphnia magna would have distinct metabolic changes after 3 different sublethal contaminant exposures, because of differences in the toxic mode of action and ontogeny. To test this hypothesis, the proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiles were measured in D. magna aged day 0 and 18 after exposure to 28% of the lethal concentration of 50% of organisms tested (LC50) of atrazine, propranolol, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) for 48 h. Principal component analysis revealed significant separation of contaminants from the control daphnids in both neonates and adults exposed to propranolol and PFOS. In contrast, atrazine exposure caused separation from the controls in only the adult D. magna. Minimal ontogenetic changes in the targeted metabolites were seen after exposure to propranolol. For both atrazine and PFOS exposures ontogeny exhibited unique changes in the targeted metabolites. These results indicate that, depending on the contaminant studied, neonates and adults respond uniquely to sublethal contaminant exposure. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB The combination of chemical and biological treatment is a promising solution to remove emerging contaminants, e.g., pharmaceuticals, from wastewater for its future reuse. In this study, the combination of ozonation and ultrasound (O-3/US) was examined as a pretreatment prior to membrane bioreactor (MBR). The effects of O-3/US on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals, including diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ), and MBR fouling control were investigated. The variation of the toxicity potential of the MBR influent was also assessed. The O-3/US treatment was effective in reducing fouling, mainly due to its effects on the microbial metabolism products in the MBR. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) concentration was reduced by 50%. Improved operating conditions resulted in higher removal rates for pharmaceuticals in the MBR effluent, with removal efficiency in the range of 80-84%. However, the O-3/US treatment alone was not efficient in removing the toxicity of wastewater. This was likely due to the formation of intermediate products that are more toxic than the parent compounds. These intermediate products were observed to be biologically oxidized by MBR, with a 80% reduction of the toxicity potential in the MBR permeate compared to the influent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Organic emerging micropollutants are persistent during the biological process used in treatment plants and have the tendency to accumulate in the sludge. Since a common method of final sludge disposal is the land application, there are potential risks associated with the presence of contaminants within the sludge. In this work, the removal efficiency of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, namely bisphenol A, nonylphenol and triclosan from sludge was investigated using ozonation and electrooxidation using boron-doped diamond electrodes. Both procedures were studied to determine the optimal conditions (pH, current density and ozone flow) for removing these chemicals in an hour. With the obtained conditions, a coupled system ozonation-electrooxidation was used with the goal to have better pollutant elimination. Results indicate that these compounds could be effectively removed by the coupled system; the diminutions were Bisphenol A 86%, nonylphenol 68% and triclosan 67%. Also improvements in the quality of aqueous phase were obtained, and for instance, the chemical oxygen demand, color and turbidity, were abated in 62, 61 and 66%, respectively. Moreover, an additional advantage of the coupled system is the absence of any secondary pollution.

AB Performance of moving bed biofilm reactor system for a real hospital wastewater (HW) was experimented, modelled, and optimized using response surface methodology. Prior to conducting laboratory tests, design of the experiments was evaluated to minimize any prediction error. Statistical analyses demonstrated the models' validity and adequacy for anticipation of the removal of BOD and COD by the process. The models predictions (with desirability of 0.98) were found to be in very good agreement with confirmative experiments results. The results indicated that under convenient operating conditions of the studied variables (packing rate 70%, HRT 24 h, and MLSS 3000 mg/L), the removal efficiencies for BOD and COD were 97.8 and 95.6%, respectively. Moreover, kinetics of the biological process showed that removal of organic matters for the tested wastewater adheres to modified Stover-Kincannon model with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. Ratio of BOD to COD of 0.6 (optimal range for biological treatment normally is [0.5) suggests acceptable efficiency of the reactor for decomposing organic load. A high overall efficiency of the process and fulfilling the related standards make this system an appropriate option for treating HDW.

AB In recent years, because of both lowered discharge limits and reduction of usable water sources, reutilization of water became inevitable. This situation makes the application of advanced water treatment technologies compulsory. In this study, applicability of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) methods was investigated for reuse of industrial wastewater treated with advanced treatment method at organized industrial zone. For this purpose, two NF (HL-GE and DL-GE) and one RO (AG-BWRO) membranes were used at 10 bar of applied pressure. Permeability test revealed that HL membrane exhibited the highest permeability with 7.22 +/- 0.79 L/m(2) h bar of permeability constant followed by AG membrane with a permeability constant of 6.03 +/- 0.25 L/m(2) h bar. Less permeable membrane was DL with a permeability constant of 2.08 +/- 0.11 L/m(2) h bar. In terms of rejection performance, conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-) and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) were rejected by HL membrane with an average rejection of 37.2 +/- 2.1%, 38.6 +/- 2.5%, 72.5 +/- 5.5%, 79.9 +/- 6.1%, 85.4 +/- 1.2%, 86.0 +/- 0.5%, 88.8 +/- 0.3%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 46.0 +/- 0.9%, 27.0 +/- 0.3% 17.9 +/- 1.1%, 64.3 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The respective rejections by DL membrane were 31.1 +/- 0.8%, 31.2 +/- 1.1%, 36.8 +/- 16.4%, 68.2 +/- 7.3%, 81.0 +/- 4.0%, 77.9 +/- 0.7%, 84.7 +/- 07%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 41.0 +/- 04%, 18.4 +/- 1.7%, 14.0 +/- 1.3%, and 45.2 +/- 2.7%. On the other hand, higher water quality was obtained with AG-BWRO membrane. AG-BWRO achieved conductivity, salinity, COD, TOC and color rejections of 96.8 +/- 0.2%, 96.9 +/- 0.1%, 74.7 +/- 2.8%, 90.5 +/- 4.8% and 87.6 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Divalent ions and monovalent ions were rejected by AG-BWRO membrane with an average rejection of higher than 94%. In conclusion, AG-BWRO membrane was found to be the best membrane considering both product water quality and quantity. DL membrane was found to be the worst one among the three membranes investigated in this work. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bicarbonate anion (HCO3-) is a major constituent in wastewater and natural water matrices, and the aim of this study was to investigate its roles in the degradation of the antineoplastic agent methotrexate via UV/TiO2. A comprehensive investigation of reaction mechanisms was performed by conducting scavenger experiments and substructure reactivity and Microtox (R) toxicity tests. In the presence of HCO3-, the methotrexate degradation rate substantially increased, indicating the involvement of (CO3-)-C-center dot. The estimated second-order rate constants of methotrexate with (CO3-)-C-center dot and (OH)-O-center dot were 1.4 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) and 8.7 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Both the valence hole (h(vb)(+)) and (OH)-O-center dot resulted in the generation of (CO3-)-C-center dot. Initial transformation pathways of methotrexate were proposed, including the addition of atomic oxygen, hydroxylation, deamination, C-C cleavage and C-N cleavage. C-N cleavage at the aniline moiety (the N(13) position) is the primary decomposition pathway, leading to an aminopterin yield of 43%. (CO3-)-C-center dot preferentially reacted with the 4-aminobenzamide (ABZ) moiety and generated toxic byproducts during the later stages of decomposition, which was not observed in the UV/TiO2 system. The reactivity of the three methotrexate substructures decreased in the following order in the presence of HCO3-: ABZ >> DHP >> LG similar to 0; however, without HCO3-, the following order was observed: ABZ similar to DHP > LG. The results of this work suggest that the increase in toxicity induced by the presence of HCO3- likely occurs in many other (OH)-O-center dot-based advanced oxidation processes in wastewater containing pharmaceutical cocktails with ABZ moieties.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiency for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in two of eThekwini Municipality's wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), Kingsburgh and Umbilo, were investigated. This paper describes a simple method that can be used routinely for the simultaneous determination of such compounds in the influent and effluent of the WWTPs. Target compounds were extracted from wastewater and pre-concentrated using the optimized Oasis MAX solidphase extraction (SPE) method. During SPE, the pH of wastewater samples was adjusted to 2.5; then 100 mL of each sample was loaded onto a pre-conditioned cartridge. The SPE cartridge was rinsed with methanol: water (10: 90%, v: v) prior to sequential elution of retained analytes with 2 mL methanol, followed by 2 mL methanol and acetic acid (90: 10, v:v) and 2 mL of 2% (v:v) formic acid diluted using a mixture of methanol and acetic acid (40:60, v:v). The eluted analytes from the SPE cartridge were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with photo diode array detection. The analytical method was validated by spiking deionized water with 5 and 50 mu g . L-1 of target compounds, for which the recovery range of 76 to 98% was achieved with good precision. The instrument quantification limits obtained were 0.1 mu g . L-1, for naproxen and 0.4 mu g . L-1 for both ibuprofen and diclofenac. The detected concentrations for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in the influent of both WWTPs were in the ranges of 15-20 mu g . L-1, 55-69 mu g . L-1 and 6.4-16 mu g . L-1, respectively. In effluent, the detected concentrations for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were in the ranges of 0.6-1.1, 2.1-4.2 and 1.4-2.0 mu g . L-1, respectively. Overall, the employed SPE-HPLC method led to rapid pre-concentration of target compounds prior to their trace quantification in wastewater samples.

AB In this work the optimal operating conditions for removing selected micropollutants (also known as emerging contaminants, ECs) from actual municipal wastewater by graphene adsorption (GA) and simultaneous electrocoagulation/electrofiltration (EC/EF) process, respectively, were first determined and evaluated. Then, performance and mechanisms for the removal of selected phthalates and pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater simultaneously by the GA and EC/EF process were further assessed. ECs of concern included di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), acetaminophen (ACE), caffeine (CAF), cefalexin (CLX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). It was found that GA plus EC/EF process yielded the following removal efficiencies: DnBP, 89 +/- 2%; DEHP, 85 +/- 3%; ACE, 99 +/- 2%; CAF, 94 +/- 3%; CLX, 100 +/- 0%; and SMX, 98 +/- 2%. Carbon adsorption, size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, electrocoagulation, and electrofiltration were considered as the main mechanisms for the removal of target ECs by the integrated process indicated above.

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) using highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a promising strategy for indirect potable water reuse. Treated wastewater effluent can contain a number of residual contaminants that could have adverse effects on human health, and some jurisdictions have regulations in place to govern these. For those that do not, but where reuse may be under consideration, it is of crucial importance to develop a strategy for identifying priority contaminants, which can then be used to understand the water treatment technologies that might be required. In this study, a multi-criteria approach to identify critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for MAR was developed and applied using a case study site located in southern Ontario, Canada. An important aspect of this approach was the selection of representative compounds for each group of contaminants, based on potential for occurrence in wastewater and expected health or environmental impacts. Due to a lack of MAR regulations in Canada, the study first proposed potential recharge water quality targets. Predominant contaminants, potential additional contaminants, and potential emerging contaminants, which together comprise critical contaminants for MAR with reclaimed water, were then selected based on the case study wastewater effluent monitoring data and literature data. This paper proposes an approach for critical contaminant selection, which will be helpful to guide future implementation of MAR projects using wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB Environmental release of veterinary pharmaceuticals has been of regulatory concern for more than a decade. Monensin is a feed additive antibiotic that is prevalent throughout the dairy industry and is excreted in dairy waste. This study investigates the potential of dairy waste management practices to alter the amount of monensin available for release into the environment. Analysis of wastewater and groundwater from two dairy farms in California consistently concluded that monensin is most present in lagoon water and groundwater downgradient of lagoons. Since the lagoons represent a direct source of monensin to groundwater, the effect of waste management, by mechanical screen separation and lagoon aeration, on aqueous monensin concentration was investigated through construction of lagoon microcosms. The results indicate that monensin attenuation is not improved by increased solid-liquid separation prior to storage in lagoons, as monensin is rapidly desorbed after dilution with water. Monensin is also shown to be easily degraded in lagoon microcosms receiving aeration, but is relatively stable and available for leaching under typical anaerobic lagoon conditions.

AB This study investigates the influence of feed solution pH and fouling on the rejection of ten selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) with different physicochemical characteristics (molecular weight, water solubility, log Kow, pKa, dipole moment, etc.) by three multichannel ceramic ultrafiltration membranes, ranging from 1 to 8 kDa, in order to improve their removal from water. For this purpose, the comparison between filtration of PhACs in deionised water (Feed I) and in real wastewater effluent (Feed II) was performed, demonstrating that the variation of pH and the formation of a foulant layer altered the separation mechanism and hence the rejection values of each PhAC varied. Higher rejections of most of the PhACs were higher at slightly alkaline pH, especially for anionic compounds in the filtration with real wastewater. In these conditions, flux decline was more severe. The formed fouling layer onto the hydrophilic membrane surface acted as a secondary barrier for separation with different properties like hydrophobicity and charge. Electrostatic interactions were the main separation mechanism in the filtration of PhACs in deionised water, while the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions played a crucial role in the filtration experiments with real wastewater effluent. Thus, the reported results indicated that the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds was strongly pH-dependent, except for hydrophilic neutral compounds (acetaminophen and caffeine), which showed a pH-independent behaviour with low rejection values.

AB In this work, it is studied the treatment of real wastewater (intensified with two target compounds) using electro-irradiated technologies. Two types of effluents coming from an organic-synthesis pharmaceutical industry and the outlet of a municipal wastewater treatment plant were intensified with metoprolol (beta-blocker) and caffeine (stimulant), respectively. Conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO), photolysis, sonolysis and all possible combinations among these technologies were evaluated for the treatment of both wastes. Results demonstrate that complete oxidation of the target compounds, as well as mineralization of the organic compounds contained in the matrixes, can be attained by all electro-irradiated technologies and no salt addition was needed to obtain an efficient treatment. Single irradiated technologies were inefficient in the oxidation but their combination with CDEO improves significantly the efficiency of the process showing clear synergistic effects. However, due to the large energy requirement of ultrasound irradiation, this combination is only cost-effective in the case of ultraviolet irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The overarching aim of this field study was to examine causal links between in-situ exposure to complex mixtures of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants and effects on freshwater microbial communities in the receiving streams. To reach this goal, we assessed the toxicity of serial dilutions of micropollutant mixtures, extracted from deployed passive samplers at the discharge sites of four Swiss wastewater treatment plants, to in situ periphyton from upstream and downstream of the effluents. On the one hand, comparison of the sensitivities of upstream and downstream periphyton to the micro pollutant mixtures indicated that algal and bacterial communities composing the periphyton displayed higher tolerance towards these micropollutants downstream than upstream. On the other hand, molecular analyses of the algal and bacterial structure showed a clear separation between upstream and downstream periphyton across the sites. This finding provides an additional line of evidence that micropollutants from the wastewater discharges were directly responsible for the change in the community structure at the sampling sites by eliminating the micropollutant-sensitive species and favouring the tolerant ones. What is more, the fold increase of algal and bacterial tolerance from upstream to downstream locations was variable among sampling sites and was strongly correlated to the intensity of contamination by micropollutants at the respective sites. Overall, our study highlights the sensitivity of the proposed approach to disentangle effects of micropollutant mixtures from other environmental factors occurring in the field and, thus, establishing a causal link between exposure and the observed ecological effects on freshwater microbial communities.

AB For photocatalytic degradation of organic pharmaceutical pollutants in wastewater, an important limitation is low photonic efficiency. To solve this problem, using periodic illumination is a good option. However, due to the nature of widely applied traditional mercury lamp, which cannot be turned on and off efficiently, the study of periodic illumination was limited. In this research, ultraviolet-A/light emitting diode (UVA/LED) lamp was introduced and a TiO2/UVA/LED photocatalytic system was setup for acetaminophen (Ace) degradation study. The background study was conducted, which included the effects of H2O2, humic acid and bicarbonate ion concentrations. Different periodic pulse frequencies were applied, results in this study shows that smallest duty cycle (0.2) and shortest cycle time (20 ms) gave the highest photonic efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of Ace in the studied range. The effect of additional H2O2 was also studied. H2O2 added into the heterogeneous reaction system enhanced both decomposition rate and photonic efficiency under both continuous illumination mode and periodic illumination mode. The enhancement effect of H2O2, however, was found more obvious for controlled periodic illumination, especially for small duty cycles and short cycle times. In addition, by the addition of H2O2, the mineralization of Ace was accelerated probably due to the increase of hydroxyl radical concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the significance of changes of UV absorbance and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as surrogate indicators for assessing the formation of bromate and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) during the ozonation of surface water and wastewater effluent. Spectroscopic monitoring was carried out using benchtop UV/Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers and a newly developed miniature LED UV/fluorescence sensor capable of rapidly measuring UVA280 and protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. With the increase of O-3/DOC mass ratio, the plots of BDOC formation were characterized of initial lag, transition slope and final plateau. With the decrease of UV absorbance and fluorescence, BDOC concentrations initially increased slowly and then rose more noticeably. Inflection points in plots of BDOC versus changes of spectroscopic indicators were close to 35 -45% loss of UVA254 or UVA280 and 75-85% loss of humic-like fluorescence. According to the data from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with organic carbon detection and 2D synchronous correlation analyses, DOM fractions assigned to operationally defined large biopolymers (apparent molecular weight, AMW>20 kDa) and medium AMW humic substances (AMW 5.5-20 kDa) were transformed into medium-size building blocks (AMW 3-5.5 kDa) and other smaller AMW species (AMW<3 kDa) associated with BDOC at increasing 03/DOC ratios. Appreciable bromate formation was observed only after the values of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence in 03-treated samples were decreased by 45 55%, 50-60% and 86-92% relative to their respective initial levels. No significant differences in plots of bromate concentrations versus decreases of humic-like fluorescence were observed for surface water and wastewater effluent samples. This was in contrast with the plots of bromate concentration versus UVA254 and UVA280 which exhibited sensitivity to varying initial bromide concentrations in the investigated water matrixes. These results suggest that measurements of humic-like fluorescence can provide a useful supplement to UVA indices for characterization of ozonation processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Here, we presented a novel industrial application for membrane distillation (MD) in a pharmaceutical production facility's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Two semicommercial air gap MD module designs (Xzero and Eldr500) were studied for comparison, with experimental results of product yield and heat demand up-scaled for inclusion in system simulations. District heating was considered to drive the 3 m(3)/h capacity MD process, with heat recovery employed in various process streams and for heating purposes in offices. The selected configurations show a high degree of thermal integration with an increase of yearly district heating purchases of 2-13%. Economic assessments of the full-scale MD system indicate that unit costs of purification would be $1.3/m(3) and $7/m(3) for Elixier500 and Xzero MD modules, respectively. Module heat losses should be considered in the future design of MD systems since the heat demand contributed to up to 77% of the specific costs.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) negatively impacts granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption of micro pollutants and is a disinfection byproduct precursor. DOM from surface waters, wastewater effluent, and 1 kDa size fractions were adsorbed by GAC and characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-absorption, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fluorescing DOM was preferentially adsorbed relative to UV-absorbing DOM. Humic-like fluorescence (peaks A and C) was selectively adsorbed relative to polyphenol-like fluorescence (peaks T and B) potentially due to size exclusion effects. In the surface waters and size fractions, peak C was preferentially removed relative to peak A, whereas the reverse was found in wastewater effluent, indicating that humic-like fluorescence is associated with different compounds depending on DOM source. Based on specific UV-absorption (SUVA), aromatic DOM was preferentially adsorbed. The fluorescence index (FI), if interpreted as an indicator of aromaticity, indicated the opposite but exhibited a strong relationship with average molecular weight, suggesting that FI might be a better indicator of DOM size than aromaticity. The influence of DOM intermolecular interactions on adsorption were minimal based on SEC analysis. Fluorescence parameters captured the impact of DOM size on the fouling of 2-methylisoborneol and warfarin adsorption and correlated with direct competition and pore blockage indicators.

AB The photochemical transformation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists. In the current study, the photo degradation of 29 PPCPs was examined in effluents under simulated solar irradiation. Direct photodegradation, triplet state effluent organic matter ((3)EfOM*)-mediated and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot)-mediated degradation are three major pathways in the removal process. With the photodegradation of trace levels of PPCPs, the excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence intensities of the effluents were also gradually reduced. Therefore, fluorescence peaks have been identified, for the first time, as appropriate surrogates to assess the photodegradation of PPCPs. The humic-like fluorescence peak is linked to direct photolysis-labile PPCPs, such as naproxen, ronidazole, diclofenac, ornidazole, tinidazole, chloramphenicol, flumequine, ciprofloxacin, methadone, and dimetridazole. The tyrosine-like EEM peak is associated with HO center dot/CO3 center dot- -labile PPCPs, such as trimethoprim, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, carbamazepine, and cephalexin. The tryptophan-like peak is associated with (3)EfOM*-labile PPCPs, such as clenbuterol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, bisphenol A, propranolol, ractopamine, salbutamol, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, famotidine, terbutaline, and erythromycin. The reduction in EEM fluorescence correlates well with the removal of PPCPs, allowing a model to be constructed. The solar-driven removal of EEM fluorescence was applied to predict the attenuation of 11 PPCPs in five field. samples. A close correlation between the predicted results and the experimental results suggests that fluorescence may be a suitable surrogate for monitoring the solar-driven photodegradation of PPCPs in effluents.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as hydroxyl radical (HO center dot)- and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-mediated oxidation, are alternatives for the attenuation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater effluents. However, the kinetics of these reactions needs to be investigated. In this study, kinetic models for 15 PPCPs were built to predict the degradation of PPCPs in both HO center dot- and SO4 center dot--mediated oxidation. In the UV/H2O2 process, a simplified kinetic model involving only steady state concentrations of HO center dot and its biomolecular reaction rate constants is suitable for predicting the removal of PPCPs, indicating the dominant role of HO center dot in the removal of PPCPs. In the UV/K2S2O8 process, the calculated steady state concentrations of CO3 center dot- and bromine radicals (Br-center dot, Br-2(center dot-) and BrCl center dot-) were 600-fold and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of SO4 center dot-, respectively. The kinetic model, involving both SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot- as reactive species, was more accurate for predicting the removal of the 9 PPCPs, except for salbutamol and nitroimidazoles. The steric and ionic effects of organic matter toward SO4 center dot- could lead to overestimations of the removal efficiencies of the SO4 center dot--mediated oxidation of nitroimidazoles in wastewater effluents.

AB In this study, an analytical methods for determination of antidepressants including (diazepam (DZP), lorazepam (LZP), carbamazepine (CBZ), fluoxetine (FLU)) was developed. The concentration of antidepressants was monitored in Konya Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant influent and effluent samples for one years. Environmental risk assessment was performed with detected concentration with treatment plant effluent wastewater by hazard quotient (HQ) methods. Oasis HLB cartridges with SPE system was used for extraction of wastewater samples. The effect of sample volume and pH, different analyte concentration, pretreatment and matrix on efficiency of cartridges were optimized. Quantitative analyses of the target compounds were performed by LC/MS-MS system. Recoveries of antidepressant compounds from fortified wastewater were over 87% for three different fortification levels. The limits of detection were determined between 0.006 and 0.118 ng l(-1). CBZ, FLU and LZP concentration in influent varied from 6.3 to 135.6 ng l(-1), <dl to 2.6 ng l(-1), <dl to 4.8 ng l(-1), respectively, while DZP was not detected. CBZ, DZP, FLU and LZP concentrations in the effluent was determined as <dl-245.1 ng l(-1), <dl-0.21 ng l(-1), <dl-2.7 ng l(-1), <dl-2.2 ng l(-1), respectively. Antidepressants were generally removed in January, February, and August. The high removal was determined for CBZ compounds as % 100 at January. The low removal was determined for FLU compounds as % 2.4 at January.
   While the HQ values for DZP, LZP, CBZ were determined below 0.1 which means insignificant risk to aquatic organisms, HQ values for FLU determined above 0.1 which means low risk to aquatic organism

AB The increasing demand on water resources throughout the world has motivated researchers to seek new ways to obtain quality water increasing their interest in water reclamation. However, the presence of harmful organic chemicals such as pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is a serious environmental concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the pH on the rejection of seven target PhACs (acetaminophen, caffeine, erythromycin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) by different low-pressure membranes within the fine ultrafiltration (UF) and loose nanofiltration (NF) range. For this purpose, three ceramic membranes and a polyamide membrane were used for UF and NF experiments, respectively. Experimental results indicated that PhACs with negative charge were effectively rejected at basic conditions (< 75% for UF, < 90% for NF), improving both their hydrophilicity and solubility with increasing pH. Furthermore, high soluble PhACs with high pKa values showed low rejection values (similar to 15% for UF, similar to 30% for NF) and a pH-independent behaviour during low-pressure filtration experiments. Therefore, the use of low-pressure membranes could be considered as an appropriate and sustainable supplemental technique to remove PhACs in a wastewater treatment plant.

AB Gallic acid is a major phenolic pollutant present in the wastewater generated from cork boiling, olive mill, and pharmaceutical industries. Experimental and statistical modelling using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were carried out for reactive separation of gallic acid from aqueous stream using tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) in hexanol. TBP has a more significant effect on extraction efficiency as compared to temperature and pH. The optimum conditions of 2.34 g L-1, 65.65 % v/v, 19 degrees C, and 1.8 of initial concentration of gallic acid, concentration of TBP, temperature, and pH, respectively, were obtained using RSM. Under optimum conditions, extraction efficiency of 99.45 % was obtained for gallic acid. The ANN and RSM results were compared with experimental unseen data. Error analysis suggested the better performance of ANN for extraction efficiency predictions.

AB In this work, the degradation and mineralization of ortho-toluidine (OT) that is one of the constituents of petrochemical wastewater was investigated by the TiO2/O-3 process. The influence of some operational parameters such as concentration of pollutant (30-90 mg L-1), initial pH and amounts of TiO2 was investigated. A radical mechanism with the formation of an anion radical superoxide radical prior to hydroxyl radical is suggested for describing the interaction between ozone and TiO2. These results were not similar to the ozonation process alone, in which higher pH had a positive effect on the removal of OT because of the generation of hydroxyl radicals. In optimum pH for the ozonation and O-3/TiO2 processes, the degradation efficiency of the OT was 89.5 and 96%, respectively, at 60 min of reaction. Furthermore, it was made clear that in catalytic ozonation, the degradation efficiency of the OT was higher at neutral pH conditions (pH = 7). The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased from 47.5% (only ozonation) to 73% (O-3/TiO2) after 90 min of reaction. The kinetics of degradation was pseudo-first order; the degradation and relative mineralization of the OT were calculated by HPLC and COD tests, respectively.

AB Rapid development of pharmaceutical industry, and thus widespread availability of different types of therapeutical and increased intake of pharmaceuticals, results in elevated concentrations of pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater subjected to treatment in wastewater treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals present in raw wastewater discharged from hospitals, households, veterinary and health care clinics eventually end up in wastewater treatment plants. Commonly applied methods for treating wastewater do not allow complete removal of these contaminants. As a consequence, pharmaceuticals still present in treated wastewater are introduced to water environment. The most frequently identified pharmaceuticals in surface water belong to the following groups: non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, estrogens and lipid regulators. The most difficult is removal of diclofenac, clofibric acid and carbamazepine as these substances show low biodegradability. Diclofenac can be removed in the process of wastewater treatment by 40%, carbamazepine by 10%, and clofibric acid from 26 to 50%. The presence of diclofenac sodium in the rivers in Poland was confirmed and the concentrations were following: 380 ng/dm(3) (the Warta river), 470 ng/dm(3) (the Odra river), 140 ng/dm(3) (the Vistula river). Naproxene was found in the Warta river at the concentration of 100 ng/dm(3). The presence of pharmaceuticals in surface water can be toxic to aqueous microorganisms and fish. Recent studies confirmed also the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. This is considered as a problem especially in urban agglomerations such as Berlin or large cities in Spain and China. The studies showed that pharmaceuticals were also identified in the samples taken from the Polish rivers and drinking water. The presence of naproxene and diclofenac at the concentrations of 13 and 4 ng/dm(3) was identified in drinking water sampled from water intakes in Poznan. Surface water and drinking water showed also the presence of illegal drugs.

AB This work evaluated the photo-Fenton degradation of two pharmaceuticals extensively used in human medicine, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and fluoxetine (FLU) when present in an anaerobic pre-treated hospital effluent (HE) at low concentration (100 mu g L-1). Operational parameters such as concentration of hydrogen peroxide, iron, and initial pH as well as the effect of iron citrate complex were evaluated considering the degradation of the pharmaceuticals. Iron citrate complex (Fecit) influenced significantly FLU degradation at pH 4.5 achieving 80 % after 20 min, while with iron nitrate only 36 % degradation was obtained after the same time. However, only a slight effect was observed on CIP degradation, achieving 86% with Fecit and 75% with Fe(NO3)(3), after 20 min. Samples of HE used in this work were previously treated in an anaerobic reactor followed by sand filtration; however, the presence of pharmaceuticals was detected. Degradation of both FLU and CIP was significantly hindered when present in HE, due to the relatively high content of organic (39.6 mg L-1) and inorganic (12.5 mg L-1) carbon, which may have consumed OH in side reactions. However, the iron cycle reduction was not affected by the matrix in the presence of citrate. Despite the recalcitrance of the matrix (no total organic carbon removal), it was possible to achieve over 50 % degradation of both pharmaceuticals after 90 min.

AB A fast and simple method for the analysis of 17 commonly used antibiotics in Finland in water samples was developed. The method combines online solid phase extraction using a reusable online trapping column combined with analytical separation on a C-18 analytical column and detection by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The method was fully validated for detection and quantification limits as well as linearity, repeatability, and matrix effects. The method gave an excellent linear response (r (2) > 0.99) and detection limits for all compounds (1-10 ng(-1)), except for tetracycline (20 ng l(-1)) and roxithromycin (50 ng l(-1)). The repeatability was evaluated at two concentrations, and the values at 5 ng l(-1) ranged from 5 to 39% and at 100 ng l(-1) ranged from 3 to 19%. To test the method on real samples at low environmental concentrations, water samples collected from a river receiving discharges from two wastewater treatment plants were analyzed as well as samples from a pristine river. Seven antibiotics as well as carbamazepine were detected in the samples. The concentration of the compounds ranged from 5 to 81 ng l(-1).

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) receive industrial effluents from the plant that contain extremely high levels of antibiotics and are regarded as one of the major sources of antibiotics in the environment. Two PWWTPs have been selected in Zhejiang Province, China, to assess the removal mechanisms of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs). PWWTP A uses activated sludge with biocarriers in a moving bed biofilm reactor in anoxic and aerobic units, and PWWTP B uses biological units under anaerobic, aerobic, and anoxic conditions. The wastewater samples and solid samples (sludge and suspended solid matter) were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Ofloxacin (OFX) was detected in each stage of PWWTP A, and enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected in PWWTP B. The concentrations of FQs ranged from 0.32 mu g/L to 5.7 mg/L. Although the FQs were largely removed in the biological units (94.5 to 99.9%), large amounts were still discharged in the final effluent (up to 88.0 +/- 7.0 mu g/L) and dewatered sludge (up to 0.85 +/- 0.24 mg/kg). Mass balance analyses of samples from PWWTP A indicated that biodegradation (93.8%) was the major mechanism responsible for the removal of OFX, whereas the contribution of sorption by sludge (0.79%) was less significant, deviating from the findings of most similar studies. Using linear analysis and correlation analysis, we found that the log(10) values of the FQ concentration in the sludge were positively related with the log(10) values of the equilibrium concentration in water (C (w) ). These relationships can be described by a Freundlich-like equation. However, these relationships were negative when the C (w) values were high. Our preliminary explanation is that the equilibrium C (w) plays an important role in controlling the sorption behavior of FQs in activated sludge.

AB Advanced oxidation processes that utilize highly oxidative radicals are widely used in water reuse treatment. In recent years, the application of sulfate radical (SO(4)c(center dot-)) as a promising oxidant for water treatment has gained increasing attention. To understand the efficiency of SO(4)c(center dot-) in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater effluent, it is important to be able to predict the reaction kinetics of various SO(4)c(center dot-) -driven oxidation reactions. In this study, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) and high-level wavefunction-based methods (including computationally-intensive coupled cluster methods), to explore the activation energies of SO(4)c(center dot-) -driven oxidation reactions on a series of benzene-derived contaminants. These high-level calculations encompass a wide set of reactions including 110 forward/reverse reactions and 5 different computational methods in total. Based on the high-level coupledcluster quantum calculations, we find that the popular M06-2X DFT functional is significantly more accurate for OH- additions than for SO(4)c(center dot-) reactions. Most importantly, we highlight some of the limitations and deficiencies of other computational methods, and we recommend the use of high-level quantum calculations to spot-check environmental chemistry reactions that may lie outside the training set of the M06-2X functional, particularly for water oxidation reactions that involve SO(4)c(center dot-) and other inorganic species.

AB In the current era of human life, we face an increased consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nevertheless, NSAIDs are not entirely metabolized by humans and are thus excreted into domestical effluents, whereas expired medications are recurrently directly disposed into wastewaters. Several studies have already demonstrated that an extensive diversity of pharmaceuticals is present in aqueous effluents and is therefore a matter of serious concern with regard to wildlife and public health. In this perspective, this work is focused on the use of a liquid liquid extraction approach for the removal of NSAIDs from aqueous media. In particular, aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of ionic liquids (ILs) and aluminum-based salts were used for the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. With these systems, extraction efficiencies of NSAIDs up to 100% into the IL-rich phase were obtained in a single-step. Further, the recovery of NSAIDs from the IL medium and the recyclability of the IL-rich phase were ascertained aiming at developing a more sustainable and cost-effective strategy. On the basis of the remarkable increase of the NSAIDs solubility in the IL-rich phase (from 300- to 4100-fold when compared with pure water), water was used as an effective antisolvent, where recovery percentages of NSAIDs from the IL-rich phase up to 91% were obtained. After the "cleaning" of the IL-rich phase by the induced precipitation of NSAIDs, the phase-forming components were recovered and reused in four consecutive cycles, with no detected losses on both the extraction efficiency and recovery of NSAIDs.

AB In the first part of a broader study on the effects of individual and multicomponent mixtures of pharmaceutical active compounds, the authors used the Microtox((R)) test system to analyze in detail the effects of 10 widely used human and veterinary pharmaceutical active compounds toward the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri. The experimental results indicated moderate toxicity for the majority of the tested compounds. Comparison between experimental 50% inhibitory concentrations and those predicted from the quantitative structure-activity relationship models indicated that most of the tested pharmaceutical active compounds behave as polar narcotic compounds toward A. fischeri (only the antibiotic chlortetracycline seemed to have a specific mechanism of action). A comparison between the experimental results and a collection of acute toxicity data on other nontarget organisms indicated that in general A. fischeri has a comparable sensitivity to other aquatic species. However, according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, the majority of the investigated chemicals can be classified as harmful or nontoxic for aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on comparisons among the 95th percentile of measured environmental concentrations found in European Union water bodies and acute toxicity data on various aquatic organisms, no risk to aquatic life exists when the tested pharmaceutical active compounds are assessed as individual chemicals.

AB The electrochemical degradation kinetics of diclofenac (DCF) using graphite-PVC composite as anode was assessed in pure water and effluent wastewat er. Effects of initial concentration of diclofenac, chloride ion (Cl-) loading, type of sample and applied voltage were determined to test and validate a kinetic model for the oxidation of diclofenac by the electrochemic al oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of diclofenac followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The rate constant values ranged from 0.018 to 0.173 /min, depending on the operating parameters. However, 6 V and 4 g/L NaCl were selected for further experiments (96.9% removal of diclofenac and 0.0078 kWh/g diclofenac consumption energy) after 30 min and at 20 mg/L of diclofenac. High consumption energy (0.0303 kWh/g diclofenac) was accompanied with high applied voltage of 10 V so it was not considered in this study.
   Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ToF/MS) was used for the elucidation of the main transformation products (TPs) which are resulted from the degradation of diclofenac (DCF) during the application of graphite-PVC composite as anode in aqueous matrices. The toxicity of DCF and its TPs was assessed against E. coli bacteria at different incubation time. (C) 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics such as tetracycline are used on a large scale in agriculture, and can become concentrated in wastewater lagoons that are used in conjunction with confined animal feeding operations. Solar-illuminated titanium dioxide can be used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous tetracycline, but its application in a lagoon environment requires that the photocatalyst be supported on a macroscopic support material to prevent loss of the nanoscale photocatalyst into the environment. In this work, titanium dioxide was deposited within a porous poly(methyl methacrylate) film on the surface of floating 7.0 cm diameter acrylic spheres. Six of these floating spheres removed over 96% of the tetracycline in 3.5 L of 60 mg/L tetracycline in natural pond water during 24 hours of solar illumination. The durability of these spheres under long-term solar exposure was also investigated along with the amount of photocatalyst lost from the sphere surface during use. These macroscale floating composite spheres provide a new method for removing tetracycline from wastewater lagoons with minimal risk of being displaced in the environment due to the large size of the spheres.

AB Fourteen antibiotics, including five quinolones (QNs), five sulfonamides (SAs), and four tetracyclines (TCs), were selected to investigate their occurrence and elimination in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) by employing different treatment technologies in Urumqi (two STPs) and Shihezi (one STP), China. The STP in Shihezi was chosen as representative to investigate the distribution of antibiotics in a sludge-sewage system. Results showed that the concentrations of most detected antibiotics ranged from tens to hundreds of nanograms per liter in influent samples and under 100 ng L-1 in effluent samples. QNs and TCs were dominant species with concentrations of 2.33 mg kg (-1) to 3.34 mg kg (-1) and 0.36 mg kg (-1) to 0.47 mg kg (-1) in sludge samples, respectively. The elimination rates of target antibiotics by various STPs ranged from 17% to 100%. The STP with anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic and membrane bio-reactor technology removed antibiotics more efficiently than those with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditch technology. The elimination capacities of treatment units from the three STPs were also investigated. SAs were mainly degraded in biological treatment units; conversely, QNs and TCs were significantly eliminated in sedimentary treatment units. Ozonation effectively removed remaining antibiotics but not UV and chlorination disinfection in this study.

AB Treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are a significant source of anthropogenic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, in the aquatic environment. Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O-2 consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site. We discuss our findings in relation to exposure site water quality, concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care product pollutants, and our test species tolerance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forest-water reuse systems infiltrate municipal, industrial, and agricultural Wastewaters through forest soils to shallow aquifers that ultimately discharge to surface waters. Their ability to Mitigate regulated nutrients, metals, and organic chemicals is well known, but the fate of non-regulated chemicals in these systems is largely unstudied. This study quantified 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in soils, groundwaters, and surface waters in a 2000-hectare forest that receives similar to 1200 mm/year of secondary-treated, municipal Wastewater in addition to natural rainfall (similar to 1300 mm/year). This forest-water reuse system does contribute PPCPs to soils, groundwater, and surface waters. PPCPs were more abundant in soils versus underlying groundwater by an order of magnitude (5-10 ng/g summed PPCPs in soil and 50-100 ng/L in groundwater) and the more hydrophobic chemicals were predominant in soil over water. PPCP concentrations in surface waters were greater at the onset of significant storm events and during low-rainfall periods when total summed PPCPs were >80 ng/L, higher than the annual average. With few exceptions, the margins of exposure for PPCPs in groundwater and surface waters were several orders of magnitude above values indicative of human health risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotics that play an important role in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. FQs can reach wastewater treatment plants from different routes, and eventually accumulate in activated sludge. In this study, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with HPLC-FLD detection method was utilized to investigate the partition and fate of FQs in digested sludge when thermal hydrolysis was used as pretreatment. As a result, thermal hydrolysis showed minor effects on the fate of FQs in batch anaerobic digestion processes, while anaerobic digestion alone removed >60% FQs and finally assisted in the mitigation of the inhibitory effects to microbial communities.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze pharmaceuticals in wastewater from eight selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Slovakia. We analyzed 125 pharmaceutical compounds and selected 14 from the most common therapeutic classes, i. e., antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin), antifungal (fluconazole and clotrimazole), antihistaminic (fexofenadine and meclozine), antithrombotic (dipyridamole), hypertension (eprosartan, telmisartan, and valsartan), analgetics (diclofenac), and psychiatric (tramadol and carbamazepine). The results show the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater in concentrations ranging from low ng dm(-3) to a few lg dm(-3). The highest maximum concentrations were detected for cardiovascular pharmaceuticals (32.98 mu g dm(-3) valsartan; 17.10 mu g dm(-3) telmisartan) and antibiotics (25.66 mu g dm(-3) ciprofloxacin, 13.98 mu g dm(-3) clarithromycin). We also analyzed the daily load of pharmaceuticals compounds in Slovak WWTPs. The study shows that telmisartan has the highest median load (2270 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) followed by ciprofloxacin (2210 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) in Piest any town.

AB The first part of our study is focused on the analysis of wastewaters composition from the effluence of four Slovak and three Czech wastewater treatment plants. The presence of 30 psychoactive substances and their main metabolites, antibiotic resistant coliforms and S. aureus were determined. The highest concentrations were observed in the case of cotinine, methamphetamine, tramadol, venlafaxine, and oxazepam. The amount of coliforms ranged from 0.6 to 2.7 log CFU/cm(3). The majority of them showed ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. The amount of S. aureus ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 log CFU/cm(3) with methicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin resistance. The second part of this study was focused on the treatment of respective wastewaters by anodic oxidation of contaminants by boron doped diamond electrodes, which were tested applying various current intensities (12.50, 18.75, 40.00 mA/cm(2)). Obtained results indicate that this method is able to effectively degrade a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals and drugs that are insufficiently removed by traditional processes at wastewater treatment plants, such as oxazepam, venlafaxine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, cotinine, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, and citalopram with the efficiency more than 50%. Moreover, the only 1 h lasting treatment caused the elimination of the total bacteria count including the resistant types under the detection limit.

AB This work evaluates the biodegradation of the antiviral drug acyclovir by an enriched nitrifying culture during ammonia oxidation and without the addition of ammonium. The study on kinetics was accompanied with the structural elucidation of biotransformation products through batch biodegradation experiments at two different initial levels of acyclovir (15 mg L-1 and 15 mu g L-1). The pseudo first order kinetic studies of acyclovir in the presence of ammonium indicated the higher degradation rates under higher ammonia oxidation rates than those constant degradation rates in the absence of ammonium. The positive correlation was found between acyclovir degradation rate and ammonia oxidation rate, confirming the cometabolism of acyclovir by the enriched nitrifying culture in the presence of ammonium. Formation of the product carboxy-acyclovir (P239) indicated the main biotransformation pathway was aerobic oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group, which was independent on the metabolic type (i.e. cometabolism or metabolism). This enzyme-linked reaction might be catalyzed by monooxygenase from ammonia oxidizing bacteria or heterotrophs. The formation of carboxy-acyclovir was demonstrated to be irrelevant to the acyclovir concentrations applied, indicating the revealed biotransformation pathway might be the dominant removal pathway of acyclovir in wastewater treatment.

AB As reuse of municipal water resource recovery facility (WRRF) effluent becomes vital to augment diminishing fresh drinking water resources, concern exists that conventional barriers may prove deficient, and the upcycling of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) could prove harmful to human health and aquatic species if more effective and robust treatment barriers are not in place. A multiple month survey, of both primary and secondary effluents, from three (3) WRRFs, for 95 CECs was conducted in 2014 to classify CECs by their persistence through conventional water reclamation processes. By sampling the participating WRRF process trains at their peak performance (as determined by measured bulk organics and particulates removal), a short-list of recalcitrant CECs that warrant monitoring to assess treatment performance at advanced water reclamation and production facilities. The list of identified CECs for potable water reclamation (indirect or direct potable reuse) include a herbicide and its degradants, prescription pharmaceuticals and antibiotics, a female hormone, an artificial sweetener, and chlorinated flame retardants.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely used for the treatment of various physical and psychological ailments. Due to incomplete removal during sewage treatment many pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in aquatic waterways at trace concentrations. The diversity of pharmaceutical contaminants and potential for complex mixtures to occur makes it very difficult to predict the toxicity of these compounds on wildlife, and robust methods are therefore needed to explore sub-lethal effects. Metabolic syndrome is one of the most widespread health concerns currently facing the human population, and various drugs, including anti-diabetic medications and lipid- and cholesterol-lowering fibrates and statins, are widely prescribed as treatment. In this study, we exposed striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) tadpoles to a mixture of the drugs metformin, atorvastatin and bezafibrate at 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 mu g/L to explore possible effects on growth and development, energy reserves (triglycerides and cholesterol), and profiles of small polar metabolites extracted from hepatic tissues. It was hypothesised that exposure would result in a general reduction in energy reserves, and that this would subsequently correspond with reduced growth and development. Responses differed from expected outcomes based on the known mechanisms of these compounds in humans, with no changes to hepatic triglycerides or cholesterol and a general increase in mass and condition with increasing exposure concentration. Deviation from the expected response patterns may be explained by differences in the receptivity or uptake of the compounds in non-mammalian species. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy revealed evidence of broad metabolic dysregulation in exposed animals, and possible interaction between the solvent and mixture. Specifically, increased lactic acid and branched-chain amino acids were observed, with responses tending to follow a non-monotonic pattern. Overall, results demonstrate that a mixture of drugs commonly prescribed to treat human metabolic syndrome is capable of eliciting physiological and developmental effects on larval amphibians. Importantly, outcomes further suggest that it may not be possible to predict toxicological effects in non-target wildlife based on our knowledge of how these compounds act in humans.

AB Roxarsone has been extensively used as an organoarsenic feed additive. Part of supplemented roxarsone was discharged into wastewater. UASB reactor has been widely applied to treat high concentration of organics wastewater. However, there was little report about the arsenic accumulation from organoarsenic biotransformation in an UASB reactor. In this study, the accumulation and volatilization of arsenic in a 260-day cultured UASB reactor spiked with 13.2 mg/L roxarsone were investigated. In the anaerobic granular sludge (AGS), the total arsenic concentrations were 5276.90 +/- 366.12 mg/kg AGS at the bottom of anaerobic sludge bed and 10,661.92 +/- 539.63 mg/kg AGS at the top of anaerobic sludge bed. Nearly 50% arsenic in the AGS was extracted under acidic conditions, and the main species of the extracted arsenic was arsenite (As(III)). In the aqueous phases, roxarsone was rapidly transformed into 4-hydroxy-3-aminophenylarsonic acid (HAPA) and an unknown organoarsenic, which was further converted to inorganic arsenic and monomethylarsenate (MMA(V)), in which As(III) was also the main species. Volatile arsenic from the reactor spiked with roxarsone was released at a rate of 134.93 +/- 6.61 ng/d. Based on the mass balance analysis of arsenic, 23.40% of the influent arsenic was accumulated in the AGS and 0.002% was released in the form of volatile arsenic. The results from this study indicated that the operation of anaerobic digestion reactor treating organoarsenic-contaminated wastewater and the disposal of the residual AGS should be well managed.

AB The growing concern worldwide regarding the presence of emerging contaminants in biosolids calls for a better understanding of how different treatment technologies at water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) can influence concentrations prior to biosolids land application. This study focuses on the influence of solids treatment via the Cambi Thermal Hydrolysis Process " in conjunction with anaerobic digestion (TH-AD) on concentrations of triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), and their transformation products in biosolids and sludges. Concentrations of the target analytes in biosolids from the TH-AD process (Class A), sludges from the individual TH-AD treatment steps, and limed biosolids (Class B) from the same WRRF were compared. TCC concentrations were significantly lower in Class A biosolids than those in the Class B product - a removal that occurred during thermal hydrolysis. Concentrations of TCS, methyl triclosan, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, conversely, increased during anaerobic digestion, leading to significantly higher concentrations of these compounds in Class A biosolids when compared to Class B biosolids. Implementation of the TH-AD process had mixed effect on contaminant concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands are often used as decentralized wastewater treatment and as treatment systems for small communities. The effluent is usually discharged in small water courses in which the aquatic ecosystem can be put at risk by pharmaceutical residues present in the effluent. This study describes the performance of a pilot-scale aerated subsurface-flow constructed wetland treating municipal and hospital wastewater. Especially the effect of active aeration on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals is assessed. The removal of metformin and valsartan is significantly increased when continuous aeration is applied (99 +/- 1% vs. 68 +/- 32% for metformin and 99 +/- 1% vs. 17 +/- 19% for valsartan), although the micro-organisms can adapt to degrading metformin also in anoxic conditions. At the hospital site high concentrations of pharmaceuticals are measured in the influent. Atenolol and bisopfolol are efficiently removed (> 75% and > 50%, respectively), although the effluent concentrations of these compounds remain high (up to 0.5 mu g/L). Only limited removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gabapentin and sulfamethoxazole is achieved. Intermittent aeration (50%) provides equally efficient removal of the selected pharmaceuticals as continuous aeration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Little information exists on the occurrence and the ultimate fate of pharmaceuticals in the water bodies in India despite being one of the world leaders in pharmaceutical production and consumption. This paper has reviewed 19 published reports of pharmaceutical occurrence in the aquatic environment in India [conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), hospital WTPs, rivers, and groundwater]. Carbamazepine (antipsychoactive), atenolol (antihypertensive), triclocarban and triclosan (antimicrobials), trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (antibacterials), ibuprofen and acetaminophen (analgesics), and caffeine (stimulant) are the most commonly detected at higher concentrations in Indian WTPs that treat predominantly the domestic sewage. The concentration of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin in Indian WTPs were up to 40 times higher than that in other countries in Europe, Australia, Asia, and North America. A very few studies in Indian rivers reported the presence of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ketoprofen, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and enrofloxacin. Similar compounds were reported in rivers in China, indicating a similar usage pattern in both of these developing countries. In a study reported from an open well in southern India, the groundwater showed the presence of cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, citalopram and terbinafine, which was close to a WIT receiving effluents from pharmaceutical production.

AB The presence of emergent antibiotics, in livestock wastewater may affect constructed wetlands (CWs) performance in the removal of other pollutants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of two antibiotics commonly used in livestock industry, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, on metal removal by CWs.
   Microcosms (0.4 m x 0.3 m x 0.3 m), simulating CWs, were constructed with Phragmites australis to treat livestock wastewater spiked or not with 100 mu g/L of enrofioxacin or ceftiofur (individually or in mixture). Wastewater was treated during 20 one-week cycles. After one-week cycle wastewater was removed and replaced by new wastewater (with or without spiking). At weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20, treated wastewater was analysed to determine the removal rates of metals (Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) and of each antibiotic. At weeks 1, 8 and 20 portions of the plant root substrate were collected and metals determined. At the end of the experiment metal levels were also determined in plant tissues.
   Removal rate of Fe from wastewater was 99%. Removal rates of Cu and Zn were higher than 85% and 89%, respectively, whereas for Mn removal rates up to 75% were obtained. In general, no significant differences were observed through time in the removals of the different metals, indicating that the systems maintained their functionality during the experimental period. Antibiotics did not interfere with the system depuration capacity, in terms of metals removals from wastewater, and ceftiofur even promoted metal uptake by P. australis.
   Therefore, CWs seem to be a valuable alternative to remove pollutants, including antibiotics and metals, from livestock wastewaters, reducing the risk the release of these wastewaters might pose into the environment, although more research should be conducted with other antibiotics in CWs.

AB Pharmaceuticals are increasingly detected in environmental matrices, but information on their trophic transfer in aquatic food webs is insufficient. This study investigated the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of 23 pharmaceuticals in Taihu Lake, China. Pharmaceutical concentrations were analyzed in surface water, sediments and 14 aquatic species, including plankton, invertebrates and fish collected from the lake. The median concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals ranged from not detected (ND) to 49 ng/L in water, ND to 49 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments, and from ND to 130 ng/g dw in biota. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in zoobenthos relative to plankton, shrimp and fish muscle. In fish tissues, the observed pharmaceutical contents in the liver and brain were generally higher than those in the gills and muscle. Both bioaccumulation factors (median BAFs: 19 -2008 L/kg) and biota sediment accumulation factors (median BSAFs: 0.0010-0.037) indicated a low bioaccumulation potential for the target pharmaceuticals. For eight of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in food webs, the trophic magnification factors (TMF5) were analyzed from two different regions of Taihu Lake. The TMFs for roxithromycin, propranolol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ofloxacin, norfioxacin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in the two food webs ranged from 0.28 to 1.25, suggesting that none of these pharmaceuticals experienced trophic magnification. In addition, the pharmaceutical TMFs did not differ significantly between the two regions in Taihu Lake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluates the treatment of the antibiotic cloxacillin (CLX) in water by means of electrochemical oxidation, TiO2 photocatalysis, and the photo-Fenton system. The three treatments completely removed cloxacillin and eliminated the residual antimicrobial activity from synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic, commercial excipients, and inorganic ions. However, significant differences in the degradation routes were found. In the photo-Fenton process, the hydroxyl radical was involved in the antibiotic removal, while in the TiO2 photocatalysis process, the action of both the holes and the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals degraded the pollutant. In the electrochemical treatment (using a Ti/IrO2 anode in sodium chloride as supporting electrolyte), oxidation via HClO played the main role in the removal of CLX. The analysis of initial by-products showed five different mechanistic pathways: oxidation of the thioether group, opening of the central beta-lactam ring, breakdown of the secondary amide, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, and decarboxylation. All the oxidation processes exhibited the three first pathways. Moreover, the aromatic ring hydroxylation was found in both photochemical treatments, while the decarboxylation of the pollutant was only observed in the TiO2 photocatalysis process. As a consequence of the degradation routes and mechanistic pathways, the elimination of organic carbon was different. After 480 and 240 min, the TiO2 photocatalysis and photo-Fenton processes achieved similar to 45 and similar to 15 % of mineralization, respectively. During the electrochemical treatment, 100 % of the organic carbon remained even after the antibiotic was treated four times the time needed to degrade it. In contrast, in all processes, a natural matrix (mineral water) did not considerably inhibit pollutant elimination. However, the presence of glucose in the water significantly affected the degradation of CLX by means of TiO2 photocatalysis.

AB The biodegradation of fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, and metoprolol using ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing consortium, nitrite-oxidizing consortium, and heterotrophic biomass was evaluated in batch tests applying different retention times. The ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing consortium presented the highest biodegradation percentages for mefenamic acid and metoprolol, of 85 and 64% respectively. This consortium was also capable to biodegrade 79% of fluoxetine. The heterotrophic consortium showed the highest ability to biodegrade fluoxetine reaching 85%, and it also had a high potential for biodegrading mefenamic acid and metoprolol, of 66 and 58% respectively. The nitrite-oxidizing consortium presented the lowest biodegradation of the three pharmaceuticals, of less than 48%. The determination of the selected pharmaceuticals in the dissolved phase and in the biomass indicated that biodegradation was the major removal mechanism of the three compounds. Based on the obtained results, the biodegradation kinetics was adjusted to pseudo-first-order for the three pharmaceuticals. The values of kbiol for fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, and metoprolol determined with the three consortiums indicated that ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing and heterotrophic biomass allow a partial biodegradation of the compounds, while no substantial biodegradation can be expected using nitrite-oxidizing consortium. Metoprolol was the less biodegradable compound. The sorption of fluoxetine and mefenamic acid onto biomass had a significant contribution for their removal (6-14%). The lowest sorption coefficients were obtained for metoprolol indicating that the sorption onto biomass is poor (3-4%), and the contribution of this process to the global removal can be neglected.

AB The present work aimed to evaluate the capacity of constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove three emerging organic contaminants with different physicochemical properties: caffeine (CAF), oxybenzone (MBPh), and triclosan (TCS). The simulated CWs were set up with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and planted with Spartina maritima, a salt marsh plant. Controlled experiments were carried out in microcosms using deionized water and wastewater collected at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), with different contaminant mass ranges, for 3, 7, and 14 days. The effects of variables were tested isolatedly and together (LECA and/or S. maritima). The presence of LECA and/or S. maritima has shown higher removal (around 61-97%) of lipophilic compounds (MBPh and TCS) than the hydrophilic compound (CAF; around 19-85%). This was attributed to the fact that hydrophilic compounds are dissolved in the water column, whereas the lipophilic ones suffer sorption processes promoting their removal by plant roots and/or LECA. In the control (only wastewater), a decrease in the three contaminant levels was observed. Adsorption and bio/rhizoremediation are the strongest hypothesis to explain the decrease in contaminants in the tested conditions.

AB In the rainy season, rice growing areas in Vietnam often become flooded by up to 1.5 m water. The floodwater brings contaminants from cultivated areas, farms and villages to the rice fields resulting in widespread contamination. In 2012 and 2013, the inorganic and organic contaminants in floodwater was investigated in Thanh Hoa and Hue. Water samples were taken at 16 locations in canals, paddy fields and rivers before and during the flood. In total, 940 organic micro-pollutants in the water samples were determined simultaneously by GC-MS method with automatic identification and quantification system (AIQS), while ICP-MS was used for determination of ten trace elements in the samples. The concentrations of 277 organic micro-pollutants and ten elements (As, Cu, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn, Al) ranged from 0.01 to 7.6 mu g L-1 and 0.1 to 3170 mu g L-1, respectively, in the floodwater. Contaminants originated from industrial sources (e. g. PAH) were detected at low concentrations, ranged from 0.01 to 0.18 mu g L-1, while concentrations of pollutants originated from domestic sources (e. g. sterols, pharmaceuticals and personal care products and pesticides) were ranged from 0.01 to 2.12 mu g L-1. Isoprocarb had the highest detection frequency of 90%, followed by isoprothiolane (88%) and fenobucarb (71%). The results indicated that contaminants in floodwater come from untreated wastewater from villages, and the agricultural activities are the major sources of increased pesticides resuspended in the floodwater in this study.

AB Antibiotics are routinely used in intensive animal agriculture operations collectively known as Concentrated Animal Feed Operations (CAFO) which include dairy, poultry and swine farms. Wastewater generated by CAFOs often contains low levels of antibiotics and is typically managed in an anaerobic lagoon. The objective of this research is to investigate the uptake and fate of aqueous sulfamethazine (SMN) antibiotic by alfalfa (Medicago sativa) grass grown under hydroponic conditions. Uptake studies were conducted using hydroponically grown alfalfa in a commercially available nutrient solution supplemented with 10 mg/L of SMN antibiotic. Analysis of alfalfa sap, root zone, middle one-third, and top portion of the foliage showed varying uptake rate and translocation of SMN. The highest average amount of SMN (8.58 mu g/kg) was detected in the root zone, followed by the top portion (1.89 mu g/kg), middle one-third (1.30 mu g/kg), and sap (0.38 mu g/kg) samples, indicating a clear distribution of SMN within the sampled regions. The ultraviolet (UV) spectra of parent SMN and translocated SMN identified in different parts of the plant present the possibility of metabolization during the uptake process. Uptake of SMN using alfalfa grown under hydroponic conditions has potential as a promising remediation technology for removal of similar antibiotics from wastewater lagoons.

AB This study examined the presence and sources of 10 pharmaceuticals in Klang River were studied. The most common pharmaceuticals were caffeine and acetaminophen, 0.57-20.62 ng/mL and "not detected"-1.45 ng/mL. Water samples were clustered based on pharmaceutical concentrations. Source apportionment analysis showed that treated wastewater discharged from treatment plants contributed 18.43% of pharmaceuticals in Klang River. An environmental risk assessment by means of the risk quotient (RQ) was done whereby the latter was more than one for salicylic acid and diclofenac in surface water posing threats to the aquatic environment. Salicylic acid showed high risk for acute toxicity, while diclofenac showed high risk for chronic toxicity. The results indicated a need for regular monitoring on pharmaceutical levels in Klang River and increasing the efficiency of wastewater treatment here.

AB Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from drinking water is usually enhanced by advanced oxidation which is not affordable in low income countries. Slow sand filtration has been found to be capable of removing anti-inflammatory compounds, and its low maintenance costs and easy operation make it an attractive technology for treating drinking water in many parts of the world. In addition, slow sand filters can be used at both large and household scales. The biofilm (i.e. schmutzdecke) developed on the top of the sand and within the upper layers of the sand is acknowledged to be responsible for the water purification. However, it is possible that the PPCPs may affect the schmutzdecke development and microbial community within the filters, and consequently the performance of the filter. This study investigated two household slow sand filters (for water purification) operated intermittently with and without contamination by six PPCPs. Eleven parameters were monitored in the affluent and effluent water, including bacterial species present and schmutzdecke biomass development. Results demonstrated that the household slow sand filter performance was not affected by the 2 mu g L-1 of PPCPs in the water. There was no significant difference between filters for total coliforms and E. coli removal, but there was considerable difference between sampling times. Biomass considerably increased with the number of filtrations in both filters and there was no significant difference between filter biomass. However, it was found that more bacterial species were present in the period with no contamination than during the contamination period. Bacillus anthracis and Exiguobacterium sp. showed to be resistant to the effects of the PPCPs. These suggest there are effects of PPCPs on bacterial species within the filter. However, the effect of the PPCPs on biomass was not conclusive in this study and needs to be further investigated.

AB The application of innovative technologies in water management, such as wastewater reuse, requires a deeper understanding of emerging pollutants, including pharmaceuticals. This study presents a unique pilot site at Horni Bekovice in Central Bohemia, where wastewater parameters are significantly influenced by the effluent from a local psychiatric hospital, and where the treated wastewater infiltrates into a shallow aquifer over a long period. The survey compared the quality parameters of local wastewater with those of the wastewater in four other catchments with no sources of concentrated pharmaceutical contamination. A total of 10 pharmaceuticals were detected while monitoring a common sewage system, but their number increased 3-fold at Horni Bekovice. The water quality data revealed the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater at the local sewage treatment plant and tracked the fate of substances that move from the treatment plant into the recharge ponds and then gradually into groundwater. The findings showed a significant decrease in all the monitored micropollutants that remained bound in sediments and in the unsaturated zone. Their passage into groundwater was highly reduced, and they virtually disappear after a few hundred meters in the saturated zone. The only exception is carbamazepine. This substance passes through the treatment technology and unsaturated zone. It systematically appears in the groundwater samples collected about 1 km from the infiltration site.

AB The photoreactivity of treated wastewater effluent organic matter differs from that of natural organic matter, and the indirect phototransformation rates of micropollutants originating in wastewater are expected to depend on the fractional contribution of wastewater to total stream flow. Photodegradation rates of four common compounds of wastewater origin (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine, cimetidine and caffeine) were measured in river water, treated municipal wastewater effluent and mixtures of both to simulate various effluent-stream water mixing conditions that could occur in environmental systems. Compounds were chosen for their unique photodegradation pathways with the photochemically produced reactive intermediates, triplet-state excited organic matter ((OM)-O-3*), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot). For all compounds, higher rates of photodegradation were observed in effluent relative to upstream river water. Sulfamethoxazole degraded primarily via direct photolysis, with some contribution from OH center dot and possibly from carbonate radicals and other unidentified reactive intermediates in effluent-containing samples. Sulfadimethoxine also degraded mainly by direct photolysis, and natural organic matter appeared to inhibit this process to a greater extent than predicted by light screening. In the presence of effluent organic matter, sulfadimethoxine showed additional reactions with OH center dot and O-1(2). In all water samples, cimetidine degraded by reaction with O-1(2) (>95%) and caffeine by reaction with OH" (>95%). In river water mixtures, photodegradation rate constants for all compounds increased with increasing fractions of effluent. A conservative mixing model was able to predict reaction rate constants in the case of hydroxyl radical reactions, but it overestimated rate constants in the case of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) pathways. Finally, compound degradation rate constants normalized to the rate of light absorption by water correlated with E-2/E-3 ratios (sample absorbance at 254 nm divided by sample absorbance at 365 nm), suggesting that organic matter optical properties may hold promise to predict indirect compound photodegradation rates for various effluent mixing ratios.

AB The presence of high concentration antibiotics in wastewater can disturb the stability of biological wastewater treatment systems and promote generation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the treatment. To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 degrees C for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 +/- 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial potency (from 874 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 mg L-1 and from 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, an average COD removal rate of 83.2%, 78.5% and 68.9% was achieved at an organic loading rate of 33, 4.8 and 5.9 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), respectively. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tetracycline (tet) genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron (intI1)) in anaerobic sludge on day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those in inoculated sludge on day 0 (P < 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3720 +/- 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 +/- 4% at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1.2 +/- 0.2 kg m(-3) d(-1), and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P < 0.01). The above result demonstrated that enhanced hydrolysis as a pretreatment method could enable efficient anaerobic treatment of oxytetracycline production wastewater containing high concentrations of oxytetracycline with significantly lower generation of ARGs.

AB Micropollutants enter surface waters through various pathways, of which wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a major source. The large diversity of micropollutants and their many modes of toxic action pose a challenge for assessing environmental risks. In this study, we investigated the potential impact of WWTPs on receiving ecosystems by describing concentration patterns of micropollutants, predicting acute risks for aquatic organisms and validating these results with macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data. Grab samples were taken upstream, downstream and at the effluent of 24 Swiss WWTPs during low flow conditions across independent catchments with different land uses. Using liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, a comprehensive target screening of almost 400 organic substances, focusing mainly on pesticides and pharmaceuticals, was conducted at two time points, and complemented with the analysis of a priority mixture of 57 substances over eight time points. Acute toxic pressure was predicted using the risk assessment approach of the multi-substance potentially affected fraction, first applying concentration addition for substances with the same toxic mode of action and subsequently response addition for the calculation of the risk of the total mixture. This toxic pressure was compared to macroinvertebrate sensitivity to pesticides (SPEAR index) upstream and downstream of the WWTPs. The concentrations were, as expected, especially for pharmaceuticals and other household chemicals higher downstream than upstream, with the detection frequency of plant protection products upstream correlating with the fraction of arable land in the catchments. While the concentration sums downstream were clearly dominated by pharmaceuticals or other household chemicals, the acute toxic pressure was mainly driven by pesticides, often caused by the episodic occurrence of these compounds even during low flow conditions. In general, five single substances explained much of the total risk, with diclofenac, diazinon and clothianidin as the main drivers. Despite the low predicted acute risk of 0%-2.1% for affected species, a significant positive correlation with macroinvertebrate sensitivity to pesticides was observed. However, more effect data for pharmaceuticals and a better quantification of episodic pesticide pollution events are needed for a more comprehensive risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the kinetics of the different mechanisms (radical pathway, photolysis, molecular reaction with H2O2 and reaction with ultrasonically generated oxidative species) involved in the homogeneous sono-photoFenton (US/UV/H2O2/Fe) mineralization of antipyrine present in a synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (ASMWE). The dynamic behavior of hydroxyl (HO center dot) radical generation and consumption in mineralization reaction under different systems was investigated by measuring hydroxyl radical concentration during the reaction. The overall mineralization process was optimized using a Central-Composite Experimental Design (CCED) with four variables (initial concentrations of H2O2 and Fe(II), amplitude and pulse length). The response functions (pseudo-first order mineralization kinetic rate constants) were fitted using neural networks (NNs). Under the optimal conditions ([H2O2]0 = 500 mg L-1, [Fe(II)](0), = 27 mg L-1, Amplitude (%) = 20 and Pulse length = 1), the TOC removal was 79% in 50 min. The radical reaction in the bulk solution was found be the primary mineralization pathway (94.8%), followed by photolysis (3.65%), direct reaction with H2O2 (0.86%), and reaction by ultrasonically generated oxidative species (0.64%). The role of the Fe catalyst on the radical reaction and the presence of refractory intermediates towards hydroxyl radical were also studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a Partial Least Squares Projection of Latent Structures (PLS) model has been developed for predicting the rejection of pharmaceutical residuals by nanofiltration (NF) using treated municipal wastewater as feed. The objective was to provide a practical tool for wastewater reuse facilities for estimating the rejection of emerging organic contaminants based on their physiochemical characteristics. The model was developed by identifying the important physiochemical properties of pharmaceutical residuals for rejection by NF. The investigated pharmaceuticals were those present in the effluent from Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), Sweden. The rejection, at volume reduction factors (VRF) ranging from 2 to 20, was examined in a NF pilot plant at two occasions.
   The important variables for rejection by NF were, in descending order: polarizability, globularity, ratio hydrophobic to polar water accessible surface area and compound charge.
   Two studies were performed with a time interval of about a year with different wastewater matrices and age of membranes. For different VRF5, but in the same study, the model produced consistent predicted rejections. For the same VRF, but in the different studies, the regression lines were almost parallel, but with a deviation of about 7% for the predicted values. Most of the compounds were within the 95% prediction interval. The model also proved to be able to predict rejection using data from the literature. This confirms that the predictive PLS model can estimate the rejection albeit, with limitations. Generally the proposed predictive rejection model is most likely valid but the model coefficients need to be determined for each individual WWTP or wastewater reuse facility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB As of 2008, approximately 48% of Americans use prescription drugs within any given 30-day period. Many pharmaceutical compounds are not fully metabolized by the human body, nor fully removed by wastewater treatment systems, before release into the environment. As a result, a vast array of pharmaceuticals has been detected in marine and freshwater organisms, sediments, and waters, with unintended effects on non -target organisms, and limited studies of environmental effects. The antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TRI), often presctibed together to treat bacterial infections, have been detected worldwide in marine and estuarine environments at concentrations up to 765-870 ng/L each. Little research has examined sub-lethal effects of antibiotic mixtures at environmentally-relevant concentrations on marine organisms. We examined the effects of mixtures of these two antibiotics on three marine microalgal species with wide geographic ranges: Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros neogracile, and Nannochloropsis oculata. In separate simulations using a temperature/light-controlled set-up, we measured the growth response for each species to environmentally-relevant levels of SMX and TRI. N. oculata growth was significantly reduced by mixture treatments of both drugs (p <0.05), by TRI (p <0.001), and by SMX (p <0.001), whereas only aggregated SMX levels significantly reduced growth for the other two species (p <0.005). The exposure time at which growth rates were affected varied across species, with significant reduction in growth focused in the latter half of the experimental Period for C. neogracile and N. oculata (Days 15 and 6 respectively), and midway through the experimental period for I. galbana (by Day 3). This study finds that important marine primary producers respond to the presence of SMX and TRI in the water, offering an understanding of environmental Consequences of anthropogenic pharmaceuticals contaminants, and specifically the suite of antibiotics, that are released into marine ecosystems at an ever-growing rate, and highlighting potential cascading effects through trophic levels.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) was evaluated as a treatment option of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (WWROC) discharged from wastewater reclamation plants (WRPs). A direct contact MD (DCMD), at obtaining 85% water recovery of WWROC showed only 13-15% flux decline and produced good quality permeate (10-15 S/cm, 99% ion rejection) at moderate feed temperature of 55 degrees C. Prevalent calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposition on the MD membrane occurred in treating WWROC at elevated concentrations. The combination of low salinity and loose CaCO3 adhesion on the membrane did not significantly contribute to DCMD flux decline. Meanwhile, high organic content in WWROC (58-60 mg/L) resulted in a significant membrane hydrophobicity reduction (70% lower water contact angle than virgin membrane) attributed to low molecular weight organic adhesion onto the MD membrane. Granular activated carbon (GAC) pretreatment helped in reducing organic contents of WWROC by 46-50%, and adsorbed a range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic micropollutants. This ensured high quality water production by MD (micropollutants-free) and enhanced its reuse potential. The MD concentrated WWROC was suitable for selective ion precipitation, promising a near zero liquid discharge in WRPs.

AB Solar driven photocatalysis is considered as an environmental friendly treatment for micropollutant removal from secondary wastewater treatment plant effluents. The photo-Fenton process is efficient in persistent organic pollutant degradation and the use of low cost reactors with variable light path length such as raceway pond reactors (RPR) has been recently proposed. The aim of the study was to develop a simplified kinetic model predicting micropollutant removal rate as a function of environmental variables (irradiance and temperature), geometrical variables (light path length) and operating variables (reactant concentration). The parameters were obtained by fitting the model to 36 experimental conditions in 1.25-L cylindrical reactors at lab scale and then validated in a 360-L RPR at pilot plant scale. In the studied range, 10-40 degrees C, temperature enhances the photo-Fenton reaction rate by: i) accelerating the oxidation of ferrous iron with hydrogen peroxide (thermal Fenton); and ii) making the light absorption coefficient of ferric iron higher, that is the VRPA. The proposed photo-Fenton model takes into account both effects and properly fit experimental data. Considering 90% removal of the pesticide acetamiprid at an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L, a treatment capacity of 135 mg/m(2) h was achieved with low reactant concentrations, 10 mg/L Fe2+ and 50 mg/L H2O2. The presented results encourage the application of this modeling strategy for process optimization, design and operation of raceway pond reactors for micropollutant removal by solar photo-Fenton.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis can be a suitable add-on process to conventional wastewater treatment methods aiming to the full degradation of emerging contaminants contributing to water pollution. This work examines the photo-degradation of two frequently detected emerging contaminants (caffeine and salicylic acid) using titanium dioxide nanotubular films (TNTs) so as commercial TiO2 nanoparticulate films (Evonik P25) for comparison. The TNT films were prepared by electrochemical anodization of titanium metal and reached lengths of 20 pm, with a high growth rate (10 mu m/h). They present an open porous structure with large specific surface area suitable for efficient adsorption of the contaminants and formation of a large number of photocatalytic active sites. After calcination at 450 degrees C, TNT films obtain the anatase crystal structure, absorb well in the UV range and present significant photocatalytic activity with high degradation rates for both examined emerging pollutants. Furthermore, they present small variability of their photocatalytic efficiency in a big range of the solutions pH values and under consecutive photocatalytic cycles, rendering them suitable at various wastewater treatment conditions.

AB Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease affecting a large portion of the world population and is treated by orally administered drugs. Since these drugs are often taken in high doses and are excreted unchanged or partially metabolised many of them are nowadays detected in surface waters or wastewater treatment plants effluents. Unmetabolised antidiabetics or some of their transformation products retain their pharmacological activity, therefore their presence in the environment is highly undesired. One of the main routes of elimination from wastewaters or surface waters is biodegradation. Within this work we tested primary biodegradation of: metformin and its metabolite guanylurea, acarbose, glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride. We also inspected what might be the extent of the degradation by examining the products formed during the degradation using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Transformation of diabetes staple drug metformin to dead-end product guanylurea was generally confirmed. An alternative, though rather minor pathway leading to complete mineralisation was also found. Complete primary degradation was observed for acarbose, glibenclamide and glimepiride whereas gliclazide was shown to be resistant to biodegradation. These results allow a preliminary assessment of environmental persistency of a very important group of pharmaceuticals and show need for implementing monitoring programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Diclofenac is one of the most widely prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs worldwide. It is frequently detected in surface waters; however, whether this pharmaceutical poses a risk to aquatic organisms is debated. Here we quantified the uptake of diclofenac by the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) following aqueous exposure (0.2-25.0 mu g L-1) for 21 days, and evaluated the tissue and biomolecular responses in the kidney. Diclofenac accumulated in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in the plasma of exposed fish. The highest plasma concentration observed (for fish exposed to 25 mu g L-1 diclofenac) was within the therapeutic range for humans. There was a strong positive correlation between exposure concentration and the number of developing nephrons observed in the posterior kidney. Diclofenac was not found to modulate the expression of genes in the kidney associated with its primary mode of action in mammals (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases) but modulated genes associated with kidney repair and regeneration. There were no significant adverse effects following 21 days exposure to concentrations typical of surface waters. The combination of diclofenac's uptake potential, effects on kidney nephrons and relatively small safety margin for some surface waters may warrant a longer term chronic health effects analysis for diclofenac in fish.

AB Intersex in fish downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) is a global concern. Consistent high rates of intersex in male rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) have been reported for several years in the Grand River, in southern Ontario, Canada, in close proximity to two MWWTPs. The larger MWWTP (Kitchener) recently underwent upgrades that included the conversion from a carbonaceous activated sludge to nitrifying activated sludge treatment process. This created a unique opportunity to assess whether upgrades designed to improve effluent quality could also remediate the intersex previously observed in wild fish. Multiple years (2007-2012) of intersex data on male rainbow darter collected before the upgrades at sites associated with the MWWTP outfall were compared with intersex data collected in postupgrade years (2013-2015). These upgrades resulted in a reduction from 70 to 100% intersex incidence (preupgrade) to <10% in postupgrade years. Although the cause of intersex remains unknown, indicators of effluent quality including nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and estrogenicity improved in the effluent after the upgrades. This study demonstrated that investment in MWWTP upgrades improved effluent quality and was associated with an immediate change in biological responses in the receiving environment. This is an important finding considering the tremendous cost of wastewater infrastructure.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is carcinogenic in rodents and occurs in chloraminated drinking water and wastewater effluents. NDMA forms via reactions between chloramines and mostly unidentified, N-containing organic matter. We developed a mass spectrometry technique to identify NDMA precursors by analyzing 25 model compounds with LC/QTOF-MS. We searched isolates of 11 drinking water sources and 1 wastewater using a custom MATLAB (R) program and extracted ion chromatograms for two fragmentation patterns that were specific to the model compounds. Once a diagnostic fragment was discovered, we conducted MS/MS during a subsequent injection to confirm the precursor ion. Using non-target searches and two diagnostic fragmentation patterns, we discovered 158 potential NDMA precursors. Of these, 16 were identified using accurate mass combined with fragment and retention time matches of analytical standards when available. Five of these sixteen NDMA precursors were previously unidentified in the literature, three of which were metabolites of pharmaceuticals. Except methadone, the newly identified precursors all had NDMA molar yields of less than 5%, indicating that NDMA formation could be additive from multiple compounds, each with low yield. We demonstrate that the method is applicable to other disinfection by-product precursors by predicting and verifying the fragmentation patterns for one nitrosodiethylamine precursor.

AB After consumption, pharmaceuticals are excreted as parent compounds and/or metabolites in urine and faeces. Some are not completely removed during wastewater treatments, forcing sewage treatment plants (STPs) to apply alternative technologies to guarantee quality of treated water. To monitor the removal efficiency of STPs, not only unchanged compounds and metabolites have to be taken into account, but also formation of possible transformation products (TPs). In this work, QTOF MS has been used for screening metabolites/TPs of pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater from Athens. A customised database was built with the exact masses of metabolites reported in literature for the parent drugs found in an initial screening. Additionally, TPs identified in previous degradation experiments performed at our laboratory were included. Up to 34 metabolites/TPs were detected for omeprazole, venlafaxine, clindamycin, clarithromycin, clopidogrel or dipyrone, among others. Seven corresponded to TPs whose reference standards were available at our lab, seven were TPs previously identified in laboratory degradation experiments, eight were TPs tentatively identified by QTOF MS without reference standards, and twelve TPs were discovered after using the common fragmentation pathway approach. Tentative identification of TPs was supported by prediction of their chromatographic retention time based on the use of advanced chemometric QSRR models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) as an important group of "emerging contaminants" (ECs), have been highlighted and received global attentions in last decade. China has tremendous consumption of PhACs and the most pharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide. In this study, 33 PhACs (19 antibiotics included) were monitored in the Beiyun River basin in Beijing, China. The seasonal occurrence, temporal spatial distribution and potential source were investigated. The total levels were about 2 mu g L-1. Nonantibiotics were more frequently detected. The highest median concentrations were observed for caffeine (558 ng L-1) and erythromycin (319 ng L-1). Acetaminophen, erythromycin, diclofenac and N,N-diethylmeta-toluamide showed highly significant seasonal variation, while caffeine, carbamazepine, metoprolol and most sulfonamides were more stable. The burden was most heavy in Qing River in both seasons (up to 4 mu gL(-1)). Antibiotics from veterinary use accounted for minor contribution in this region. The characteristics and trends were overviewed by comparing with our previous survey. The total level of 15 PhACs dropped significantly by 37% on average from 2013 to 2015. The proportion of caffeine, once a major component in 2013, reduced from 77% to 47%. The burden of these ECs in surface water of Beijing is remarkably reduced, suggesting the overall situation has been improving. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater can provide a wealth of epidemiologic data on common drugs consumed and on health and nutritional problems based on the biomarkers excreted into community sewage systems. One of the biggest uncertainties of these studies is the estimation of the number of inhabitants served by the treatment plants. Twelve human urine biomarkers 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), acesulfame, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, cotinine, creatinine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), naproxen, salicylic acid (SA) and hydroxycotinine (OH COT) were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to estimate population size. The results reveal that populations calculated from cotinine, 5-HIAA and caffeine are commonly in agreement with those calculated by the hydrochemical parameters.

AB Membrane filtration using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient effluent polishing step at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the removal of selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (>60%) removed BP3, UV-329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (<20%) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30-50% of COD, 80-95% of TP, up to 30% of TN and NH4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment.

AB In the aquatic environment, pharmaceutical drugs are submitted to degradation processes, where photodegradation is one of the most important mechanisms affecting the fate, persistence and toxicity of the compounds. Carbamazepine, a widely used antiepileptic, is known to suffer photodegradation in water bodies and generate photoproducts, some of them with higher potential toxicity than the parent compound. Therefore, to evaluate the toxic effects of CBZ when combined with its photoproducts, an acute exposure (96 h) with the edible clam Scrobicularia plana was performed using environmental concentrations of CBZ (0.00-9.00 mu g/L) irradiated (and non-irradiated) with simulated solar radiation. The analysis of the irradiated CBZ solutions by mass spectrometry revealed the formation of 5 photoproducts, including acridine (a compound known to be carcinogenic). Oxidative stress results showed that the exposure to CBZ photoproducts did not increase the toxicity to clams, by comparison with the parent compound. Lipid peroxidation levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were the most responsive parameters to these stressors and lipid peroxidation results appeared to show the presence of an antagonistic effect resulting from the mixture of CBZ and its photoproducts.

AB Laboratory tests were conducted with four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and ketoprofen) under different redox conditions (aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic and sulfate reducing conditions) in order to assess abiotic and biotic degradation in a river water/sediment system. The river water was sampled from Sperchios River and the sediment was collected from the banks of a rural stream where the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant is located. To quantitatively describe degradation kinetics of the selected compounds, pseudo first-order kinetics were adopted. According to the results, it can be stated that the concentration of the substances remained constant or decreased only marginally (p >= 0.05) in the sterile experiments and this excludes abiotic processes such as hydrolysis or sorption as major removal mechanisms of the target compounds from the water phase and assign their removal to microbial action. Results showed that the removal rate of the compounds decreases as dissolved oxygen concentration in the river water/sediment system decreases. All compounds were found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions at dissipation half-lives between 1.6 and 20.1 days, while dissipation half-lives for naproxen and ketoprofen increase by a factor of 2 under all tested conditions in the absence of oxygen.

AB This review focuses on the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) by biological, chemical and hybrid technologies in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Results showed that endocrine disruption chemicals (EDCs) were better removed by membrane bioreactor (MBR), activated sludge and aeration processes among different biological processes. Surfactants, EDCs and personal care products (PCPs) can be well removed by activated sludge process. Pesticides and pharmaceuticals showed good removal efficiencies by biological activated carbon. Microalgae treatment processes can remove almost all types of ECs to some extent. Other biological processes were found less effective in ECs removal from wastewater. Chemical oxidation processes such as ozonation/H2O2, UV photolysis/H2O2 and photo Fenton processes can successfully remove up to 100% of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals, while EDCs can be better removed by ozonation and UV photocatalysis. Fenton process was found less effective in the removal of any types of ECs. A hybrid system based on ozonation followed by biological activated carbon was found highly efficient in the removal of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals. A hybrid ozonation-ultrasound system can remove up to 100% of many pharmaceuticals. Future research directions to enhance the removal of ECs have been elaborated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A laboratory scale Hybrid Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (HMBBR) was used to study the removal of five benzotriazoles and one benzothiazole from municipal wastewater. The HMBBR system consisted of two serially connected fully aerated bioreactors that contained activated sludge (AS) and K3-biocarriers and a settling tank. The average removal of target compounds ranged between 41% (4-methyl-1Hbenzotriazole; 4TTR) and 88% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole; OHBTH). Except for 4TTR, degradation mainly occurred in the first bioreactor. Calculation of biodegradation constants in batch experiments and application of a model for describing micropollutants removal in the examined system showed that AS is mainly involved in biodegradation of OHBTH, 1H-benzotriazole (BTR) and xylytriazole (XTR), carriers contribute significantly on 4TTR biodegradation, while both types of biomass participate on elimination of 5-chlorobenzotriazole (CBTR) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5TTR). Comparison of the HMBBR system with MBBR or AS systems from literature showed that the HMBBR system was more efficient for the biodegradation of the investigated chemicals. Biotransformation products of target compounds were identified using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with a quadrupole-time of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC-QToF-MS). Twenty two biotransformation products were tentatively identified, while retention time denoted the formation of more polar transformation products than the parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the applicability of different techniques for fluorescence excitation/emission matrices data interpretations, including peak-picking method, fluorescence regional integration and PARAFAC modelling, to act as surrogates in predicting emerging trace organic compounds (ETOrCs) removal during conventional wastewater treatments that usually comprise primary and secondary treatments. Results showed that fluorescence indexes developed using alternative methodologies but indicative of a same dissolved organic matter component resulted in similar predictions of the removal of the target compounds. The peak index defined by the excitation/emission wavelength positions (lambda(ex)/lambda(em)) 225/290 nm and related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine-like fluorescence was determined to be a particularly suitable surrogate for monitoring ETOrCs that had very high removal rates (average removal >70%) (i.e., triclosan, caffeine and ibuprofen). The peak index defined by lambda(ex)/lambda(em) =245/440 nm and the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 245, 350/450, both identified as humic-like fluorescence, were found remarkably well correlated with ETOrCs such as atenolol, naproxen and gemfibrozil that were moderately removed (51-70% average removal). Finally, the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima lambda(ex)/lambda(ex) =<240, 315/380 identified as microbial humic-like fluorescence was the only index correlated with the removal of the antibiotic trimethoprim (average removal 68%).

AB The fate of four benzotriazoles [1-H-benzotriazole (1-H-BTRi), tolyltriazole (TTRi), xylyltriazole (XTRi) and 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole (1-OH-BTRi)] and three benzothiazoles [benzothiazole (BTH), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (2-OH-BTH) and 2-amino-benzothiazole (2-amino-BTH)], during chlorination batch experiments was investigated. In the first step, their degradation under different experimental conditions (applied molar ratio of NaOCl and the target contaminant (m.r.), reaction's contact time, pH value of the reaction's solution and the influence of total suspended solids (TSS) presence) was investigated and their removal kinetics parameters (k(obs) and t(1/2)) were determined. In the second step, LC-QTOFMS/MS was used for the detection and identification of transformation products (TPs) formed during chlorination, through the application of suspect and non-target screening approaches. Four and five TPs of XTRi and 2-amino-BTH, respectively, were detected and tentatively identified, while 1-H-BTRi was proven to be formed by the chlorination of 1-OH-BTRi. Moreover, since the identified TPs were also detected in spiked wastewater samples, after lab-scale chlorination experiments, toxicity assessment was carried out by ECOSAR calculations for the environmental relevance of their occurrence. The proposed chlorinated TPs were proven to be more toxic than their parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of erythromycin (ERY) and ethylparaben (EtP) in urban wastewater effluents at low concentration level during ozonation was investigated under different experimental conditions. Both substrates were rapidly eliminated within 2 min at low ozone dose of 0.3 mg L-1 and the experimental data were well fitted in the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The ratio of HO center dot- and O-3-exposure (R-ct) at the inherent pH was found to be 1.9 x 10(-8). The degradation of ERY and EtP was pronounced at pH 8 compared to acidic pH conditions, while the degradation rate of both substrates was found to be matrix depended. It was also shown that both O-3(-) and HO center dot-mediated pathways are involved in the degradation of EtP, whereas the saturated-rich structure of ERY renders it O-3-recalcitrant. Under the optimum O-3 dose, the BrO3- concentration was found to be lower than 10 mu g L-1. Five and fifteen transformation products were elucidated during ERY and EtP oxidation, respectively. The root and shoot inhibition can be attributed to the oxidation products formed upon dissolved effluent organic matter transformation. Escherichia coil harbouring resistance to ERY survived ozonation better than EtP-resistant E. coil. However, neither ERY- nor EtP-resistant E. coli were detected after 15 min of ozonation.

AB Iodinated pharmaceuticals, thyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and diatrizoate (an iodinated X-ray contrast medium), are among the most prescribed active pharmaceutical ingredients. Both of them have been reported to potentially disrupt thyroid homeostasis even at very low concentrations. In this study, UV 254 nm-based photolysis and photochemical processes, i.e., UV only, UV/H2O2, and UV/S2O82-, were evaluated for the destruction of these two pharmaceuticals. Approximately 40% of 0.5 mu M thyroxine or diatrizoate was degraded through direct photolysis at UV fluence of 160 mJ cm(-2), probably resulting from the photosensitive cleavage of C-I bonds. While the addition of H2O2 only accelerated the degradation efficiency to a low degree, the destruction rates of both chemicals were significantly enhanced in the UV/S2O82- system, suggesting the potential vulnerability of the iodinated chemicals toward UV/S2O82- treatment. Such efficient destruction also occurred in the presence of radical scavengers when biologically treated wastewater samples were used as reaction matrices. The effects of initial oxidant concentrations,solution pH, as well as the presence of natural organic matter (humic acid or fulvic acid) and alkalinity were also investigated in this study. These results provide insights for the removal of iodinated pharmaceuticals in water and/or wastewater using UV-based photochemical processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The abatement of valproic acid sodium salt (VA) via photo-Fentonprocess was investigated to evaluate the effect of irradiation type. Three different light sources have been used: UVA (black light blue lamps, BLB reactor), UVC (UVC reactor) and simulated sunlight in a Solarbox (SB). Using the highest concentrations of Fe2+ (10 mg L-1) and H2O2 (150 mg L-1),100% of VA degradation was observed in BLB and UVC devices, and 89.7% in Solarbox. Regarding mineralization, 67.4% and 76.4% of TOC conversion were achieved in BLB and UVC, respectively. In Solarbox, mineralization was negligible. Treated solutions under UVA or UVC radiation became biodegradable (BOD5/COD >= 0.25), which was not observed in Solarbox where BOD5/COD achieved was only 0.20. Regarding to toxicity (Vibrio Fischeri method), all processes have promoted the overall toxicity reduction of VA solution. Transformation products were identified by a LC-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, and degradation pathways were proposed. Operating costs and the energy needed by mg of VA removed were estimated and compared, for the different installations, showing that UVA can remove around 3 times more VA than SB and 2 times more VA than UVC, under the same conditions.

AB Diclofenac (DC) is one of the most widely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one of the commonly found pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments and wastewater treatment plants. It possesses negative charges when solution pH is greater than its pKa value, while most of the soil components and sediment minerals bear negative charges, too, resulting in a net repulsion between the soil minerals and DC. Surfactant-modified zeolite (SMZ) has been studied extensively over the last 20 years for its effective removal of anionic contaminants tested under different experimental scales. However, its application for the removal of anionic drugs, such as DC, was less reported. This study focused on the sorption of DC by SMZ under different physic-chemical conditions, supplemented with instrumental analyses, in order to elucidate the mechanism of DC sorption by SMZ and to expand the SMZ application further. The results showed that the retention of DC was on the external surfaces of SMZ with extremely fast removal rate. Both anion exchange and partitioning of DC into the adsorbed surfactant micelles (admicelles) were responsible for the extended DC sorption. Interactions of DC with SMZ were facilitated with the benzene ring, the -C=O, and the CH2CH3 functional groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research addresses some critical challenges regarding the validation of a quantitative multi-residue method for pharmaceuticals in wastewater making use of modern SPE-LC-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. Particular attention is given to study in detail response linearity, to realistically estimate detection limits, and to express the measurement precision of the analyte concentration, obtained by external calibration.
   First, linearity of the Orbitrap response showed to be matrix dependent in a counter intuitive way: stronger deviations from linearity were observed for pure solvent standards than for complex matrices like wastewater. Second, detection limits risk to be overestimated for ubiquitously present compounds for which true blank matrix samples are hard to find, leading to false negative findings. A novel and easy applicable methodology is presented to allow a better estimation of detection limits using the response of the natural isotopes. Third, a statistical methodology to estimate the measurement precision of the analyte concentration using basic validation parameters is developed specifically for the context of multi-residue quantification.

AB Metoprolol is a beta-blocker highly prescribed for the treatment of heart diseases. It is not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants and it has been detected not only in the treated effluents, but also in natural waters. Thus, the knowledge of its fate in the environment is an important issue, and photodegradation is an important degradation pathway. While direct photodegradation of metoprolol by solar light is not relevant, there is evidence in the literature that it suffers indirect photodegradation and a few studies have been published showing the important role of dissolved humic matter as photo sensitizer. However, the identification of the photoproducts formed in the presence of humic matter is very poor, since only 2 photoproducts had been identified. This study investigated the degradation of metoprolol under simulated solar radiation and in the presence of fulvic acids (FA) extracted from a river. During the photodegradation experiments we observed the formation of new compounds which were separated and tentatively identified by HPLC-UV-ESI-MSn. At least 16 compounds were tentatively identified,including the 2 compounds previously identified in the literature and 4 new compounds which had not been detected by other authors as degradation products of metoprolol, even when submitted to artificial degradation processes.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment has a limited capacity to reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes (ARB&ARG). Tertiary treatment processes are promising solutions, although the transitory inactivation of bacteria may select ARB&ARG. This study aimed at assessing the potential of ozonation and UV254 nm radiation to inactivate cultivable fungal and bacterial populations, and the selected genes 16S rRNA (common to all bacteria), intl1 (common in Gram-negative bacteria) and the ARG vanA, bIa(TEM), sul1 and qnrS.
   The abundance of the different microbiological parameters per volume of wastewater was reduced by similar to 2 log units for cultivable fungi and 16S rRNA and intll genes, by similar to 3-4 log units, for total heterotrophs, enterobacteria and enterococci, and to values close or below the limits of quantification for ARG, for both processes, after a contact time of 30 min. Yet, most of the cultivable populations, the 16S rRNA and intll genes as well as the ARG, except qnrS after ozonation, reached pre-treatment levels after 3 days storage, suggesting a transitory rather than permanent microbial inactivation. Noticeably, normalization per 16S rRNA gene evidenced an increase of the ARG and intl1 prevalence, mainly after UV254 (nm) treatment. The results suggest that these tertiary treatments may be selecting for ARB&ARG populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this work was to study the ozonation of nanofiltration (NF) retentates of real municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents for removal of microcontaminants (MCs) and toxicity. MCs present in these effluents were monitored using LC-MS/MS. Acute and chronic toxicity was addressed with Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and Selenastrum capricornutum. Up to 40 MCs were found, most of them in concentrations over 100 ng/L. 90% degradation of the sum of MCs was the critical point of comparison. When the NF membrane system was applied to MWTP effluents, treatment of NF rejection needed 2.75-4.5 g O-3/m(3),4.5 g O-3/m(3), which is less than 50% of the ozone needed for direct treatment of MWTP effluent. Treatment time (lower than 11 min) was not influenced by MCs concentration, at least in the range tested (25-190 mu g/L). It has been demonstrated that consumption of ozone increased with organic load and inorganic content of different real effluents. MCs were eliminated by ozonation but acute toxicity (against V. fischeri and D. magna) increased. Chronic toxicity results were different and contrary in D. magna and S. capricornutum, due to the generation of new transformation products more toxic to D. magna than the parent contaminants. S. capricornutum inhibition percentage decreased in all cases after ozonation treatment. According to these results, before ozonation is implemented in MWTPs for the removal of MCs, the transformation products must first be examined and the treatment time or ozone doses should be extended to complete degradation if necessary.

AB The presence and persistency of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment attracted great attention recently. Among them, antibiotics and pain-killers accounted for a large quantity. Although many works were devoted to the investigation of their removal in wastewater treatment processes, most of the PPCPs studied were of cationic nature. The net repulsive interactions between anionic PPCPs and negatively charged sorbents make them difficult to be removed in wastewater treatment. In this study, 2:1 clay minerals illite and montmorillonite (MMT) were modified with different amounts of cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammoium bromide (CTAB). The types and sites of interactions between the surfactant-modified clays and the anionic drug diclofenac (DC) were investigated. The uptake of DC on the modified clays was controlled by the CTAB loading level and its surface configuration on the clays. The adsorption sites of DC were limited to the external surfaces of modified illite due to its non-swelling nature. On the contrary, both the external and interlayer sites were available for the adsorption of DC on modified MMT. A CTAB bilayer formation resulted in significant increase in DC adsorption due to the formation of extensive admicelles. FTIR results showed participation of the benzene ring, N-H, and CH2CH3 for the interactions between DC and modified MMT, suggesting that partitioning of DC into the admicelles of CTAB played a significant role in DC uptake. The results could extend the application of surfactant-modified clays for the removal of anionic PPCPs in the wastewater treatment processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Activated carbon is used increasingly in the post-treatment of municipal wastewater in order to reduce micropollutant loads in aquatic systems. However, there is lack of knowledge concerning the capacity and kinetics of adsorption on activated carbon. Using treated municipal wastewater spiked with organic micropollutants in this study assesses the elimination efficiency of six different activated carbon products and investigates the adsorption capacity and kinetics of these products. Elimination efficiency was assessed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole. A comparison of different isotherm equations using equivalent molar radius and Stokes radius as parameters was also investigated focusing on adsorption kinetics as well as adsorption isotherms. Kinetics of DOC elimination were comparable for all activated carbons tested with an elimination of about 50% occurring within the first 5-10 min. Carbamazepine and diclofenac showed high elimination of more than 90% with carbon dosages of 5 mg/L or more. For benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole 90% elimination could only be achieved with carbon dosages of 20 mg/L or more, depending on the activated carbon used. Analytical data for micropollutant elimination were found to be best represented by Freundlich isotherm.

AB In this study, electrocoagulation process was performed using Al and Fe electrodes for personal care product (PCP) industry wastewater treatment. Response surface methodology approach using Central Composite Design was applied to develop a mathematical model and optimize process parameters (initial pH, current density and electrolysis time) for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). The predicted values of models obtained using RSM were in good agreement with experimental data. The optimu m conditions for the COD removal were found to be pH of 8.03, current density of 58 mA/cm(2), electrolysis time of 33 with Al electrodes, whereas the optimum conditions were pH of 5.9, current density of 75 mA/cm(2), electrolysis time of 45 min with Fe electrodes. Under optimum conditions, 97.09% COD removal was obtained using Al electrodes and 98.76% COD removal was obtained using Fe electrodes. The operating costs for the COD removal from PCP wastewater by electrocoagulation process using Al and Fe electrodes at optimized conditions were calculated to be 3.75 and 3.86 sic/m(3), respectively. Additionally, the sludge samples formed in the process was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. According to FT-IR results, pollutants in PCP wastewater were linked to Al(OH)(3) and Fe(OH)(3) compounds.

AB In this study, the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater as predicted by SimpleTreat 4.0 was evaluated. Field data obtained from literature of 43 pharmaceuticals, measured in 51 different activated sludge WWTPs were used. Based on reported influent concentrations, the effluent concentrations were calculated with SimpleTreat 4.0 and compared to measured effluent concentrations. The model predicts effluent concentrations mostly within a factor of 10, using the specific WWTP parameters as well as SimpleTreat default parameters, while it systematically underestimates concentrations in secondary sludge. This may be caused by unexpected sorption, resulting from variability in WWTP operating conditions, andlor QSAR applicability domain mismatch and background concentrations prior to measurements. Moreover, variability in detection techniques and sampling methods can cause uncertainty in measured concentration levels. To find possible structural improvements, we also evaluated SimpleTreat 4.0 using several specific datasets with different degrees of uncertainty and variability. This evaluation verified that the most influencing parameters for water effluent predictions were biodegradation and the hydraulic retention time. Results showed that model performance is highly dependent on the nature and quality, i.e. degree of uncertainty, of the data. The default values for reactor settings in SimpleTreat result in realistic predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups: group A, which were S-sludge samples including ASA, carbamazepine (CBM), and others, and group B were L-sludge samples, dominated by antibiotics (CTC, OTC, LIN). The total daily load amount of the target pharmaceuticals in S-sludge was 0.010-268.9 kg day(-1) while the L-sludge was 0.021-0.529 kg day(-1). The estimated amounts of the target pharmaceutical discharged from S-sludge and L-sludge into the Korean environment were 150.2 +/- 47.94 ton yr(-1) and 15.05 +/- 5.671 ton yr(-1) respectively, but the discharged amount of antibiotics from S-sludge (6.945 ton yr(-1)) was lower than that from L-sludge (9.234 ton yr(-1)).

AB The chemical pollution of water resources is a major challenge facing the humanity in this century. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of emerging environmental chemical pollutants distinguished by their bioactivity and high solubility. They may also cause health complications to humans and living organisms. Pharmaceuticals enter the environment, mainly via wastewater and can eventually reach the surface and ground water. Despite this, PPCPs received less attention as environmental pollutants than other chemical pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and pesticides). The purpose of this work was to investigate the presence of some of the most frequently dispensed drugs for the residents of Almadinah Almunawarah, Saudi Arabia in the municipal wastewater before and after treatment. For this purpose, wastewater samples were collected biweekly from the city's sewage treatment plant for a period of 4 months and analyzed the targeted drugs using tandem LC-MS. Out of the 19 investigated drugs, 5 pharmaceuticals have been found in concentrations greater than the limit of detection in both the influents and effluents of the sewage treatment plant. As expected, the concentrations of investigated pharmaceuticals in the wastewater were found to be low. These drugs and their average concentrations (in ng mL(-1)) in the influents were: acetaminophen (38.9), metformin (15.2), norfluoxetine (7.07), atenolol (2.04), and cephalexin (1.88). Meanwhile, the effluents contained slightly lower levels (in ng mL(-1)) than those of influents: acetaminophen (31.2), metformin (3.19), norfluoxetine (7.25), atenolol (0.545), and cephalexin (1.53). The results of this study supported by many other investigations indicate the inefficiency of current conventional wastewater treatment protocols in eliminating such a group of active and potentially hazardous pollutants from the wastewater.

AB Kitchen food waste provides serious environmental pollution including its handling and disposal problem. In this study, an initiative has been taken to chemically characterize food waste and identify possible reuse and disposal techniques. Food waste samples were collected from kitchen of girls hostel of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. Collected food waste samples were dried by various methods. It is observed that oven drying method at 105 degrees C is the optimum temperature for maximum dewatering of collected food waste. The dried samples were further used for lipid extraction. Lipid profile analysis of the food waste samples was performed by using combination of different time of contact (20, 40 and 60 min) with varying solvent to food waste volumes (1: 4, 1: 2, 1: 1 and 2: 1). Gas chromatographymass spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector analyses have been performed to identify and quantify the presence of organic compounds in lipid from food waste. Caproic acid (6: 1), lauric acid (12: 0), mystric acid (14: 0), palmitic acid (16: 0), stearic acid (17: 0) and oleic acid (18: 0) are the fatty acids that have been identified in GC-MS. Palmitic acid (60.89 mg/l), stearic acid (74.11 mg/l) and oleic acid (3.81 mg/l) dominate the lipid profile. The results obtained from lipid profile analysis suggest that the kitchen food waste can be an innovative raw material for biodiesel production. Physico-chemical characterization identify considerable amount of calcium (20.36 mg/l), iron (30.84 mg/l), magnesium (3.00 mg/l) and chromium (1.28 mg/l), suggest its reuse in pharmaceutical and agricultural industries after extracting these metals.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmaceutical pollutants in urban wastewater can be reduced during algal cultivation. A mixed population of wild freshwater green algal species was grown on urban wastewater influent in a 650 L photobioreactor under natural light and with the addition of flue gases. Removal efficiencies were very high (> 90 %), moderate (50-90 %), low (10-50 %), and very low or non-quantifiable (< 10 %) for 9, 14, 11, and 18 pharmaceuticals, respectively, over a 7-day period. High reduction was found in the following pharmaceuticals: the beta-blockers atenolol, bispropol, and metoprolol; the antibiotic clarithromycine; the antidepressant bupropion; the muscle relaxant atracurium; hypertension drugs diltiazem and terbutaline used to relive the symptoms of asthma. Regression analysis did not detect any relationship between the reduction in pharmaceutical contents and light intensity reaching the water surface of the algal culture. However, the reduction was positively correlated with light intensity inside the culture and stronger when data collected during the night were excluded. Algae cultivation can remove partially or totally pharmaceutical pollutants from urban wastewater, and this opens up new possibilities for treating urban wastewater.

AB Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) are a general indicator for the total amount of compounds containing organically bonded halogens. AOX concentrations and components were investigated along the wastewater treatment process in four large-scale pharmaceutical factories of China, and genotoxicity based on the SOS/umu test was also evaluated. The results showed that AOX concentrations in wastewater of four factories ranged from 4.6 to 619.4 mg/L, which were high but greatly different owing to differences in the raw materials and products. The wastewater treatment process removed 50.0%-89.9% of AOX, leaving 1.3-302.5 mg/L AOX in the effluents. Genotoxicity levels ranged between 2.1 and 68.0 mu g 4-NQO/L in the raw wastewater and decreased to 1.2-41.2 mu g 4-NQO/L in the effluents of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). One of the main products of factory I, ciprofloxacin, was identified as the predominant contributor to its genotoxicity. However, for the other three factories, no significant relationship was observed between genotoxicity and detected AOX compounds.

AB The individual and combined biochemical responses of erythromycin and ketoconazole have been examined in an organism representative of the aquatic environment, crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The possible interactions between erythromycin and ketoconazole were investigated on the bioaccumulation and the expression of biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), and an antioxidant defense enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in fish tissues. After 14 days of combined exposure (erythromycin + ketoconazole), the addition of ketoconazole at nominal concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 20 mu g/L significantly increased the accumulation of erythromycin in fish bile; however, elevated erythromycin accumulation levels were not observed in the other test tissues. The inductions of EROD and SOD activity to erythromycin were inhibited by the combined exposure of ketoconazole in most cases; however, the GST activity returned to normal with exposure time and concentration of combined administration. From the tested pharmaceutical mixtures, it indicated that certain specific combinations may pose some perturbations in biochemical responses in fish and also provide a better understanding of the effects of toxic mixtures.

AB The continuous release of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the aquatic environment, as a result of the inadequate removal by conventional treatment methods, has prompted research to explore viable solutions to this rising global problem. One promising alternative is the use of electrochemical processes since they represent a simple and highly efficient technology with less footprint. In this paper, the feasibility of treating ECs (i.e., pharmaceuticals) using an intermittent electrocoagulation process, a known electrochemical technology, has been investigated. Diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and amoxicillin (AMX) were chosen as being representative of highly consumed drugs that are frequently detected in our water resources and were added in synthetic municipal wastewater. The removal efficiencies of both individual and combined pharmaceuticals were determined under different experimental conditions: hydraulic retention time (HRT) (6, 19 and 38 h), initial concentration (0.01, 4 and 10 mg/L) and intermittent application (5 min ON/20 min OFF) of current density (0.5, 1.15 and 1.8 mA/cm(2)). Results have shown that these parameters have significant effects on pharmaceutical degradation. Maximum removals (DCF = 90%, CBZ = 70% and AMX = 77%) were obtained at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2), an initial concentration of 10 mg/L and HRT of 38 h.

It also resulted in high amounts of biopolymers in the presence of non-biodegradable pharmaceutical compound in MBR. As a result, biological removal decreased and membrane fouling happened. Ozonation treatment reached a chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal of 99.9% and caused better effluent quality. The MBR-ozonation process could achieve an acetaminophen and fluoxetine removal of around 98.4 and 57.83%, respectively.

AB The aim of the study was to present first preliminary characterization of Turkish hospital wastewaters, their environmental risk, and a method for toxicity assessment. The hospital wastewater samples were collected from two of the largest medical faculty hospitals and a training and research hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. The samples from the selected hospitals were taken as grab samples on March 2014. Overall, 55 substances including pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, pesticides, and corrosion inhibitors were analyzed in all hospital wastewaters. Analysis of toxicity and the antibiotic resistance bacteria were investigated in addition to the chemical analysis in the wastewater of one hospital. Hazard quotients (HQs) and toxic units (TUs) were calculated as basis of the environmental risk assessment. Fourteen pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater (HWW) were classified as "high risk" with HQ > 10. HQ(HWW) values higher than 100 were determined for five antibiotics and one analgesic, namely, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, and diclofenac. Ofloxacin with an HQ(HWW) of 9090 was observed to be the most hazardous compound. HQ and TU values of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent dropped significantly due to dilution in the sewer. Further elimination by biological degradation or adsorption was observed only in some cases. However, the decreased HQ(WWTPeffluent) values do not the change environmental load significantly. Therefore, advanced treatment processes should be applied to remove the persistent compounds. In combination with the results on antibiotic resistance, we would prefer on-site treatment of hospital wastewater. Toxicological assessment was performed using cytotoxic and mutagenic screening tests. The results of the Ames assay showed that the native hospital wastewaters had strongly mutagenic activity with a <= 10-fold increase relative to negative controls. The mutagenic potentials of the samples were generally concentration and metabolic activation dependent. Multiple antibiotic resistances were demonstrated with the tested isolates to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, and ceftazidime. This study demonstrates that the hospital wastewaters in Istanbul exhibit strong environmental and toxicological risks, as well as high multiple drug resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

AB Great environmental concern is due to disposal of pharmaceutical wastewater without adequate treatment. The present study deals with treatment of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater for an effective removal of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). This wastewater was previously treated by activated sludge through two stage successive treatment process that was inadequate for the removal of the PhACs. The inefficient treated water is used for landscape irrigation that would threat the environment, public health and groundwater. The aim of the present study is employing an adequate treatment system for complete removal of the pharmaceutical residues (PhR's), efficient wastewater handling and safe water reuse. For this purpose an integration of UASB reactor followed by MBR was studied. The examined system proved high efficiency in treating the given wastewater, removal of the PhR's and safe quality for water reuse. The pharmaceuticals were removed from raw wastewater at a rate ranging from 94 to 99.2%. The overall results revealed that employing the integration of UASB followed by MBR is efficient for the treatment of the studied raw mixed wastewater in terms of the pollution parameters as well as eliminating the PhR's. Meanwhile, the examined integrated process is considered a compact system with low space requirements.

AB To mitigate the detrimental risk of residual phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (PEDCs) from the discharge of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and to increase the utilization of constructed wetlands( CWs), both a stacked CW (SCW), comprising vertical and horizontal flow CWs, and an assembled bio-filter (ABF) were developed and their capability to remove PEDCs from STP discharge at high hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) of 0.5-2.0 m/d evaluated. The SCW and ABF showed different performance on PEDCs removal because of process structural difference. The removal percentages of PEDCs were associated with their octanol-water partition coefficients (LogKow), except 4-nonlyphenol (4-NP) whose apparent removal rate was affected by its precursors, and declined in the order of triclosan (TCS) at 80% and 69%, 4-t-octylphenol (4-t-OP) at 58% and 51%, estrone (E1) at 48% and 44%, and bisphenol-A (BPA) at 45% and 32% in the SCW and ABF systems on average, respectively. The efficiencies of SCW and ABF were superior to the single type of CWs, such as surface flow CW, vertical flow CW, and horizontal flow CW, in terms of removal rates or first-order removal rate constants. Recommended value of HLR for optimal utilization of SCW and ABF to ensure essential removal of PEDCs from STP discharge was between 1.5 and 2.0 m/d. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence trends and effects of 30 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, anthelmintics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and -blockers, in the marine environment, with a focus on seawater, sediment, cultured fish, and their feed collected from coastal and fish farm areas in the southern sea of Korea, were investigated. The concentrations of total pharmaceuticals in coastal area seawater (mean: 533 ng/L) were higher than those in fish farm seawater (mean: 300 ng/L), while the opposite trend (coastal area: 136 ng/g dry wt < fish farm area; 195 ng/g dry wt) was observed for sediment samples. Regarding cultured fish, the concentration of total pharmaceuticals in fish muscle (mean: 5.08 ng/g wet wt) was lower than that in organs (mean: 14.1 ng/g wet wt). However, not all compounds were present at higher concentrations in organs. Characteristic distribution patterns of pharmaceuticals were observed according to sample types and sampling sites based on the predominance of various antibiotics in fish farms (including cultured fish and feed) and the predominance of pharmaceuticals of terrestrial origin (human and livestock) in coastal areas. Pharmaceuticals used as fish drugs, such as sulfadiazine, erythromycin, and trimethoprim, were commonly detected in fish farm media (seawater, sediment, and cultured fish), which might contaminate fish farm media.

AB Tamoxifen is a chemotherapy drug considered as recalcitrant contaminant (with low biodegradability in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment), bioaccumulative, ubiquitous, and potentially hazardous for the environment. This work studies the removal of Tamoxifen from water by advanced oxidation processes, paying special attention to the formation of transformation products (TPs) and to the evolution of toxicity (using the Microtox (R) bioassay) during the oxidation processes. Five types of treatments were evaluated combining different technologies based on ozone, hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation: i) O-3, ii) O-3/UV, iii) O-3/H2O2 (peroxone), iv) UV and v) UV/H2O2. Complete removal of tamoxifen was achieved after 30 min for all the treatments carried out with O-3 while a residual concentration (about 10% of initial one) was observed in the treatments based on UV and UV/H2O2 after 4 h of reaction. Eight TPs were tentatively identified and one (non-ionizable molecule) was suspected to be present by using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. An increase of toxicity was observed during all the oxidation processes. In the case of ozone-based treatments that increase was attributed to the presence of some of the TPs identified, whereas in the case of UV-based treatments there was no clear correlation between toxicity and the identified TPs.

AB High efficiency and facile separation are desirable for catalysts used in water treatment. In this study, a magnetic catalyst (nitrogen doped iron/activated carbon) was prepared and used for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The catalyst was characterized using BET, SEM, XRD, VSM and XPS. Results showed that iron and nitrogen were successfully loaded and doped, magnetic Fe2N was formed, large amount of active surface oxygen and Fe(II) were detected, and the catalyst could be easily separated from water. Diclofenac was then degraded using the catalyst in ultrasound system. The catalyst showed high catalytic activity with 95% diclofenac removal. Analysis showed that center dot OH attack of diclofenac was a main pathway, and then center dot OH generation mechanism was clarified. The effects of catalyst dosage, sonication time, ultrasonic density, initial pH, and inorganic anions on diclofenac degradation were studied. Sulfate anion enhanced the degradation of diclofenac. Mechanism in the catalytic ultrasonic process was analyzed and reactions were clarified. Large quantity of oxidants was generated on the catalyst surface, including center dot OH, O-2(-center dot), O-center dot and HO2 center dot, which degraded diclofenac efficiently. In the solution and interior of cavitation bubbles, center dot OH and "hot spot" effects contributed to the degradation of diclofenac. Reuse of the catalyst was further investigated to enhance its economy, and the catalyst maintained activity after seven uses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), as a widely used drug, has been detected in various environmental media such as municipal wastewater effluent. However, there is little information on the effects of DCF on freshwater invertebrates potentially exposing to its residues in surface water. In the present study, we investigated the toxic effects of DCF on the physiological parameters (e.g., survival, growth rate, and reproduction) of a crustacean, Daphnia magna, via a 21-d chronic toxicity test, and we also evaluated the effects of DCF on the expression of the genes related to the detoxification metabolism, growth, development and reproduction (e.g., HR96, P-gp, CYP360A8, CYP314, GST, EcR and Vtg) in acute exposure (up to 96 h) with RT-PCR. Significant toxic effects of DCF to D. magna were observed at 50 mu g L-1, the expression of these selected genes was inhibited with 24 h of exposure, and induced after 48 h to some extents. The expression of Vtg was induced at high concentrations of DCF (500 mu g L-1 and 5000 mu g L-1) after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, but also significantly induced at low concentration (50 mu g L-1) after 96 h of exposure. Dose and time-dependent relationships were observed for gene expression of the seven selected genes. In the 21-d chronic toxicity test, the days to the first brood and the days to the first egg production were both significantly delayed at 50 mu g L-1. However, there were no significant differences observed among the molting frequency, number of eggs produced in the first brood, total number of eggs per individual, total number of broods per individual, body length and intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggested that the reproduction parameters are more sensitive endpoints than the survival and growth for evaluating the toxicity of DCF to aquatic invertebrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The transfer of 23 antibiotics from domestic and hospital sources was investigated in two elementary river watersheds receiving wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges, in relation with the hydrological cycle and seasonal conditions. Antibiotic concentrations in the effluent of a WWTP. treating wastewaters from both hospital and domestic sources (18-12 850 ng L-1) were far higher than those from domestic sources exclusively (3-550 ng L-1). In rivers, upstream of the WWTP discharges, fluoroquinolones only were found at low concentrations (<= 10 ng L-1). Their presence might be explained by transfer from contaminated agricultural fields located on the river banks. Immediately downstream of the WWTP discharge, antibiotic occurrence increased strongly with mean concentrations up to 1210 ng L-1 for ofloxacin and 100% detection frequencies for vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and three fluoroquinolones. Dilution processes during high-flow periods led to concentrations 14 times lower than during low-flow periods. Downstream of the discharge, the antibiotic dissipation rate from the water column was higher for fluoroquinolones, in relation with their high sorption upon suspended matter and sediment. Only five antibiotics (vancomycin and four fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin) were partly distributed (11%-36%) in the particulate phase. Downstream of the discharge, antibiotic contents in sediment ranged from 1700 to 3500 ng g(-1) dry weight, fluoroquinolones accounting for 97% of the total. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The discharge of emerging contaminants (ECs) from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment is a matter of great importance due to the potential adverse effects that they can exert on aquatic biota. This study assesses the capacity of 12 full-scale horizontal-flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) (18,000 m(2) in total) used as tertiary treatment to remove 16 ECs from secondary treated wastewater( 423,500 PE). Benzotriazole, 5-methylbenzotriazole, ketoprofen, and diclofenac were the most abundant(>2000 ng L-1 on average) in the secondary treated wastewater effluent. EC removal levels ranged from no removal to 92%, with an average removal of 43%. A significant relationship was observed between the removal of ECs in the HFCWs and their log Kow and molecular weight. The HFCWs were able to attenuate the predicted ecotoxicological effects of ECs on aquatic biota (Daphnia magna) by 66%. This study indicates that HFCWs are suitable for removing ECs from WWTP effluents and, therefore, reduce the ecotoxicological effects associated with pollutant discharges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Mississippi River drainage basin includes the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas rivers. These rivers drain areas with different physiography, population centers, and land use, with each contributing a different suites of metals and wastewater contaminants that can affect water quality. In July 2012, we determined 18 elements (Be, Rb, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the five major tributaries and in the Upper Mississippi River. The following summer, we determined both trace elements and 25 trace organic compounds at 10 sites in a longitudinal study of the main stem of the Mississippi River from Grafton, Illinois to Natchez, Mississippi. We detected wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, throughout the river system, with the highest concentrations occurring near urban centers (St. Louis and Memphis). Concentrations were highest for atrazine (673 ng L-1), DEET (540 ng L-1), TCPP (231 ng L-1), and caffeine (202 ng L-1). The Illinois, Missouri, and Yazoo rivers, which drain areas with intense agriculture, had relatively high concentrations of Chl-a and atrazine. However, the Ohio River delivered higher loads of contaminants to the Mississippi River, including an estimated 177 kg day(-1) of atrazine, due to higher flow volumes. Concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cd, and Zn) were relatively high in the Illinois River and low in the Ohio River, although dissolved metal concentrations were below US EPA maximum contaminant levels for surface water. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the rivers can be distinguished based on elemental and contaminant profiles.

AB Activated carbon (AC)/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites, MAC-1 and MAC-2, were prepared by a simple pyrolytic method using a mixture of iron(III)/cobalt(II) benzoates and iron(III)/cobalt(II) oxalates, respectively, and were used as efficient adsorbents for the removal of amoxicillin (AMX) and paracetamol (PCT) of aqueous effluents. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sizes of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles formed from benzoates of iron(III)/cobalt(II) and oxalates of iron(III)/cobalt(II) precursors were in the ranges of 5-80 and 6-27 nm, respectively. The saturation magnetization (M-s), remanence (M-r) and coercivity (H-c) of the MAC-2 nanocomposites were found to be 3.07 emu g(-1), 1.36 emu g(-1) and 762.49 Oe; for MAC-1, they were 0.2989 emu g(-1), 0.0466 emu g(-1) and 456.82 Oe. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies were investigated, and the results showed that the as-prepared nanocomposites MAC-1 and MAC-2 could be utilized as an efficient, magnetically separable adsorbent for environmental cleanup. The maximum sorption capacities obtained were 280.9 and 444.2 mg g(-1) of AMX for MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively, and 215.1 and 399.9 mg g(-1) of PCT using MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively. Both adsorbents were successfully used for simulated hospital effluents, removing at least 93.00 and 96.77% for MAC-1 and MAC-2, respectively, of a mixture of nine pharmaceuticals with high concentrations of sugars, organic components and saline concentrations.

AB The use of the ligninolytic fungi Trametes versicolor for the degradation of micropollutants has been widely studied. However, few studies have addressed the treatment of real wastewater containing pharmaceutically active compounds (PhAC) under non-sterile conditions. The main drawback of performing such treatments is the difficulty for the inoculated fungus to successfully compete with the other microorganisms growing in the bioreactor. Id the present study, several fungal treatments were performed under non-sterile conditions in continuous operational mode with two types of real wastewater effluent, namely, a reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from a wastewater treatment plant and a veterinary hospital wastewater (VHW). In all cases, the setup consisted of two parallel reactors: one inoculated with T. versicolor and one non-inoculated, which was used as the control. The main objective of this work was to correlate the operational conditions and traditional monitoring parameters, such as laccase activity, with PhAC removal and the composition of the microbial communities developed inside the bioreactors. For that purpose a variety of biochemical and molecular biology analyses were performed: phospholipid fatty acids analysis (PLFA), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by sequencing. The results show that many indigenous fungi (and not only bacteria, which were the focus of the majority of previously published research) can successfully compete with the inoculated fungi (i.e., Trichoderma asperellum overtook T. versicolor in the ROC treatment). We also showed that the wastewater origin and the operational conditions had a stronger impact on the diversity of microbial communities developed in the bioreactors than the inoculation or not with T. versicolor.

AB Siloxane-based compounds are widely used in personal care, pharmaceutical and household products as well as in industrial applications. Among the wide variety of these chemicals, special attention has been given to volatile methylsiloxanes (VMSs). These compounds have been extensively detected in several environmental compartments, as they are not effectively removed from wastewater and may migrate through different matrices and being lipophilic, bioaccumulate and biomagnify in living organisms. In this work, a prioritisation methodology for several VMSs in different environmental matrices was applied, estimating a hazard quotient by combining exposure evaluation through measured or predicted environmental concentrations (MEC or PEC) and effects using ecotoxicity data to establish no effect concentrations (PNEC).VMSs show quite different hazard potentials in the environment: for linear VMSs it is not considerable, while for cyclic VMSs the hazard is disperse. D4 and D5 may have adverse effects in water, as well as D5 and D6 in sediments. This first multi-matrix approach for the prioritisation of VMSs sets the ground for more accurate studies in the future, provided that more field-based data are reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is essential to monitor the release of organic micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for developing environmental risk assessment and assessing compliance with legislative regulation. In this study the impact of sampling strategy on the quantitative determination of micropollutants in effluent wastewater was investigated. An extended list of 90 chiral and achiral micropollutants representing a broad range of biological and physico-chemical properties were studied simultaneously for the first time. During composite sample collection micropollutants can degrade resulting in the under-estimation of concentration. Cooling collected sub-samples to 4 degrees C stabilised >= 81 of 90 micropollutants to acceptable levels (+/- 20% of the initial concentration) in the studied effluents. However, achieving stability for all micropollutants will require an integrated approach to sample collection (i.e., multi-bottle sampling with more than one stabilisation method applied). Full-scale monitoring of effluent revealed time-paced composites attained similar information to volume-paced composites (influent wastewater requires a sampling mode responsive to flow variation). The option of monitoring effluent using time-paced composite samplers is advantageous as not all WWTPs have flow controlled samplers or suitable sites for deploying portable flow meters. There has been little research to date on the impact of monitoring, strategy on the determination of chiral micropollutants at the enantiomeric level. Variability in wastewater flow results in a dynamic hydraulic retention time within the WWTP (and upstream sewerage system). Despite chiral micropollutants being susceptible to stereo-selective degradation, no diurnal variability in their enantiomeric distribution was observed. However, unused medication can be directly disposed into the sewer network creating short-term (e.g., daily) changes to their enantiomeric distribution: As enantio-specific toxicity is observed in the environment, similar resolution of enantid-selective analysis to more routinely applied achiral methods is needed throughout the monitoring period for accurate risk assessment.

AB In this study, the performance of a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) to treat real municipal wastewater was assessed at low temperatures (7 to 20 degrees C) in Nordic regions. First, the effect of low temperatures on membrane fouling was evaluated by monitoring trans-membrane pressure. A significant membrane fouling was observed when the sludge temperature inside the MBR unit was below 10 degrees C with a 75% permeability drop, thus indicating high deterioration of the membrane performance at low temperatures. Moreover, increasing values of sludge volume index (SVI) during low temperatures showed high deterioration of sludge settleability. As for the pollution removal, MBR achieved high performances primarily for pathogens and emerging micro pollutants. The average log reductions of 1.82, 3.02, and 1.94 log units were achieved for norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and adenoviruses, respectively. Among the four trace organic compounds (TrOCs), the average removal efficiencies of bisoprolol, diclofenac and bisphenol A were 65%, 38%, and >97%, respectively. However, carbamazepine was not efficiently removed (-89% to 28%). Regarding trace metals, an average removal of >80% was achieved for Cd, Pb, and V. For the rest of the metals, the removal capacities were between 30 and 60%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of pharmaceutical residue in surface water. Epilithic biofilms were collected downstream from 12 WWTPs of various types and capacities to study the impacts of their discharge through the changes in biofilm composition (compared to a corresponding upstream biofilm) in terms of pharmaceutical concentrations and bacterial communitymodifications (microbial diversity and resistance integrons). The biofilm is a promising indicator to evaluate the impacts of WWTPs on the surrounding aquatic environment. Indeed, the use of biofilms reveals contamination hot spots. All of the downstream biofilms present significant concentrations (up to 965 ng/g) of five to 11 pharmaceuticals (among the 12 analysed). Moreover, the exposition to the discharge point increases the presence of resistance integrons (three to 31 fold for Class 1) and modifies the diversity of the bacterial communities (for example cyanobacteria). The present study confirms that the discharge from WWTPs has an impact on the aquatic environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the sorption of pharmaceuticals to sewage sludge during waste water treatment processes is important for understanding their environmental fate and in risk assessments. The degree of sorption is defined by the sludge/water partition coefficient (K-d). Experimental K-d values (n = 297) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (n= 148) in primary and activated sludge were collected from literature. The compounds were classified by their charge at pH 7.4 (44 uncharged, 60 positively and 28 negatively charged, and 16 zwitterions). Univariate models relating log K-d to log K-ow for each charge class showed weak correlations (maximum R-2 = 0.51 for positively charged) with no overall correlation for the combined dataset (R-2 = 0.04). Weaker correlations were found when relating log K-d to log D-ow. Three sets of molecular descriptors (Molecular Operating Environment, VolSurf and ParaSurf) encoding a range of physico-chemical properties were used to derive multivariate models using stepwise regression, partial least squares and Bayesian artificial neural networks (ANN). The best predictive performance was obtained with ANN, with R-2= 0.62-0.69 for these descriptors using the complete dataset. Use of more complex Vsurf and ParaSurf descriptors showed little improvement over Molecular Operating Environment descriptors. The most influential descriptors in the ANN models, identified by automatic relevance determination, highlighted the importance of hydrophobicity, charge and molecular shape effects in these sorbate-sorbent interactions. The heterogeneous nature of the different sewage sludges used to measure K-d limited the predictability of sorption from physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals alone. Standardization of test materials for themeasurement of K-d would improve comparability of data from different studies, in the long-term leading to better quality environmental risk assessments.

AB Mobile and persistent chemicals that are present in urban wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals, may survive on-site or municipal wastewater treatment and post-discharge environmental processes. These pharmaceuticals have the potential to reach surface and groundwaters, essential drinking-water sources. A joint, two-phase U.S. Geological Survey-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study examined source and treated waters from 25 drinking-water treatment plants from across the United States. Treatment plants that had probable wastewater inputs to their source waters were selected to assess the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in such source waters, and to identify which pharmaceuticals persist through drinking-water treatment. All samples were analyzed for 24 pharmaceuticals
   in Phase I and for 118 in Phase II. In Phase I, 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of nine pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was five. Quantifiable pharmaceutical detections were fewer, with a maximum of five pharmaceuticals in any one sample and a median for all samples of two. In Phase II, 47 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of 41 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was eight. For 37 quantifiable pharmaceuticals in Phase II, median concentrations in source water were below 113 ng/L.
   For both Phase I and Phase II campaigns, substantially fewer pharmaceuticals were detected in treated water samples than in corresponding source-water samples. Seven different pharmaceuticals were detected in all Phase I treated water samples, with a maximum of four detections in any one sample and a median of two pharmaceuticals for all samples. In Phase II a total of 26 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all treated water samples, with a maximum of 20 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample and a median of 2 pharmaceuticals detected for all 25 samples. Source-water type influences the presence of pharmaceuticals in source and treated water. Treatment processes appear effective in reducing concentrations of most pharmaceuticals.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals and their potential for adverse biological effects raise concern for aquatic ecosystem health in protected areas. During 2013-15, surface waters of four Midwestern United States national parks were sampled and analyzed for wastewater indicators, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides. More chemicals and higher concentrations were detected at the two parks with greater urban influences (Mississippi National River and Recreation Area and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore) than at the two more remote parks (Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and Isle Royale National Park). Atrazine (10-15 ng/L) and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (16-120 ng/L) were the only chemicals detected in inland lakes of a remote island national park (Isle Royale National Park). Bisphenol A and organophosphate flame retardants were commonly detected at the other sampled parks. Gabapentin and simazine had the highest observed concentrations (>1000 ng/L) in three and two samples, respectively. At the two parks with urban influences, metolachlor and simazine concentrations were similar to those reported for other major urban rivers in the United States. Environmental concentrations of detected chemicals were often orders of magnitude less than standards or reference values with three exceptions: (1) hydrochlorothiazide exceeded a human health-based screening value in seven samples, (2) estrone exceeded a predicted critical environmental concentration for fish pharmacological effects in one sample, and (3) simazine was approaching the 4000 ng/L Maximum Contaminant Level in one sample even though this concentration is not expected to reflect peak pesticide use. Although few environmental concentrations were approaching or exceeded standards or reference values, concentrations were often in ranges reported to elicit effects in aquatic biota. Data from this study will assist in establishing a baseline for chemicals of concern in Midwestern national parks and highlight the need to better understand the sources, pathways, and potential adverse effects to aquatic systems in national parks.

AB Owing to advanced analytical procedures an increasing number of organic micropollutants have been identified within the aquatic environment. Results from field investigations evidenced the attenuation of various organic micropollutants to be impacted by the predominant hydrochemical conditions. In the course of this study, column experiments were performed to examine the influence of redox conditions and temperature on the attenuation of 20 wastewater derived organic micropollutants. For this purpose, the degradation behavior of these compounds were investigated under oxic, nitrate reducing, iron/manganese reducing and sulfidic conditions at 21 8C in sandy aquifer sediments. Redox dependent degradation was observed for the pharmaceutically active compounds atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, iopromide, phenazone, propyphenazone, acesulfame and trimethoprim as well as for two phenazone type metabolites. In order to identify temperature dependencies, oxic columns were in addition operated at 6 degrees C, indicating the removal of several compounds to be influenced by the prevalent temperature.

AB Wastewater (WW) reuse for vegetable crops irrigation is regularly applied worldwide. Such a practice has been found to allow the uptake of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) by plants and their subsequent entrance to the food web, representing an important alternative pathway for the exposure of humans to PhACs, with potential health implications. Herein we report the impacts of the long-term (three consecutive years) WW irrigation of a tomato crop with two differently treated effluents under real agricultural conditions, on (1) the soil concentration of selected PhACs (i.e. diclofenac, DCF; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; trimethoprim, TMP), (2) the bioaccumulation of these PhACs in tomato fruits, and (3) the human risks associated with the consumption of WW-irrigated fruits. Results revealed that the concentration of the studied PhACs in both the soil and tomato fruits varied depending on the qualitative characteristics of the treated effluent applied and the duration of WW irrigation. The PhAC with the highest soil concentration throughout the studied period was SMX (0.98 mu g kg(-1)), followed by TMP (0.62 mu g kg(-1)) and DCF (0.35 mu g kg(-1)). DCF was not found in tomato fruits harvested from WW-irrigated plants during the first year of the study. However, DCF displayed the highest fruit concentration (11.63 mu g kg(-1)) throughout the study (as a result of prolonged WW irrigation), followed by SMX (5.26 mu g kg(-1)) and TMP (3.40 mu g kg(-1)). The calculated fruit bioconcentration factors (BCFF) were extremely high for DCF in the 2nd (108) and 3rd year (132) of the experimental period, with the respective values for SMX (0.5-5.4) and TMP (0.2-6.4) being significantly lower. The estimated threshold of toxicity concern (ITC) and hazard quotients (HQ) values revealed that the consumption of fruits harvested from tomato plants irrigated for long period with the WW applied for irrigation under field conditions in this study represent a de minimis risk to human health. However, more studies need to be performed in order to obtain more solid information on the safety of WW reuse for irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has focused on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a surrogate for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in pharmaceutical wastewater. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a part of DOM has received little attention. This study investigated the removal characteristics of DON and its influence on the N-nitrosodimethylamine formation potential (NDMA FP) and acute toxicity of DOM in a full-scale hydrolysis/acidification + anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic + moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Results showed that maximum removal of DON (68 +/- 12%) was present in the anaerobic process. The removal of DON by anoxic and aerobic processes was negligible as a result of the production of new N-containing compounds that are characteristic of proteins/amino sugars and lipids. DON concentration decreased significantly in the MBBR process (p < 0.05, t-test), indicating that manipulation of the solids retention times (SRTs) could be a solution to minimize DON. Based on the Pearson correlation analysis, the behavior of NDMA FP and DOM acute toxicity was significantly associated with the 3 kDa < MW < 10 kDa (r = 0.709, p < 0.05) and MW < 3 kDa DON (r = 0.659, p < 0.05), respectively, and are not identical to that of DOC fractions (r = 0.037-0.466, p = 0.051-0.886). Moreover, the removal and molecular changes of DON are not coupled with that of DOC during biotreatment. Thus, testing the performance indicator of DON in pharmaceutical wastewater was recommended, as it provides important information for DOM removal characteristics. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The pharmaceutical industry of Pakistan is growing with an annual growth rate of 10%. Besides this growth, this industry is not complying with environmental standards, and discharging its effluent into domestic wastewater network. Only limited information is available about the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) in the environmental matrices of Pakistan that has motivated us to aim at the occurrence and ecological risk assessment of 11 PCs of different therapeutic classes in the wastewater of pharmaceutical industry and in its receiving environmental matrices such as sludge, solid waste and soil samples near the pharmaceutical formulation units along Shiekhupura road, Lahore, Pakistan. Target PCs (paracetamol, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, amlodipine, rosuvastatin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and gemifloxacin) were quantified using in-house developed HPLC-UV. Ibuprofen (1673 mu g/L, 6046 mu/kg, 1229 mu g/kg and 610 mu g/kg), diclofenac (836 mu g/L, 4968 mu g/kg, 6632 mu g/kg and 257 mu g/kg) and naproxen (464 mu g/L, 7273 mu g/kg, 4819 mu g/kg and 199 mu g/kg) showed the highest concentrations among 11 target PCs in wastewater, sludge, solid waste and soil samples, respectively. Ecological risk assessment, in terms of risk quotient (RQ), was also carried out based on the maximum measured concentration of PCs in wastewater. The maximum RQ values obtained were with paracetamol (64 against daphnia), naproxen (177 against fish), diclofenac (12,600 against Oncorhynchus mykiss), ibuprofen (167,300 against Oryzias latipes), ofloxacin (81,000 against Pseudomonas putida) and ciprofloxacin (440 against Microcystis aeruginosa). These results show a high level of ecological risk due to the discharge of untreated wastewater from pharmaceutical units. This risk may further lead to food web contamination and drug resistance in pathogens. Thus, further studies are needed to detect the PCs in crops as well as the government should strictly enforce environmental legislation on these pharmaceutical units.

Here, inspired by the bioadhesive technology of polydopamine (pDA), a novel porous pDA/SiO2-based molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (PMINcMs) strategy was developed and obtained. The as-prepared PMINcMs were synthesized through an in situ AGET-ATRP method by using ciprofloxacin as template molecule. Importantly, largely enhanced specific rebinding capacity (64.54 mg/g) and permselectivity (the permeability factor 13 was larger than 2.27) had be successfully achieved, which should be attributing to the formation of high-stability and uniform growth of ciprofloxacin-imprinted layers onto the pDA/SiO2-based surfaces. Additionally, the PMINcMs not only exhibited rapid adsorption dynamics of template molecule, but also possessed excellent regeneration performance. All synthesis methods were conducted in water at ambient temperature, which was environmental friendly for scaling up without causing pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A dual chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) with a novel application of granular activated carbon (GAC) as biofilm bearer was developed for simultaneous biotreatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater and power generation. The results demonstrated that maximum COD removal efficiency and power density achieved were 83% and 204.9 mW/m(2), respectively. To examine the influence of GAC adsorptive capacity on COD removal, an additional identically designed MFC was set up with high density polyethylene (HDPE) to replace the GAC as biofilm bearer. The results revealed that maximum observed COD removal efficiency and power density were 83% and 205 mW/m(2), respectively. A steady state, two dimensional model accounting for coupled mass, charge and momentum balances in the biofilm domain was developed. Significant agreement was observed between the predicated and experimental results with a coefficient of determination up to 0.991 demonstrating the validity of the Proposed model for the suggested bio-electrochemical system within the selected range of operating conditions.

AB Emerging contaminants are principally personal care products not readily removed by conventional wastewater treatment and, with an increasing reliance on water recycling, become disseminated in drinking water supplies. Carbamazepine, a widely used neuroactive pharmaceutical, increasingly escapes wastewater treatment and is found in potable water. In this study, a mechanism is proposed by which carbamazepine resists biodegradation, and a previously unknown microbial biodegradation was predicted computationally. The prediction identified biphenyl dioxygenase from Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 as the best candidate enzyme for metabolizing carbamazepine. The rate of degradation described here is 40 times greater than the best reported rates. The metabolites cis-10,11-dihydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine and cis-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrocarbamazepine were demonstrated with the native organism and a recombinant host. The metabolites are considered nonharmful and mitigate the generation of carcinogenic acridine products known to form when advanced oxidation methods are used in water treatment. Other recalcitrant personal care products were subjected to prediction by the Pathway Prediction System and tested experimentally with P. xenovorans LB400. It was shown to biodegrade structurally diverse compounds. Predictions indicated hydrolase or oxygenase enzymes catalyzed the initial reactions. This study highlights the potential for using the growing body of enzyme-structural and genomic information with computational methods to rapidly identify enzymes and microorganisms that biodegrade emerging contaminants.

AB The occurrence of illicit drugs in natural waters (surface, source and drinking water) is of interest due to the poor sanitation coverage and the high consumption of drugs of abuse in Brazil. In addition, little is known about the effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms and human health. This work investigates the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), in surface and drinking water collected in rivers from a populated geographic area in Brazil. Surface water samples were collected in 22 locations from 16 different rivers and one dam from sao Paulo State, whereas drinking water samples were collected in 5 locations. Samples were collected during the dry and wet season. Among the 34 surface water samples analyzed, BE was detected above the LOD in 94%, while COC in 85%. BE concentrations ranged from 10 ng L-1 to 1019 ng L-1 and COC concentrations from 6 ng L-1 to 62 ng L-1. In the drinking water samples analyzed, BE and COC were found in 100% of the samples analyzed. For BE, concentrations were found in the range from 10 ng L-1 to 652 ng L-1, and COC was quantified in concentrations between 6 and 22 ng L-1. These concentrations are one of the highest found in urban surface waters and may pose some risk to aquatic species. However, no human health risk was identified using the Hazard Quotient. BE is proposed as a reliable indicator of sewage contamination in both source and drinking water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline using MWCNT/TiO(2)nanocomposite was investigated under UVC irradiation. The effective operational parameters included pH, irradiation time, photocatalyst dosage, weight ratio of MWCNT to TiO2 and tetracycline concentration and were studied consecutively. Complete removal of tetracycline concentrations of up to 10 mg/L was obtained at MWCNT to TiO2 ratio of 1.5 (w/w%), pH 5, photocatalyst dosage of 0.2 g/L. Pseudo-first order kinetic model was best fitted with the experimental results (R-2: 0.91-0.98 for different tetracycline concentrations). Based on TOC analysis, mineralization was 37% in the same reaction conditions for initial tetracycline concentration of 10 mg/L and reached to 83% after 300 min. In the case of real pharmaceutical wastewater, the COD concentration of 2267 mg/L decreased to 342 mg/L after 240 min in the same operational conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fenton or Fenton-like processes have been regarded as feasible methods to degrade a wide variety of contaminants by generating reactive species, but the efficiency is still challenged by the slow transformation from Fe(III) to Fe(II) and pH. This study employed hydroxylamine (HA) to improve the oxidation efficiency of Fe(II)/HSO5- (Fe(II)/PMS) process, by selecting sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as the target compound. The degradation efficiency and mechanism of SMX by the HA/Fe(II)/PMS process were elucidated for the first time. Compared with Fe(II)/PMS process, the HA/Fe(II)/PMS process showed about 4 times higher degradation efficiency of SMX at pH 3.0. The analysis of steady-state concentration of Fe species indicated that HA enhanced the transformation of Fe(III) to Fe(II), sustaining the rapid Fenton-like reactions. Both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals accounted for the degradation of SMX, with the latter regarded as the dominant reactive species. Degradation intermediates of SMX were further analyzed, and three main transformation pathways were thus proposed. The HA/Fe(II)/PMS process was also effective in the removal of SMX and total organic carbon from real pharmaceutical wastewater. This work would broaden the scope of application of Fenton and Fenton-like processes enhanced by HA in contaminants treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the use of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) against the degradation of an emerging contaminant has been subjected under systematic investigation. The optimization of treatment of the antidepressant drug Venlafaxine (VFA) was performed, using UV light, the combined UV/H2O2 process, solar light, Fenton and finally the solar photo-Fenton process in laboratory scale. The degradation kinetics, the time necessary to remove 90% of the contaminant and the optimal reactants concentration were proposed. The treatment in pure water, (synthetic) wastewater and urine was assessed, in an effort to identify the opportunities and pitfalls the application of process would encounter in a field application. Treatment by the UV-based methods was found sufficiently efficient and the application of the solar photo-Fenton process showed feasibility in a potential field application with appropriate context. Real urban wastewater effluents after biological and physicochemical treatment were tested, as well as human urine, as a proposal for on-site collection and treatment was also treated. Biological treatment before applying the tested AOPs improved their efficiency, and the strategy of diluting urine prior to treatment greatly enhanced the efficacy of the process. Finally, the identification of the degradation pathway and the biodegradability tests of AOPs treated VFA solutions exhibit promising results concerning the strategy of treatment for similar pollutants of emerging concern.

AB Lab scale and single stage high-solid anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge spiked with freshly synthesized nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) and commercial iron powder (IP) under mesophilic condition (37 +/- 1 degrees C) was performed. The effects of both additives on methane yield, and pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) removal were investigated. Results showed that methane yield was increased by 25.2% and 40.8% in the presence of nZVI (0.1%) and IP (1.6%), respectively. Removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand were 54.4% and 66.2% in the presence of nZVI and IP, respectively, which were higher compared to the control group (44.6%). In addition, most PPCPs could be partly or completely removed during the anaerobic digestion process. The application of nZVI and IP showed positive impact on the removal of chlorinated PPCPs (p <0.05), but did not show significant impact on other PPCPs (p > 0.05). Our finding suggests that the application of nZVI and IP in anaerobic digestion could be a promising way to enhance methane yield but had less improvement on PPCP degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study evaluates a battery of marine species-based bioassays against chemically characterized municipal wastewater samples (raw and WWTP treated). We estimated Dunaliella tertiolecta growth rate inhibition (24-96 h IC50 values), Artemia franciscano immobilization (24h LC50 values), mussel hemocytes viability and lipid peroxidation enhancement (in terms of neutral red retention assay/NRRT and malondialdehyde/MDA content, respectively) in influent- and WWTP effluent-treated species. We found algal growth arrest and stimulation respectively, almost similar 24hLC(50) values in Artemia sp., and significantly higher adverse effects (in terms of NRRT and MDA levels) in influent-treated mussel hemocytes. Furthermore, the estimation of hatchability, yolk-sac larvae mortality (24-120 hLC(50)) and spinal deformities (SD) in sea bream Sparus aurata showed slight variations over time, with the lowest LC50 and SD50 (representing spinal deformities at 50% of yolk-sac larvae) values to be observed in influent-treated larvae at 120 h. Data interpretation (both chemical and biological) revealed that toxic endpoints, such as NRRT50, 96hIC(50)Dun, 120hLC(50)Sparus and 120hSD(50)Sparus, significantly related to WWTP removal efficiency and further mediated by the presence of dominant compounds, such as As and Cr, could be used for identifying main components of toxicity in wastewaters.

AB Carbamazepine is an emerging contaminant and resistant to biodegradation, which cannot be effectively removed by the conventional biological wastewater treatment processes. In this study, the combined gamma irradiation and biodegradation was employed to remove carbamazepine from wastewater. The effect of dose on the removal of carbamazepine was studied at different doses (300, 600 and 800 Gy). The results showed that the removal efficiency of carbamazepine increased with dose increasing during the irradiation process. The maximum removal efficiency was 99.8% at 800 Gy, while the removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) was only 26.5%. The removal efficiency of TOC increased to 79.3% after the sequent biological treatment. In addition, several intermediates and organic acids were detected. The possible degradation pathway of carbamazepine during the integrated irradiation and biodegradation was proposed. Based on the overall analysis, the combined gamma irradiation and biological treatment process can be an alternative for removing the recalcitrant organic pollutants such as carbamazepine from wastewater.

AB Worldwide, ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents is increasingly considered in order to decrease the load of organic contaminants before environmental discharge. However, despite the constantly growing knowledge of ozonation over the past few years, the characterization of transformation products (TPs) is still a major concern, particularly because such TPs might remain biologically active. It has been shown for selected tertiary amine pharmaceuticals that they react with ozone and form the corresponding N-oxides. This study therefore applies liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to assess the overall N-oxide formation during the pilot-scale ozonation of a secondary wastewater effluent from a major city in Germany. Sample analysis by LC-HRMS revealed the occurrence of 1,229 compounds, among which 853 were precursors attenuated by ozone and 165 were TPs. Further examination of precursors and TPs using Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect analysis revealed 34 pairs of precursors and products corresponding to a mono-oxygenation. Among these, 27 pairs (16% of all TPs) were consistent with N-oxides since the TP had a higher retention time than the precursor, a characteristic of these compounds. Using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, 10 of these N-oxides could be identified and were shown to be stable during a subsequent filtration step.

AB Fish can be exposed to a complex mixture of chemical contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, present in discharges of wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) effluents. There is little information on the effects of effluent exposure on fish metabolism, especially the small molecule signaling compounds which are the biological target of many pharmaceuticals. We applied a newly developed sensitive nanoflow-nanospray mass spectrometry nontargeted profiling technique to identify changes in the exposome and metabolome of roach (Rutilus rutilus) exposed to a final WwTWs effluent for 15 days. Effluent exposure resulted in widespread reduction (between 50% and 90%) in prostaglandin (PG) profiles in fish tissues and plasma with disruptions also in tryptophan/serotonin, bile acid and lipid metabolism. Metabolite disruptions were not explained by altered expression of genes associated with the PG or tryptophan metabolism. Of the 31 pharmaceutical metabolites that were detected in the effluent exposome of fish, 6 were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but with plasma concentrations too low to disrupt PG biosynthesis. PGs, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites are important mediators regulating a diverse array of physiological systems in fish and the identity of wastewater contaminants disrupting their metabolism warrants further investigation on their exposure effects on fish health.

AB The widespread use of platinum in high-tech and catalytic applications has led to the production of diverse Pt loaded wastewaters. Effective recovery strategies are needed for the treatment of low concentrated waste streams to prevent pollution and to stimulate recovery of this precious resource. The biological recovery of five common environmental Pt-complexes was studied under acidic conditions; the chloro-complexes PtCl42- and PtCl62-, the amine-complex Pt(NH3)(4)Cl-2 and the pharmaceutical complexes cisplatin and carboplatin. Five bacterial species were screened on their platinum recovery potential; the Gram-negative species Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, Geobacter metallireducens, and Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the Gram-positive species Bacillus toyonensis. Overall, PtCl42- and PtCl62- were completely recovered by all bacterial species while only S. oneidensis and C. metallidurans were able to recover cisplatin quantitatively (99%), all in the presence of H-2 as electron donor at pH 2. Carboplatin was only partly recovered (max. 25% at pH 7), whereas no recovery was observed in the case of the Pt-tetraamine complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of both intra- and extracellular platinum particles. Flow cytometry based microbial viability assessment demonstrated the decrease in number of intact bacterial cells during platinum reduction and indicated C. metallidurans to be the most resistant species. This study showed the effective and complete biological recovery of three common Pt-complexes, and estimated the fate and transport of the Pt-complexes in wastewater treatment plants and the natural environment.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is a widespread water treatment process utilised in water reuse applications. However, the improper discharge of RO concentrate (ROC) containing organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals into the environment may cause potential health risks to non-target species and particularly those in aquatic environments. A study was conducted using a submerged membrane-filtration/granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption hybrid system to remove organic micropollutants from a water treatment plant ROC by initially adding 10 g GAC /L of membrane reactor volume with 10% daily GAC replacement. The percentage of dissolved organic carbon removal varied from 60% to 80% over an operation lasting 10 days. Removal of organic micropollutants was almost complete for virtually all compounds. Of the 19 micropollutants tested, only two remained (the less hydrophobic DEET 27 ng/L and the hydrophilic sulfamethoxazole 35 ng/L) below 80% removal on day 1, while five of the most hydrophobic micropollutants were detectable in very small concentrations (<5-10 ng/L) with >89%->99% being removed. High percentages of micropollutants were removed probably because of their high hydrophobicity or they had positive or neutral charges and therefore they were electrostatically adsorbed to the negatively charged GAC.

AB The efficiency of adsorption of two photosensitive fluoroquinolones; Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Moxilloxacin (MOX), on the surface of synthesized magnetite/pectin nanoparticles (MPNPs) and magnetite/silica/pectin nanoparticles (MSPNPs) was studied from aqueous solution under varying experimental conditions. A validated spectrofluorimetric assay was developed for monitoring of CIP and MOX intact drugs and their photodegraded molecules concentrations. To optimize the working conditions which influence the drugs sorption, a 2(4) full factorial experimental design was implemented. The maximum percentage of removal was attained as 89% (type of sorbent = MSPNPs, pH = 7.0, initial drug concentration = 5 mg/L, and contact time = 30 min). The studied factors-pH, NPs loading initial drug concentration, and contact time-were significant for both types of sorbents. The most significant variable was pH, and the highest CIP and MOX adsorption occurred at pH = 7.0. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips equations, and the Sips model showed the best fit with equilibrium isotherm data. Furthermore, pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were used to analyze sorption kinetics, and it was found that adsorption of the investigated fluoroquinolones followed pseudo second-order kinetics. We believe that our synthesized NPs can be used as effective adsorbents for fluoroquinolones and their photodegraded molecules removal from aqueous solutions.

AB Environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is barely studied in India despite being one of the largest global producers and consumers of pharmaceuticals. In this study, 29 pharmaceuticals and six metabolites were determined in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Udupi (STPu: population served similar to 150,000) and Mangalore (STPM: population served similar to 450,000); the measured mean concentrations ranged from 12 to 61,000 ng/L and 5.0 to 31,000 ng/L, respectively. Atorvastatin (the most prescribed antihypercholesterolemic in India), mefenamic acid, and paraxanthine were found for the first time in wastewater in India at the mean concentrations of 395 ng/L, 1100 ng/L, and 13,000 ng/L, respectively. Select pharmaceutical metabolites (norverapamil and clopidogrel carboxylic acid) were found at concentrations of upto 7 times higher than their parent drugs in wastewater influent and effluent. This is the first study in India to report mass loading and emission of PPCPs and their select metabolites in STPs. The total mass load of all PPCPs analyzed in this study at STPU (4.97 g/d/1000 inhabitants) was 3.6 times higher than calculated for STPM. Select recalcitrant PPCPs (carbamazepine, diazepam, and clopidogrel) were found to have negative or no removal from STPU while additional treatment with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor at STPM removed (up to 95%) these PPCPs from STPM. Overall, 5.1 kg of caffeine, 4.1 kg of atenolol, 2.7 kg of ibuprofen, and 1.9 kg of triclocarban were discharged annually from STPU. The PPCP contamination profile in the Indian STP was compared with a similar study in the USA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxytetracycline (OTC), an antibacterial agent, is extensively used in aquaculture practices all over the world, but also in human and veterinary medicines. Because of its intensive use, low rates of absorption by treated animals, inadequate disposal, and low efficiency of removal in wastewater treatment plants, the potential harmful effects on aquatic organisms are of great concern. This work aimed to assess the effects of this antibiotic in rainbow trout, following both acute and chronic exposures. Catalase (CAT), total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRed) activities and lipid peroxidation (TBARS levels) were quantified as oxidative stress biomarkers, in gills and liver. Genotoxic endpoints, reflecting different types of genetic damage in blood cells, were also determined, by analysis of genetic damage (determination of the genetic damage index, GDI, measured by comet assay) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs). The obtained results showed a mild pattern of antioxidant response, with modifications in CAT and GPx activities in gills, and lipid peroxidation in liver. These results suggest that despite the occurrence of oxidative effects, a full scenario of oxidative stress is not likely. However, exposure to OTC resulted in the establishment of genotoxic alterations with the induction of DNA strand breaks in blood cells (increase of GDI), and of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities (increase of ENAs). Considering that the oxidative response was not totally devisable, other mechanisms may be involved in the genotoxic effects reported.

AB Three samples of cosmetic wastewater from the" production of soaps and shampoos were treated by the following processes: coagulation with sedimentation (C/S), coagulation with dissolved air flotation (C/DAF), and the Fenton process (FP). The COD values of raw wastewater samples were 13 160, 13 580 and 9410 mg O-2/dm(3). The anionic surfactants were 3000, 4500 and 4000 mg/dm(3), for samples 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All three processes were effective in highly polluted cosmetic wastewater treatment. The most effective process was coagulation. In the case of sample 1, application of FeCl3 at pH 6.0 resulted in 88.2% of COD removal and the application of aluminum based coagulants allowed for 80.1-85.3% COD removal. In the case of samples 2 and 3, the usage of Al 1019 and Al 3010 coagulants brought about a 91.6% and 82.6% decrease in COD values, respectively. C/DAF was found to be less effective than C/S. The best results with C/DAF were obtained using Al 3010 coagulant with wastewater recirculation the COD removal efficiency amounted to 82.3, 87.3 and 78.8, respectively. The lowest COD removal efficiency was observed for FP and it was equal to 64.0 and 72.7% for samples 2 and 3, respectively.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is one of the major complex and toxic industrial effluents containing little or no biodegradable organic matters. In this study, H2O2/UV based advanced oxidation process (AOP) was used to remove organic materials from pharmaceutical industry effluent. For the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal radiation of medium pressure mercury vapor UV lamp was used in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2/UV). Results indicated that the efficiency of COD removal depends on the initial concentration of H2O2, oxidation time and pH. The efficiency of COD removal at low H2O2 concentration was very low even coupled with UV light, which can be attributed to the low generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot). At high concentration of H2O2 (500 mg/dm(3)) and optimum pH (pH = 4), 87.6% removal efficiency could be achieved during 70 min oxidation. For high concentration of H2O2 (500 mg/dm(3)) at pH 3 and 7, the maximum COD removal efficiency was 28.5% and 15.2% respectively, indicating significant roles of pH and H2O2 concentration in the process of COD removal.

AB The pharmaceutical compounds are emerging pollutants for which the international scientific community has paid special attention in recent years, because these substances can have adverse effects on living organisms in the aquatic environment. In this paper we developed a chromatographic method for the quantification of trace class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs in river water. The present method is a simple and economical way to perform a preliminary screening of eight widely used pharmaceuticals in water. To isolate the analytes from river aqueous matrix we used solid-phase extraction testing three specific types of adsorbents (LiChrolut EN, OASIS HLB and Supelclean ENVI-18). The extract obtained was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with multi waved detector. To reach the sensitivity required in this field, and to be able of determining the low pharmaceuticals concentration levels commonly present in water, a pre-concentration of 1,000 times has been applied. The detection limits in water samples ranged between 0.04 mu g/L and 0.6 mu g/L and the best recoveries were obtained for LiChrolute EN adsorbent (72% and 107%). In the next step of project we need to confirm the identity of the compounds detected in the samples by powerful LC MS technique.

AB Our previous study demonstrated that high levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Haihe River were directly attributed to the excessive use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. The antibiotic residues of the Xiangjiang River determined in this study were much lower than those of the Haihe River, but the relative abundance of 16 detected ARGs (sul1, sul2 and sul3, qepA, qnrA, qnrB, qnrD and qnrS, tetA, tetB, tetW, tetM, tetQ and tetO, ermB and ermC), were as high as the Haihe River particularly in the downstream of the Xiangjiang River which is close to the extensive metal mining. The ARGs discharged from the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant (PWWTP) are a major source of ARGs in the upstream of the Xiangjiang River. In the downstream, selective stress of heavy metals rather than source release had a significant influence on the distinct distribution pattern of ARGs. Some heavy metals showed a positive correlation with certain ARG subtypes. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between individual ARG subtypes and heavy metal resistance genes, suggesting that heavy metals may co select the ARGs on the same plasmid of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The co-selection mechanism between specific metal and antibiotic resistance was further confirmed by these isolations encoding the resistance genotypes to antibiotics and metals. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the fate and distribution of ARGs under the selective pressure exerted by heavy metals in the catchment scale. These results are beneficial to understand the fate, and to discern the contributors of ARGs from either the source release or the selective pressure by sub-lethal levels of environmental stressors during their transport on a river catchment scale.

AB The arrival and discharge of seven antibiotics were monitored at two trickling filter sewage treatment plants of 6000 and 11,000 population equivalents (PE) and two activated sludge plants of 33,000 and 162,000 PE in Southern England. The investigation consisted of 24 h composite samples taken on two separate days every summer from 2012 to 2015 and in the winter of 2015 (January) from influent and effluent. The average influent concentrations generally matched predictions based on England-wide prescription data for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, oxytetracycline and levofloxacin (within 3-fold), but were 3-10 times less for clarithromycin, whilst tetracycline influent concentrations were 5-17 times greater than expected. Over the four years, effluent concentrations at a single sewage plant varied by up to 16-fold for clarithromycin, 10-fold for levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, 7-fold for oxytetracycline, 6-fold for tetracycline, 4-fold for azithromycin and 3-fold for trimethoprim. The study attempted to identify the principal reasons for this variation in effluent concentration. By measuring carbamazepine and using it as a conservative indicator of transport through the treatment process, it was found that flow and hence concentration could alter by up to 5-fold. Measuring influent and effluent concentrations allowed assessments to be made of removal efficiency. In the two activated sludge plants, antibiotic removal rates were similar for the tested antibiotics but could vary by several-fold at the trickling filter plants. However, for clarithromycin and levofloxacin the variations in effluent concentration were above that which could be explained by either flow and/or removal alone so here year on year changes in consumption are likely to have played a role.

AB Ozonation is widely used in wastewater treatment plants to remove diverse organic micropollutants. As molecular structures of organic micropollutants contain multiple ozone-preferred reaction sites, and moreover intermediate products can react with ozone again, ozonation mechanism is complex. A fast increasing number of organic micropollutants and a great demand of ecological risk assessments call for an in silico method to provide insights into the ozonation mechanism of organic micropollutants. Here, an in silico model was developed to unveil ozonation mechanisms of organic micropollutants. Sulfamethoxazole was taken as a case. The model enumerates elementary reactions following well-accepted ozonation patterns and secondary transformation reactions established for intermediates by experiments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed for evaluating thermodynamic feasibilities of reaction pathways. By calculating Gibbs free energies, ozonation products of SMX were predicted. The predicted products are consistent with those detected in experiments. This method is advanced in revealing all possible reaction pathways including minor pathways that produce toxic byproducts but are difficult to be observed by experiments. Accordingly, water treatment engineers can setup necessary treatment technology to ensure water safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex mixtures of micropollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals emitted by wastewater effluents to European rivers may compromise the quality of these water resources and may pose a risk to ecosystem health and abstraction of drinking water. In the present study, an integrated analytical and bioanalytical approach was applied to investigate the impact of untreated wastewater effluents from the city of Novi Sad, Serbia, into the River Danube. The study was based on three on-site large volume solid phase extracted water samples collected upstream and downstream of the untreated wastewater discharge. Chemical screening with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was applied together with a battery of in vitro cell-based bioassays covering important steps of the cellular toxicity pathway to evaluate effects on the activation of metabolism (arylhydrocarbon receptor AhR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma PPAR gamma), specific modes of action (estrogen receptor ER alpha, androgen receptor AR) and adaptive stress responses (oxidative stress, inflammation). Increased effects, significantly changed contamination patterns and higher chemical concentrations were observed downstream of the wastewater discharge. A mass balance approach showed that enhanced endocrine disruption was in good agreement with concentrations of detected hormones, while only a smaller fraction of the effects on xenobiotic metabolism (<1%) and adaptive stress responses (0-12%) could be explained by the detected chemicals. The chemical and effects patterns observed upstream of the discharge point were fairly re-established at about 7 km downstream, demonstrating the enormous dilution capacity of this large river.

AB In this study, seven strains of bacteria with polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)-producing ability (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomona huttiensis, Yersinia frederiksenii, Aeromonas ichthiosmia, and Sphingopyxis terrae) were isolated from various waste treatment plants in Hong Kong. Simultaneous wastewater treatment and PHA accumulation were successfully achieved in the bioreactors using isolated bacteria from different sludges. At the organic loading less than 13,000 ppm, more than 95% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed by the isolated strains before the decrease of PHA accumulation. In addition, more than 95% of nitrogen removal was achieved by all isolated strains. In the bioreactors inoculated with single strains, the highest yields of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV) were obtained in A. ichthiosmia (84 mg PHB/g) and B. cereus (69 mg/g), respectively. For the mixed culture, the highest yields of PHB and PHV were increased by 55% and 45% in the system inoculated with B. pumilus and A. ichthiosmia. The biologically synthesized PHA also showed the potential applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering. PHA-nanoparticles loaded with pyrene were successfully prepared by recombinant Escherichia coli. The results of in vitro drug release and biocompatibility tests revealed that nanoparticles could be used as safer dray carriers with high loading capacity and efficiency. After 20 days, the cells successfully grew on 90% of the PHA-aortic valve.

AB The ZVI/H2O2 process was applied for cosmetic wastewater treatment. Two commercial zero-valent iron (ZVI) types with different granulations were chosen: Hepure Ferrox PRB and Hepure Ferrox Target. In addition, the pH and stirring method influence on ZVI/H2O2 process efficiency was studied. During the ZVI and ZVI/H2O2 processes, linear Fe ions concentration increase was observed. The addition of H2O2 significantly accelerated the iron dissolution process. The highest COD removal was obtained using finer ZVI (Hepure Ferrox Target) for doses of reagents ZVI/H2O2 1500/1600mg/L, in a H2O2/COD weight ratio 2:1, at pH 3.0 with stirring on a magnetic stirrer. After 120min of the process, 84.0% COD removal (from 796 to 127mg/L) was achieved. It was found that the efficiency of the process depends, as in the case of the Fenton process, on the ratio of the reagents (ZVI/H2O2) and their dose in relation to the COD (H2O2/COD) but does not depend on the dose of the iron itself. Statistical analysis confirms that COD removal efficiency depends primarily on H2O2/COD ratio and ZVI granulation, but ZVI dose influence is not statistically significant. The head space, solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry results confirm high efficiency of the ZVI/H2O2 process.

AB We selected 14 anthropogenic organic compounds representing major classes of potential contaminants for analysis to determine their occurrence in the South Saskatchewan River and its tributaries near irrigated farmland and the only urban center in southeast Alberta, Canada. Agriculture and urban runoff and discharges seem to have little impact on the quality of surface water based on samples taken above and below Medicine Hat/Redcliff in the South Saskatchewan River and local tributaries. Samples of river water, tributary water, and raw and treated wastewater taken over a period of 3 years allowed an estimation of the impact of trace organic compounds from urban and agricultural activities on water quality. Of the 14 compounds investigated, 10 were detected in concentrations above the detection limit in at least one surface water sample and 9 at concentrations above the detection limit in sewage samples. The wastewater treatment plant removed indicator compounds to varying degrees, and the volume of treated effluent discharge was <1% of the river, even during the lowest flow conditions, thereby minimizing potential impact. Discharge in the river and tributaries varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study, including 2 major flood events in the South Saskatchewan River. Potential health or environmental effects were difficult to evaluate from a regulatory perspective because few guidelines are available for reference.

AB Because of the intensive use of pharmaceutical substances in human life, studies on the detection of these chemical compounds and their metabolites as pollutants in water bodies are continuously reported. Some pharmaceutical agents are associated with adverse effects to aquatic life, even at very low concentrations (ng L-1 to g L-1). For instance, the presence of antibiotics and hormones has been associated with increasing proliferation of antibiotic resistant pathogens and feminization and masculinization of some aquatic organisms. Currently, new attempts are being made to minimize or fully remove these types of pollutants from aquatic systems to protect the environment and human health. In this regard, physicochemical and biological treatments are among the most promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical pollutants. These treatments are green alternatives for the degradation of hazardous organic compounds into nontoxic by-products. Here, we review some of the physicochemical and biological treatment methods used for the removal of the most extensively used antibiotics and hormones. Enzymatic oxidation, photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation are described in terms of the aforementioned pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The use of membrane technologies to separate different groups of antibiotics and hormones prior to biologic or physicochemical treatment methods is also addressed.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A complex mix of pharmaceuticals enters waterways via treated wastewater effluent and many remain biochemically active after the drugs reach aquatic systems. However, to date little is known regarding the ecological effects that might arise following pharmaceutical contamination of aquatic environments. One group of particular concern is behaviorally modifying pharmaceuticals as seemingly minor changes in behavior may initiate marked ecological consequences. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) on key behavioral traits in wild roach (Rutilus rutilus) at concentrations similar to those encountered in effluent surface waters. Roach exposed to water with high concentrations of oxazepam (280 mu g/L) exhibited increased boldness, while roach at low treatment (0.84 mu g/L) became bolder and more active compared to control fish. Our results reinforce the notion that anxiolytic drugs may be affecting fish behavior in natural systems, emphasizing the need for further research on ecological impacts of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems and development of new tools to incorporate ecologically relevant behavioral endpoints into ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB Effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are known to be point sources of micropollutants for surface waters. The aim of this study was to examine a reconstructed full-scale ozonation equipped with a pump-injector system for ozone (O-3) dosage and a fluidized moving-bed reactor as biological posttreatment at a municipal WWTP utilizing an effect-directed approach. This approach consists of chemical analysis in combination with toxicological tests for the assessment of treatment efficiency of the plant. Chemical analysis showed elimination rates > 80% for pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. Analysis of endocrine disruptors was limited due to substance concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD). Estrogenic activity was detected by the Arxula Adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (A-YES) at low concentrations (pg to ng EEQ/l range). Estrogenic activity was reduced by more than 90% after ozonation. In contrast, androgenic activity (measured in the Adeninivorans yeast androgen screen, A-YAS) was still found after O-3 treatment and after biological posttreatment, which is consistent with the data obtained by chemical analysis. Furthermore, no marked genotoxic or cytotoxic effects were observed after ozonation using the alkaline comet and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid (MTT) assays, respectively. Results suggest that the applied specific O-3 dose of 0.4 mgO(3)/mgDOC is a safe operation setup in terms of toxicologically relevant transformation products. In addition, no adverse effects on primary producers, as evidenced by algae growth inhibition tests, were detected. The monitored biofilm growth in the biological posttreatment exhibited a steady state after one month. Based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and biomass, one might conclude that O-3 did not apparently enter biological posttreatment to a great extent and that hydraulic retention time in the O-3 reactor was sufficient. Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of a full-scale O-3 treatment in combination with a fluidized moving-bed reactor as biological posttreatment for the reduction of a majority of micropollutants without the release of relevant toxic transformation products as assessed by a chemical and toxicity-based approach.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is an effective natural and economically feasible tertiary treatment for wastewater reuse. An innovative hybrid process based on biofiltration, ozonation and short SAT (sSAT, with similar to 22 days retention time) was demonstrated in a 6 m(3)/hr pilot system to remove emerging trace organic compounds (TrOCs), organic matter and control Mn2+ dissolution in reclaimed water. The biofiltration stage was proposed for nitrification of ammonia as well as removal of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), to enable efficient ozonation of secondary effluents. The pilot system was operated in two modes, where samples were periodically taken from all pilot stages to observe changes in product water quality. At first (Mode 1), biofiltered effluents were infiltrated through sSAT (i.e., no ozonation prior infiltration). During this operation, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were completely removed, and pathogens were highly reduced. In addition, all measured TrOCs were effectively removed after sSAT, besides the persistent TrOCs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Iodine-organic contrast media Iopamidol (IPDL). In Mode 2, biofiltered and ozonated (1.0-1.2 mg ozone/mg DOC) effluents were infiltrated through sSAT. In the final reclaimed product, values of DOC, UVA and Mn2+ were reduced to 0.8 mg/L, 2.2 L/m, and 29-35 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, ammonia and nitritewere not detected in the product, and good bacterial quality was obtained. Following 56-75 days of operation at Mode 2, all TrOCs were reduced down to <100 ng/L. The delay in the effect of the pretreatment stages on TrOCs removal by sSAT (>56 days instead of similar to 22 days) could be explained by their displacement retardation in the upper soil layers of the pilot SAT (0-25 cm). In-depth sampling inbservation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water. the observation well after 111 days atMode 2 showed homogeneity along the overall perforated section of the well (from -14 to -26 m) with 0.7-0.9 mg/L DOC, 2.1-2.2 1/m UVA and <10 ng/L CBZ. This result proved that the ozonated water completely covered the area around the observation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water.

AB The quality of surface waters in lowland rivers is largely dependent on the efficiency of wastewater treatment. Even in the developed countries, there have been difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of wastewater management and the proportion of wastewater content (WWC) in the river, as well as in estimating the contributing human population. This study aimed to develop a wastewater quality and quantity assessment based on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the receiving waters. A survey of 53 pharmaceuticals in 324 samples (river water and influent and effluent of sewage (wastewater) treatment plants) was carried out in southern England in the River Thames catchment over four years. Carbamazepine was selected as stable marker and from its concentration WWC in the rivers and cumulative human populations along the catchment were estimated. The estimated population had a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.94) with that reported by the local water company. The concentration ratio of the labile marker caffeine to carbamazepine indicated the efficiency of wastewater treatment in the different treatment systems (i.e. trickling filter or activated sludge) and in the receiving waters. The ratio in some river samples revealed unexpected discharges of untreated or poorly treated wastewater, with a total concentration of the analytes (up to 20 mu g/L) five times higher than that in treated wastewater. Such information could be valuable to estimate the discharge or occurrence of not only non-targeted chemicals, but also pathogens within the basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the extraction of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from Ladysmith water resources was conducted by means of a multi-template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as selective sorbent in solid-phase extraction. Quantification was done using high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detection system. Bulk polymerization of MIP was carried out at 70 degrees C for 24 h and characterized with differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and zeta potential. The analytical method detection limits for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in wastewater treatment plant effluent were 0.23, 1.02 and 0.30 mu g L-1, respectively. Recoveries obtained in wastewater, river water, deionized water and drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) samples spiked with 5 mu g L-1 of target compounds and pre-concentrated using molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) were greater than 80 %. All compounds were not detected in DWTP samples, whereas in river water the concentrations were generally higher in the upstream of wastewater treatment plants compared to downstream. The maximum concentrations detected in river water for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were 2.77, 6.72 and 2.58 mu g L-1, respectively. Only diclofenac was present in wastewater at concentrations above the limit of quantification. In conclusion, the high levels of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac detected in river water could be attributed to poor sanitation in Ladysmith.

AB Hairy root cultures are an efficient tool to understand plant biology, biotechnology and other applied sciences. In particular such cultures have revealed many cues of plant cells related to growth, development, physiological and biochemical processes. Thus, hairy roots are used to study secondary metabolism and production of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids. Transgenic roots are used as biofoactories to produce heterologous recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical purposes. Furthermore, they have shown promising applications in phytoremediation and restoring the environment because of advantages in the reduction of toxic organic and inorganic pollutants from soil, air, wastewater, groundwater and biowaste. This review focuses on the recent progress of bioengineering hairy root culture systems.

AB Trace organic compounds from pharmaceutical and personal care products are often not fully removed during wastewater treatment, resulting in discharge of these emerging pollutants to surface and groundwater. Fate and transformation of trace organics has primarily been investigated in larger activated sludge wastewater treatment facilities; almost no research has been done on passively aerated fixed-bed bio-filters that are used in decentralized facilities that serve smaller communities. Four laboratory-scale, packed-bed, recirculating-media filter systems were constructed to evaluate the removal of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan. The media (or packed bed) provided support for the development of the fixed film and the needed porosity for air and water movement. Effluent from a local residential septic tank effluent gravity (STEG) system was used as the wastewater supply. This supply had greater than 100 ppb concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan. Three of the media filters were spiked (nominal 0.1 ppm) with ibuprofen, naproxen, or triclosan to better represent the wastewater from a rural healthcare facility; the fourth media filter received wastewater as produced by the STEG system and served as a non-spiked control. Overall, the mean removal of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan from the wastewater solution was 94%, 84%, and 83%, respectively. At the end of the study, samples of the fixed film were analyzed to discern whether removal was by sorption or biodegradation. It was determined that sorption of the three trace organic compounds into the biofilm accounted for only 0.12% of the ibuprofen, 0.20% of the naproxen, and 1.41% of the triclosan. These results indicate that biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism for these compounds.

AB In the present study, the effects of sub-lethal sub-chronic doses of ibuprofen, diclofenac, and carbamazepine alone, and in combination (concentration range 0.02-60 mu g/l), on the early life stages of tench (Tinca tinca) were investigated. The lower concentrations of pharmaceuticals tested (0.02, 0.2, 2 mu g/l) represent the concentration values of these substances commonly present in surface waters or effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Multiple biomarkers of biotransformation, antioxidant defence systems, and lipid peroxidation were determined in fish after 35 days of exposure. The evaluated pharmaceuticals induced oxidative stress in fish both alone and in combination with each other. Generally, 60 mu g/l of each single pharmaceutical influenced the activity of antioxidant enzymes significantly (P < 0.05), whereas the same concentration of these pharmaceuticals in combination (1 : 1 : 1) did not have any impact on the activity of these enzymes. However, changes in biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes were apparent if lower concentrations of these pharmaceuticals were administered in the mixture. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase were observed even at environmental concentration ranges. A significant effect (P < 0.05) on lipid peroxidation levels was found only in the experimental group exposed to carbamazepine.

AB This article provides data on the contamination of different kinds of sludge (raw, centrifuged, digested, thermally dried sludge and sludge cake) from Paris conurbation by 71 various pollutants including pharmaceutical products (PHPs), hormones, perfluorinated acids (PFAs), linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), alkylphenols (APs), phthalates (PAEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs).
   Very high contents of LAS (0.1-10g/kg dry matter - DM) compared to other compounds were found in all types of sludge followed by DEHP (10-100 mg/kg DM) and fluoroquinolones (1-100 mg/kg DM). APs were measured at intermediary contents in Parisian sludge, lying in the 2-20 mg/kg DM range. Finally, hormones, PAHs, PCBs, PAEs, PFAs and the remaining PHPs were all found at contents lower than 1 mg/kg DM.
   For most compounds (PHPs, PFOS, DEHP, PAHs), no significant differences in the micropollutant contents were found for similar types of sludge from different WWTP in Paris, highlighting the homogeneity of sludge contamination in downstream Paris catchment.
   The variability of concentration is rather high (coefficient of variation >100%) for several PHPs, PFAs or PCBs while it is moderate (<100%) or low (<50%) for fluoroquinolones, hormones, PAHs, APs or LAS. In addition, digestion seems to have a buffer effect as variabilities are lower in digested sludge for PHPs, PFAs, APs and PCBs. During sludge treatment (centrifugation, digestion, thermal drying, sludge conditioning + press filtration), the hormones, LAS, APs, PAHs, DEHP and PCBs concentrations increased, while those of PHPs and PFAs decreased. In the case of digestion, the increase of content can be explained by no pollutant removal or a lower removal than DM removal (concentration phenomenon) whereas the decrease underlines that the compound is more removed than the DM. In any case, these concentration variations presuppose the mechanisms of dissipation that could be attributed to volatilization, biotic or abiotic transformation (complete or with metabolites production), bound residues formation.
   In addition, data on sludge liquors - centrifuged (CW) and condensed (TDW) waters - from respectively centrifugation and thermal drying were collected. Several hormones, PHPs, PFAs, LAS, PAEs, APs, PCBs and PAHs were quantified in CW and TDW, displaying a transfer through the water removal. The concentrations observed are rather comparable to those found in wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are discharged to the environment from wastewater resource recovery facilities, sewer overflows, and illicit sewer connections. To understand the fate of pharmaceuticals, there is a need to better understand their sorption dynamics to suspended sediments (SS) and settled sediments (StS) in sewer systems. In this study, such sorption dynamics to both SS and StS were assessed using a batch equilibrium method under both static and dynamic conditions. Experiments were performed with natively occurring and artificially modified concentrations of sewer pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, theophylline, carbamazepine, and a metabolite of carbamazepine) and caffeine. Differences in apparent distribution coefficients, K-d,K-app, between SS and StS were related to differences in their organic carbon (OC) content, and the practice of artificially modifying the concentration. K-d,K-app values of modified contaminant concentrations and high OC sediments were substantially higher. Pseudo-second order desorption rates for these mobile compounds were also quantified. Successive flushing events to simulate the addition of stormwater to sewer networks revealed that aqueous concentrations would not necessarily decrease, because the added water will rapidly return to equilibrium concentrations with the sediments. Sorption and desorption kinetics must be considered in addition to dilution, to avoid underestimating the influence of dilution on concentrations of pharmaceuticals discharged to the environment.

AB While the population and therefore the demand for water keep increasing alarmingly, the type and quantity of water source remains the same. This leads the world to water scarcity. In this chapter, the need for wastewater recycling and stringent rules to control water pollution, instigated by water scarcity, is identified as the main driving force for the current and future increase in the use of advanced wastewater treatment systems. The types and sources of wastewater, water pollution, and pollutants along with the available treatment technologies are described. The need to continue to develop new strategies for water management is recommended. In most scenarios water reuse and/or recycling are deemed to be financially feasible approaches and hence are discussed as vital in this chapter. Municipal wastewater represents a large volume of wastewater released from different sources. The wastewater is rich in organic and inorganic compounds with high biodegradability. This chapter discusses Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) process with a special focus on biomass-based MBRs and its suitability for municipal wastewater treatment/reclamation in comparison with the existing conventional treatment technologies. Selected groups of microbes isolated and described in the literature as efficient for use in MBR systems are highlighted. The effort, desire, and market trends on MBR for municipal/domestic wastewater treatment and valorization are commentated by reviewing a wide range of projects funded by EU and other reports. It is also noted that, although there is progressive development and significant rise in the use of MBRs, severe membrane fouling and presence and retention of emerging micropollutants limited its further success. Remark is given to the importance of integrating MBR with emerging membrane operations and the simultaneous use of enzyme membrane reactors and mixed community of microbes to reclaim municipal wastewater with a desirable quality.

AB This chapter explores the possibilities of using coffee processing by-products (e.g., coffee husks, coffee grounds and coffee beans) for environmental applications (e.g., adsorption of heavy metals, dye removal etc.). The elaboration of char from coffee processing by-products is presented and some applications devoted to the removal of cations and dyes from wastewater. The preparation of activated carbon (AC) is detailed. Chemical and physical activation methods are described as well as the characteristics of the AC obtained (textural, structural properties and surface chemistry). The role of the activation process on the adsorption of cations, anions, and organic molecules (pharmaceutical products, pesticides, micropollutants) contained in water is discussed. The use of AC for gas treatment is detailed, especially for acid pollutants (H2S, NO2) and CO2 coming from postcombustion. The last part of this chapter is devoted to the preparation of AC for catalytic application (decomposition of organic molecules). For this specific application, AC has to be functionalized (sulfonation of the surface, or impregnation of K and Fe) in order to obtain catalytic properties.

AB Carbamazepine is an anti-epileptic pharmaceuticalcompound which is frequently detected in wastewater. However, this compound is hardly degraded naturally due to its persistency. Thus, carbamazepine presents in water stream and household water supply as well as wastewater treatment plant. This paper focuses on various species of fungi and bacteria used in carbamazepine biodegradation and the carbamazepine degrading-enzymes involved in the degradation pathways. Selected research papers on carbamazepine biodegradation using fungi and bacteria were reviewed. The efficiency and approaches in term of methodologies and technologies used were highlighted in this paper. Such study sheds light on gaps of study and future research direction on carbamazepine biodegradation.

AB This study focuses on the degradation of the sulfonamide antibiotics, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfathiazole, using ultraviolet irradiation in various conditions. Different pHs were investigated in combination with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and further oxygen removal. High-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry was used to identify and elucidate degradation products and to establish concentration-time curves. Previously unknown degradation products could be characterized. Reaction rate constants of all compounds and transformation products were determined. The parent sulfonamides decayed according to first-order kinetics, while the concentrations of the transformation products varied with time according to a subsequent reaction of an intermediate product. Quantum efficiencies were analyzed for mechanistic purposes. As example, sulfamethoxazole was added to effluents from a wastewater treatment plant and irradiated. Phototoxicity and environmental hazard were assessed through quantitative structure-activity relationship computations. In addition, the minimal inhibition concentrations were determined for Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis. Conclusions for UV-C irradiation as a fourth purification wastewater treatment stage were derived.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used by humans as therapeutic agents to treat or prevent illnesses. Once ingested, part of them is excreted and enters the wastewater treatment plants generating biosolids that they may be used as fertilizing complements.
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the mobility of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) in soils and soils amended with biosolid.
   Studies of NSAIDs adsorption on two different soils were carried through batch equilibrium at room temperature. The mobility of NSAIDs in soils was studied through the use of leaching columns incorporating in the top section soil enriched with NSAIDs with and without biosolid.
   Ketoprofen, naproxen and ibuprofen were determined in the leaching columns. Anti-inflammatory mobility in the soil profile depends on the specific characteristics of each system soil-biosolid. In both soils there was little mobility of anti-inflammatory in the soil profile. In Linderos soil were found in greater quantity of Ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac that in Lonquen soil.

AB A variety of organic compounds and their metabolites used in pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP's) are continuously introduced into the environment by domestic or industrial wastewater. Solid phase extraction (polymeric dinivylbenzene cartridge) and stir bar sorptive extraction (polydimethylsiloxane phase) methodologies were optimized for the determination of some selected PPCP's in aqueous matrices. Carbamazepine, beta estradiol, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) champhor, benzophenone-1 and ibuprofen were extracted from aqueous samples and methanol was used as conditioning/eluting solvent. The variables involved in the extraction of the analytes in the original sample were studied, pH between 3 and 6 and sample volume between 50 and 500 mL were considered. Three concentration levels were extracted at the optimal conditions of pH 5 and 500 mL of sample volume with a recovery up to 89%. The determination was performed in a GC-MS, and a derivatization step using BSTFA+ TMCS (99: 1) was needed previous to the injection. Real samples from Maipo River and Villarrica Lake were analyzed with the optimized method, and concentrations below the detection limit were detected.

AB Addition of external carbon sources to post-denitrification systems is frequently used in wastewater treatment plants to enhance nitrate removal. However, little is known about the fate of micropollutants in post-denitrification systems and the influence of external carbon dosing on their removal. In this study, we assessed the effects of two different types and availability of commonly used carbon sources -methanol and ethanol-on the removal of micropollutants in biofilm systems. Two laboratory-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), containing AnoxKaldnes K1 carriers with acclimated biofilm from full-scale systems, were operated in continuous-flow using wastewater dosed with methanol and ethanol, respectively. Batch experiments with 22 spiked pharmaceuticals were performed to assess removal kinetics. Acetyl-sulfadiazine, atenolol, citalopram, propranolol and trimethoprim were easily biotransformed in both MBBRs (biotransformations rate constants 410 between 1.2 and 12.9 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)), 13 compounds were moderately biotransformed (rate constants between 0.2 and 2 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)) and 4 compounds were recalcitrant. The methanol-dosed MBBR showed higher kw (e.g., 1.5-2.5-fold) than in the ethanol-dosed MBBR for 9 out of the 22 studied compounds, equal k(bio) for 10 compounds, while 3 compounds (i.e., targeted sulfonamides) were biotransformed faster in the ethanol dosed MBBR. While biotransformation of most of the targeted compounds followed first-order kinetics, removal of venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole could be described with a cometabolic model. Analyses of the microbial composition in the biofilms using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that the methanol-dosed MBBR contained higher microbial richness than the one dosed with ethanol, suggesting that improved biotransformation of targeted compounds could be associated with higher microbial richness. During continuous-flow operation, at conditions representative of full-scale denitrification systems (hydraulic residence time = 2 h), the removal efficiencies of micropollutants were below 35% in both MBBRs, with the exception of atenolol and trimethoprim (>80%). Overall, this study demonstrated that MBBRs used for post denitrification could be optimized to enhance the biotransformation of a number of micropollutants by accounting for optimal carbon sources and extended residence time.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is a complicated process due to the presence of various kinds of toxic chemicals and antibiotics that are harmful to any living organisms. In this study we employed a pilot-scale net-like rotating biological contactor (NRBC) with three compartments and total volume of 78.75 L to eliminate high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from a synthetic wastewater. In this system, 16 plastic discs in each compartment were fixed on a horizontal shaft, rotating with constant speed (4 rpm). Activated sludge collected from a local hospital wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum and the system was working in batch condition in order to develop adapted living organisms as biofilm on the rotation discs. Then the NRBC was successfully operated at continuous mode for 10 months at various organic loading rates (OLR) (0 to 21.3 gCOD/L.d), hydraulic retention times (HRT) (12 to 72 h), and concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (5 to 120 mg/L). It was found that by increasing in OLR and HRT, SMX removal efficiency was increased. Also, the obtained results indicated that increasing COD concentration had a positive impact on SMX removal efficiency, which was most probably due to the utilization of SMX as a nitrogen source. Finally, it was revealed that most SMX and organic matter removal occurred in the first compartment of the NRBC, and antibiotic concentration was negligible in the outlet stream.

AB Mixed pharmaceutical wastewater contains high levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and high concentrations of toxic and harmful substances. A conventional wastewater treatment process cannot treat this wastewater sufficiently to meet discharge standards. Therefore, mixed pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is a serious challenge to wastewater management. In this study, a full-scale combined anaerobic/oxic (A/O) and biological filtration oxygenated reactor (BIOFOR (R)) process was used to treat the mixed pharmaceutical wastewater. The objectives were to evaluate the removal efficiency of the combined A/O+BIOFOR process on mixed pharmaceutical wastewater and to examine the bacterial community structures in process. The results showed that the effluent concentration of COD, NH4-N, and SS could meet the Chinese mission standard of water pollutants for the pharmaceutical industry mixing/compounding and formulation category (GB21908-2008). MiSeq sequencing data showed that the two systems (A/O and BIOFOR) harbored different bacterial diversity and communities. In phylum level, candidate-division-TM7 was the most predominant phylum in the A/O system, while Proteo bacteria was the most dominant phylum in the BIOFOR reactor. At the genus level, 126 genera were unique in A/O or BIOFOR reactors. The results of this study provided insights into the bacterial community structure and diversity in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment system and can provide reference for the treatment of mixed pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Over the years, adsorption has been the most widely applied technique for pollutants remediation in conventional water and wastewater treatment regimes with commendable results. Consequently, multiple adsorbents have been synthesized, characterized and tested for various pollutants sequestration such as; heavy metals, dyes, pharmaceutically active ingredients, among others, in aqueous media. Unfortunately, most of the sorbents face many inherent limitations such as high production cost, difficult separation of adsorbent from solution, and complex synthesis processes. Therefore, an efficient adsorbent that would be sustainably adopted for industrial application in wastewater treatment requires, among other properties, a simple and efficient recovery step from a continuous flowing system. The regenerated adsorbent must also possess near original properties after several cycles of reuse thereby resulting to low capital investment. To address this challenge, studies conducted in the past few years incorporating magnetism in both natural and synthetic sorbents to improve their removal from water via magnetic separation have yielded stupendous results compared to conventional technologies. This chapter concisely discusses synthesis methods and adsorption capacities and mechanisms of selected magnetic nanocomposite adsorbents under diverse physicochemical conditions for removal of cations, dyes and organic pollutants from wastewater. Magnetic nanocomposites present eco-friendly properties and are potential alternatives for application in water purification processes subject to commercial viability evaluation before practical use.

AB This work has assessed the seasonal changes and the dynamics in the concentration of six pharmaceutical compounds during photolysis as a tertiary treatment of sewage previously treated by an anaerobic/aerobic system comprising a UASB (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactor and a trickling filter (TF). The target compounds were four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin (CPF), clindamycin (CLM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimetoprim), one beta-blocker (atenolol), and one anti-inflammatory (diclofenac (DCF)). Six hydraulic retention times (HRTs) were evaluated (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min) with the intent of varying the ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation doses applied to the effluent from biological treatment containing the target contaminants. The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds in the effluent of the UASB/TF system were in agreement with the concentration levels reported in the literature. Aside from DCF, the seasonality seems to be a preponderant characteristic regarding the pharmaceutical concentration found in the effluent of biological treatment systems. The radiation dose of 117 mJ cm(-2) seemed to be most suited for the photolysis application to tertiary treatment of domestic effluents. It was observed that lower UVC doses led to deconjugation of pharmaceuticals, which can result in increased concentrations of target pollutants in the photoreactor effluent.

AB The main recent advances in photo-Fenton oxidation treatment for recalcitrant wastewaters have been reviewed. Biodegradable intermediates and mineralized pollutants are obtained from recalcitrant compounds when this oxidation technology is employed in wastewater. However, the cost of the technology is one of the main limitations. Several strategies, such as new nanotechnologies, heterogeneous catalysts or chelating agents have been used to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process. Moreover, applying solar energy cost can be reduced integrating biological treatments in the oxidation process. Direct UV photolysis is able to degrade pollutants (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, endocrine-disrupting compounds, and herbicides) in water. In this scenery, photo-Fenton is presented as an attractive and very effective alternative for the removal of recalcitrant compounds and emerging contaminants present in wastewater.

AB This study proposes a microwave-assisted method for the simultaneous extraction of highly prescribed antidepressants (citalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline and amitriptyline) and caffeine from sediments and sewage sludge for subsequent HPLC-PDA analysis. Because the sludge and sediment matrices have high contents of organic material, they strongly interact with the analytes and hinder extraction. Thus, a carefully optimised analytical methodology is required for quantitative extraction. A simplex-centroid design was applied to optimise the solvent composition, and a three-factor central composite rotational design was used to optimise the extraction protocol with regards to pH, amount of solvent and processing time. Samples (in triplicates) were fortified with a standard mixed solution of all the analytes and extracted according to the experimental design in each study. The extraction steps included: 30s vortexing, 20s microwave heating at 10W, cooling to room temperature (25 degrees C) in an ultrasonic bath for 60s, 2min centrifugation at 2000 rpm, and filtration. Analysis of variance and lack-of-fit tests were used to assess the significance of data fitting at 95% confidence. The desirability function was the optimisation tool used to obtain the ideal extraction conditions. As a result, a binary mixture of methanol and acetonitrile in 45:55 and 53:47 (v/v) ratios was indicated as the optimum solvent composition for the simultaneous extraction of all the target drugs from the sludge and sediment, respectively. The optimised extraction conditions were: 3 extraction cycles with 4mL of solvent at pH 3 for sewage sludge extraction and 4 extraction cycles with 3mL of solvent at pH 11 for sediment extraction. Further, low recoveries were obtained for extractions from sediment as compared to sludge indicating strong interaction of antidepressants and caffeine with the acidic organic components of sediments. It was found that the optimisation of pH of the extraction phase was crucial for the efficient extraction of the analytes from these environmental matrices.

AB An innovative approach for mitigating the micropollutants released by urban WWTP has been evaluated. It consists in applying ozone within an activated sludge system fed by a 50% vol mixture of raw hospital and urban wastewaters. Ozone was injected in the entering raw sewage or in the recycled mixed liquor. This integrated oxidation treatment provides a significant improvement in pharmaceuticals removal compared to biological treatment alone. Additional benefit lies in the simultaneous removal of the contaminants from both the solid and soluble phases. Compared to ozonation applied downstream the biological treatment, this configuration presents interesting advantages on the engineering aspects: improved operability of the biological treatment, control of bulking and odor issues.

AB This study focuses on the reaction of ozone with constituents of activated sludge liquor with the aim of understanding the behavior of organic micropollutants and to analyze the changes in the mixed liquor sludge matrix. To do so, different sludge sampling campaigns from two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were treated with different transferred ozone doses (TOD) and analyzed observing the effect on the sludge properties and micropollutants removal. Indeed, the ozone treatment promotes changes in the sludge matrix, increasing the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) solubilization until the Immediate Ozone Demand (IOD) completion and decreasing the Sludge Volume Index (SVI). Moreover, significant pharmaceutical removals have been achieved with low transferred ozone doses (TODs), reaching removals up to 99% depending on the compound.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants, which are ubiquitous and pose the potential risk to ecosystem and human health. It is necessary to remove PPCPs from water and wastewater. In this study, sulfamethoxazole, a widely used antibiotic, was chosen as targeted pollutant. Fenton process and persulfate process were employed to remove sulfamethoxazole from aqueous solution. The results showed that Fenton process required less amount of Fe(II) and oxidant than persulfate process to achieve 100% removal of sulfamethoxazole in the water sample prepared with deionized water. The maximal mineralization reached 83% when hydrogen peroxide concentration was 1 mM and Fe(II) was 0.05 mM for Fenton process. The maximal mineralization for persulfate process was 60% with 4 mM of persulfate and 4 mM of Fe(II). The increase of Fe(II) concentration could increase the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate, but did not increase the mineralization of sulfamethoxazole, indicating that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate was not positive correlation with the removal and mineralization of sulfamethoxazole. Five intermediate compounds were detected in Fenton process while eight intermediate compounds in persulfate process, suggesting that different degradation pathway occurred in the two processes. The wastewater components had negative effect on the degradation of sulfamethoxazole for both Fenton and persulfate processes. The removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole was 52.5% and 52.3%, respectively, for Fenton and persulfate processes. Persulfate process could be an alternative for treating the real wastewater containing PPCPs.

AB Classical methods of wastewater treatment are often not suitable for the treatment of pharmaceutical waste. The previous studies have shown that the use of the advanced oxidation procedures (AOP) can lead to a more efficient degradation of various biologically active compounds, which are active pharmaceutical ingredients of applied drugs. The aim of this paper is the application of the plasma technology on the degradation of a two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs, diazepam and alprazolam) and the finished products (Bensedin((R)) and Ksalol((R))) using the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor for AOP. We studied the degradation rate of these pharmaceuticals, depending on the number of passes through the reactor. This degradation method was efficient 61 % for diazepam and 95 % alprazolam. We also examined the influence of the pH adjustment between the passes of APIs through the DBD reactor. The degradation rate of APIs and the finished products was monitored by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique, using a photodiode array detector. The concentration of the dissolved ozone was determined using the iodometric procedure.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their transformation products (TPs) have been generally detected in the aquatic environment. They threaten human health and increase environmental risk, but knowledge on their fate and attenuation in environmental ecosystems is still lacking. In this study, 13 parent pharmaceuticals and 8 of their TPs in wastewater containing rivers were investigated. We detected all of the compounds except carboxyibuprofen and sulfacetamide in at least one site in all sampling points and found that sewage treatment plants were the principal source of these substances. The majority of parent pharmaceuticals were attenuated in Yangtze River and Qinhuai River, but only a small number were attenuated in the Yunliang River. All detected TPs except 4-chlorobenzoic acid were attenuated in the three rivers. Photodegradation, sorption to sediments, and biotransformation may be important attenuation processes for these substances. We found the largest extent of attenuation in the Yangtze River, where conditions for attenuation were most favorable. Extents of attenuation values for some substances obtained by active and passive sampling were roughly the same; thus, using a polar organic chemical integrative sampler may be an appropriate method for determining the extent of attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers.

AB Hospital wastewater contains a great variety of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs), mainly due to excretion by patients. These PhCs, called emerging pollutants, are not fully eliminated in treatment plants, and are consequently detected in various environmental matrices, contributing to bacterial resistance and adverse environmental impacts on water resources. This study explores a consumption-based approach to predict the contribution of PhCs to a Brazilian hospital's wastewater. This approach identifies the consumption of major pharmaceutical classes in the studied hospital. Overall, this approach demonstrates a unique opportunity to screen PhCs used in hospitals and identify priority pollutants in hospital wastewater.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is a pharmaceutical drug widely found in the aquatic environment, where it represents a persistent, anthropogenic hazard to all biota. Owing to the reported inefficiency of water treatment strategies to remove pharmaceuticals, the present study aimed to investigate the ability of the aquatic fungus Mucor hiemalis to take up and accumulate DCF. Cultures of M. hiemalis were exposed to varying concentrations of DCF (10, 25 and 50 mu g/L) over a period of 144h. In the presence of M. hiemalis, DCF concentrations in the media decreased by 95% within 24h. This early removal was most likely due to extracellular metabolism of DCF, as low proportions of the pharmaceutical were found in the mycelium of the fungus, thereby excluding bioaccumulation as the main mode of removal. However, adsorption of DCF onto the surface of the M. hiemalis pellets cannot be excluded. Our study provides the first report of DCF remediation using M.hiemalis and is the first successful step towards a feasible and inexpensive bioremediation technique for DCF.

AB We report on the development of an electrochemical sensor based on electrodepositing zinc oxide on multiwalled carbon nanotube-modified glassy carbon electrode for the detection of caffeine in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. The measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). DPV measurements showed a linear relationship between oxidation peak current and concentration of caffeine in 0.1M HClO4 (pH 1.0) over the concentration range 0.00388-4.85mg/L and a detection limit of 0.00194mg/L. The diffusion coefficient and Langmuir adsorption constant for caffeine were calculated to be 3.25x10(-6)cm(2)s(-1) and 1.10x10(3)M(-1), respectively. The sensor showed satisfactory results when applied to the detection of caffeine in wastewater effluents.

AB The widespread and large scale use of platinum group metals, especially palladium, in a wide variety of industrial applications has seen their levels in wastewater streams, roadside dust and even pharmaceuticals significantly rise over recent years. Due to the possible environmental damage and potential health risk this may cause, there is now substantial demand for inexpensive, efficient and robust methods for the detection of palladium. Based upon self-immolative linker technologies, we have designed and synthesised a number of allyl ether-functionalised electrochemical probes to determine the optimum probe structure required to deliver a ratiometric electrochemical detection method capable of achieving a limit of detection of<1mg/mL within 20min through the use of disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes. Combined with an enzymatic assay, this method was then used to achieve a proof-of-principle ratiometric electrochemical molecular logic gate.

AB A major environmental concern has recently developed due to emerging pollutants (EC) that are nowadays being detected in the effluents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) at very low concentrations, thanks to improved analytical techniques. Pharmaceutical compounds (PhACs) are some of the most hazardous EC. These compounds can be retained into the water cycle (from users to WWTP, and then to water sources by discharge) virtually endlessly. Thus innovative solutions are required, such as the advanced oxidation processes (AOP). Among them, combined treatments based on UV light appear to be eco-friendly, giving very interesting removal efficiencies if opportunely devised. In this paper, the removal of diclofenac, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), from synthetic water streams was explored by using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at fixed wavelength and intensity (254 nm; 400 mJ m(-2)). The experimental tests have been carried out to evaluate the effect of treatment time and to verify the possibility of further degrading the obtained compound. The preliminary results confirm what has been recently and unexpectedly found in literature, that is the formation of a dimer during the first minutes of photolysis, carbazole, a very stable coloured intermediate.

AB Surface waters in urban areas are contaminated by ibuprofen (IBP), a popular and extensively used anti-inflammatory drug. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic response in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. roots with the aim of revealing genes that are potentially involved in IBP detoxification and elucidating the effect of IBP on plants. IBP upregulated 63 and downregulated 38 transcripts (p-value < 0.1, fold change >= 2) after 2-day exposure to a 5-mu M (1.03mg/L) concentration of IBP under hydroponic conditions. Although the IBP concentration used in the experiment was highly relative to the concentrations found in rivers and wastewater, the number of genes with transcriptional changes was relatively low. The upregulation of cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and UDP-glycosyltransferases indicates the occurrence of IBP oxidation in the first phase, followed by conjugation with glutathione and sugar in the second detoxification phase. ABC transporters could be involved in the transport of IBP and its metabolites. The identification of genes potentially involved in IBP detoxification could be useful in an IBP phytoremediation approach.

AB Selected pharmaceutical chemicals, steroids and xenoestrogens (PCSXs) consisting of 29 endocrine modulators, therapeutic drugs, pesticides, detergents, plastics, and active ingredients in household products were measured in water, riverbed sediments and fish collected in a tributary embayment of the Potomac River (Hunting Creek, Alexandria, VA, USA) in the vicinity of wastewater discharge. A total of 17 PCSXs were found in the Hunting Creek samples, with steroid hormones (e.g., progesterone and 17-ethinylestradiol), triclosan, dextromethorphan and bisphenol A being the most prominent micropollutants detected.The geospatial distribution of the PCSXs in Hunting Creek indicated that the steroids correlated with wastewater treatment plant discharge in all matrices, but such an association is tentative in Hunting Creek given the complex nature of urban sources of PCSXs and hydrodynamics in an urban tidal river. The sediment PCSX concentrations correlated with sediment total organic carbon content at all sampling sites. For the most part, the PCSXs showed an enrichment in fish tissue relative to sediments when concentrations were normalized to lipids and sediment organic carbon contents, but the influence of endogenous steroids is also an important consideration for these chemicals.

AB Human-used antibiotics are eliminated from the body with little or no transformation at all. Traces of eliminated antibiotics enter the receiving environment directly since they cannot be treated in prevalent wastewater treatment facilities. Thus, wastewaters containing traces of antibiotics have to be treated accordingly. Lincomycin is subsequently isolated from Streptomyces lincolnensis. Lincomycin and its derivatives are antibiotics exhibiting biological activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and are natural antibiotics in the environment as pollutants. This study aims to predict the degradation mechanism of lincomycin molecule in the gaseous phase and aqueous media. Probable reaction path of lincomycin molecule with OH radicals was analyzed. Optimized geometry was calculated via Gauss View 5. Subsequently, the lowest energy status was determined through geometric optimization via Gaussian 09 program. Aiming to determine the intermediates in photocatalytic degradation mechanism of lincomycin, geometric optimization of the molecule was realized through DFT method. Activation energy for the probable reaction path was calculated, and their most stable state from the thermodynamic perspective determined for the gaseous phase and aqueous media. Impact of water solvent was investigated using the conductor-like screening solvation model (COSMO). The predicted mechanism was confirmed by comparison with experimental results on simple structures reported in literature.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the potential health risks of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in ambient air of different factories. In this study, fifty-five locations were selected and represented eleven type factories, including municipal solid waste incineration factory (MSWI), hazardous solid waste incineration factory (HSWI), sewage sludge treatment factory (SST), medical waste incineration factory (MWI), electronic factory (EF), pharmaceutical factory in large infusion (PILI), oral medication class factory (OMC), inorganic chemical factory (IC), organic chemical factory (OC), paper mills factory (PM) and mechanical factory (MF). We found that toxic equivalent concentration of PCDD/Fs (TEQ) ranged from 0.236 +/- 0.198 to 0.48 +/- 0.442 pg I-TEQ/Nm(3) in 11 kinds of factories, and average value of TEQs in 11 factories were lower than atmospheric PCDD/F standard (0.6 pg I-TEQ/m3) announced in Japan, and the mean values of TEQ in ambient air of factories were in the decreasing order of MWI > MSWI > PILI > MF > OC > SST > HSWI > OMC > PM > EF > IC. In addition, lifetime average daily doses (LADDs) and their resultant excess cancer risks (ECRs) for workers in those factories were calculated. The results suggested that potential health risk might be occurred in those ambient air. Copyright (C) 2016 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.

AB Pharmaceuticals of different therapeutic classes are found in the environment. Captopril is used worldwide as an antihypertensive drug, and it has been found in the influent, effluent and secondary sludge of wastewater treatment plants. Advanced oxidation processes, such as direct photolysis (UV-C) and heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO2/UV-C), are alternatives to enhance mineralisation of pharmaceuticals and their removal during water treatment. In this article, it was evaluated the degradation of captopril in aqueous solution induced by UV-C and TiO2/UV-C systems. The process focused on the identification and monitoring of the by-products formed under these conditions by applying direct-infusion electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode (ESI(-)-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC/HRMS). To evaluate the by-products toxicity, acute ecotoxicity tests were performed with the crustacean Artemia salina, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated with (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using HepG2 cells. It was observed by ESI(-)-HRMS that after 120 min of light exposure, there was almost complete removal of captopril, with 93.5% removal efficiency during photolysis and 99.9% during photocatalysis. At these conditions, the rate of mineralisation, by total organic carbon (TOC), was only 2.92% for photolysis and 9.09% for photocatalysis, evidencing the formation of degradation by-products. Nine by-products of captopril photodegradation were identified, and their respective chemical structure elucidations were proposed. The treated samples were nontoxic to A. salina and HepG2 cells, indicating that both oxidative treatments (photocatalytic or photolytic processes) can be conveniently employed to remove captopril from aqueous media.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the pollutant removal efficiency of different types of wastewaters by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). A laboratory-scale SBR was used to treat sewage, medical wastewater and industrial wastewater. The effects of different conditions of aeration, stirring and settling on the efficiency of pollutants removal were explored to optimize the performance, especially for the removal of organic matter (COD), ammonia nitrogen(NH4+-N), total nitrogen(TN) and total phosphorus(TP) of different types of polluted water. From the results it was showed that when aeration 6 hours, stirring 4 hours and settling 2 hours in SBR, the removal rates of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus of domestic sewage were 93%, 98% and 83%, respectively; when aeration 5 hours, stirring 5 hours and settling 1 hour in the SBR, the removal rates of COD and nitrogen of pharmaceutical wastewater were 83% and 90%, respectively; when aeration 4 hours, stirring 4 hours and settling 1 hour in the SBR, removal rates of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus of industrial wastewater were 97%, 93% and 97%, respectively.

AB Some pollutants can be resistant to wastewater treatment, hence becoming a risk to aquatic and terrestrial biota even at the very low concentrations (ng L-1-mu g L-1) they are commonly found at. Tertiary treatments are used for micropollutant removal but little is known about the ecotoxicity of the treated effluent. In this study, a municipal secondary effluent was treated by a solar photo-Fenton reactor at initial neutral pH in a raceway pond reactor, and ecotoxicity was evaluated before and after micropollutant removal. Thirty-nine micropollutants were identified in the secondary effluent, mainly pharmaceuticals, with a total concentration of approximate to 80 mu g L-1. After treatment, 99 % microcontaminant degradation was reached. As for ecotoxicity reduction, the assayed organisms showed the following sensitivity levels: Tetrahymena thermophila > Daphnia magna > Lactuca sativa > Spirodela polyrhiza approximate to Vibrio fischeri. The initial effluent showed an inhibitory effect of 40 % for T. thermophila and 20 % for D. magna. After 20 min of photo-Fenton treatment, no toxic effect was observed for T. thermophila and toxicity dropped to 5 % for D. magna.

AB Integration of conventional wastewater treatments with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has become of great interest to remove pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from wastewater. However, application of these technologies generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may reach superficial waters through effluents from sewage treatment plants. The main objective of the present study was to elucidate if ROS present in real effluents after biological and then chemical (single ozonation, solar photolytic ozonation, solar photocatalytic ozonation (TiO2, Fe3O4) and solar photocatalytic oxidation (TiO2)) treatments induce oxidative stress in Daphnia magna. For this, the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and the level of lipid peroxidation were determined in Daphnia. The results of oxidative stress biomarkers studied suggest that D. magna is able to cope with the superoxide ion radical (O-2 center dot(-)) present in the treated effluent due to single ozonation by mainly inducing the antioxidant activity superoxide dismutase, thus preventing lipid peroxidation. Lethal effects (measured in terms of immobility) were not observed in these organisms after exposure to any solution. Therefore, in order to probe the ecological efficiency of urban wastewater treatments, studies on lethal and sublethal effects in D. magna would be advisable.

AB The objectives of the research are to determine the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water and groundwater in the Republic of Serbia and to identify significant effects of river-water purification through riverbank filtration, concerning oxic conditions and hydrogeological conditions of alluvial aquifers in Serbia. Between 2009 and 2015, a total of 19 studied pharmaceuticals and metabolites were analyzed in 184 samples, 10 were detected in surface water, and 8 in groundwater. Carbamazepine and metamizole metabolites N-acetyl-4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAA) and N-formyl-4-amino-antipyrine (4-FAA) have the highest frequency of occurrence in surface water (57.3-68.8 %) and in groundwater (19.5-43.9 %), respectively. Highest detected concentrations were for 4-AAA (520 ng/L) and 4-FAA (248 ng/L) in surface water as well as in groundwater (4-AAA 128 ng/L and 4-FAA 150 ng/L). Results showed that riverbank filtration sites with different hydrogeological and oxic conditions could significantly remove investigated pharmaceuticals. Percentage of removal during riverbank filtration was determined for carbamazepine (65.4 %), trimethoprim (100 %), 4-AAA (91.2 %), and 4-FAA (70 %) for all investigated locations. Based on the available data for three specific locations (Danube River alluvion, Sava River alluvion, and Velika Morava River alluvion), results showed that besides oxic conditions, residence time of groundwater in alluvial aquifer and ratio of infiltrated water from river to the well play very important role in the quality of groundwater. These results are extremely important for better understanding of self-purification potential of alluvial aquifers and protection from potential impacts of anthropogenic pollution to the groundwater sources in the Republic of Serbia.

AB In this study, the analytical method optimization for analysis of (beta-blockers including metoprolol (MET), propranolol (PRO), atenolol (ATE), sotalol (STL), timolol (TML) in wastewater were carried out. The effect of various parameters such as sample volume, pH, concentration, matrix and pre-treatment procedure was studied in order to find out the optimum conditions for their determination in SPE system. The presence of the compounds in Konya urban wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent samples was investigated and the eco-toxicological risk assessment was carried out. The extraction of the samples was performed with SPE system using Oasis HLB cartridges. The concentrations of the target compounds were determined using a liquid chromatograph equipped with MS-MS detector. STL, ATE, MET, PRO, TML were determined in the range of 43.5-468, 278-465, 28.3-92, <d1-18, 58-86 ng/L in influent wastewater samples while STL, ATE, MET, PRO were determined as 30.4-44, 163276, 81.8-136, 3.3-34 ng/L in effluent samples, respectively. TML compound was not detected in effluent samples. The hazard quotient (HQ) for determined P-blocker compounds were calculated according to EU guidelines. PNEC values were derived from the available aquatic toxicity data using three different species (algae, crustaceans and fish) from different tropic levels. The HQ values for MET, PRO, STL and ATE compounds were determined below 0.1 which means insignificant risk to aquatic organisms.

AB Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) have gained increased notoriety due to their continued detection in environmental media and consequently their threat to human and animal health. The continuing spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the environment is of growing environmental and public health concern, making it difficult to treat harmful resistant diseases. This paper examines the presence of antibiotics, ARB, and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments; the effectiveness of current water treatment strategies to remove them; and risk assessment methods available that can be used to evaluate the risk from antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs have been reported at varying levels in wastewater treatment plants, hospital wastewater, irrigation water, recreational water, and drinking water. There are many different water treatments capable of reducing antibiotic resistance (including chlorination, UV, and ozone); however, no onemethod can fully eliminate it with much variation in the reported effects. Risk assessment models can be used for interpreting field data into the risk to human health from antibiotic resistance. Currently, there is no gold standard risk assessment method for evaluating antibiotic resistance. Methods in this area need further development to reflect evolving risk assessment methodologies and dynamic data as it emerges.

AB The pharmaceutical compound indomethacin is not totally removed in wastewater treatment plants, whose effluents flow into aquatic environments; concentrations in the 0.1-100 ng/L range are commonly found in surface waters, and its fate is unknown. Here, biological, photochemical and thermal degradation assays were conducted under stress and non-stress conditions to estimate its degradation rate in riverwater and establish its degradation products over time. The results revealed that direct sunlight irradiation promoted the complete degradation of indomethacin (2 mu g/L) in less than 6 hr, but indomethacin was detected over a period of 4 months when water was kept under the natural day-night cycle and the exposure to sunlight was partially limited, as occurs inside a body of water. The biological degradation in water was negligible, while the hydrolysis at pH 7.8 was slow. Residues were monitored by ultra-pressure liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight/mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction, and six degradation products were found; their structures were proposed based on the molecular formulae and fragmentation observed in high-resolution tandem mass spectra. 4-Chlorobenzoic and 2-acetamido-5-methoxybenzoic acids were the long-term transformation products, persisting for at least 30 weeks in water kept under non-stress conditions. Furthermore, the degradation in the presence of sediment was also monitored over time, with some differences being noted. The adsorption coefficients of indomethacin and degradation products on river sediment were calculated; long-term degradation products did not have significant adsorption to sediment.

AB Erythromycin (ERY), a widely used antibiotic, has recently been detected in municipal secondary effluents and poses serious threats to human health during wastewater reusing. In this study, the removal, fate, and degradation pathway of ERY in secondary effluent during soil aquifer treatment was evaluated via laboratory-scale SAT tests. Up to a 92.9% reduction of ERY in synthetic secondary effluent was observed in 1.0 m depth column system, which decreased to 64.7% when recharged with wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent. XRD-fractionation results demonstrated that the transphilic acid and hydrophobic acid fractions in secondary effluent compete for the adsorption sites of the packed soil and lead to a declined ERY removal. Moreover, aerobic biodegradation was the predominant role for ERY removal, contributing more than 60% reduction of ERY when recharged with synthetic secondary effluent. Destruction of 14-member macrocyclic lactone ring and breakdown of two cyclic sugars (L-cladinose and D-desosamine) were main removal pathways for ERY degradation, and produced six new intermediates.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals pose a challenge for water and wastewater treatment because they exist at very low concentrations in the presence of substances at much higher concentrations competing for adsorption sites. Sub-micron sized resin particles (approximately 300 nm in diameter) (SMR) were tested to evaluate their potential as a treatment for EDCs including: 17-beta estradiol (E2), 17-alpha ethinylestradiol (EE2), estrone (E1), bisphenol A (BPA), and diethylstilbestrol (DES) as well as 12 pharmaceuticals. SMR were able to remove 98% of spiked E2, 80% of EE2, 87% of BPA, and up to 97% of DES from water. For a 0.5 ppm mixture of E2, EE2, E1, BPA and DES, the minimum removal was 24% (E2) and the maximum was 49% (DES). They were also able to remove the pharmaceuticals from deionized water and wastewater. Overall, SMR are a promising advanced treatment for removal of both EDCs and pharmaceuticals.

AB Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Consequently, these compounds are frequently identified in global waterways where they may pose a hazard to aquatic biota. Evidence demonstrates these compounds to be capable of influencing the behaviour of fish, but the relevance of many reported behavioural endpoints is unclear and the value of some findings has been questioned. Since these compounds act on neuroendocrine-mediated pathways in vertebrates, the present study explored how exposure to two representative SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and an SNRI (venlafaxine) affect circadian rhythms in fish. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L concentrations of these compounds individually and when present as a full mixture, for a period of one week. Neither fluoxetine nor sertraline had an impact on diurnal activity patterns when fish were exposed to these compounds alone at any concentration, whereas venlafaxine significantly disrupted normal circadian rhythmicity but only at 100 mu g/L. When fish were exposed to the full mixture, significantly altered diurnal activity patterns were rapidly observed at nominal concentrations of 1 and 100 mu g/L, but there was no effect at 10 mu g/L. This sort of non-monotonic dose relationship is not altogether unusual for fish exposed to antidepressants, but it poses a problem when attempting to evaluate potential risks to the aquatic environment. To evaluate the possibility for misinterpretation when collecting behavioural data over short temporal scales, the data for each day of the experiment was analysed separately. The outcomes demonstrate the importance of longer periods of data collection, which may be necessary to capture the full range of natural behavioural variability that exists both amongst and within individual fish. More importantly, these findings may help reveal why discrepancies are commonly being reported in the literature with regards behavioural effects in fish exposed to antidepressants. It is thus suggested that research be aimed at documenting behavioural variability in fish species used in toxicity testing, to establish guidelines for quality control and where possible inform the development of standardised methodologies so that behavioural analysis can be more appropriately applied to the broad field of aquatic toxicology.

AB An adsorptive differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry method has been developed for determining the presence of sulfadiazine drugs. The method is based upon the adsorptive collection of the drug on a hanging mercury dropping electrode at -1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Factors affecting the stripping performance such as, pH, accumulation time and potential, sweep rate were critically studied. The optimum conditions were achieved in a Britton-Robinson buffer of pH 5-6. At the optimal conditions, the cathodic stripping current of the drug at -1.0 V versus concentrations was linear in the concentration range -. The lower limit of detection and quantification of the drug were and , respectively. The method was successfully applied for the determination of industrial wastewater, pure form ( %) and drug formulations ( %). The method was validated by comparison with the standard HPLC and the reported methods. The method offers a simple system, coupled with good reproducibility, accuracy, ruggedness, and cost-effectiveness.

AB Visible light-induced photocatalysis is potentially advantageous and could be an efficient approach to degrade contaminants because it can be used to selectively target specific wavelength for decomposition of organic contaminants in water and wastewater. This study demonstrates the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) using [Pt(3,3'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bpy)(1,2-benzenedithiolate)] (Complex 1)-sensitized and [Pt(4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bpy)(1,2-benzenedithiolate)] (Complex 2)-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2) under blue or yellow light (420 or 580 nm, respectively) irradiation in water. The Complex 1-sensitized TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation of SMX reached almost 100 % removal under 420 nm irradiation for 3 h in water. In addition, the formation of hydroxyl radicals can be facilitated by bubbling O-2 during the photodegradation in which an effective decomposition of SMX was observed. Based on HPLC and UV-Vis studies of the decomposed products, it was found that SMX underwent cleavage of aromatic rings during the photodegradation process.

AB Pharmaceutical products (PPs) belong to emerging contaminants that may accumulate along with other chemical pollutants in wastewaters (WWs) entering industrial and/or urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In the present study, the technique of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-HRMS) was applied for the analysis of 24 multi-class PPs in WW samples collected at different technological stages of Daugavgriva WWTP located in Riga, Latvia. Caffeine and acetaminophen levels in the range of 7,570-11,403 ng/L and 810-1,883 ng/L, respectively, were the predominant compounds among 19 PPs determined in the WW. The results indicate that aerobic digestion in biological ponds was insufficiently effective to degrade most of the PPs (reduction efficiency <0-50.0%) with the exception of four PPs that showed degradation efficiency varying from 55.0 to 99.9%. Tests of short-term chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis for PP degradation in WW samples were performed, and the results reflected the complexity of different degradation mechanisms and physicochemical transformations of PPs. The toxicological studies of WW impact on Daphnia magna indicated gradual reduction of the total toxicity through the treatment stages at the WWTP.

AB Research addressing the occurrence, fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, primarily due to the development of improved chemical analysis methods. Significant research gaps still remain, however, including a lack of longer term, repeated monitoring of rivers, determination of temporal and spatial changes in pharmaceutical concentrations, and inputs from sources other than wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). In addressing these gaps it was found that the five pharmaceuticals studied were routinely (51-94% of the time) present in effluents and receiving waters at concentrations ranging from single ng to mu g L-1. Mean concentrations were in the tens to hundreds ng L-1 range and CSOs appear to be a significant source of pharmaceuticals to water courses in addition to WWTPs. Receiving water concentrations varied throughout the day although there were no pronounced peaks at particular times. Similarly, concentrations varied throughout the year although no consistent patterns were observed. No dissipation of the study compounds was found over a 5 km length of river despite no other known inputs to the river. In conclusion, pharmaceuticals are routinely present in semi-rural and urban rivers and require management alongside more traditional pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to remove 31 pharmaceuticals was surveyed during seven sampling campaigns at four horizontal flow constructed wetlands in rural areas of the Czech Republic. The constructed wetlands involved in the study treated wastewater from 55 to 248 PE and have been in operation for 10-22 years. A total of 31 pharmaceuticals belonging to antibiotics, antiepileptics, antiphlogistics (NSAID), antibacterial agents, anticoagulants, beta blockers, contrast mediums, diuretics, fibrates (lipid regulators), pain medications and psychoactive drugs (stimulants) were included in the survey. The survey revealed that only 7 substances were detected in all samples of inflowing water (ibuprofen, diclofenac, metoprolol, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, paracetamol and caffeine) and 7 substances were found in more than 75% of the samples of inflowing wastewater (clarithromycin, gabapentin, ketoprofen, triclocarban, triclosan, warfarin and tramadol). Other compounds were found only occasionally and roxithromycin, sulfamerazine and gemfibrozil were always below the limit of quantification in the inflow. The detailed evaluation of the treatment removal was done for 14 substances that were detected in at least 75% of the inflow wastewater samples. The results indicated wide variation in removal efficiency among systems as well as among pharmaceuticals. The highest average removal was found for paracetamol (91%), caffeine (84%) and furosemide (75%). Moderate removal (50-75%) was found for triclosan (65%), hydrochlorothiazine (61%), ibuprofen (55%), clarithromycin (54%) and tramadol (53%). Metoprolol (48%), diclofenac (41%), warfarin (31%), ketoprofen (31%) and gabapentin (14%) removal was insufficient and did not exceed 50%. The correlation analysis revealed only few significant correlations between removal of individual pharmaceuticals and other wastewater parameters. Environmental risk assessment revealed high risk for ibuprofen, paracetamol and clarithromycin in the effluent water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological effect directed in vivo tests with model organisms are useful in assessing potential health risks associated with chemical contaminations in surface waters. This study examined the applicability of two in vivo test systems viz. plant, Allium cepa root based tests and fish, Oreochromis niloticus erythrocyte based tests for screening cytogenotoxic potential of raw source water, water treatment waste (effluents) and treated water of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) using two DWTPs associated with a major river in Sri Lanka. Measured physico-chemical parameters of the raw water, effluents and treated water samples complied with the respective Sri Lankan standards. In the in vivo tests, raw water induced statistically significant root growth retardation, mitodepression and chromosomal abnormalities in the root meristem of the plant and micronuclei/nuclear buds evolution and genetic damage (as reflected by comet scores) in the erythrocytes of the fish compared to the aged tap water controls signifying greater genotoxicity of the source water especially in the dry period. The effluents provoked relatively high cytogenotoxic effects on both test systems but the toxicity in most cases was considerably reduced to the raw water level with the effluent dilution (1:8). In vivo tests indicated reduction of cytogenotoxic potential in the tested drinking water samples. The results support the potential applications of practically feasible in vivo biological test systems such as A. cepa root based tests and the fish erythrocyte based tests as complementary tools for screening cytogenotoxicity potential of the source water and water treatment waste reaching downstream of aquatic ecosystems and for evaluating cytogenotoxicity eliminating efficacy of the DWTPs in different seasons in view of human and ecological safety.

AB Animals living in aquatic habitats regularly encounter anthropogenic chemical pollution. Typically, the toxicity of a chemical toxicant is determined by the median lethal concentration (LC50) through a static exposure test. However, LC50 values and static tests do not provide an accurate representation of exposure to pollutants within natural stream systems. In their native habitats, animals experience exposure as a fluctuating concentration due to turbulent mixing, temporal variations of contamination (seasonal inputs), and contaminant input type (point vs. non-point). Research has shown that turbulent environments produce exposures with a high degree of fluctuation in frequency, duration, and intensity. In order to more effectively evaluate the effects of pollutants, we created a dynamic exposure paradigm, utilizing both flow and substrate within a small mesocosm. A commonly used pharmaceutical, naproxen, was used as the toxicant and female crayfish (Orconectes virilis) as the target organism to investigate changes in fighting behavior as a result of dynamic exposure. Crayfish underwent either a 23 h long static or a dynamic exposure to naproxen. Following exposure, the target crayfish and an unexposed size matched opponent underwent a 15 min fight trial. These fight trials were recorded and later analyzed using a standard ethogram. Results indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of naproxen, in both static and flowing conditions, negatively impact aggressive behavior. Results also indicate that a dynamic exposure paradigm has a greater negative impact on behavior than a static exposure. Turbulence and habitat structure play important roles in shaping chemical exposure. Future research should incorporate features of dynamic chemical exposure in order to form a more comprehensive image of chemical exposure and predict the resulting sublethal effects from exposure. Possible techniques for assessment include utilizing flow through experimental set-ups in tandem with behavioral or physiological endpoints as opposed to acute toxicity. Other possibilities of assessment could involve utilizing fine-scale chemical measurements of pollutants to determine the actual concentrations animals encounter during an exposure event.

AB New psychoactive substances have become increasingly popular across the globe in recent years, which may cause certain public health issues. In this work, sewage-based epidemiology was applied to examine the use of two synthetic cathinones, mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), and three piperazines, benzylpiperazine (BZP), trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), and 1-(3-Chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP), across China. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 36 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 18 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Effluent samples were also collected from selected STPs to determine removal rates. Mephedrone, TFMPP, and mCPP were below detection limits in all the wastewater samples collected, indicating negligible use of these substances in China. MDPV was detected in wastewater at 13 STPs. However, its loads were <1 mg/1000 inh/d at most of these STPs, indicating low use of this substance. BZP was detected at all the STPs examined, with loads typically falling within the range of 3-10 mg/1000 inh/d. No clear geographic pattern in BZP occurrence in wastewater was identified. Since BZP in wastewater may also come from its legal sources, whether widespread occurrence of BZP means widespread abuse is yet to be confirmed. Apparent removal of MDPV by wastewater treatment was low (<25%), whereas removal of BZP was nearly complete (typically >95%). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMP), e.g. pharmaceuticals and household/industrial chemicals, are not fully eliminated in state-of-the-art municipal wastewater treatment plants and can potentially harm the aquatic environment. Therefore, several pilot and large-scale investigations on the elimination of organic micropollutants have taken place in recent years. Based on the present findings, the most efficient treatment steps to eliminate organic micropollutants have proven to be ozonation, adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC), or filtration through granular activated carbon (GAC). Yet a further treatment step implies an increase in energy demand of the wastewater treatment plant, which has to be considered along with OMP elimination. To this aim, data on energy demand of ten large-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with processes for OMP elimination was collected and analyzed. Moreover, calculations on energy demand beyond the WWTP for production and transport of ancillary materials were performed to assess the cumulative energy demand of the processes. An assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions of the processes was achieved, which shall facilitate future life cycle analyses. The results show that energy demand of ozonation at the wastewater treatment plant is dependent upon the ozone dosage and is significantly higher than energy demand of PAC addition or GAC filtration (2 to 4 times higher without consideration of delivery heads). Despite uncertainties regarding the energy demand for production of activated carbon, it could be shown that the cumulative energy demand of adsorption steps is significantly higher than the energy demand at the WWTP. Using reactivated GAC can lead to energy and greenhouse gas emissions savings compared to using fresh GAC/PAC. Moreover, energy demand is always plant-specific and depends on different factors (delivery heads, existing filtration or post-treatment etc.). Since processes for elimination of organic micropollutants are still in a developing phase, future optimization steps shall minimize their energy demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging Organic Contaminants (EOCs) such as steroidal estrogen hormones are of growing concern in recent years, as trace concentrations of these hormones can cause adverse effects on the environmental and human health. While these hormones have been widely detected in soil and groundwater, effective technology has been lacking for in-situ degradation of these contaminants. This chapter illustrates a new class of stabilized MnO2 nanoparticles and a new in-situ technology for oxidative degradation of EOCs in soil and groundwater. The stabilized nanoparticles were prepared using a low-cost, food-grade Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) as a stabilizer. The nanoparticles were then characterized and tested for their effectiveness for degradation of both aqueous and soil-sorbed E2 (17 beta-estradiol). Column tests confirmed the effectiveness of the nanoparticles for in-situ remediation of soil sorbed E2. The nanoparticle treatment decreased both water leachable and soil-sorbed E2, offering a useful alternative for in-situ remediation of EOCs in the subsurface.

AB The Lake Simcoe watershed in Ontario, Canada is an important recreational area and a recharge zone for groundwater resources. Lake Simcoe is a relatively shallow lotic system that has been impacted by urban development, recreation, industry and agriculture. As part of a watershed management plan, six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in this catchment basin were selected to measure the inputs of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) of wastewater origin. These WWTPs were recently upgraded to tertiary treatment for phosphorus removal. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were used to monitor for hydrophilic and hydrophobic CECs, respectively, in treated and untreated wastewater. The passive samplers were calibrated with performance reference compounds (PRCs) by measuring the loss of deuterated beta blocker drugs spiked into POCIS and the loss of PCB congeners spiked into SPMDs over the course of 14-day deployment periods. From the PRC data, field sampling rates of CECs were determined and applied to estimate time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations and mass loadings in mg/day/1000 members of the population serviced. In treated wastewater, TWA concentrations of an antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, the prescription drugs, carbamazepine, naproxen and gemfibrozil, and the non-prescription drug, ibuprofen, were estimated to be in the low (<18 ng/L) range. The artificial sweeteners, sucralose and acesulfame, were particularly useful chemical tracers, with estimated TWA concentrations in treated wastewater ranging from 128 to 213 ng/L and 4 to 33 ng/L, respectively. The steroid hormones were detected only rarely in treated wastewater. Triclosan, triclocarban and the synthetic musks, HHCB and AHTN, were removed efficiently (>77 %), possibly because of the tertiary treatment technologies. Therefore, the mass loadings for these personal care products were all <5 mg/day/1000 people. Overall, this study indicates that tertiary treatment technologies designed for phosphorus removal do not entirely remove the target CECs.

AB Concerns over the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) within the environment have been growing with the advent of more precise analytical methods. The discharge of municipal wastewater has been identified as a significant source of these contaminants, particularly where wastewater treatment is minimal. Here we present results from a comprehensive monitoring regime located around Victoria, BC, Canada. Samples were collected between 2009 and 2016 from a variety of sources including marine water, sediment and biota adjacent to two major untreated sewage outfalls, as well as the sewage itself. PPCP concentrations within the untreated sewage were high, and the sediment surrounding the outfalls showed corresponding contamination. However, this contamination dropped quickly with distance from the outfall such that by 800 m distance most PPCPs were below detection limits. Tissue samples of resident Northern Horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus) collected adjacent to one of the major sewage outfalls showed high single sample concentrations of the antimicrobial triclosan (317 ng g(-1) dry weight), the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (176 ng g(-1) dry weight), as well as the antidepressant sertraline (84.1 ng g(-1) dry weight). Reference stations from around the region showed very low concentrations of contamination with almost all PPCP concentrations being below detection limits. Within the sewage, concentrations were largely stable overtime, with the exception of triclosan and triclocarban which both showed declines over the study period.

AB The astounding increase in the use of pharmaceuticals in the last decade has raised concerns over their occurrence in the soils and wastewaters posing potential dangers to the general public health and environment. Considering the limitations of chemical remediation measures in treatment of recalcitrant xenobiotics, several bioremediation measures are being currently investigated and proposed for removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from the environment. Several bacterial, fungal and plant species have shown promising bioremediation potential with regard to the removal of pharmaceuticals. Varying configurations of anaerobic and aerobic reactors have been utilized for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. This chapter is intended to give a compilation and overview of the various types of bioremediation measures currently being employed or investigated to remove the pharmaceutical pollutants.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent which has been frequently detected in the environment. In this paper, the biodegradation of triclosan after radiation-induced advanced oxidation was investigated. The results show that the removal efficiency of triclosan in the combined irradiation and biological treatment process ranged from 88% to 97%, depending on the absorbed dose, while it was only 54% in the single biological treatment process. The removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) was in the range of 53.1%,-59.2% at dose of 1-5 kGy in the combined irradiation and biological treatment process. In comparison, the removal efficiency of TOC in the single biological treatment process was 24.5%, suggesting that irradiation can enhance the mineralization of triclosan. The dechlorination efficiency of triclosan ranged from 48.6% to 78.4% at dose of 1-5 kGy. The intermediates of triclosan degradation were tentatively identified by LC-MS analysis and the possible degradation pathway was proposed. Based on the above results, the combined irradiation and biological treatment process could be an alternative process for treating triclosan-containing wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB By synthesizing GO-Fe3O4 nanocomposites (graphene oxide coated with magnetite), this study investigated chlorpheniramine (a widely used pharmaceutical) adsorption on magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influences of using the nanocomposite suspension or particles, mass ratios of Fe3O4/GO in the synthesis, pH, and contact time. GO-Fe3O4 was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory. Nano-sized Fe3O4 anchored on GO uniformly, resulting in hybrid structures with well combination between GO and Fe3O4. By fitting to the pseudo 2nd-order model, chlorpheniramine adsorption onto GO-Fe3O4 likely occurred due to a chemical adsorption. The adsorption maximums decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 particles > GO-Fe3O4 suspension > activated carbon. With Fe3O4 changing the surface charge of GO-Fe3O4 suspension, pH variation enhanced chlorpheniramine adsorption on. GO-Fe3O4 suspension. The GO-Fe3O4 particles exhibited a relatively better but slow chlorpheniramine adsorption. More importantly, additional nanopore volumes and surface areas were created in GO-Fe3O4 particles due to low Fe3O4 contents to more effectively capture and remove chlorpheniramine, as Fe3O4 crystals on the GO surface potentially prevented the compaction of GO sheets. These factors interactively affected and determined the approach of using GO for removing chlorpheniramine or other pharmaceuticals with similar molecular characteristics in wastewater treatment.

AB Trace emerging contaminants (ECs) occur in both waste and surface waters that are rich in particulates that have been found to sorb several organic contaminants. An analytical method based on off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was developed for the detection and quantification of 31 ECs from surface water, wastewater, suspended particulate matter (SPM) as well as sediments. Lyophilized sediments and air-dried SPM were subjected to ultrasonic extraction. Water samples and extracts were then concentrated and cleaned-up by off-line SPE. Quantification was realized using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer in both full scan (FS) and MS2 modes. These two modes were optimized and compared to determine which one was the most suitable for each matrix studied. Yeast estrogen screen assay (YES-assay) adapted from the direct measurement of estrogenic activity without sample extraction was tested on filtered wastewater samples. An endocrine disrupting effect was detected in all effluent samples analyzed with estradiol equivalent concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 720 ng eq E2 L-1 for the WWTP-1 and 6.5-42 ng eq E2 L-1 for the WWTP-2. The analytical methods were also applied on six samples of surface water, the corresponding SPM, the sediments and thirty-nine effluent samples from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) sampled over a period of five months (February to June 2014).

AB A biochar supported calcined-Mg/Al layered double hydroxides composite (CLDHs/BC) was synthesized by a one-pot slow pyrolysis of LDHs preloaded bagasse biomass. Multiple characterizations of the product illustrated that the calcined-Mg/Al layered double hydroxides (CLDHs) were successfully coated onto the biochar in slow pyrolysis of pre-treated biomass. The as-synthesized CLDHs/BC could efficiently remove antibiotic tetracycline from aqueous solutions. The coating of CLDHs significantly increased the adsorption ability of biochar, and CLDHs/BC exhibited more than 2 times higher adsorption capacity than that of the pristine biochar (BC) in the tested pH range. The maximum adsorption capacity of CLDHs/BC for tetracycline was 1118.12 mg/g at 318 K. The experimental results suggested that the interaction with LDHs on biochar played a dominant role in tetracycline adsorption, accompanied with pi-pi interaction and hydrogen bond. This study provides a feasible and simple approach for the preparation of high-performance material for antibiotics contaminated wastewater treatment in a cost-effective way.

AB To estimate drug consumption more reliably, waste water-based epidemiology would benefit from a better understanding of drug residue stability during in-sewer transport. We conducted batch experiments with real, fresh wastewater and sewer biofilms. Experimental conditions mimic small to medium-sized gravity sewers with a relevant ratio of biofilm surface area to wastewater volume (33 m(2) m(-3)). The influences of biological, chemical, and physical processes on the transformation of 30 illicit drug and pharmaceutical residues were quantified. Rates varied among locations and over time. Three substances were not stable-that is, >20% transformation, mainly due to biological processes-at least for one type of tested biofilm for a residence time <= 2 h: amphetamine, 6-acetylcodeine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine. Cocaine, ecgonine methyl ester, norcocaine, cocaethylene, and mephedrone were mainly transformed by chemical hydrolysis and, hence, also unstable in sewers. In contrast, ketamine, norketamine, O-desmethyltramadol, diclofenac, carbamazepine, and methoxetamine were not substantially affected by in-sewer processes under all tested conditions and residence times up to 12 h. Our transformation rates include careful quantification of uncertainty and can be used to identify situations in which specific compounds are not stable. This will improve accuracy and uncertainty estimates of drug consumption when applied to the back calculation.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS), two of the most commonly used antimicrobial compounds, can be introduced into ecosystems by applying wastewater treatment plant biosolids to agricultural fields. Concentrations of TCC and TCS were measured in different trophic levels within a terrestrial food web encompassing land-applied biosolids, soil, earthworms (Lumbricus), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and eggs of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius) at an experimental site amended with biosolids for the previous 7 years. The samples from this site were compared to the same types of samples from a reference (biosolids-free) agricultural site. Inter-site comparisons showed that concentrations of both antimicrobials were higher on the experimental site in the soil, earthworms, mice (livers), and European starling eggs, but not American kestrel eggs, compared to the control site. Inter-species comparisons on the experimental site indicated significantly higher TCC concentrations in mice (TCC: 12.6-33.3 ng/g) and in starling eggs (TCC: 15.4-31.4 ng/g) than in kestrel eggs (TCC: 3.6 ng/g). Nesting success of kestrels only was significantly lower on the experimental site compared to the reference site due to nest abandonment. This study demonstrates that biosolids-derived TCC and TCS are present throughout the terrestrial food web, including secondary (e.g., starlings) and tertiary (i.e., kestrels) consumers, after repeated, long-term biosolids application.

AB Sewer pipelines, although primarily designed for sewage transport, can also be considered as bioreactors. In-sewer processes may lead to significant variations of chemical loadings from source release points to the treatment plant influent. In this study, we assessed in-sewer utilization of growth substrates (primary metabolic processes) and transformation of illicit drug biomarkers (secondary metabolic processes) by suspended biomass. Sixteen drug biomarkers were targeted, including mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their major human metabolites. Batch experiments were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using raw wastewater. Abiotic biomarker transformation and partitioning to suspended solids and reactor wall were separately investigated under both redox conditions. A process model was identified by combining and extending the Wastewater Aerobic/anaerobic Transformations in Sewers (WATS) model and Activated Sludge Model for Xenobiotics (ASM-X). Kinetic and stoichiometric model parameters were estimated using experimental data via the Bayesian optimization method DREAM((ZS)). Results suggest that biomarker transformation significantly differs from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, and abiotic conversion is the dominant mechanism for many of the selected substances. Notably, an explicit description of biomass growth during batch experiments was crucial to avoid significant overestimation (up to 385%) of aerobic biotransformation rate constants. Predictions of in-sewer transformation provided here can reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of drug consumption as part of wastewater-based epidemiological studies.

The number of molecules detected increased along the river, with 11 molecules in the source, 15 upstream WWTP 1, 16 downstream WWTP 1 and upstream WWTP 2 and 19 downstream WWTP2. The highest concentrations were often found downstream near the river mouth. Different possible sources of contamination of the Lis river were identified, namely WWTP effluents, untreated wastewaters and livestock production. Nevertheless, the discharge of WWTP effluents appeared to be the most pronounced, given that, in general, it was noticed an increase in the concentration of pharmaceuticals downstream of the WWTPs. WWTP effluents contributed with a total mass load of pharmaceuticals into the Lis river between-470 and 2317 mg/d/1000 inhabitants. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/analgesics were the therapeutic group with a high contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals entering the Lis river, followed by psychiatric drugs and antibiotics. No seasonal variation was observed for the detected concentrations of pharmaceuticals. At the levels detected in the Lis river, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ibuprofen showed to have potential risk for aquatic organisms. These findings show that further studies embracing different environmental compartments (water, sediment and biota) are needed, in order to evaluate the partition/distribution of pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and transformation products in the environment as well as to predict their possible impact to non-target organisms and, in a last instance, to human health.

AB Photoproducts of pharmaceuticals have been studied in order not to overlook their potential risks to aquatic organisms. However, no studies have verified an equation for predicting the fate of photoproducts in aquatic environment (Poiger equation) by field measurements, leaving uncertainties in its practical utility. Therefore, we conducted this study to test the applicability of the Poiger equation to 3-ethylbenzophenone (EBP), a photoproduct of ketoprofen (KTP). Photolysis experiments determined the fraction of KTP transformed into EBP as 0.744 +/- 0.074 and the quantum yield of EBP degradation as 0.000418 +/- 0.000090. Field studies in urban rivers and waste-water treatment plants (WWTPs) revealed that EBP was produced by sunlight, mainly in the rivers, but also appreciably in outdoor primary and secondary clarifiers in the WVVTPs. We developed a model in the secondary clarifiers, disinfection tanks, and rivers by incorporating the Poiger equation, which was effective at predicting the concentrations of EBP in the river waters and wastewaters. Thus, our first trial of verification by field measurements enhanced the practical utility of the Poiger equation, though further study including several photo products should be conducted.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from wastewater using conventional treatment technologies and there is limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs. In this study, we used the "fractionated approach" that accounts for the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate the fate of 26 target CECs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that includes primary, secondary and tertiary treatment steps. Prior, hydraulic calibration of each treatment unit was performed. Wastewater and sludge samples were collected at different locations along the treatment train and the concentrations of target CECs were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The most substantial aqueous removal occurred during activated sludge treatment (up to 99%). Removals were <50% in the primary clarifier and tertiary rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and up to 70% by sand filtration. Mass balance calculations demonstrated that (bio)degradation accounted for up to 50% of the removal in the primary clarifier and 100% in activated sludge. Removal by sorption to primary and secondary sludge was minimal for most CECs. Analysis of the selected metabolites demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and secondary treatments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of membrane-associated molecularly imprinted materials that can rapidly adsorb and separate specific compound has broad technological applications for areas ranging from sewage treatments to biomedical devices. However, issues such as low permselectivity and unstable composite structures are restricting it from developing stage to a higher level. Here, inspired by the bioadhesive technology of polydopamine (pDA), we present a novel molecular imprinting strategy to integrate multilevel nanocomposites (Br-Ag-pDA@SiO2) into the porous membrane structure. The molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (MINcMs) were then obtained through an in situ photoinitiated ATRP method by using propranolol as the template molecule, which was one of the pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). In this work, largely enhanced specific rebinding capacity (48.53 mg/g) and permselectivity (the permeability factor beta values were also more than 9.6) had been successfully achieved, which should be attributing to the creation of high-stability and uniform growth of propranolol-imprinted polymer layers onto the nanoparticle-integrated nanocomposite membrane surfaces. Specifically, the as-prepared MINcMs not only exhibited rapid adsorption dynamics of template molecule, but also possessed excellent regeneration performance. Moreover, when the other PhACs were respectively imprinted, similar recognition selectivity could be observed dependent on the template molecule. Importantly in this case, all synthesis methods were conducted in aqueous at ambient temperature, which was environmental friendly for scaling up without causing pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is a need to develop viable techniques for removal and/or recovery of organic and inorganic compounds from environmental matrices, due to their eco-toxicity, regulatory obligations or potential supplies as secondary materials. Simultaneous phosphorus (P) recovery and removal of emerging organic contaminants (caffeine, bisphenol A, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and oxybenzone) from sewage sludge (SS) was assessed using the electrodialytic (ED) process. The SS samples were collected at the secondary settling tank between May and July, 2015. Different current intensities were tested continuously or sequentially (between 50, 75 and 100 mA), in a 2 compartment cell, placing the SS in the cathode end, separated from the anode end through an anion exchange membrane. After 24 h, between 45 and 55% of P electromigrated to the anode end in all experiments and the application of higher current intensities did not promote significant improvements in its recovery. After 72 h, the best results were obtained when 100 mA (0.21 mA/cm(2)) were applied: 70% of P were recovered in the anolyte and between 79 and 96% of organic compounds were degraded. Still, the obtained anolyte enriched in P was not completely free of organic contaminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the transformation and removal of the atypical antipsychotics amisulpride and sulpiride and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine were selected using a tailored non-target screening approach. In WWTPs, lamotrigine concentrations increased from 1.1 to 1.6 mu g/L awhile sulpiride and amisulpride exhib, ited similar concentrations, up to 1.1 mu g/L and 1.3 mu g/L respectively. It was found that N2-glucuronide conjugates of lamotrigine were cleaved to form lamotrigine. Both lamotrigine and amisulpride were detected in groundwater with a concentration of 0.07 mu g/L. Sulpiride was identified but not quantified. This demonstrates that amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine might be used as indicators for treated wastewater in raw waters used for drinking water production.
   Furthermore, it could be shown that all three pharmaceutical compounds are efficiently oxidized by ozonation, leading mainly to N-oxide oxidation products. No significant removal of the N-oxides of amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine was observed in the bench-scale biodegradation experiments with activated sludge. This indiCated their high biological persistence. Therefore, N-oxides might be appropriate as indicators for post-ozonation as a major technology for the advanced treatment of secondary effluent.

AB In this study, an air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) system at pilot scale is applied for purification of effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A district heating network (DHN) is considered as a heat source for the membrane distillation system. Removal performance of pharmaceutical residuals, specific heat demand, and economic assessments were analyzed on the membrane distillation plant. Almost all targeted pharmaceutical compounds were removed to a very high degree, often below the method detection limit. The heat requirement for the MD process could be sufficiently supplied by the low-temperature district heating return line. Specific heat demands for the AGMD ranges from 692 to 875 kWh/m3 without heat recovery and as low as 105 kWh/m3 when heat recovery is possible. Different approaches to integrating the MD within the DHN system were analyzed; the advantages and shortcomings of each are discussed with emphasis on the MD system's capacity requirement and annual heat demand. The thermoeconomic analyses from this study presented the potential for energy optimization regarding heat recovery and module design improvement of the current MD equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is a concentration process based on the natural phenomena of osmosis. It is nowadays considered a breakthrough technology that can be potentially used for concentrating suspensions and solutions, including wastes such as sewage. The diluted nature of sewage restricts the treatment technologies that can be applied. Then, sewage concentration by FO could represent a habilitating technology enabling the application of a wider range of treatment alternatives. This research studied sewage and pre-filtered sewage concentration by a FO. Thin-film-composite (TFC) and cellulose triacetate (CTA) FO membranes were considered. Results showed that TFC membranes presented higher fluxes than CTA, when operated with clean water and sewage. Filtration experiments were done using sewage and filtered sewage as feeds. Even though differences in formed fouling layers were identified by scanning electron microscopy, observed fluxes were similar. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was done to study the elemental composition of the fouling layers. Results revealed nitrogen contents in the range 10-13%, suggesting a relevant role of protein. At tested conditions, TFC membrane showed little apparent ammonia rejection due to permeation to the draw solution. Ammonia permeation was independent of applied osmotic potential, and was mainly related with the ammonia concentration difference through the membrane. Results show that concentration of sewage by forward osmosis would be technically feasible, and its application could potentially improve energy recovery from sewage. However, main drawback that needs to overcome is a low water-flux, which translates into high membrane requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial sweeteners (Ass) have been used for decades as food and drink additives. ASs are not readily metabolized by humans and are excreted mostly unchanged from the human body and therefore they can be detected in high concentrations in the inflow to wastewater treatment plants. This study evaluates the occurrence and removal of saccharin in six constructed wetlands in the Czech Republic. The results revealed that saccharin was identified in 100% of samples of inflowing wastewater. The average removal of saccharin was only 42.4%, lower as compared to >90% removal of saccharin commonly achieved in activated sludge treatment plants. There was no difference in saccharin removal during the summer and winter periods. The correlation of saccharin removal with removal of major pollutants indicated a significant positive relationship with removal of COD, relationships to other major pollutants removal were not significant. Saccharin removal was positively related (p < 0.05) to dissolved oxygen concentration in the inflow wastewater and outflow values of redox potential. This is the first study that evaluates the removal of saccharin in constructed wetlands and therefore, more research is needed to confirm these preliminary results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the last years, increasing attention has been paid on the presence of antibiotics in aqueous environments due to their ecological damage and potential adverse effects on organisms. Membrane biofilm reactors (MBfR) have been gained a significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology in removing of organic micro-pollutants. In this study, the performance of H-2-MBfR for simultaneous removal of nitrate and chlortetracycline, formation of transformation products and community analysis of the biofilm grown on the gas permeable hollow fiber membranes was evaluated by considering effect of the hydraulic retention time, surface loadings of target pollutants and H-2 pressure. The results showed that the simultaneous chlortetracycline (96%) and nitrate removal (99%) took placed successfully under the conditions of 5 h HRT and 2 psi H-2 pressure. It has been determined that the main elimination process was biodegradation and Betaproteobacteria species was responsible for chlortetracycline degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Migration is an important life-history event in a wide range of taxa, yet many migrations are influenced by anthropogenic change. Although migration dynamics are extensively studied, the potential effects of environmental contaminants on migratory physiology are poorly understood. In this study we show that an anxiolytic drug in water can promote downward migratory behaviour of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in both laboratory setting and in a natural river tributary. Exposing salmon smolt to a dilute concentration of a GABAA receptor agonist (oxazepam) increased migration intensity compared with untreated smolt. These results implicate that salmon migration may be affected by human-induced changes in water chemical properties, such as acidification and pharmaceutical residues in wastewater effluent, via alterations in the GABAA receptor function.

AB The relevant environmental hazard related to the presence of pharmaceuticals in water sources requires the development of high effective and suitable wastewater treatment technologies. In the present work, a hybrid process coupling electro-Fenton (EF) process and aerobic biological treatment (Bio-EF process) was implemented for the efficient and cost-effective mineralization of beta-blocket metoprolol (MPTL) aqueous solutions. Firstly, operating factors influencing EF process were assessed. MTPL solutions were completely mineralized after 4h-electrolysis under optimal operating conditions and BDD anode demonstrated its oxidation superiority. The absolute rate constant of MTPL oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot (k(MTPL)) was determined by the competition kinetics method and found to be (1.72 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). A reaction pathway for the mineralization of the drug was proposed based on the identification of oxidation byproducts. Secondly, EF process was used as pre-treatment. An increase of BOD5/COD ratio from 0.012 to 0.44 was obtained after 1 h EF treatment, along with 47% TOC removal and a significant decrease of toxicity, demonstrating the feasibility of a post-biological treatment. Finally, biological treatment successfully oxidized 43% of the total TOC content. An overall 90% mineralization of MPTL solutions was achieved by the Bio-EF process, demonstrating its potentiality for treating wastewater containing pharmaceutical residues. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB 22 representative antibiotics, including 8 quinolones (QNs), 9 sulfonamides (SAs), and 5 macrolides (MCs) were selected to investigate their occurrence and removal efficiencies in a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and their distribution in the receiving water of the Chaobai River in Beijing, China. Water quality monitoring was performed in an integrated way at different selected points in the WWTP to explore the potential mechanism of antibiotics removal during wastewater treatment. Water quality of the Chaobai River was also analyzed to examine environmental distribution in a river ecosystem. The results showed that within all the 22 compounds examined, 10 antibiotics were quantified in wastewater influent, 10 in effluent, and 7 in river. Sulfadiazine (SDZ, 396 ng/L) and Sulfamethazine (SMZ, 382 ng/L) were the dominating antibiotics in the influent. Both the conventional treatment and advanced Biological Aerated Filter (BAF) system was important for the removal of antibiotics from the wastewater. And the concentrations of selected antibiotics were ranged from 0-41.8 ng/L in the effluent-receiving river. Despite the fact that the concentrations were reduced more than 50% compared to effluent concentrations, WWTP discharge was still regarded as a dominant point-source input of antibiotics into the Chaobai River.

Then, RHB characterized by various techniques including Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. RHB used for the removal and adsorption of toluene from pharmaceutical wastewater. Toluene adsorption profile displayed an initial fast toluene uptake that reduced and reach equilibrium after two hours contact time at which up to 90 % toluene was taken by RHB from water. Kinetic data well fitted by using pseudo-second order models (R-2= 0.99), which representing that chemisorption mechanism. Langmuir equation fitted well equilibrium data at all RHB dosage and maximum adsorption capacity was 108 mg/g. These findings suggest that the RHB is efficient toluene adsorbent and it possess good potential for toluene removal in wastewater treatment.

AB Surface water contamination with current-use pesticides (CUPS) is usually associated with inputs from agriculture. However, there are several urban sources of these compounds, including pesticides used in public spaces, golf courses, and lawns and gardens; discharges of municipal wastewater containing fungicides from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs); and runoff of biocides that are used in construction materials. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used to monitor the occurrence of fungicides and selected herbicides in surface waters in the densely populated urban area near Toronto, Canada. Samplers were deployed in five urban streams, one agriculturally dominated stream, and at five locations in the nearshore zone of western Lake Ontario adjacent to urban areas. Sampling rates for target compounds in POCIS determined in laboratory calibration experiments ranged between 0.03 and 0.65 L/day. For herbicides, atrazine was detected at all sites, and diuron, 2,4-D, and mecoprop were frequently detected. The fungicides carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl were detected at all sites, and a hydroxy-metabolite of the fungicide chlorothalonil was also widely detected. Fungicides used in PPCPs (e.g. fluconazole, climbazole) were primarily detected in POCIS deployed in locations impacted by municipal wastewater. Estimated time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of iprodione and carbendazim in urban streams were consistent with the number of golf courses in the watershed. However, runoff of biocides from building materials may also be a source of these fungicides. Overall, these data indicate that urban environments, as indicated by the Toronto area, have several point and non-point sources of fungicides and other CUPs.

AB Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdansk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdansk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg(-1) (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g(-1) of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.

AB In Latin America and the Caribbean, with a population of approximately 580 million inhabitants, less than 20 % of wastewater is treated. Megacities in this region face common challenges and problems related with water quality and sanitation, which require urgent actions, such as changes in the sustainable use of water resources. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world, with over 20 million inhabitants, and is no exception to the challenges of sustainable water management. For more than 100 years, wastewater from Mexico City has been transported north to the Mezquital Valley, which is ranked as the largest wastewater-irrigated area in the world. In this study, bacteria and pathogenic protozoa were analyzed to determine the association between the presence of such microorganisms and water types (WTs) across sampling sites and seasons in Mexico City and the Mezquital Valley. Our results show a difference in microbiological water quality between sampling sites and WTs. There is no significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons in terms of bacterial concentration, demonstrating that water quality remains constant at each site regardless of whether it is the dry or the rainy season. The results illustrate the quantity of these microorganisms in wastewater, provide a current diagnosis of water quality across the area which could affect the health of residents in both Mexico City and the Mezquital Valley, and demonstrate the need to transition in the short term to treat wastewater from a local to a regional scale.

AB Wheat grains are natural products which grow in the north of Algeria. In this study, they were used as adsorbent to remove amoxicillin antibiotic from wastewater. Adsorption isotherm of amoxicillin on both crude and modified wheat grains with 20% tartaric acid was investigated in batch tests. A model was developed regarding both the kinetic partitioning and the mechanism governing the forward transfer of amoxicillin. Results were interpreted in terms of a two-film theory for flat interface. The percentage of maximum adsorption capacity of amoxicillin was found to be 84% for the following optimal conditions: amoxicillin concentration of 4mg/L, 5min contact time, pH 7, temperature 25 degrees C, and 0.24g/L initial amoxicillin concentration and 150g particle size. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the intraparticle diffusion model were used to describe the kinetic data, and the rate constants were evaluated. It was found that the pseudo-second-order model provides the most adequate correlation of experimental data. The rate parameters of the intraparticle diffusion model for adsorption were also evaluated and to identify the adsorption mechanisms. The adsorption constants were evaluated by using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherm models. The results showed that Temkin isotherm agrees with experimental data better than other adsorption models for the adsorption of amoxicillin. The thermodynamic parameters (G, H, and S) showed that the process was feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic.

AB High-salinity industrial wastewater is difficult to treat. In this study, an evaporation process for use in cooling towers and seawater desalination was adapted to treating high-salinity wastewater under gentle operating conditions. Real wastewater and simulated wastewater containing sodium chloride and glucose were used in this study. An evaporation unit, with an evaporation rate of 5L/h, was designed and installed in the laboratory. Analysis revealed the effects of operating factors on the quality of condensed water, as well as the relationship between the mass transfer coefficient and wastewater characteristics. The results showed that for the selected system, when the inlet air speed was below 2.5m/s and the wastewater flow rate was below 1.0m(3)/h, the total dissolved solids and the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies could reach up to 99.9%. The most significant difference between the mass transfer coefficients of the clean water and simulated wastewater was 30.9% under identical operating conditions. The equation of the mass transfer coefficient considering the density, viscosity, and saturated vapor pressure of wastewater was built to predict the mass transfer efficiency for this process. A case study using real wastewater from a pharmaceutical factory illustrated that the system performed well in practical situations. The predicted mass transfer coefficient agreed well with the measured value. In summary, the developed evaporation system has good prospects for the treatment of high-salinity industrial wastewater.

AB Guadiamar River is located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula and connects two protected areas in the South of Spain: Sierra Morena and Doana National Park. It is sited in an area affected by urban, industrial and agriculture sewage pollution and with tradition on intensive mining activities. Most of the studies performed in this area have been mainly focused on the presence of heavy metals and, until now, little is known about the occurrence of other contaminants such as emerging organic pollutants (EOPs). In this work, an analytical method has been optimized and validated for monitoring of forty-seven EOPs in surface water. The analytical method has been applied to study the distribution and environmental risk of these pollutants in Guadiamar River basin. The analytical method was based on solid-phase extraction and determination by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry. The 60 % of the target compounds were found in the analyzed samples. The highest concentrations were found for two plasticizers (bisphenol A and di(2-ethyhexyl)phthalate, mean concentration up to 930 ng/L) and two pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine (up to 623 ng/L) and salicylic acid (up to 318 ng/L)). This study allowed to evaluate the potential sources (industrial or urban) of the studied compounds and the spatial distribution of their concentrations along the river. Environmental risk assessment showed a major risk on the south of the river, mainly due to discharges of wastewater effluents.

AB The occurrence and fate of five endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), bisphenol A (BPA) and norethindrone (NET) was investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and receiving river (Suzhou River and Yangtze River) of Shanghai. Selected EDCs in WWTPs influents ranged from 1.02 to 3560 ng L-1, which dominated by NP and BPA. Target compounds detected in effluents were from N.D. to 1136 ng L-1, with NP as most prevalent. The removal rates of target compounds varied from negative of NET to 99 % of BPA. Except of NET, efficiently removal rates (> 70 %) were observed in WWTPs. Biological treatment was the major removal stage of selected EDCs in WWTPs. Furthermore, the selected EDCs were detected from N.D. to 424 ng L-1 in receiving river. The correlation analysis suggested EDCs pollution in receiving river might be mainly contributed by WWTPs effluents. The risk quotient of NP (RQ > 1) was higher than any other pollutants, indicating its relatively higher potential risk for the aquatic organism. These results will provide significant background data to future EDCs pollution control and management in Shanghai, China.

AB The mechanisms and reaction pathway of UV photo-assisted Fenton-like degradation of progesterone in water and wastewater were investigated. The reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics for both the dark Fenton-like and UV photo-Fenton-like processes. The reaction kinetics of the UV photo-assisted process improved with the presence of humic acid (HA) in wastewater, due to the formation of Fe(III)-HA complexes which enhanced Fe(II) production by a ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The UV photo-assisted process reduced the amount of ferric required to completely degrade progesterone by 60 % and lowered the activation energy to 42 kJ/mol compared to 104 kJ/mol for the dark Fenton-like process. Complete degradation of progesterone was achieved through a multi-step process involving several intermediate compounds.

AB The degradation of four pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) by ozonation was studied under a range of experimental conditions, including ozone dosage and concentration of target compounds. The concentration profile of the pharmaceuticals and detection of any by-products formed was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. CBZ, DCF, TMP and SMX at initial concentration of 5mg/L each were degraded to below the method detection limit (1g/L) when they reacted with 1.6, 2.3, 2.8 and 4.5mg/L of ozone, respectively. For each parent compound several by-products were detected after the ozone treatment. A number of these by-products have not been previously reported in the literature. Some of these by-products were founds to be quite resistant to ozone up to applied ozone dosages of 15mg/L.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in the environment has been frequently confirmed and has been recognized as a potential threat to the environment. This paper describes an advanced wastewater treatment process based on the electrochemical oxidation of pollutants, and the development of a sensitive analytical method to monitor the analytes in wastewater samples comprised of solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. The analytical method was successfully validated and achieved low limits of quantification (2.5-12.5 ng/L).
   In our survey of some Slovenian wastewater samples, the occurrence of seven compounds from the list of ten monitored pollutants was confirmed and quantified. Bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and metoprolol were determined in every assayed sample, while diclofenac reached the highest concentration (2 mu g/L). Therefore, under laboratory conditions the degradation efficiency of investigated compounds by various electrode materials, including boron-doped diamond (BDD), mixed metal oxide (MMO), platinum electrode, and high voltage sparks (HVS) were tested. The applicability of methodologies was evaluated on a synthetic mixture comprised of eight frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals (bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fluoxetine, imatinib and metopro-lol) and two pesticides (atrazine, simazine). The BDD and MMO electrodes showed >85% degradation in 60 min of treatment for the majority of the compounds, while the platinum electrode and HVS revealed low overall degradation efficiency. In addition, the BDD electrodes demonstrated an operational efficiency up to 70% also in a complex matrix of wastewater samples.
   Based on our observations of the prototype electrolytic cell degradation efficiency of some pollutants commonly presents in wastewaters, one can assume that this new technology could be a viable and feasible option to upgrade existing wastewater treatment plants in order to achieve a significantly greater cleaning efficiency, and to lessen the ecological burden.

AB Thousands of tons of pharmaceuticals are introduced into the aqueous environment due to their incomplete elimination during treatment process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs). The presence of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment is of a great interest because of their potential to cause negative effects. Furthermore, drugs can undergo different processes leading to the formation of new transformation products, which may be more toxic than the parent compound. In light of these concerns, within the research a new, rapid and sensitive analytical procedure for the determination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from different classes using solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) technique in different water samples was developed. This methodology was applied to investigate the occurrence, removal efficiency of 25 pharmaceuticals during wastewater and drinking water treatment, and seasonal variability in the amount of selected pharmaceuticals in WWTP and WTP over a year. The most often detected analytes in water samples were carbamazepine (100 % of samples) and ibuprofen (98 % of samples), concluding that they may be considered as pollution indicators of the aqueous environment in tested area. Highly polar compound, metformin, was determined at very high concentration level of up to 8100 ng/L in analyzed water samples. Drugs concentrations were much higher in winter season, especially for non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and caffeine, probably due to the inhibited degradation related to lower temperatures and limited sunlight. Carbamazepine was found to be the most resistant drug to environmental degradation and its concentrations were at similar levels during four seasons.

AB Water pollution has been a major concern for agrarian societies like Pakistan. Pharmaceutical industries are amongst the foremost contributor to industrial waste. Present study addresses the generation of oxidative stress caused by 2 months exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater in rats and their response to oral treatment with vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. The rats were randomized into five groups (n = 5) named as negative control, pharmaceutical wastewater (PEW) 100 %, PEW 10 %, PEW 1 %, and PEW 100 % + vitamin E. Oxidative damage in rats was evaluated by estimation of the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver, kidney, and blood/plasma. Exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater significantly decreased the activities of T-SOD and CAT and concentration of H2O2 in the liver and kidney and blood/plasma. Exposure to 100 % pharmaceutical wastewater exhibited a maximum decline in T-SOD activity, and activity was reduced to only 63.57 U/mL, 32.65, and 43.57 U/mg of protein in the plasma, kidney, and liver, respectively. Exposure to wastewater minimized activity CAT to 89.25 U/g of hemoglobin, 54.36, and 62.95 U/mg of protein in the blood, kidney, and liver, respectively. Treatment with vitamin E significantly increased the activity of T-SOD and CAT. However, increase in concentration of H2O2 was also observed in vitamin E exposed rats. Histopathology of the kidney revealed coagulative necrosis of renal epithelial cells and peritubular congestion. Endocardium showed infiltration of inflammatory cells and cellular breakdown in some areas. Lung sections exhibited atelectasis and emphysema of alveoli suggesting decline in lung function. The anatomy of the liver was also compromised due to severe degeneration and cellular swelling. The present study concluded that pharmaceutical wastewater induced severe oxidative stress in Wistar rats and ensued in histopathological lesions in several vital organs suggesting its high toxicity. Non-enzymatic antioxidant vitamin E may ameliorate oxidative stress induced by pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB In recent years, cardiovascular diseases were the second most common cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the consumption of drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases is high. So far, there were no such comprehensive reports regarding the presence of cardiovascular drugs in surface and tap waters, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of 30 pharmaceutically active compounds and some of their metabolites, at specific points of the Vistula River and in tap water samples in the Warsaw region. The analysis was performed using the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method, coupled to solid-phase extraction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where the presence of ciprofibrate in the environment was investigated. Cardiovascular drugs found at the highest concentrations (reaching 1 mu g/L or higher) in surface water were beta-blockers, sartans and diuretics. In tap water samples, trace amounts of pharmaceuticals were detected, for almost all target compounds. This highlights their inadequate elimination by the treatment facility used in the Warsaw region. The presence of cardiovascular compounds in the aquatic environment could have a long-term effect even at a low exposure level, since synergy effects amongst pharmaceuticals may occur.

AB The wastewater generated in pharmaceutical process generally contains residual organic solvents (ROSs) which will cause the toxicity and inhibition of the micro-organisms in treating wastewater, thus affecting the treatment effect of wastewater. The aim of this study was to establish a system for the analysis and evaluation of microtoxicity and biodegradability of ROSs in pharmaceutical wastewater. The quantitative structure activity relationship models were used to predict the toxicity and biodegradability; meanwhile, the biological toxicity was tested by the method of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) as well as luminescent bacteria and biodegradability was measured by shaking experiment. The proposed system was applied to predict and evaluate toxicity and biodegradability of toluene, acetone, isopropanol and dichloromethane in pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that the actual measured values fitted well with the calculated values. The microtoxicity of toluene was the highest and the degradation was more difficult. Dichloromethane toxicity was the second highest after toluene and more easily degradable. Acetone and isopropanol were less toxic and had easy degradation. The fact indicated the system was reliable and easy to operate which could be extended to the screening and identification of highly toxic and difficult degradation components in industrial wastewater.

AB We collaborated with 26 groups from universities across the United States to sample 42 sites for 33 trace organic compounds (TOCs) in water and sediments of lotic ecosystems. Our goals were 1) to further develop a national database of TOC abundance in United States lotic ecosystems that can be a foundation for future research and management, and 2) to identify factors related to compound abundance. Trace organic compounds were found in 93% of water samples and 56% of sediment samples. Dissolved concentrations were 10-1000x higher relative to sediment concentrations. The ten most common compounds in water samples with detection frequency and maximum concentration were sucralose (87.5%, 12,000 ng/L), caffeine (77.5%, 420 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (70%, 340 ng/L), cotinine (65%, 130 ng/L), venlafaxine (65%, 1800 ng/L), carbamazepine (62.5%, 320 ng/L), triclosan (55%, 6800 ng/L), azithromycin (15%, 970 ng/L), diphenylhydramine (40%, 350 ng/L), and desvenlafaxine (35%, 4600 ng/L). In sediment, the most common compounds were venlafaxine (32.5%, 19 ng/g), diphenhydramine (25%, 41 ng/g), azithromycin (15%, 11 ng/g), fluoxetine (12.5%, 29 ng/g) and sucralose (12.5%, 16 ng/g). Refractory compounds such as sucralose may be good indicators of TOC contamination in lotic ecosystems, as there was a correlation between dissolved sucralose concentrations and with the total number of compounds detected in water. Discharge and human demographic (population size) characteristics were not good predictors of compound abundance in water samples. This study further confirms the ubiquity of TOCs in lotic ecosystems. Although concentrations measured rarely approached acute aquatic-life criteria, the chronic effects, bioaccumulative potential, or potential mixture effects of multiple compounds are relatively unknown.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses risks to human and ecosystem health. Wastewater treatment facilities are primary sources of pharmaceutical pollutants, but little is known about the factors that affect drugs entering the wastewater stream. This paper investigates the effects of student pharmaceutical use and disposal behaviors and an annual demographic shift on pharmaceutical pollution in a university town. We sampled wastewater effluent during a ten-day annual spring student move-out period at the University of Vermont. We then interpreted these data in light of survey results that investigated pharmaceutical purchasing, use, and disposal practices among the university student population. Surveys indicated that the majority of student respondents purchased pharmaceuticals in the previous year. Many students reported having leftover drugs, though only a small portion disposed of them, mainly in the trash.
   We detected 51 pharmaceuticals in 80% or more of the wastewater effluent samples collected over the ten-day sampling period. Several increased in concentration after students left the area. Concentrations of caffeine and nicotine decreased weakly. Drug disposal among this university student population does not appear to be a major source of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Increases in pharmaceutical concentration after the students left campus can be tied to an increase in the seasonal use of allergy medications directly related to pollen, as well as a demographic shift to a year-round older population, which supports national data that older people use larger volumes and different types of pharmaceuticals than the younger student population.

AB Hydrolysis of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) and dodecamethylcyclohexasilane (D6_silane) and their sorption to digested sludge was studied in batch experiments. Hydrolysis was affected by the type of the compound and the applied temperature, while the relevant half-life values ranged between 0.07 +/- 0.01 d (D3, 55 degrees C) and 48.4 +/- 17.1 d (D6_silane, 4 degrees C). D5 showed the greatest affinity for sorption to digested sludge (logK(d): 3.84 +/- 3.42), the lowest LogK(d) value was found for D3 (1.46 +/- 0.95). Prediction of investigated compounds' fate in a single-stage anaerobic digestion system indicated that volatilization seems to be the major fate in both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The addition of a pre-digester with 3 d retention time would significantly decrease the expected concentrations of all siloxanes in bio-gas, enhancing their removal through hydrolysis and sorption to sludge.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin can be found in soils receiving exogenous organic matter (EOM). Their long-term behavior in EOM-amended soils and their level of biodegradability are not well understood partly due to a lack of methods to estimate their environmental availability. We performed different aqueous extractions to quantify the available fraction of C-14-ciprofloxacin in soils amended with a compost of sewage sludge and green wastes or a farmyard manure contaminated at relevant environmental concentrations.
   After minimizing C-14-ciprofloxacin losses by adsorption on laboratory vessel tubes, three out of eleven different aqueous solutions were selected, i.e., Borax, Na(2)EDTA and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. During 28 d of incubation, the non-extractable fractions were very high in all samples, i.e., 57-67% of the initial C-14-activity, and the availability of the antibiotic was very low, explaining its low biodegradation. A maximum of 6.3% of the initial C-14-activity was extracted from soil/compost mixtures with the Na(2)EDTA solution, and 7.2% from soil/manure mixtures with the Borax solution. The available fraction level was stable over the incubation in soil/compost mixtures but slightly varied in soil/manure mixtures following the organic matter decomposition.
   The choice of different soft extractants highlighted different sorption mechanisms controlling the environmental availability of ciprofloxacin, where the pH and the quality of the applied EOM appeared to be determinant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a commonly-prescribed antibiotic that is largely excreted by the body, and is often found at elevated concentrations in treated sewage sludge (biosolids) at municipal wastewater treatment plants. When biosolids are applied to soils, they could release CIP to surface runoff, which could adversely affect growth of aquatic organisms that inhabit receiving water bodies. The hazard risk largely depends on the amount of antibiotic in the solid phase that can be released to solution (labile CIP), its diffusion coefficient, and sorption/desorption exchange rates in biosolids particles. In this study, these processes were evaluated in a Class A Exceptional Quality Biosolids using a diffusion gradient in thin films (DGT) sampler that continuously removed CIP from solution, which induced desorption and diffusion in biosolids. Mass accumulation of antibiotic in the sampler over time was fit by a diffusion transport and exchange model available in the software tool 2D-DIFS to derive the distribution coefficient of labile CIP (K-dl) and sorption/desorption rate constants in the biosolids. The K-dl was 13 mL g(-1), which equated to 16% of total CIP in the labile pool. Although the proportion of labile CIP was considerable, release rates to solution were constrained by slow desorption kinetics (desorption rate constant = 4 x 10(-6) s(-1)) and diffusion rate (effective diffusion coefficient = 6 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1). Studies are needed to investigate how changes in temperature, water content, pH and other physical and chemical characteristics can influence antibiotic release kinetics and availability and mobility in biosolid-amended soils.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is difficult to be treated efficiently by the conventional biological wastewater treatment plant and reverse osmosis is a solution for this kind of wastewater pollution control. One limitation for RO application in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is the treatment of RO concentrate. This work prepared a Co doped PbO2 anode and assessed the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrates with electrochemical oxidation process using this Co doped PbO2 anode. The operational parameters which have an influence on the electrochemical oxidation of quinoline, including the current density, the initial concentration of quinoline and the initial value of pH, were studied. The results revealed that the electrochemical degradation of quinoline followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics and the optimal removals of quinoline and COD were 100% and 59.35% after 120 min. The EE/O was calculated among all the experiments which showed that the Co doped electrode would greatly reduce the EE/O value. The degradation mechanism and kinetics were analyzed and the intermediates including kinds of organic acids generated during the process of electrolysis were analyzed. This paper can provide a technique reference for the reverse osmosis concentrate pollution control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traces of pharmaceuticals have been classified as emerging pollutants due to their persistence in the aquatic ecosystem. There has been indiscriminate disposal of pharmaceutical waste from manufacturing processes, half used, expired antibiotics as a result of which, huge quantities of bacterial resistant antibiotic wastewater have been introduced into natural ecosystems. In addition, drugs that are not fully metabolized in the body may be excreted into the sewer system. Therefore, treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a global concern. A wide range of treatment methodologies have been developed to treat pharmaceutical wastewater viz., chemical oxidation, biodegradation, adsorption, liquid extraction, membrane techniques, etc. However, adsorption is a promising method for the removal of micropollutants because of its simple design, low-cost, high efficiency, etc. Research has shown that graphene materials can be used as photo-catalysts, adsorbents, and as disinfectants in water treatment. They are reported to be efficient agents against a wide variety of water pollutants, including (but not limited to) organic molecules, inorganic heavy metals, and water borne pathogenic micro-organisms. This review discusses the application of graphene materials in treating pharmaceutical wastewater and explains the mechanism of adsorption. A brief perspective on the future scope of work in the area has also been examined.

AB The consumption of antibiotics in today's world has increased tremendously and as such they are frequently found in effluents, sewage treatment plants, hospital waste water and surface water like lakes and rivers. The aquatic organisms are severely affected due to the presence of these antibiotics. Moreover, as these antibiotics are mostly recalcitrant, biological treatment methods are not feasible. Hence, the present study is focused on the treatment of one such antibiotic called norfloxacin using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The parameters considered in this study include the effect of UV, initial pH of the recalcitrant solution, UV/H2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton process, UV/TiO2 and UV/TiO2 immobilization with glass beads. Among all the processes studied, photo-Fenton process has found to be effective and removed 96% of the norfloxacin. The optimum conditions obtained for the maximum degradation with photo-Fenton process are: pH 3, H2O2 concentration of 200mg/L and iron concentration of 30mg/L, for an initial drug concentration of 150ppm.

AB The occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological assessment of selected estrogenic compounds were investigated at Tunisian urban sewage treatment plant. The influents, effluents, as well as primary, secondary and dehydrated sludge, were sampled and analyzed for the target estrogens to evaluate their fate. All target compounds were detected in both sewage and sludge with mean concentrations from 0.062 to 0.993 mu g L-1 and from 11.8 to 792.9 mu g kg(-1)dry weight, respectively. A wide range of removal efficiencies during the treatment processes were observed, from 6.3 % for estrone to 76.8 % for estriol. Ecotoxicological risk assessment revealed that the highest ecotoxicological risk in sewage effluent and dehydrated sludge was due to 17 beta-estradiol with a risk quotient (RQ) of 4.6 and 181.9, respectively, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol with RQ of 9.8 and 14.85, respectively. Ecotoxicological risk after sewage discharge and sludge disposal was limited to the presence of 17 beta-estradiol in dehydrated-sludge amended soil with RQ of 1.38. Further control of estrogenic hormones in sewage effluent and sludge is essential before their discharge and application in order to prevent their introduction into the natural environment.

AB Sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is a widely prescribed antidepressant in North America. Though sertraline is continuously released from wastewater treatment plant discharge to surface water, effects of aqueous exposure of sertraline on behavioral responses of aquatic animals are largely unknown. Our study explored the effects of aqueous exposures of sertraline on antagonistic bouts and predator response behavior of virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis). Crayfish were either exposed or not exposed to waterborne sertraline and then size-matched for paired antagonistic bouts to determine if sertraline affects the aggression of each crayfish. We investigated the effect of sertraline on responses to visual predator cues and determined whether sertraline acts as an olfactory cue. Our results demonstrate that crayfish exposed to sertraline are more aggressive when paired with control crayfish but, when sertraline crayfish are paired, there is no change in aggression. Attraction response to sertraline in behavioral mazes was also observed, which may represent a maladaptive behavior, and in an ecological context may result in crayfish moving to areas with elevated levels of sertraline. However, aqueous exposure to sertraline had no effect on predator responses of crayfish. Future research is warranted to determine whether such medicine released in wastewater treatment plant effluents produces long-term ecologically important consequences for aquatic animals residing in urbanized aquatic ecosystems.

AB Hospital wastewater contains huge amounts of hazardous pollutants which are being discharged daily to environment with or without treatment. Antibiotics were among the important group of pharmaceuticals considered as a potential source of health risk for human and other living creatures. Although the investigations about the existence of antibiotics in hospital wastewater have gained concern for researchers in many countries, there is only one research conducted in Hanoi-Vietnam. Hence, in this study, investigations have been done to fulfill the requirement of real situation in Vietnam by accomplishing survey for 39 health care facilities in Ho Chi Minh City. As results, seven popular antibiotics were detected to exist in all samples such as sulfamethoxazole (2.5 +/- 1.9 mu g/L), norfloxacin (9.6 +/- 9.8 mu g/L), ciprofloxacin (5.3 +/- 4.8 mu g/L), ofloxacin (10.9 +/- 8.1 mu g/L), erythromycin (1.2 +/- 1.2 mu g/L), tetracycline (0.1 +/- 0.0 mu g/L), and trimethoprim (1.0 +/- 0.9 mu g/L). On the other hand, survey also showed that only 64% of health care facilities using conventional activate sludge (AS) processes in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As a consequence, basic environmental factors (BOD5, COD, TSS, NH4+-N, or total coliforms) were not effectively removed from the hospital wastewater due to problems relating to initial design or operational conditions. Therefore, 18% effluent samples of the surveyed WWTPs have exceeded the national standard limits (QCVN 28:2010, level B).

AB Metformin is the most commonly used anti-diabetic drug in the world. When consumed, this unmetabolised pharmaceutical compound is excreted by the body and eventually enters the environment through a variety of pathways. Based on its high consumption and excretion rates, high concentrations of metformin have been detected in influents of wastewater treatment plants. Metformin and its transformation product, guanylurea, are also expected to be present in other aquatic environments based on their physico-chemical properties. Not surprisingly, guanylurea has also been detected in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. Available information on ecotoxicological effects of metformin suggests that metformin is a potential endocrine disruptor and thus further emphasising the threat this drug could pose to our environment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metformin and critically discusses available literature data with respect to its global use/demand, occurrence, fate and ecotoxicity in treatment facilities equipped with conventional and advanced treatment technologies, and its degradation/removal mechanisms. Final section highlights the existing knowledge gaps regarding its ultimate fate under the natural and engineered ecosystems and identifies some important research areas requiring urgent attention from regulatory makers and scientific community.

AB Today, the presence of contaminants in the environment is a topic of interest for society in general and for the scientific community in particular. A very large amount of different chemical substances reaches the environment after passing through wastewater treatment plants without being eliminated. This is due to the inefficiency of conventional removal processes and the lack of government regulations. The list of compounds entering treatment plants is gradually becoming longer and more varied because most of these compounds come from pharmaceuticals, hormones or personal care products, which are increasingly used by modern society. As a result of this increase in compound variety, to address these emerging pollutants, the development of new and more efficient removal technologies is needed. Different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially photochemical AOPs, have been proposed as supplements to traditional treatments for the elimination of pollutants, showing significant advantages over the use of conventional methods alone. This work aims to review the analytical methodologies employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater in studies in which advanced oxidation processes are applied. Due to the low concentrations of these substances in wastewater, mass spectrometry detectors are usually chosen to meet the low detection limits and identification power required. Specifically, time-of-flight detectors are required to analyse the by-products.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems provokes increasing concern due to their potential risk to non-target organisms and to human health. Pharmaceuticals are used in both human and veterinary medicine and are essentially released into the environment via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from livestock. In this study, 31 pharmaceuticals were analyzed in effluent and surface water upstream and downstream of two WWTPs in the Loue-Doubs rural karstic catchment in Eastern France. Diclofenac (965 and 2476 ng L-1), sulfamethoxazole (655 and 1380 ng L-1) and carbamazepine (566 and 1007 ng L-1) displayed the highest levels in the effluents of both WWTPs. Diclofenac levels were also high in surface water samples 300 and 166 ng L-1 in the River Doubs and the River Loue, respectively, followed by paracetamol (273 and 158 ng L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (126 and 73 ng L-1). In both rivers, the most critical compounds were found to be the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (risk quotient (RQ) from 23.7 to 51.1) and ofloxacine (RQ from 1.1 to 18.9), which reached levels inducing toxic effects in aquatic organisms. This study showed that WWTP effluents are the major sources of the pharmaceuticals, but raw discharges from human residences, pastures and livestock manure represent significant sources of contamination of surface water and groundwater. The aim of this study was to assist scientists and authorities in understanding occurrence and sources of pharmaceuticals in order to improve water quality management in chalk streams.

AB Pharmaceutical degradation in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) represents a challenge since municipal wastewater and hospital effluents contain pharmaceuticals in low concentrations (recalcitrant and persistent in WWTP) and biodegradable organic matter (BOM) is the main pollutant. This work shows the feasibility of coupling electro-oxidation with a biological system for the simultaneous removal of recalcitrant drugs (bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, indomethacin and sulfamethoxazole (BGIS)) and BOM from wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained without affecting the performance of activated sludge. BGIS degradation was performed by advanced electrochemical oxidation and the activated sludge process for BOM degradation in a continuous reactor. The selected electrochemical parameters from microelectrolysis tests (1.2Ls(-1) and 1.56mAcm(-2)) were maintained to operate a filter press laboratory reactor FM01-LC using boron-doped diamond as the anode. The low current density was chosen in order to remove drugs without decreasing BOM and chlorine concentration control, so as to avoid bulking formation in the biological process. The wastewater previously treated by FM01-LC was fed directly (without chemical modification) to the activated sludge reactor to remove 100% of BGIS and 83% of BOM; conversely, the BGIS contained in wastewater without electrochemical pre-treatment were persistent in the biological process and promoted bulking formation.

AB Estradiol is known as the indicator of the presence of hormones as Endocrine Disruptor Compounds (EDCs) in water and wastewater. The entrance of these compounds into water resources through daily liquid wastes of societies as well as pharmaceutical industries, ranching, and pathology laboratories leads to an increase in their concentrations in these resources. Consequently, due to the metabolic properties of these substances they can cause adverse effects on consumers and aquatics. The main purpose of this research is to determine the occurrence and the fate of estradiol as indicator of endocrine-disrupting compounds in drinking water, surface water, and wastewater in Ahvaz, Iran. 17 beta-estradiol was detected in 37.5% of samples obtained from drinking water and 68.75% of samples from the Karun River. In the urban drinking water and Karun River, the mean concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol were 2.96 and 13.66 ng l(-1), respectively.
   In the domestic and industrial wastewater, the concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol were higher than that detected in the drinking and surface waters. The mean concentrations of this hormone in these wastewaters were 57.46 and 70.6 ng l(-1), respectively. The highest amount of 17 beta-estradiol was measured in the hospital wastewater. The fate of 17 beta-estradiol in the slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plant, in which a septic tank, an anaerobic pond, and an aerobic tank were used for wastewater treatment, was higher than 75%. The highest level of removal in the aerobic stage was also obtained by breaking estradiol down to other metabolites.

AB Physico-chemical properties of a galactan exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Weissella confusa KR780676 isolated from an idli batter were studied. In our previous paper, we had reported the isolation and characterization of a linear galactan (containing alpha-(1 -> 6)-linked galactose units) isolated from an acidic fermented food. In this manuscript, we are reporting the physico-chemical properties viz., Colour evaluation (L* 81.79, a* 3.15, b* 15.04), flow properties (compressibility index 38.46%), syneresis, light transmittance (50.7% for 5 days), pasting properties (temperature 64.6 C), texture (hardness 9.876 N) and particle size (549.81 d nm) for the galactan were carried out. This galactan also possessed high oil absorption capacity (5.09 mL/g) with good emulsifying activity (69.4%) and emulsion stability up to 15 days. Flocculating activity of 65.3-81.7% was observed with 0.2 mg/mL EPS in a wide range of pH (2.0-12.0). These functional properties will make the galactan EPS a good candidate for use as thickening and gelling agent and emulsifier to form long-term emulsions in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, as well as for bio-treatment of wastewater and hydrocarbon-polluted environments.

AB BACKGROUND: The nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) is a process commonly used in wastewater treatment to remove ammonia. What is less clear is its ability to remove emerging organic contaminants. This study evaluated the potential of NTF to remove eight trace organic chemicals of concern (CoCs), with initial concentration of caffeine, bisphenol A, benzotriazole, trimethoprim and acetaminophen 1 mg L-1, atrazine 2 mg L-1, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol 5 mg L-1 and N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide 10 mg L-1, using a laboratory-scale NTF system. The impact of initial nitrification rate on chemicals' removal and the impact of chemicals on nitrification rate were investigated.
   RESULTS: The removal efficiency of a recirculating NTF for CoC removal was in the following order: caffeine (98%)> acetaminophen and N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (58.6%)> atrazine (48.7%)> 17 alpha NTF-ethynylestradiol (48.3%)> benzotriazole (42.8%)> bisphenol A (26.2%)> trimethoprim (17.9%). In NTFs, biodegradation was the dominant process. In this study, the removal of caffeine was found to be the most effective, and removal of trimethoprim the least. The removal efficiency of most chemicals increased, except for benzotriazole, with increasing nitrification. The presence of CoCs might negatively affect nitrification in NTFs.
   CONCLUSION: The research demonstrated that recirculating high rate NTF is potentially an efficient approach for removal of trace organic contaminants. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In this study, selective removal of acidic pharmaceutical from aqueous media was investigated. The purpose of this work was to use the multi template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for the selective extraction of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from aqueous samples. A multi template MIP was synthesized using a bulk polymerization method. The performance of the MIP in aqueous solutions was evaluated by optimizing several adsorption parameters. The optimized adsorption conditions were 50 mg of MIP, extraction time of 10 min and a sample pH of 4.6. The imprinting factors obtained for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were 1.25, 1.42, and 2.01, respectively, which corresponded to the selectivity order of diclofenac > ibuprofen > naproxen. Furthermore, the synthesized MIP showed great selectivity to the target compounds in the presence of gemfibrozil and fenoprofen. The data was modelled best by pseudo 2nd order which implied a chemisorption of pharmaceuticals onto MIP particles. Based on R-2 values, it was determined that the adsorption data fitted Langmuir isotherm which meant that the binding occurred on the homogeneous sites. The recovery in wastewater influent for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac was 38%, 69% and 87%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports a new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective recognition to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) by a non-covalent imprinting process. ASA being part of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is also known as aspirin. Due to human excretion of the drug and its metabolites, persistent environmental contamination of ASA occurs. This requires highly efficient sorbents which permit the isolation of such pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In this regard, we synthesized a MIP by a simple thermal bulk polymerization method using acrylamide (AA) as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the crosslinker. In order to determine the binding capacity of the new polymer several adsorption studies using different solvents were performed. Fitting of the data points with a Langmuir isotherm revealed a maximum adsorption capacity of 328.6 mg g(-1) polymer in water at pH 3. It was observed that the present MIP allowed the simultaneous isolation of ASA and salicylic acid (SA), its major metabolite. This is a main advantage as both, ASA and SA can be isolated in a single extraction step. In a further experiment, the adsorption performance of the imprinted polymer was evaluated and compared to the non-imprinted polymer (NIP) and provided higher capacity values for the MIP. To check the ability of reusability, the polymer was loaded with standard solutions for several times and the percentage of removal was calculated after each treatment. Finally, the applicability of the polymer for the isolation of ASA was investigated for river water as a more complex sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fenton oxidation has proved to be effective for the treatment of a real hospital wastewater. The intensification of the process viz. the improvement on the efficiency of H2O2 consumption, by increasing the temperature, is necessary to operate in a single step and avoid high reaction times and the need of large H2O2 and iron concentrations. This approach would allow taking advantage of the heat energy contained in the laundry stream since the washing process is performed at high temperature to assure disinfection of the hospital textiles. In this work, temperatures within the range of 50-90 degrees C have been tested, which allowed an effective oxidation of the real wastewater ([COD](0) = 365 mg L-1, [Phenols](0) = 8.4 mg L-1, [total coliforms](0) = 4.16 x 10(6) MPN/100 mL, 5 toxicity units) with the stoichiometric amount of H2O2 (1000 mg L-1) and a relatively low iron concentration (25 mg L-1 Fe3+). Operating at 90 degrees C, complete disappearance of phenolic compounds and 70% and 50% reduction of COD and TOC were achieved in 1 h reaction time. Time evolution of those global parameters were appropriately fitted to pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, providing a useful approach for design purposes. The main by-products were short-chain organic acids (oxalic and formic), being the final effluents non-toxic. Disinfection of the hospital wastewater was also achieved at all the operating temperatures tested, as confirmed by the absence of coliforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This is the first nationwide survey of emerging contaminants in Brazilian waters. One hundred drinking water samples were investigated in 22 Brazilian state capitals. In addition, seven source water samples from two of the most populous regions of the country were evaluated. Samples were collected from June to September of 2011 and again during the same period in 2012. The study covered emerging contaminants of different classes, including hormones, plasticizers, herbicides, triclosan and caffeine. The analytical method for the determination of the compounds was based on solid-phase extraction followed by analysis via liquid chromatography electrospray triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Caffeine, triclosan, atrazine, phenolphthalein and bisphenol A were found in at least one of the samples collected in the two sampling campaigns. Caffeine and atrazine were the most frequently detected substances in both drinking and source water. Caffeine concentrations in drinking water ranged from 1.8 ng L-1 to values above 2.0 mu g L-1 while source-water concentrations varied from 40 ng L-1 to about 19 mu g L-1. For atrazine, concentrations were found in the range from 2.0 to 6.0 ng L-1 in drinking water and at concentrations of up to 15 ng L-1 in source water. The wide spread presence of caffeine in samples of treated water is an indication of the presence of domestic sewage in the sourcewater, considering that caffeine is a compound of anthropogenic origin.

AB An emissions inventory for top consumed human pharmaceuticals in Sweden was done based on national consumption data, human metabolic rates and wastewater treatment removal rates. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface waters in Swedish river basins were predicted using estimated emissions from the inventory and river discharges. Our findings indicate that the top ten emitted pharmaceuticals in our study set of 54 substances are all emitted in amounts above 0.5 ton/y to both surface waters and soils. The highest emissions to water were in decreasing order for Metformin, Furosemide, Gabapentin, Atenolol and Tramadol. Predicted emissions to soils calculated with the knowledge that in Sweden sludge is mostly disposed to soil, point to the highest emissions among the studied drugs coming from, in decreasing order, Metformin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin and Atenolol. Surface water concentrations in Sweden's largest rivers, all located in low density population zones, were found to be below 10 ng/L for all substances studied. In contrast, concentrations in surface waters in Stockholm's metropolitan area, the most populous in Sweden, surpassed 100 ng/L for four substances: Atenolol, Metformin, Furosemide and Gabapentin.

AB Most river systems are impacted by sewage effluent. It remains unclear if there is a lower threshold to the concentration of sewage effluent that can significantly change the structure of the microbial community and its mobile genetic elements in a natural river biofilm. We used novel in situ mesocosms to conduct replicated experiments to study how the addition of low-level concentrations of sewage effluent (nominally 2.5 ppm) affects river biofilms in two contrasting Chalk river systems, the Rivers Kennet and Lambourn (high/low sewage impact, respectively). 16S sequencing and qPCR showed that community composition was not significantly changed by the sewage effluent addition, but class 1 integron prevalence (Lambourn control 0.07% (SE +/- 0.01), Lambourn sewage effluent 0.11% (SE +/- 0.006), Kennet control 0.56% (SE +/- 0.01), Kennet sewage effluent 1.28% (SE +/- 0.16)) was significantly greater in the communities exposed to sewage effluent than in the control flumes (ANOVA, F = 5.11, p = 0.045) in both rivers. Furthermore, the difference in integron prevalence between the Kennet control (no sewage effluent addition) and Kennet sewage-treated samples was proportionally greater than the difference in prevalence between the Lambourn control and sewage-treated samples (ANOVA (interaction between treatment and river), F = 6.42, p = 0.028). Mechanisms that lead to such differences could include macronutrient/biofilm or phage/bacteria interactions. Our findings highlight the role that low-level exposure to complex polluting mixtures such as sewage effluent can play in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The results also highlight that certain conditions, such as macronutrient load, might accelerate spread of antibiotic resistance genes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An urban net-zero water treatment system, designed for energy-positive water management, 100% recycle of comingled black/grey water to drinking water standards, and mineralization of hormones and other organics, without production of concentrate, was constructed and operated for two years, serving an occupied four-bedroom, four-bath university residence hall apartment. The system comprised septic tank, denitrifying membrane bioreactor (MBR), iron-mediated aeration (IMA) reactor, vacuum ultrafilter, and peroxone or UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation, with 14% rainwater make-up and concomitant discharge of 14% of treated water (ultimately for reuse in irrigation). Chemical oxygen demand was reduced to 12.9 +/- 3.7 mg/L by MBR and further decreased to below the detection limit (<0.7 mg/L) by IMA and advanced oxidation treatment. The process produced a mineral water meeting 115 of 115 Florida drinking water standards that, after 10 months of recycle operation with similar to 14% rainwater make-up, had a total dissolved solids of similar to 500 mg/L, pH 7.8 +/- 0.4, turbidity 0.12 +/- 0.06 NTU, and NO3-N concentration 3.0 +/- 1.0 mg/L None of 97 hormones, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals analyzed were detected in the product water. For a typical single-home system with full occupancy, sludge pumping is projected on a 12-24 month cycle. Operational aspects, including disinfection requirements, pH evolution through the process, mineral control, advanced oxidation by-products, and applicability of point of -use filters, are discussed. A distributed, peroxone-based NZW management system is projected to save more energy than is consumed in treatment, due largely to retention of wastewater thermal energy. Recommendations regarding design and operation are offered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work aimed to compare the adsorptive removal of diclofenac from ultrapure and wastewater by different adsorbents. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out using two different activated carbons (GPP20 and WP70, from Chemviron Carbon) and a non-ionic polymeric resin (SP207, from Resindion). The pseudo-second-order equation fitted the kinetic experimental results and the corresponding k(2) (gmg(-1)min(-1)) determined for the activated carbons was one order of magnitude higher than for the polymeric resin. The equilibrium results were fitted by the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. The determined maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m), mgg(-1)) and the adsorbent-adsorbate affinity parameter (K-LF, mgg(-1) (mgL(-1))(-1/n)) were one order of magnitude higher for the activated carbons than for the polymeric resin. With respect to the influence of the aqueous matrix, both the k(2) and the Q(m) remained the same in ultrapure as in wastewater. Differently, the K-LF showed one order of magnitude higher values in waste than in ultrapure water. WP270 displayed the best adsorptive performance providing 0.00106gmg(-1)min(-1) (k(2)), 315mgg(-1) (Q(m)), and 1.7mgg(-1) (mgL(-1))(-1/n) (K-LF) for the adsorption of diclofenac from wastewater. These results support the practical application of activated carbon for the removal of diclofenac during the tertiary treatment of waste effluents.

AB Information on the partitioning of chemicals between particulate matter and water in sewage treatment plants (STP5) can be used to predict their subsequent environmental fate. However, this information can be challenging to acquire, especially for pharmaceuticals that are frequently present in ionized forms. This study investigated the relationship between the ionization state of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their partitioning between water and sludge in STPs. We also investigated the underlying mechanisms of sludge sorption by using chemical descriptors based on ionized structures, and evaluated the usefulness of these descriptors in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling. K-D values were collected for 110 APIs, which were classified as neutral, positive, or negative at pH 7. The models with the highest performance had the (RY)-Y-2 and Q(2) values of above 0.75 and 0.65, respectively. We found that the dominant intermolecular forces governing the interactions of neutral and positively charged APIs with sludge are hydrophobic, pi-pi, and dipole-dipole interactions, whereas the interactions of negatively charged APIs with sludge were mainly governed by covalent bonding as well as ion-ion, ion-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions; hydrophobicity-driven interactions were rather unimportant. Including charge-related descriptors improved the models' performance by 5-10%, underlining the importance of electrostatic interactions. The use of descriptors calculated for ionized structures did not improve the model statistics for positive and negative APIs, but slightly increased model performance for neutral APIs. We attribute this to a better description of neutral zwitterions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global population growth induces increased threat on drinking water resources. One way to address this environmental issue is to reuse water from wastewater treatment plant. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms and potentially toxic organic micropollutants does not allow a direct reuse of urban effluents. Membrane processes such reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) can be considered to effectively eliminate these pollutants. The integration of membrane processes involves the production of concentrated retentates which require being disposed. To date, no treatment is set up to manage safely this pollution. This work focuses on the application of ozonation for the treatment of NF retentates in the framework of the wastewater reuse. Ozonation is a powerful oxidation process able to react and degrade a wide range of organic pollutants. Four pharmaceutical micropollutants were selected as target molecules: acetaminophen, carbamazepine, atenolol and diatrozic acid. This study highlighted that NF represents a viable alternative to the commonly used RO process ensuring high retention at much lower operating costs. Ozonation appears to be effective to degrade the most reactive pollutants toward molecular ozone but is limited for the reduction of refractory ozone pollutants due to the inhibition of the radical chain by the high content of organic matter in the retentates. The ozonation process appears to be a promising NF retentate treatment, but additional treatments after ozonation are required to lead to a zero liquid discharge treatment scheme.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been widely detected in the aquatic environment and demonstrated to be potential risks to humans and the environment. Understanding emission pathways of pharmaceuticals is essential to the control of pharmaceutical contamination for environmental management. The present study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that non-wastewater pathway is also significant to the emission of pharmaceuticals into the environment. To this end, we compared the actual production with the amount of 12 antibiotics obtained by back calculation from sewage concentrations in Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing. The results showed that for over a half of investigated antibiotics, the emission through non-wastewater pathways accounted for approximately 30-80% of the total emission, varying with individual antibiotics. It was revealed that non-wastewater emission pathways could be of significance for pharmaceuticals emitted into the environment, of which disposed by household waste could be among the most important non-wastewater pathways.

AB Microalgae systems have been found to be efficient for removing microcontaminants from wastewater effluents, but the effectiveness of immobilized microalgae for removing endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) has not yet been addressed. This paper assesses the effect of free and immobilized microalgae on removal efficiency for 6 EDCs by mixing them in 2.5 L reactors with treated wastewater. The experimental design also included control reactors without microalgae. After 10 days of incubation, 64 and 89% of the NH4-N and 90 and 96% of total phosphorous (TP) had been eliminated in the free microalgae and immobilized microalgae reactors, respectively, while the control reactors eliminated only 40% and 70% of the NH4-N and TP, respectively. Both the free and immobilized microalgae reactors were able to remove up to 80% of most of the studied EDCs within 10 days of incubation. Free microalgae were found to increase the kinetic removal rate for bisphenol A, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and 4-octylphenol (25%, 159%, and 41%, respectively). Immobilizing the microalgae in alginate beads additionally enhanced the kinetic removal rate for bisphenol AF, bisphenol F, and 2,4-dichlorophenol. This study shows that the use of co-immobilized microalgae-based wastewater treatment systems increases the removal efficiency for nutrients and some EDCs from wastewater effluents.

AB The treatability of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic was investigated using a single aerobic, a single anaerobic, an anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactor system, a sonicator and a photocatalytic reactor with TiO2 nanoparticles in a raw hospital wastewater in Izmir, Turkey. The effects of increasing organic loading on the performance of all biological systems were investigated, while the effects of power and time on the yields of sonication and photocatalysis were determined. The maximum COD and CIP yields were 95% and 83% in anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactor system at an HRT of 10 days and at an OLR of 0.19 g COD/Lxday after 50 days of incubation, respectively. The maximum CH4 gas production was 580 mL day(-1) at an HRT of 6.7 days. The maximum COD and CIP yields were 95% and 81% after 45 min sonication time at a power of 640W and a frequency of 35kHz while the maximum yield of COD and CIP were 98% and 88% after 45 min UV irradiation time with a UV power of 210W using 0.5gL(-1) TiO2. Among the aforementioned treatment processes, it was found that the highest treatment yields for COD (98%) and CIP (88%) pollutants were obtained with the photocatalytic process due to high OH. radical productions.

AB A sequential treatment strategy designed by integrating sequencing batch (anoxic/aerobic operation) reactor (SBR) with bio-electrochemical treatment (BET) was studied to enhance the remediation of real-field pharmaceutical wastewater (PW). Study was carried out by feeding PW to two SBR systems operated under aerobic (SBRAe) and anoxic (SBRAx) microenvironments. Comparatively higher substrate degradation (SD) and multi-pollutant removal was observed with SBRAx (68.69%) in comparison to SBRAe (60.27%), due to the switching of bacterial metabolism that facilitates redox reactions. In order to further enhance the treatment efficiency, the effluents resulting from SBRAx were fed to BET1 and SBRAe to BET2. Relatively higher bioelectrogenic activity and SD were exhibited by BET1 (Voltage: 536 mV; current: 1.21 mA; SD: 75%) than BET2 (Voltage: 323 mV; current: 2.67 mA; SD: 73%). Self-induced bio-potential developed in BET system due to electrode assembly enabled higher organic and inorganic compounds removal than SBR. Study illustrated the advantage of integration strategy in enhancing the treatment of PW with simultaneous bioelectricity generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influence of cathode material on electron accepting conditions during the treatment of recalcitrant pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) was comparatively evaluated at different organic loads (3, 6, 9 and 15 g/l) in three bioreactors. Two bio-electrochemical treatment systems employed with different electrode materials viz., BET-SS (graphite as anode and stainless steel (SS) as cathode) and BET-G (graphite as both anode and cathode) were evaluated for PWW degradation and bioelectricity generation in comparison to conventional anaerobic treatment (AnT). BET-G exhibited high bioelectrogenic activity than BET-SS, elucidating the impact of varied cathode material. High cathode potential necessary for effective reduction at cathode were observed with graphite-cathode than SS-cathode which are crucial for treatment and power generation. Ohmic losses ascribed to electrode material interference were relatively high in BET-SS in comparison to BET-G. Graphite-cathode exhibited high electron acceptance conditions leading to higher pollutant removal along with organic fraction degradation, bio-electrogenesis and inorganic salts removal, when compared to SS-cathode. Placement of electrode assembly while operating BET with different electrode materials is proved to be significant for treatment and bioelectricity production. Efficient electron accepting conditions and high cathode potential in BET-G proved graphite as promising cathode material over SS for the treatment of PWW. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) during treatment are modern, based on available literature. Therefore, such emissions were omitted from IPCC's greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting procedures. However, a fraction of wastewater's carbon is fossil in origin. We hypothesized that since the fossil carbon entering municipal WRRFs is mostly from soaps and detergents as dissolved organic matter, its fate can be selectively determined during the universally applied separation treatment processes. Analyzing radiocarbon at different treatment points within municipal WRRFs, we verified that the fossil content could amount to 28% in primary influent and showed varying distribution leaving different unit operations. We recorded the highest proportion of fossil carbon leaving the secondary treatment as off-gas and as solid sludge (averaged 2.08 kg fossil-CO2-emission-potential m(-3) wastewater treated). By including fossil CO2, total GHG emission in municipal WRRFs increased 13%, and 23% if an on-site energy recovery system exists although much of the postdigestion fossil carbon remained in biosolids rather than in biogas, offering yet another carbon sequestration opportunity during biosolids handling. In comparison, fossil carbon contribution to GHG emission can span from negligible to substantial in different types of industrial WRRFs. With such a considerable impact, CO2 should be analyzed for each WRRF and not omitted from GHG accounting.

AB The oxidation of two industrial chemicals abundant in the environment, i.e., benzothiazole (BTH) and 1H-benzotriazole (BTA) was investigated in UV and UV/H2O2-systems using polychromatic mercury lamp. Experiments were performed in Milli-Q (TM) water solutions of BTH and BTA at pH 5, 7 and 9 and in synthetic wastewater spiked with BTH and BTA pre-treated in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Results showed that polychromatic UV-radiation is an efficient oxidative agent for BTH and BTA abatement in water and wastewater. In the kinetic study direct photolysis quantum yields at pH 7 were calculated as 0.022 and 0.051 for BTH and BTA, respectively, and the second-order rate constant for the reaction between investigated compounds and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) were determined to be (9.5 +/- 1.7).10(8) M-1 s(-1) and (2.7 +/- 0.1).10(9) M-1 s(-1), for BTH and BTA at pH 7, respectively. Identification of transformation products performed with liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry provided information about 6 and 5 transformation products formed during the photodegradation of BTH and BTA, respectively. The Microtox bioassay showed that direct photolysis is efficient to detoxify BTH and BTA in aqueous solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewaters have a high load of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). Fungal treatments could be appropriate for source treatment of such effluents but the transition to non-sterile conditions proved to be difficult due to competition with indigenous microorganisms, resulting in very short duration operations. In this article, coagulation-flocculation and UV-radiation processes were studied as pretreatments to a fungal reactor treating non-sterile hospital wastewater in sequential batch operation and continuous operation modes. The influent was spiked with ibuprofen and ketoprofen, and both compounds were successfully degraded by over 80%. UV pretreatment did not extent the fungal activity after coagulation-flocculation measured as laccase production and pellet integrity. Sequential batch operation did not reduce bacteria competition during fungal treatment. The best strategy was the addition of a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment to a continuous reactor, which led to an operation of 28 days without biomass renovation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two full-scale biological nutrient removal systems upgraded with three physico-chemical processes (coagulation, chemical precipitation, and neutral Fenton) were evaluated in order to determine the removal of emerging pollutants (EPs) present in municipal wastewater from Mexico. Between 41 and 55 EPs were detected in the influents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), including personal care products (PPCPs), antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics, antihypertensives, antiseptics, stimulants, and hormones. Emerging pollutants were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.69 ng/L to 94,600 ng/L. High concentrations of emerging pollutants were found during dry season. WWTP 1, integrated by oxidation ditches and UV light lamps, showed removal efficiencies of EPs between 20% and 22%. On the other hand, WWTP 2 consisted of anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic tanks coupled with two disinfection processes; chlorine dioxide and UV light lamps, for which the removal of EPs was significant (up to 80%). The concentrations of emerging pollutants in WWTP 1 effluent was found within a range < limit of quantification (LOQ) to 3770 ng/L. For WWTP 2, the concentrations of the emerging pollutants in the effluent were below 210 ng/L WWTP 2 showed high emerging pollutant removals, compared to those of WWTP 1, due to a greater activity of the simultaneous nitrification-denitrification process: es, hydraulic retention time, and solids retention time. The compounds that were more persistent with removals below 50% in both effluents were: carbamazepine, dehydronifedipine, meprobamate, sertraline, propranolol, propoxyphene, norverapamil, diazepam, alprazolam, sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, fluoxetine, erythromycin-H2O, diphenhydramine, dehydronifedipine, clarithromycin, hydrochlorothiazide, and albuterol. The application of neutral Fenton reaction as post-treatment for the two effluents from the WWTPs is promising for the removal of emerging pollutants (up to 100%) and for assuring high quality of treated water.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, has been introduced into agricultural soils via irrigation with treated wastewater and biosolids application. Such contamination is problematic because CBZ is persistent and the risks to ecosystems or human health are unknown. The current study examined CBZ biodegradation in two agricultural soils (soil 1 and 2) and the effects on the soil microbial communities during CBZ exposure. The experimental design involved three CBZ concentrations (50, 500, 5000 ng/g), under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. CBZ concentrations were determined using solid phase extraction and LC MS/MS. The effect of CBZ on the soil microbial community was investigated using high throughput sequencing and a computational approach to predict functional composition of the metagenomes (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, PICRUSt). The most significant CBZ biodegradation occurred in soil 1 under aerobic conditions. In contrast, CBZ biodegradation was limited under anaerobic conditions in soil 1 and under both conditions in soil 2. For soil 1, several phylotypes were enriched following CBZ degradation compared to the controls, including unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, as well as Sphingomonas, Aquicella and Microvirga. These phylotypes are considered putative CBZ degraders as they appear to be benefiting from CBZ biodegradation. PICRUSt revealed that soil I contained a greater abundance of xenobiotic degrading genes compared to soil 2, and thus, this analysis method offers a potential valuable approach for predicting CBZ attenuation in soils. PICRUSt analysis also implicated Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae in drug metabolism. Interestingly, numerous phylotypes decreased in abundance following CBZ exposure and these varied with soil type, concentration, duration of exposure, and the availability of oxygen. For three phylotypes (Flavobacterium, 3 genus incertae sedis and unclassified Bacteroidetes), the relative abundance was reduced in both soils, indicating a notable sensitivity to CBZ for these microorganisms.

AB This study focuses on the degradation of pharmaceuticals from a municipal wastewater after secondary treatment by applying various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) like UVC, H2O2/UVC, anodic oxidation (AO), AO with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO-H2O2), AO-H2O2/UVC and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) using either UVC radiation (PEF-UVC) or UVA radiation (PEF-UVA). The municipal wastewater after secondary treatment was spiked with 5.0 mg L-1 of trimethoprim (TMP) antibiotic. The efficiency of processes to remove TMP followed the order UVC < AO-H2O2 < PEF-UVA << AO approximate to PEF-UVC < AO-H2O2/UVC < PEF-UVA (pH = 2.8) < H2O2/UVC approximate to PEF-UVC (pH = 2.8), using neutral pH, except when identified. While the UVC radiation alone led to a very low TMP removal, the H2O2/UVC process promoted a very high TMP degradation due to the production of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) by H2O2 cleavage. In the AO-H2O2/UVC process, the electrogeneration of H2O2 can avoid the risks associated with the transportation, storage and manipulation of this oxidant and, furthermore, (OH)-O-center dot at the anode surface are also formed. Nevertheless, low contents of H2O2 were detected mainly at the beginning of the reaction, leading to a lower initial reaction rate when compared with the H2O2/UVC system. In the PEF-UVC, the addition of iron at neutral pH led to the visible formation of insoluble iron oxides that can filter the light. At pH 2.8, the iron remained dissolved, thereby promoting the Fenton's-reaction and increasing the organics removal. The UVA-driven processes showed limited efficiency when compared with those using UVC light. For all processes with H2O2 electrogeneration, the active chlorine species can be scavenged by the H2O2, diminishing the efficiency of the processes. This can explain the lower efficiency of AO-H2O2 when compared with AO. Moreover, the degradation of the MWWTP effluent spiked with 18 pharmaceuticals in mu g L-1 during AO process was assessed as well as the influence of the following operational variables on the process efficiency: (i) H2O2 concentration on H2O2/UVC, (ii) current density on AO, AO-H2O2, AO-H2O2/UVC, PEF-UVC and PEF-UVA, and (iii) pH on PEF-UVA.

AB Urine source separation has the potential to reduce pharmaceutical loading to the environment, while enhancing nutrient recovery. The focus of this life cycle assessment (LCA) was to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic costs to manage nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (i.e., diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) and nutrients in human urine. Urine source separation was compared with centralized wastewater treatment (WWT) (biological or upgraded with ozonation). The current treatment method (i.e., centralized biological WWT) was compared with hypothetical treatment scenarios (i.e., centralized biological WWT upgraded with ozonation, and urine source separation). Alternative urine source separation scenarios included varying collection and handling methods (i.e., collection by vacuum truck, vacuum sewer, or decentralized treatment), pharmaceuticals removal by ion-exchange, and struvite precipitation. Urine source separation scenarios had 90% lower environmental impact (based,on the TRACI impact assessment method) compared with the centralized wastewater scenarios due to reduced potable water production for flush water, reduced electricity use at the wastewater treatment plant, and nutrient offsets from struvite precipitation. Despite the greatest reduction of pharmaceutical toxicity, centralized treatment upgraded with ozone had the greatest ecotoxicity impacts due to ozonation, operation and infrastructure. Among urine source separation scenarios, decentralized treatment of urine and centralized treatment of urine collected by vacuum truck had negligible cost differences compared with centralized wastewater treatment. Centralized treatment of urine collected by vacuum sewer and centralized treatment with ozone cost 30% more compared with conventional wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The biotransformation of diclofenac during wastewater treatment was investigated. Attached growth biomass from a carrier-filled compartment of a hybrid-MBBR at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland was used to test the biotransformation. Laboratory-scale incubation experiments were performed with diclofenac and carriers and high-resolution LC-QTof-MS was implemented to monitor the biotransformation. Up to 20 diclofenac transformation products (TPs) were detected. Tentative structures were proposed for 16 of the TPs after characterization by MS2 fragmentation and/or inferring the structure from the transformation pathway and the molecular formula given by the high resolution ionic mass. The remaining four TPs were unambiguously identified via analytical reference standards. The postulated reactions forming the TPs were: hydroxylation, decarboxylation, oxidation, amide formation, ring-opening and reductive dechlorination. Incubation experiments of individual TPs, those which were available as reference standards, provided a deeper look into the transformation pathways. It was found that the transformation consists of four main pathways but no pathway accounted for a clear majority of the transformation. A 10-day monitoring campaign of the full-scale plant confirmed an, 88% removal of diclofenac (from approximately 1.6 mu g/L in WWTP influent) and the formation of TPs as found in the laboratory was observed. One of the TPs, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-indolinone detected at concentrations of around 0.25 mu g/L in WWTP effluent, accounting for 16% of the influent diclofenac concentration. The biotransformation of carriers was compared, to a second WWTP not utilising carriers. It was found that, in contact with activated sludge, similar hydroxylation and decarboxylation reactions occurred but at much slower rates, whereas some reactions, e.g. reductive dechlorination, were not detected at all. Finally, incubation experiments were performed with attached growth biomass from a third WWTP with a similar process configuration to Bad Ragaz WWTP. A similarly effective removal of diclofenac was found with a similar presence of TPs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in water and wastewater has raised concerns because of potential environmental impacts and thus their removal is of high importance. The adsorption behavior of chlortetracycline (CTC) from aqueous solution on raw and activated pinewood biochar was studied at 298 K. The effect of initial pH of the solution was studied by performing the experiment at three different pHs (1,.5 and 9). At each pH, CTC showed varied electrostatic charge (+1, 0 and -1, respectively) which affected its adsorption. The results indicated that CTC followed Langmuir isotherm and the related parameters were calculated. Also, it was observed that the maximum adsorption occurred at pH 1. The adsorption capacity of CTC for raw and activated biochar was at least 2.1 and 208.3 mg/g adsorbent, respectively. The characteristics of biochars were studied using zeta potential analyzer, laser size analyzer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that raw and activated biochars are promising candidates for removal of CTC from water due to the acidic character of pinewood that can result in better interaction with ionizable compounds at lower pHs.

AB The elimination of 81 pharmaceuticals (PhACs) by means of a biological treatment based on the fungus Trametes versicolor was evaluated in this work. PhAC removal studied in different types of wastewaters (urban, reverse osmosis concentrate, hospital, and veterinary hospital wastewaters) were reviewed and compared with conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. In addition, hazard indexes were calculated based on the exposure levels and ecotoxicity for each compound and used for the evaluation of the contaminants removal. PhAC elimination achieved with the fungal treatment (mean value 76%) was similar or slightly worse than the elimination achieved in the CAS treatment (85%). However, the fungal reactor was superior in removing more hazardous compounds (antibiotics and psychiatric drugs) than the conventional activated sludge in terms of environmental risk reduction (93% and 53% of reduction respectively). Fungal treatment can thus be considered as a good alternative to conventional treatment technologies for the elimination of PhACs from wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ranitidine can produce high yields of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) upon chloramination and its presence in water resources is a concern for water utilities using chloramine disinfection. This study assessed the efficiency of water chlorination and ozonation in transforming ranitidine and eliminating its NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) by determining moiety-specific reaction kinetics, stoichiometric factors, and elimination levels in real water matrices. Despite the fact that chlorine reacts rapidly with the acetamidine and thioether moieties of ranitidine (k > 10(8) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7), the NDMA-FP decreases significantly only when chlorine reacts with the less reactive tertiary amine (k=3 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7) or furan moiety (k=81 M-1 s(-1) at pH 7). Ozone reacts rapidly with all four moieties of ranitidine (k= 1.5 x 10(5) - 1.6 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7) and its reaction with the tertiary amine or furan moiety leads to complete elimination of the NDMA-FP. Treatments of ranitidine-spiked real water samples have shown that ozonation can efficiently deactivate ranitidine in water and wastewater treatment, while chlorination can be efficient for water containing low concentration of ammonia. This result can be applied to the other structurally similar, potent NDMA precursors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most wastewater treatment processes are not specifically designed to remove micropollutants. Many micropollutants are hydrophobic so they remain in the biosolids and are discharged to the environment through land-application of biosolids. Micropollutants encompass a broad range of organic chemicals, including estrogenic compounds (natural and synthetic) that reside in the environment, a.k.a. environmental estrogens. Public concern over land application of biosolids stemming from the occurrence of micropollutants hampers the value of biosolids which are important to wastewater treatment plants as a valuable by-product. This research evaluated pyrolysis, the partial decomposition of organic material in an oxygen-deprived system under high temperatures, as a biosolids treatment process that could remove estrogenic compounds from solids while producing a less hormonally active biochar for soil amendment. The estrogenicity, measured in estradiol equivalents (EEQ) by the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay, of pyrolyzed biosolids was compared to primary and anaerobically digested biosolids. The estrogenic responses from primary solids and anaerobically digested solids were not statistically significantly different, but pyrolysis of anaerobically digested solids resulted in a significant reduction in EEQ; increasing pyrolysis temperature from 100 degrees C to 500 degrees C increased the removal of EEQ with greater than 95% removal occurring at or above 400 degrees C. This research demonstrates that biosolids treatment with pyrolysis would substantially decrease (removal >95%) the estrogens associated with this biosolids product. Thus, pyrolysis of biosolids can be used to produce a valuable soil amendment product, biochar, that minimizes discharge of estrogens to the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB beta-Lactam antibiotics including penicillin G, nafcillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, and oxacilline in water were rapidly removed and degraded by using didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB)montmorillonite (MT) organoclay. Removal of antibiotics increased with increasing the amount of organoclay added and the amount of DDAB sorbed on MT. Extents of organoclay sorption of antibiotics were represented by the binding constants to DDAB molecules and correlated to the aqueous-octanol distribution coefficients. The degradation rate of P-lactam antibiotics was found to significantly increase by the organoclay sorption. Even under the mild conditions (25 degrees C and pH 7), penicillin G (m/z = 335) nearly completely (>98%) degraded into penicilloic acid (m/z = 353) missing P-lactam ring within 2 h. The first-order reaction rate of the primary degradation increased with increasing in temperature. The activation energy estimated from the Arrhenius plot was 49 kJ mol(-1) and lower than the value (83.5 kJ mol(-1)) in water, strongly suggesting catalytic activity of DDAB-MT organoclay. The applicability to wastewater treatment was demonstrated by using secondary effluents of municipal sewage treatment plants and synthesized hospital wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Municipal wastewaters contain a multitude of organic compounds derived from domestic and industrial sources including active components of pharmaceutical and personal care products and compounds used in agriculture, such as pesticides, or food processing such as artificial sweeteners often referred to as micropollutants. Some of these compounds or their degradation products may have detrimental effects on the environment, wildlife and humans. Acesuflame is one of the most popular artificial sweeteners to date used in foodstuffs. The main objectives of this descriptive study were to evaluate the presence of micropollutants in both the influent and effluent of a large-scale conventional biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in South-East Queensland receiving wastewater from households, hospitals and various industries.
   Methods: Based on USEPA Method 1694: Filtered samples were spiked with mass-labelled chemical standards and then analysed for the micropollutants using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
   Results: The presence of thirty-eight compounds were detected in the wastewater influent to the treatment plant while nine of the compounds in the categories of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, alkaloid and lipid/cholesterol lowering drugs were undetectable (100 % removed) in the effluent. They were: Analgesic: Paracetamol, Salicylic acid, Oxycodone; Anti-inflammatory: Naproxen + ve, Atorvastatin, Indomethacin, Naproxen; Alkaloid: Caffeine; Lipid/cholesterol lowering: Gemfibrozol.
   Conclusions: The study results revealed that the micropollutants removal through this biological treatment process was similar to previous research reported from other countries including Europe the Americas and Asia, except for acesulfame, a highly persistent artificial sweetener. Surprisingly, acesulfame was diminished to a much greater extent (> 90 %) than previously reported research for this type of WWTPs (45-65 %) that only include physical removal of objects and solids and a biodegradation step.

AB Advanced oxidation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in wastewater produces transformation products (TPs) that are often more biodegradable than the parent compounds. Secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was treated using UV-based advanced oxidation (LPUV/H2O2 and MPUV/NO3) followed by biological aerated filtration (BAF), and different APIs and their transformation products were monitored. The advanced oxidation processes degraded the APIs by 55-87% (LPUV/H2O2) and 58-95% (MPUV/NO3), while minor loss of APIs was achieved in the downstream BAF system. Eleven TPs were detected following oxidation of carbamazepine (5) and iopromide (6); three key TPs were biodegraded in the BAF system. The other TPs remained relatively constant in the BAF. The decrease in UV absorbance (UVA(254)) of the effluent in the BAF system was linearly correlated to the degradation of the APIs (for the MPUV/NO3-BAF), and can be applied to monitor the biotransformation of APIs in biological-based systems.

AB The present study evaluates the reduction of antibiotic COD from wastewater by combined coagulation and advanced oxidation processes (AOP(S)). The reduction of Azithromycin COD by combined coagulation and Fenton-like processes reached a maximum 96.9% at a reaction time of 30 min, dosage of ferric chloride 120 mg/L, dosages of Fe-0 and H(2)O(2)of 0.36mM/L and 0.38 mM/L, respectively. Also, 97.9% of Clarithromycin COD reduction, was achieved at a reaction time of 30 min, dosage of ferric chloride 120 mg/L, dosages of Fe-0 and H2O2 of 0.3 mM/L and 0.3mM/L, respectively. The results of kinetic studies were best fitted to the pseudo first order equation. The results showed a higher rate constant value for combined coagulation and Fenton-like processes [(k(ap) = 0.022 min(-1) and half-life time of 31.5 min for Azithromycin) and (k(ap) = 0.023 min(-1) and half-life time of 30.1 min for Clarithromycin)].

AB The present study provides a model-based characterization of the long-term transport behavior of five psychoactive compounds (meprobamate, pyrithyldione, primidone, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide) introduced into groundwater via sewage irrigation in Berlin, Germany. Compounds are still present in the groundwater despite the sewage farm closure in the year 1980. Due to the limited information on (i) compound concentrations in the source water and (ii) substance properties, a total of 180 cross-sectional model realizations for each compound were carried out, covering a large range of possible parameter combinations. Results were compared with the present-day contamination patterns in the aquifer and the most likely scenarios were identified based on a number of model performance criteria. The simulation results show that (i) compounds are highly persistent under the present field conditions, and (ii) sorption is insignificant. Thus, back-diffusion from low permeability zones appears as the main reason for the compound retardation.

AB Micropollutant pathways were studied for the Swist river basin (Western Germany). The aim was to verify the effectiveness of a monitoring approach to detect micropollutants entering the river. In a separate sewer system, water was frequently found to be contaminated with micropollutants. Improper connections of sewage canals to the stormwater network seemed to be the cause of pollution. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) exerted the largest influence on micropollutants for the receiving river. During a flu outbreak, antibiotics in the Swist stemming from WWTPs increased remarkably. Elevated levels of pharmaceuticals were measured in discharges from a combined sewer overflow (CSO). The study showed that the pharmaceutical load of a CSO was significantly reduced by advanced treatment with a retention soil filter. Painkillers, an anticonvulsant and beta blockers were the most often detected pharmaceuticals in the sewage of urban areas. Herbicides, flame retardants and industrial compounds were also observed frequently. On cropland, Chloridazon and Terbuthylazine compounds were often found in landscape runoff. Fungicides and insecticides were the most frequent positive findings in runoff from orchards. The paper shows that a coherent approach to collecting valid information regarding micropollutants and to addressing relevant pathways as a basis for appropriate management strategies could be established.

AB A multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) film coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated, and the electrochemical oxidation of resorcinol (RS) was studied in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer (pH 6.0) using cyclic, square wave, and differential pulse voltammetry (CV, SWV, and DPV). The results revealed that the modified electrode shows an electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of RS by a marked enhancement in the current response in buffered solution. The oxidation of RS at this nano-structured film coated electrode was irreversible and diffusion-controlled. Under the optimum conditions, the anodic peak current showed a linear relation versus RS concentration in the range of 1.2 x 10(-6) to 1.9 x 10(-4) M with detection limits of 4.9 x 10(-7) and 1.1 x 10(-6) M (signal-to-noise = 3) for SWV and DPV, respectively. Moreover, the modified electrode demonstrated good reproducibility (RSD = 2.4%, n = 10) and long-term stability. This method has been applied to the determination of RS in wastewater, and the recoveries were from 93% to 104%. (C) 2012 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study describes the removal of salicylic acid (SA) from water by adsorption using ethylene diamine (EDA)-functionalized carbon nanofibers (CNFs)-containing porous carbon beads (similar to 0.5 mm). Briefly, the phenolic beads, separately synthesized using suspension polymerization, were carbonized and activated. The CNFs were grown on the carbon beads, using chemical vapor deposition, and the prepared fibrous beads functionalized with EDA were used as an adsorbent for SA. The prepared materials were characterized by their physico-chemical properties, including specific surface area, surface morphology, and surface functional groups. The adsorption tests performed over the initial SA concentration range of 100-1500 mg/L revealed the adsorption capacity of the materials to be similar to 682 mg/g, which was considerably larger than that of the adsorbents discussed in the literature for SA. The zeta-potential analysis attributed enhanced adsorption to the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the solute molecules and the EDA-functionalized surface of the CNFs. The material and method developed in this study for the remediation of the SA-laden wastewater may be extended to other acidic pollutants present in pharmaceutical effluents.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to provide new insights on accumulation and possible adverse effects of various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in mussels, Mytilus gallo-provincialis, exposed to an environmentally realistic concentration (0.5 mu g/L) of individual compounds, Acetaminophen (AMP), Diclofenac (DIC), Ibuprofen (IBU), Ketoprofen (KET) or Nimesulide (NIM). The measurement of drugs in mussel tissues was integrated with both functional alterations at cellular level and transcriptomic responses. Results indicated the capability of mussels to accumulate DIC and NIM, while AMP, IBU and KET were always below detection limit. A large panel of ecotoxicological biomarkers revealed the early onset of alterations induced by tested NSAIDs on immunological responses, lipid metabolism and DNA integrity. The gene transcription analysis through DNA microarrays, supported cellular biomarker results, with clear modulation of a large number of genes involved in the arachidonic acid and lipid metabolism, immune responses, cell cycle and DNA repair. The overall results indicated an ecotoxicological concern for pharmaceuticals in M. galloprovincialis, with transcriptional responses appearing as sensitive exposure biomarkers at low levels of exposure: such changes, however, are not always paralleled by corresponding functional effects, suggesting caution when interpreting observed effects in terms of perturbed cellular pathways. Fascinating similarities can also be proposed in the mode of action of NSAIDs between bivalves and vertebrate species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A rotating suspension cartridge reactor immobilized with white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was employed to treat synthetic wastewater containing 1000 mu g l(-1) of the recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compound carbamazepine. The reactor was continuously operated for 160 days under non-sterile conditions. After one month of fungal adaptation, the removal efficiency for carbamazepine exceeded 90% through such strategies as the immobilization of P. chtysosporium on the polyurethane foam cubes (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm(3)), the pattern of liquid/air flow inside the cartridge created through the application of intermittent operational mode, and the gradual cut of external carbon source loading in the influent. Both nutrients and oxygen were effectively transferred to fungi, which contributed to the excellent bioreactor treatment performance for the long-term continuous operation. The bacterial contamination occurring in the bioreactor was effectively suppressed, providing a feasible alternative to treat recalcitrant compounds under non-sterile conditions.

AB An aerobic granular sludge-sequencing batch reactor (AGS-SBR) was fed for 28-days with a simulated wastewater containing a mixture of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) (alprenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, venlafaxine, salbutamol, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine), each at 1.3 mu g L-1. AGS-SBR exhibited the highest removal efficiency for norfluoxetine, with preferential removal of the (R)-enantiomer indicating that biological-mediated processes occurred. For all other CPs, removal was non-enantioselective, occurring through biosorption onto AGS. A gradual decline of CPs removal was observed, probably related to the decrease of AGS adsorption capacity. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD) content in the bulk liquid after anaerobic feeding increased, and P-release dropped, probably because the polyphosphate-accumulating organism's activity was affected. Nitrification was also affected as indicated by the ammonium effluent concentration increase. Moreover, CPs exposure promoted AGS disintegration, with decreasing granule size. After stopping CPs feeding, the AGS started to recover its compact structure, and the system returned its normal performance concerning COD- and P-removal. N-removal seemed to be a more sensitive process, as while the ammonium levels were fully restored at the end of operation, nitrite reduction was only partially restored. Results provide useful information on AGS performance during the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals, a frequent scenario in WWTP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption studies of salicylic acid (SA) and 4-nitroaniline (4NA) from aqueous solutions were performed with magnetic biochar (MBC) in order to train students in analytical techniques such as standard calibration curves, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and chemical separations within the context of wastewater purification. Analysis of samples purified by MBC enhances student understanding of water quality and the importance of potable water production, a growing worldwide concern. MBC was prepared by iron oxide precipitation onto the biochar surface using an aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+ solution followed by NaOH treatment. MBC effectiveness in removing organic contaminants from water was evaluated using UV-vis spectroscopy, Beer's law, and a comparison to standard calibration curves while determining the concentrations of two contaminant compounds. The use of MBC to remove organic contaminants in water highlights the effectiveness of this technique for wastewater remediation and prompt discussion of water quality concerns with undergraduate students.

AB The overall objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of tailored activated carbons in the adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA). The results indicated that the experimental data were well described with pseudo second-order kinetic model. Activated carbon samples (F600-A and OLC-A) tailored with acidic treatment processed better adsorption rates, and the adsorption rates D reached 46.512 and 46.083 mg/g h, respectively. In addition, the roles of water parameters were also investigated. BPA adsorption rate was reduced with increasing pH because of an increase in electrostatic repulsion and a decrease in hydrogen bond interactions. It was found that the adsorbed amount of BPA increased with the increase of temperature from 288 to 318 K. Finally, ionic strength was found to play an important role in promoting BPA adsorption rate by increasing pi-pi dispersion interaction.

AB Source-specific elucidation of domestic sewage pollution caused by various effluent sources in an urban river water, as conducted for this study, demands knowledge of the relation between concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular indicators (caffeine, carbamazepine, triclosan) and water quality concentrations of total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorous (T-P). River water and wastewater samples from the Asahikawa River Basin in northern Japan were analyzed using derivatization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Caffeine, used as an indicator of domestic sewage in the Asahikawa River Basin, was more ubiquitous than either carbamazepine or triclosan (92-100 %). Its concentration was higher than any target compound used to assess the basin: < 4.4-370 ng/L for caffeine, < 0.6-3.9 ng/L for carbamazepine, and < 1.1-13 ng/L for triclosan. Higher caffeine concentrations detected in wastewater effluents and the strongly positive mutual linear correlation between caffeine and T-N or T-P (R (2) > 0.759) reflect the contribution of septic tank system effluents to the lower Asahikawa River Basin. Results of relative molecular indicators in combination with different molecular indicators (caffeine/carbamazepine and triclosan/carbamazepine) and cluster analysis better reflect the contribution of sewage than results obtained using concentrations of respective molecular indicators and cluster analysis. Relative molecular indicators used with water quality parameters (e.g., caffeine/T-N ratio) in this study provide results more clearly, relatively, and quantitatively than results obtained using molecular indicators alone. Moreover, the caffeine/T-N ratio reflects variations of caffeine flux from effluent sources. These results suggest strongly relative molecular indicators are also useful indicators, reflecting differences in spatial contributions of domestic sources for PPCPs in urban areas.

AB The fate of six human-use drugs was assessed and predicted in mesocosms designed to mimic shallow constructed wetlands during the onset of fall and senescence. Mesocosms were monitored for 28 days after the addition of carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine and naproxen (nominal initial concentrations of 5 mu g/L each), sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine (nominal initial concentrations of 150 mu g/L each), with and without phosphorous (P) addition at 1.6 mg/L. We hypothesized that addition of P would stimulate primary productivity and enhance removal of pharmaceuticals from the water column. Carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine, and naproxen had half-lives of 8.7, 11, 1.5, and 2.5, and 8.6, 11.0, 1.4, and 2.5 days in treatments with and without P amendment, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine had half-lives of 17 and 4.9 days in mesocosms with P amendment and 17 and 4.7 days without amendment. A concurrent pulse of P with pharmaceuticals did not significantly enhance the removal of these compounds. Predicted half-lives from modeling efforts were consistent with observed values, with photolysis the greatest contributor to chemical attenuation.

AB The advanced treatment of polluted liquid streams containing traces of pharmaceutical compounds is a major issue, since more and more effluents from pharma labs and wastewaters containing the excretions of medically treated humans and animals are discharged in the conventional wastewater treatment plants without previous effective treatments. Ibuprofen is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which explains why it is found in wastewaters so often. In this paper, the removal of IBP from simulated water streams was investigated by using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at a fixed wavelength (254 nm) and various intensities. Three sets of experiments were carried out: the first to study IBP concentration as a function of time, at different volumes of treated solutions (V = 10-30 mL); the second to explore the effect of pH on IBP degradation as a function of time (pH = 2.25-8.25) and the third to evaluate the effect of different UV light intensities on IBP degradation (E = 100-400 mJ m(-2)). The IBP initial concentration (IBP (0)) was varied in the range 30-60 mg L-1. The results obtained show that the concentration of IBP decreases along with treatment time, with a negative effect of the treated volume, i.e. smaller volumes, such as lower liquid heights, are more easily degraded. Moreover, the higher the pH, the better the IBP degradation; actually, when pH increases from 2.25 to 6.6 and 8.25, the IBP concentration, after an hour of treatment, decreases respectively to 45, 34 and 27 % of its initial value. In addition, as the intensity of light increases from 100 to 400 mJ m(-2), the IBP concentration decreases to 34 % of its initial value. A reaction scheme is put forward in the paper, which well describes the effects of volume, pH and light intensity on the IBP degradation measured experimentally. Moreover, the IBP degradation by-products have been identified.

AB In this study, the solar photocatalytic process in a pilot plant with compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) was performed for amoxicillin (AMX) degradation, an antibiotic widely used in the world. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken statistical experiment design was used to optimize independent variables, namely TiO2 dosage, antibiotic initial concentration, and initial pH. The results showed that AMX degradation efficiency affected by positive or negative effect of variables and their interactions. The TiO2 dosage, pH, and interaction between AMX initial concentration and TiO2 dosage exhibited a synergistic effect, while the linear and quadratic term of AMX initial concentration and pH showed antagonistic effect in the process response. Response surface and contour plots were used to perform process optimization. The optimum conditions found in this regard were TiO2 dosage = 1.5 g/L, AMX initial concentration = 17 mg/L, and pH = 9.5 for AMX degradation under 240 min solar irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation of AMX after 34.95 kJ(UV)/L accumulated UV energy per liter of solution was 84.12 % at the solar plant.

AB Dynamic modelling and simulation of a nanofiltration-forward osmosis integrated complete system was done along with economic evaluation to pave the way for scale up of such a system for treating hazardous pharmaceutical wastes. The system operated in a closed loop not only protects surface water from the onslaught of hazardous industrial wastewater but also saves on cost of fresh water by turning wastewater recyclable at affordable price. The success of dynamic modelling in capturing the relevant transport phenomena is well reflected in high overall correlation coefficient value (R (2) > 0.98), low relative error (< 0.1) and Willmott d-index (< 0.95). The system could remove more than 97.5 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) from real pharmaceutical wastewater having initial COD value as high as 3500 mg/L while ensuring operation of the forward osmosis loop at a reasonably high flux of 56-58 l per square meter per hour.

AB Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous environment could be reductively degraded by using a hydrogen-based membrane biofilm reactor (H-2-MBfR) under denitrifying conditions as it provides an appropriate environment for the antibiotic-degrading bacteria in biofilm communities. This study evaluates the performance of H-2-MBfR for simultaneous removal of nitrate and TC, formation of degradation products of TC, and community analysis of the biofilm grown on the gas-permeable hollow fiber membranes. Hence, a H-2-MBfR receiving approximately 20 mg N/l nitrate and 0.5 mg/l TC was operated under different H-2 pressures, hydraulic retention times (HRTs), and influent TC concentrations in order to provide various nitrate and TC loadings. The results showed that H-2-MBfR accomplished successfully the degradation of TC, and it reached TC removal of 80-95 % at 10 h of HRT and 6 psi (0.41 atm) of H-2 gas pressure. TC degradation took placed at increased HRT and H-2 pressures while nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor for most of the electrons generated from H-2 oxidation used for denitrification. The transformation products of TC were found at part per billion levels through all the experiments, and the concentrations decreased with the increasing HRT regardless of H-2 pressure. Analyses from clone library showed that the microbial diversity at the optimal conditions was higher than that at the other periods. The dominant species were revealed to be Betaproteobacteria, Acidovorax caeni, and Alicycliphilus denitrificans.

AB The main objective of this study was the development of simple multi-parameter methods for the analyses of biocides in various environmental matrices (wastewater, surface water, and sewage sludge) for measurement and monitoring activities. Eight target substances (triclosan, methyltriclosan (transformation product of triclosan), cybutryne (Irgarol), and the azole fungicides propiconazole, tebuconazole, imazalil, thiabendazole, and cyproconazole) were chosen for determination in selected sample sets. For surface water and wastewater samples a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and for sewage sludge samples an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) were developed. The extracts were analyzed by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods (GC/MS), and the analytical methods were checked to ensure sufficient sensitivity by comparing the limits of quantification (LOQs) to the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) of the selected biocides. For quality control, recovery rates were determined. Finally, developed methods were checked and validated by application on sample material from various matrices. Sampling took place in seven urban wastewater treatment plants and their corresponding receiving waters. The results revealed that the developed extraction methods are effective and simple and allow the determination of a broad range of biocides in various environmental compartments.

AB A microwave-assisted extraction method for the determination of 15 alkyl, aryl, and halogenated phenols in sewage sludge and biosolids samples was developed and optimized. The effects of solvent, temperature, time, moisture content, acid, and number of extractions on the recovery of phenols were evaluated. Results indicated that extraction solvent had the greatest impact on the recovery of all phenols while pH had the largest effect on recovery of hexachlorophene and pentachlorophenol. Wet sludge samples were extracted with acetone-hexane mixture in the presence of glacial acetic acid. The extract was evaporated, acetylated by acetic anhydride and cleaned up by silica gel. For dry sludge samples, an optional procedure for the simultaneous extraction and acetylation of phenols was also proposed. Triclosan ( TCS) and the alkyl and aryl phenols in sludge extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) in electron-impact mode while polyhalogenated phenols were analyzed by GC-MS in negative ion chemical ionization mode. Method detection limits were ca. 200 ng/g for nonylphenol, < 25 ng/g for TCS and other alkyl and aryl phenols, and < 5 ng/g for other halogenated phenols. This method has been applied to the determination of phenolic compounds in over 150 sludge and biosolids samples since 2009.

AB High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) offers the opportunity to track large numbers of non-target analytes through water treatment processes, providing a more comprehensive view of reactor performance than targeted evaluation. Both approaches were used to evaluate the performance of a pilot scale advanced oxidation process (AOP) employing ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) to treat municipal wastewater effluent. Twelve pharmaceuticals and personal care products were selected as target compounds and added to reactor influent. Target compound removal over a range of flow rates and hydrogen peroxide addition levels was assessed using a liquid chromatograph combined with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-qTOF-MS). Target compound removals were used to determine hydroxyl radical concentrations and UV fluence under pilot scale conditions. The experiments were also analyzed using a nontarget approach, which identified "molecular features" in either reactor influent or effluent. Strong correlation (r = 0.94) was observed between target compound removals calculated using the targeted and non-targeted approaches across the range of reactor conditions tested. The two approaches also produced consistent rankings of the performance of the various reactor operating conditions, although the distribution of compound removal efficiencies was usually less favorable with the broader, nontarget approach. For example, in the UV only treatment 8.3% of target compounds and 2.2% of non-target compounds exhibited removals above 50%, while 100% of target compounds and 74% of non-target compounds exhibited removals above 50% in the best condition tested. These results suggest that HR-MS methods can provide more holistic evaluation of reactor performance, and may reduce biases caused by selection of a limited number of target compounds. HR-MS methods also offer insights into the composition of poorly removed compounds and the formation of transformation products, which were widely detected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this paper is to help understanding the distinctive influence of the matrix and of the flux decline (e.g. through the cake enhanced concentration polarization (CECP) phenomenon) on the removal mechanisms of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent by nanofiltration (NF). PhACs which are commonly encountered in secondary treated effluent were spiked in various matrix (real and synthetic) to investigate the separate and synergetic effects of the organic and ionic environment on PhACs rejection by two commercial membranes (NF-90 and NF-270). With pure water, rejection of NF membranes is dependent on the type of PhACs and of the permeate flux variations. Then, it appeared that the rejection of PhACs by NF-90 was poorly influenced by the type of compounds, because of the prevalence of steric mechanisms, but rather influenced by permeate flux variations and thus to fouling. For this tight NF membrane, CECP impacts PhACs rejection at the start of filtration while after a dense cake is formed, it became enhanced. On the contrary, rejections of PhACs by the NF-270 were enhanced during the filtration of the real wastewater in comparison with spiked pure water. It appeared that for loose-NF membranes, PhACs rejection is mainly governed by solute-solute interactions (EfOM-compound association) or electrostatic membrane-solute interactions. Finally, it seems that calcium concentration of the effluent is a critical parameter for the rejection of PhACs as it alters both the availability of sites for PhACs association and the fouling layer density. Rejections of the NF-270 were negatively impacted in the presence of Ca2+. Such a study has practical implications for further understanding of the fate of trace organic compounds during nano filtration of wastewater for reuse applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The wastewater treatment process, besides discharging pharmaceuticals into the environment, has been found to result in the formation of a variety of undescribed compounds. Here we investigate the laboratory scale chlorination of the commonly used anti-HIV drug Nevirapine, characterise its disinfection transformation products (DTPs), and using liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry, screen environmental surface water for these DTPs. Chlorination of Nevirapine was scaled up, fractioned by preparative chromatography and the fractions were tested in vitro for toxicity and anti-HIV activity. Nevirapine was found to be resistant to degradation at relevant chlorination levels, which may partially explain its ubiquitous presence in South African surface water. During simulated chlorination, a variety of DTPs with varying properties were formed, some of which were detected in the environment, close to wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, some of these compounds, although not as toxic as Nevirapine, retained antiviral activity. Further purification and synthesis is required to fully characterise these novel molecules.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence of 13 parent and conjugated estrogens and progestagens in surface water of the Santa Ana River. With the exception of the synthetic hormones 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and mestranol, other compounds were detected at least twice at 10 representative sites, with the ubiquitous estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol-3-sulfate as the dominant compounds quantified (0.24-6.37 ng/L and 0.49-9.25 ng/L, respectively). Sites near dairy farms exhibited high levels of conjugates, whereas those close to a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent outlet displayed relatively high concentrations of E1. Principle component analysis coupled with multiple linear regression revealed dairy farms and the STP as the 2 significant contamination sources, accounting for 69.9% and 31.1% of the total hormone burden, respectively. Risk assessment results suggested E1 and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the 2 hormones with the largest risks to aquatic organisms, and which combined, contributed >90% of the total estrogenicity. Most of the sites investigated showed that E1 and E2 posed a medium risk (0.1 < risk quotient < 1), whereas each induced a high risk (risk quotient > 1) at sites severely impacted by the STP and dairy farms. These results suggest that river health would benefit from effective treatment of waste at the STP and dairy farms prior to discharge. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB In many coastal watersheds and ecosystems, rivers discharging to estuaries receive waters from domestic wastewater-treatment plants resulting in the release and distribution of pharmaceuticals to the marine environment. In the present study, 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients were measured regularly over 1 yr in the dissolved and particulate phases as they entered Narragansett Bay from the Pawtuxet River in Cranston (Rhode Island, USA). Of the active pharmaceutical ingredients measured, 14 were consistently present in the dissolved phase, with concentrations ranging from below detection to >310 ng/L, whereas 8 were present in the particulate phase (0.2-18 ng/g). Partition coefficients (K(d)s and K(OC)s) were determined, and organic carbon normalization reduced variability associated with Kds for the active pharmaceutical ingredients evaluated. Flux estimates based on river flow were calculated for both dissolved and particulate-phase active pharmaceutical ingredients, with particulate fluxes being low (1-12 g/yr) and dissolved fluxes of active pharmaceutical ingredients being 155 g/yr to 11 600 g/yr. Results indicate that the pharmaceuticals measured in the present study reside primarily in the dissolved phase and thus are likely bioavailable on entering the estuarine waters of Narragansett Bay. This long-term temporal study provides important information on seasonal and annual dynamics of pharmaceuticals in an urban estuarine watershed.

AB An electrochemical advanced oxidation process employing a boron-doped diamond anode for the treatment of synthetic waters and secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) was studied. The efficiency and formation of transformation products (TPs) for this treatment process were investigated at different current densities for bisphenol A (BPA) spiked to synthetic water and WWTP effluents. A complete removal of the parent compound was achieved in WWTP effluents. Higher applied current densities resulted in faster removal. At the same time, a correlation between the applied current density and the ozone concentration measured in the bulk solution was revealed. Hence, the observed transformation of BPA is likely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and ozone. Based on a suspected target screening approach, four known TPs and two unreported (new) TPs were identified by LC-MS analysis. These results suggest a transformation pathway following three steps: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, followed by oxidation of the isopropylidene bridge and finally a ring opening and formation of organic acids and other small molecules. The presence of chloride ions in WWTP effluents can result in the generation of excessive concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate during electrochemical oxidation. Applying a current density of 208 mA cm(-2), a complete elimination of BPA was achievable after 15 min (Q/V = 430 mA h L-1); however, the oxidation resulted in concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate of 2.85 and 5.65 mg L-1, respectively. These values were directly dependent on the exposure time and desired degree of BPA removal.

AB This study determined the effectiveness of pilot-scale tertiary sedimentation and filtration systems on lowering phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and pharmaceutical levels in municipal secondary wastewater effluent. Secondary effluent was diverted into five pilot-scale tertiary treatment systems. The systems used alum and a polymer during coagulation and flocculation, after which sedimentation was used to remove settleable solids, and filtration was used to remove nonsettleable solids. The filtration units following sedimentation were (1)continuous backwash upflow sand filtration following conventional sedimentation, (2)dual-media granular filtration following microsand ballasted sedimentation, (3)dual-media granular filtration following magnetite ballasted sedimentation, (4)ultrafiltration following microsand ballasted sedimentation, and (5)ultrafiltration following magentite ballasted sedimentation. Total phosphorus was 1.11mg/L in the secondary effluent and decreased to 0.015mg/L after sedimentation and ultrafiltration. BOD was 9.9mg/L in the secondary effluent and decreased to <1mg/L after the five systems. The pharmaceutical concentrations found in the secondary effluent were 211ng/L trimethoprim, 323ng/L carbamazepine, and 901ng/L sulfamethoxazole. The range of concentrations following tertiary treatment were 160-255ng/L trimethoprim, 302-335ng/L carbamazepine, and 482-792ng/L sulfamethoxazole. Overall, the tertiary sedimentation and filtration systems did not provide enhanced pharmaceutical removal. The results from this study corroborate other research findings, suggesting that rapid rate sand filtration and ultrafiltration may be inadequate for removing trace concentrations of water soluble pharmaceuticals, although phosphorus and BOD removal was >96% and >91%, respectively, comparing secondary and tertiary effluent.

AB This study investigates the effect of low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on photo-oxidation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) present in secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Experiments were conducted using two types of flow-through reactor systems: (1)three ultraviolet light (UV) reactors connected in series without a H2O2 addition, and (2)a UV reactor with a H2O2 addition. In the first part of this study, 38 PPCPs detected in secondary effluent were examined based on their degradability by UV in the presence and absence of H2O2. For the PPCPs that were not degraded to or below their detection level, the pseudo first-order photo-oxidation rate constants, k (s-1), were determined using a mathematical model developed for three continuously stirred tank reactors in series. The second part of the study investigated the kinetics of the selected PPCPs in the UV/H2O2 reactor. The effect of low concentrations of H2O2 on the photo-oxidation rate of PPCPs was quantified by the power function expression.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, endocrine disruptors, and their metabolites in aquatic environments has recently attracted particular attention due to their potential risks and adverse health effects. Membrane processes as widely used technologies in wastewater treatment have played a significance role in elimination of pharmaceuticals, hormones, endocrine disruptors, and their metabolites from wastewaters. In the current research, membrane processes which are used for the removal of these pollutants have been classified into three main categories, namely membrane filtration processes (UF, NF, and RO), membrane bioreactors (MBRs) (aerobic submerged and external systems), and membrane contactors (liquid-liquid extraction, supported liquid membranes, forward osmosis, and membrane distillation). Filtration processes have been applied for the removal of a large number of the contaminants; however, NF has been the most used one and the results were significant in most of the cases. Performance of MBRs has been also investigated for extensive number of contaminants. These systems have also showed great performance in many of the studies. Nevertheless, there are only a few researches on the removal of these pollutants by membrane contactors; thus, they have the potential for growth. Membrane processes have also been used in combination with other processes.

AB The antipsychotic drug quetiapine (QUT) has been frequently detected in sewage treatment plants. However, information on the fate of QUT in aquatic environments and its behavior during UV treatment is limited. In this study, QUT is shown not to be readily biodegradable in the Closed Bottle Test and the Manometric Respirometry Test according to OECD guidelines. The main biotransformation product (BTP) formed in the tests, a carboxylic acid derivative, was identified by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry. This BTP is presumably a human metabolite and showed higher detection rates than QUT in a river sampling campaign conducted in northern Germany. UV elimination kinetics of QUT at different initial concentrations (226.5, 45.3,11.3, and 2.3 mu mol L-1) were faster at lower initial concentrations. All seven phototransformation products (PTPs) could be still identified at initial concentration of 11.3 mu mol L-1. The photolytic mixture generated after 128 min of photolysis of QUT was not better biodegradable than QUT. Initial UV treatment of QUT led to the formation of several additional BTPs. Four of them were identified. The bacterial cytotoxicity and genotoxicity before and after phototransformation of QUT in a modified luminescent bacteria test (LBT) and the umu-test (ISO/FDIS 13829) showed cytotoxic effects in the LBT for QUT. Furthermore, PTPs had similar cytotoxic effects on luminescent bacteria. The umu-test did not reveal any genotoxic activity for QUT or PTPs. In conclusion, the release of QUT into sewage treatment plants and aquatic environments could result in the formation of a main BTP. Additional UV treatment of QUT would lead to the formation of additional BTPs. Moreover, treatment did not result in lower toxicity to tested organisms. In conclusion, UV treatment of QUT should be considered critically as a potential treatment for QUT in aquatic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of municipal wastewater in the Arctic is challenging due to a variety of financial, operational, climatic and technical issues. To better understand the efficacy of current wastewater treatment in this region and the hazard posed to receiving waters, we assessed the occurrence of nutrients and contaminants (i.e., pharmaceuticals, antibiotic resistance genes) as they moved through a lagoon-based treatment system in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Wastewater treatment in this community is performed by the use of a lagoon -tundra wetland system that is discharged into the marine environment and is representative of current common practices throughout the region. In 2014, samples were collected before and during lagoon discharge from two locations in the main lagoon, one location downstream from the lagoon effluent and three locations offshore. Grab samples were collected to measure nutrients (e.g., total nitrogen and phosphorus) and the presence of antibiotic resistance gene bearing microbes, and Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were deployed to collect passively organic contaminants in all locations. A total of six pharmaceuticals were detected from a screen of twenty-eight analytes during the study: atenolol, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The greatest concentrations of nutrients, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and pharmaceuticals were found in sampling locations within the treatment lagoon. Offshore of the release point, we observed limited to no detection of pharmaceuticals and ARGs, but no change in total nitrogen and phosphorus from pre-release. We conclude that the current concentrations of monitored pharmaceuticals do not pose a significant hazard at this time to aquatic organisms in Cambridge Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a large group of substances that have been recognized as environmental contaminants in recent years. Research on the pharmaceutical fate in soils is currently limited or missing. In this study, three pharmaceuticals (atenolol (ATE), carbamazepine (CAR), and metoprolol (MET)) were introduced to soils and exposed for 61 day under aerobic conditions. Thirteen different soils were used in the study to increase the understanding of pharmaceutical behaviour in the soil matrix. Ten metabolites were detected and tentatively identified. Some of them, such as atenolol acid (AAC), carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (EPC), 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (DHC), trans-10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine (RTC), and metoprolol acid (MAC), were consequently confirmed using commercial reference standards. It was concluded that the aerobic conditions of the experiment determined the pharmaceutical degradation pathway of studied compounds in the soils. The different amounts/rates and degradation of the transformation products can be attributed to differences in the soil properties. ATE degraded relatively quickly compared with CAR, whereas MET degradation in the soils was unclear. The persistence of CAR and its metabolites, in combination with low CAR sorption, enable the transportation of CAR and its metabolites within soils and into the ground water. Thus, CAR may cause adverse effects on the environment and humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A sensitive method for simultaneous determination of 20 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs, including preservatives, antioxidants, disinfectants, oestrogens, alkyl-phenols and bisphenol-A) in surface water and wastewater has been developed and validated based on the optimisation of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. 500 mL acidified (pH = 2.5) water samples were pre-concentrated by Supel-Select HLB cartridge (200 mg, 6 mL) and eluted with 12 mL mixture of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate (50:50, v/v). This optimised SPE procedure could provide >75% recoveries for the majority of TOrCs. The instrumental methods were developed using two different LC-MS systems: a triple -quadrupole MS (QqQ-MS) and a hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap high resolution MS (Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). Both showed good performance data, but the former system provided better linearity and method precision, with the latter system providing 2-33 times lower detection limits. Different matrix effects were observed for both systems: No remarkable matrix effects were observed for Q-Orbitrap-HRMS but significant matrix effects were found in influent and river water samples for the QqQ-MS. This analytical method was subsequently employed to analyse the TOrCs in river waters and wastewaters from China successfully, which confirmed its applicability to environmental samples.

AB Pharmaceuticals reach terrestrial environments through the application of treated wastewaters and biosolids to agricultural soils. We have investigated the toxicity of 15 common pharmaceuticals, classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), blood lipid-lowering agents, beta-blockers and antibiotics, in two photosynthetic organisms. Twelve pharmaceuticals caused inhibitory effects on the radicle and hypocotyl elongation of Lactuca sativa seeds. The EC50 values obtained were in the range of 170-5656 mg L-1 in the case of the radicle and 188-4558 mg L-1 for the hypocotyl. Propranolol was the most toxic drug for both root and hypocotyl elongation, followed by the NSAIDs, then gemfibrozil and tetracycline. Other effects, such as root necrosis, inhibition of root growth and curly hairs, were detected. However, even at the highest concentrations tested (3000 mg L-1), seed germination was not affected. NSAIDs decreased the photosynthetic yield of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but only salicylic acid showed EC50 values below 1000 mg L-1. The first effects detected at low concentrations, together with the concentrations found in environmental samples, indicate that the use of biosolids and wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals should be regulated and their compositions assessed in order to prevent medium- and long-term impacts on agricultural soils and crops.

AB An extracellular, halophilic, alkalithermophilic serine protease from the halo-alkaliphilic Alkalibacillus sp. NM-Da2 was purified to homogeneity by ethanol precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified protease was a monomeric enzyme with an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa and exhibited maximal activity at 2.7 M NaCl, pH(55 A degrees C) 9 and 56 A degrees C. The protease showed great temperature stability, retaining greater than 80 % of initial activity after 2 h incubation at 55 A degrees C. The protease was also extremely pH tolerant, retaining 80 % of initial activity at pH(55 A degrees C) 10.5 after 30 min incubation. Protease hydrolyzed complex substrates, displaying activity on yeast extract, tryptone, casein, gelatin and peptone. Protease activity was inhibited at casein concentrations greater than 1.2 mg/mL. The enzyme was stable and active in 40 % (v/v) solutions of isopropanol, ethanol and benzene and was stable in the presence of the polysorbate surfactant Tween 80. Activity was stimulated with the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition with phenyl methylsulfonylfluoride indicates it is a serine protease. Synthetic saline wastewater treated with the protease showed 50 % protein removal after 5 h. Being halophilic, alkaliphilic and thermophilic, in addition to being resistant to organic solvents, this protease has potential for various applications in biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries.

AB Agricultural practices are increasingly incorporating recycled waste materials, such as biosolids, to provide plant nutrients and enhance soil functions. Although biosolids provide benefits to soil, municipal wastewater treatment plants receive pharmaceuticals and heavy metals that can accumulate in biosolids, and land application of biosolids can transfer these contaminants to the soil. Environmental exposure of these contaminants may adversely affect wildlife, disrupt microbial communities, detrimentally affect human health through long-term exposure, and cause the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study considers the use of biochar co-amendments as sorbents for contaminants from biosolids. The sorption of pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin, triclocarban, triclosan), and heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb) to biochars and biochar-biosolids-soil mixtures was examined. Phenylurea herbicide (monuron, diuron, linuron) sorption was also studied to determine the potential effect of biochar on soil-applied herbicides. A softwood (SW) biochar (510 degrees C) and a walnut shell (WN) biochar (900 degrees C) were used as contrasting biochars to highlight potential differences in biochar reactivity. Kaolinite and activated carbon served as mineral and organic controls. Greater sorption for almost all contaminants was observed with WN biochar over SW biochar. The addition of biosolids decreased sorption of herbicides to SW biochar, whereas there was no observable change with WN biochar. The WN biochar showed potential for reducing agrochemical and contaminant transport but may inhibit the efficacy of soil-applied herbicides. This study provides support for minimizing contaminant mobility from biosolids using biochar as a co-amendment and highlights the importance of tailoring biochars for specific characteristics through feedstock selection and pyrolysis-gasification conditions.

AB Sludge based activated carbons (ACs) were used to remove selected pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac (DCF) and nimesulide (NM) from aqueous solutions. The powered sewage sludge was mixed with different proportions of ZnCl2. The mixture was pyrolyzed in a conventional oven using three different temperatures under inert atmosphere. Afterwards, in order to increase the specific surface area and uptake capacity the carbonized materials were acidified with 6mol L-1 HCl under reflux at 80 A degrees C for 3 hours. The characterization of ACs was achieved by scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, TGA, hydrophobicity index by water, n-heptane vapor adsorption and nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves. The specific surface area (S (BET) ) of adsorbents varied between 21.2 and 679.3m(2)g(-1). According to the water and n-heptane analysis data all ACs had hydrophobic surface. Experimental variables such as pH, mass of adsorbent and temperature on the adsorption capacities were studied. The optimum pH, mass of adsorbent and temperature for adsorption of DCF and NM onto ACs were found to be 7.0 (DCF) and 10.0 (NM), 30mg and 25 A degrees C, respectively. The kinetic adsorption was investigated using general-order, pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models, while the general-order model described the adsorption process most suitably. The maximum amounts of DCF and NM adsorbed were 156.7 and 66.4mg g(-1) for sample 1(500-15-0.5), respectively.

AB An investigation to study the distribution and persistence of cephalosporins in the cephalosporin producing wastewater was carried out in this paper. The target cephalosporins included ceftriaxone (CRO), cefalexin (CEF), cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin (CZO), cefuroxime (CXM), cefoxitin (CFX) and cefradine (CF). A rapid and reliable detection method for cephalosporins was established based on solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. In the cephalosporin producing wastewater effluent (CPWWeff), the limit of quantification for the targets ranged from 27.5 ng/L to 131.8 ng/L, and the recoveries for all of the analytes ranged from 73% to 102%. The mean concentrations of the seven cephalosporins were 12.85-141.55 mu g/L and 0.05-24.38 mu g/L in cephalosporin producing wastewater influent and effluent, respectively. Although high removal efficiencies were achieved for the cephalosporins (78.8-99.7%), up to 1.9 kg of cephalosporins was discharged per day from the investigated C-WWTP. The degradation processes of CRO, CEF, CZO and CXM followed first-order kinetics in CPWWeff under all of the testing conditions. The degradation rates of tested cephalosporins were accelerated by high temperature and light. Persistence of CXM was the highest among the four tested cephalosporins in CPWWeff.

AB The use of process models to simulate the fate of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants is constantly growing. However, due to the high workload and cost of measuring campaigns, many simulation studies lack sufficiently long time series representing realistic wastewater influent dynamics. In this paper, the feasibility of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) influent generator is tested to create realistic dynamic influent (micro) pollutant disturbance scenarios. The presented set of models is adjusted to describe the occurrence of three pharmaceutical compounds and one of each of its metabolites with samples taken every 2-4 h: the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBU), the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the psychoactive carbamazepine (CMZ). Information about type of excretion and total consumption rates forms the basis for creating the data-defined profiles used to generate the dynamic time series. In addition, the traditional influent characteristics such as flow rate, ammonium, particulate chemical oxygen demand and temperature are also modelled using the same framework with high frequency data. The calibration is performed semi-automatically with two different methods depending on data availability. The 'traditional' variables are calibrated with the Bootstrap method while the pharmaceutical loads are estimated with a least squares approach. The simulation results demonstrate that the BSM2 influent generator can describe the dynamics of both traditional variables and pharmaceuticals. Lastly, the study is complemented with: 1) the generation of longer time series for IBU following the same catchment principles; 2) the study of the impact of in-sewer SMX biotransformation when estimating the average daily load; and, 3) a critical discussion of the results, and the future opportunities of the presented approach balancing model structure/calibration procedure complexity versus predictive capabilities.

AB Phthalates are widely used in plastic and personnel care products. Being non-steroid endocrine disrupting compounds, their exposure have toxic effects on aquatic life and human health. The aim of this study was a comparative assessment of their fate and risk in full scale wastewater treatment along with influence of seasonal variations. Four priority phthalates, Diethylphthalate (DEP), Dibutylphthalate (DBP), Benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were chosen for this study and wastewater treatment plants investigated were designed as nutrient removal based sequencing batch reactor (SBR), conventional activated sludge process (ASP) and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) with polishing pond. Results showed that the main removal mechanism of phthalates was biotransformation with removal contribution of 74% in SBR, 65% in conventional ASP and 37% in UASB. Overall removal of phthalates was maximum in the treatment combination UASB and pond (83%) followed by SBR (80%) and conventional ASP (74%). Seasonal influences on occurrence, removal and risk of these phthalates were also studied. The concentration of DEP, DBP and DEHP in untreated wastewater increased by 2, 7 and 2 mu g/L, respectively in summer. However in sludge, only large molecular weight phthalates BBP and DEHP increased in winter by 3 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg, respectively. Seasonal variations in removal of phthalates were discrepant in each process with better removal during summer. Risk assessment of phthalates to aquatic life showed that there is no potential risk of DEP, DBP and BBP from effluents of treatment plants however risk quotient of DEHP was in the range of 27-73 in both seasons which indicate probable risk to aquatic organisms. Phthalate risk to human beings estimated by daily intake of phthalates was in the range of 0.3 +/- 0.1 to 20 +/- 0.7 ng/kg/d and far below their respective reference dosages, demonstrating the potential of these treatment plants to reduce the risk of phthalates.

AB To characterise emissions from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) regarding organic micropollutants, a monitoring study was undertaken in an urban catchment in southwest Stuttgart, Germany. The occurrence of 69 organic micropollutants was assessed at one CSO outfall during seven rain events as well as in the sewage network at the influent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in the receiving water. Several pollutant groups like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), urban biocides and pesticides, industrial chemicals, organophosphorus flame retardants, plasticisers and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were chosen for analysis. Out of the 69 monitored substances, 60 were detected in CSO discharges. The results of this study show that CSOs represent an important pathway for a wide range of organic micropollutants from wastewater systems to urban receiving waters. For most compounds detected in CSO samples, event mean concentrations varied between the different events in about one order of magnitude range. When comparing CSO concentrations with median wastewater concentrations during dry weather, two main patterns could be observed depending on the source of the pollutant: (i) wastewater is diluted by stormwater; (ii) stormwater is the most important source of a pollutant. Both wastewater and stormwater only play an important role in pollutant concentration for a few compounds. The proportion of stormwater calculated with the conductivity is a suitable indicator for the evaluation of emitted loads of dissolved wastewater pollutants, but not for all compounds. In fact, this study demonstrates that remobilisation of in-sewer deposits contributed from 10% to 65% to emissions of carbamazepine in CSO events. The contribution of stormwater to CSO emitted loads was higher than 90% for all herbicides as well as for PAHs. Regarding the priority substance di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), this contribution varied between 39% and 85%. The PAH concentrations found along the river indicate environmental risk, especially during rainfall events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozone process control in secondary effluent used for elimination of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) requires the use of surrogates, such as the relative reduction of UV absorption at 254 nm (Delta UVA(254)) to adapt the ozone dose to a varying water quality. In the present study, a closed-loop process control based on two online UVA(254) measurements was successfully implemented and tested under realistic conditions with ozone doses from 0.2 to 1.05 mg-O-3/mg-DOC at a pilot scale ozonation system with subsequent coagulation filtration at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (DOC similar to 13 mg/L, UVA(254) similar to 27 m(-1), and nitrite peaks of up to 1.6 mg-N/L). It could be shown that measuring the UVA(254) at the ozonation effluent was superior to the measurement of UVA(254) at the filter effluent in terms of response time due to changes in water quality, whereas online measurement at the filter effluent showed a better agreement with laboratory data and a reduced maintenance interval due to less particles. Additional online nitrite measurement is not necessary as the ozone consumption by nitrite directly impacts Delta UVA(254). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Operation at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (<1 mg/L) in wastewater treatment could save utilities significantly by reducing aeration energy costs. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of low DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during treatment. DO concentration can impact pharmaceutical biotransformation rates during wastewater treatment both directly and indirectly: directly by acting as a limiting substrate that slows the activity of the microorganisms involved in biotransformation; and indirectly by shaping the microbial community and selecting for a community that performs pharmaceutical biotransformation faster (or slower). In this study, nitrifying bioreactors were operated at low (similar to 0.3 mg/L) and high (>4 mg/L) DO concentrations to understand how DO growth conditions impacted microbial community structure. Short-term batch experiments using the biomass from the parent reactors were performed under low and high DO conditions to understand how DO concentration impacts microbial physiology. Although the low DO parent biomass had a lower specific activity with respect to ammonia oxidation than the high DO parent reactor biomass, it had faster biotransformation rates of ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, acetaminophen, and atenolol in high DO batch conditions. This was likely because the low DO reactor had a 2x higher biomass concentration, was enriched for ammonia oxidizers (4x higher concentration), and harbored a more diverse microbial community (3x more unique taxa) as compared to the high DO parent reactor. Overall, the results show that there can be indirect benefits from low DO operation over high DO operation that support pharmaceutical biotransformation during wastewater treatment.

AB Very little information on the occurrence and fate of multiple classes of antimicrobials in the aquatic environment is reported for the Southeast Asian region. This study provides the first and comprehensive data on the occurrence of ten different classes of antimicrobials in wastewater samples for Singapore. Among the investigated antimicrobials, 19 out of 21 target compounds were detected in 100% of the collected raw influent samples. Concentrations of the detected antimicrobials in raw influent varied from 23.8 to 43,740 ng/L. Removal of antimicrobials by conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems at a local wastewater treatment plant was evaluated. MBR exhibited better performance over CAS for most target antimicrobials. Beta-lactam, glycopeptide, and fluoroquinolone classes were largely eliminated by biological wastewater treatment processes, whereas trimethoprim and lincosamides appeared to be persistent. Effects of physicochemical properties and chemical structures of target antimicrobials on their removal efficiencies/mechanisms during wastewater treatment process were also discussed.

AB Nowadays, there is an increasing concern over the presence of contaminants in the aquatic environment, where they can be introduced from wastewater after their incomplete removal in the treatment plants. In this work, degradation of selected emerging pollutants in the aqueous and solid phases of sewage sludge has been investigated after anaerobic digestion using two different digesters: mesophilic and thermophilic. Initially, sludge samples were screened by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) for identification of emerging contaminants in the samples. In a second step, a target quantitative method based on LC coupled to tandem MS was applied for selected pollutants identified in the previous screening. The behaviour of the compounds under anaerobic conditions was studied estimating the degradation efficiency and distribution of compounds between both sludge phases. Irbesartan and benzoylecgonine seemed to be notably degraded in both phases of the sludge. Venlafaxine showed a significant concentration decrease in the aqueous phase in parallel to an increase in the solid phase. The majority of the compounds showed an increase of their concentrations in both phases after the digestion. Concentrations in the solid phase were commonly higher than in the aqueous for most contaminants, indicating that they were preferentially adsorbed onto the solid particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical persistent pollutants pose a serious threat to the environment. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, hydroxyapatite-based biomaterials as photocatalysts to degrade micro pollutants. Diclofenac and fluoxetine were selected for these initial tests. Hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(OH)(2), HAp) is one of the most commonly used biomaterials/bioceramics, being a major constituent of bone. In this work sustainable HAp-based materials of marine origin, obtained from cod fish bones, were used; these photocatalysts were previously fully studied and characterised. Both single-phase HAp and HAp-titania multicomponent materials (1 wt% TiO2) were employed as UV light photocatalysts, the latter showing better performance, indicated by higher degradation rates of both compounds. The HAp-titania photocatalyst showed excellent degradation of both persistent pollutants, the maximum degradation performance being 100% for fluoxetine and 92% for diclofenac, with pollutant and photocatalyst concentrations of 2 ppm and 4 g/L, respectively. Variations in features such as pollutant and photocatalyst concentrations were investigated, and results showed that generally fluoxetine was degraded more easily than diclofenac. The photocatalyst's crystallinity was not affected by the photo degradation reaction; indeed the material exhibited good photostability, as the degradation rate did not decrease when the material was reused. Tests were also performed using actual treated wastewater; the photocatalyst was still effective, even if with lower efficiency (-20% and -4% for diclofenac and fluoxetine, respectively). TOC analysis showed high but incomplete mineralisation of the pollutants (maximum 60% and 80% for DCF and FXT, respectively). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are growing public attention and concern about the possibility of ecosystem and human health effects from pharmaceuticals in environment. Several types of environmental samples were target of studies by the scientific community, namely drinking water, groundwater, surface water (river, ocean), treated water (influent and effluent), soils, and sediments near to Wastewater Treatment Plants or near to others potential sources of contaminations. Normally, studies in the cemeteries areas are for historical and architectural research and questions of the potential risk for adverse impact of cemeteries in environment have never received enough attention. However, this risk may exist when cemeteries are placed in areas that are vulnerable to contamination. The objective of the present work was the determination of pharmaceuticals (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory/analgesics, antibiotics and psychiatric drugs) in groundwater samples collected inside of the cemeteries areas. Acetaminophen, salicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, nimesulide, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were the pharmaceuticals achieved in the analysed samples. None of the studied antibiotics were detected. The highest concentration was obtained for salicylic acid (in the range of 33.7 to 71.0 ng/L) and carbamazepine (between 20.0 and 22.3 ng/L), respectively. By the cluster analysis similarity between carbamazepine and fluoxetine was achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A screening approach was applied to influent and effluent wastewater samples. After injection in a LC-LTQ-Orbitrap, data analysis was performed using two deconvolution tools, MsXelerator (modules MPeaks and MS Compare) and Sieve 2.1. The outputs were searched incorporating an in-house database of >200 pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs or ChemSpider. This hidden target screening approach led to the detection of numerous compounds including the illicit drug cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, gemfibrozil and losartan. The compounds found using both approaches were combined, and isotopic pattern and retention time prediction were used to filter out false positives. The remaining potential positives were reanalysed in MS/MS mode and their product ions were compared with literature and/or mass spectral libraries. The inclusion of the chemical database ChemSpider led to the tentative identification of several metabolites, including paraxanthine, theobromine, theophylline and carboxylosartan, as well as the pharmaceutical phenazone. The first three of these compounds are isomers and they were subsequently distinguished based on their product ions and predicted retention times. This work has shown that the use deconvolution tools facilitates non-target screening and enables the identification of a higher number of compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological hazard of a pharmaceutical effluent before and after treatment. For the former, the determined 96 h-LC50 value was 1.2%. The photo-Fenton treatment catalyzed with an iron-pillared clay reduced this parameter by 341.7%. Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P < 0.05) were observed at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h in HPC (50.2, 30.4, 66.9 and 43.3%), LPX (22, 83.2, 62.7 and 59.5%) and PCC (14.6, 23.6, 24.4 and 25.6%) and antioxidant enzymes SOD (29.4, 38.5, 32.7 and 49.5%) and CAT (48.4, 50.3, 38.8 and 46.1%) in Hyalella azteca before treatment. Also increases in damage index were observed before treatment of 53.1, 59.9, 66.6 and 72.1% at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. After treatment the same biomarkers of oxidative stress decreased with respect to before treatment being to HPC (29.3, 22.5, 41.6 and 31.7%); LPX (14.2, 43.1, 30.7 and 35.5%); PCC (12.6, 21.3, 24.2 and 23.9%); SOD (39.2, 33.9, 49.5 and 37.9%) and CAT (28.6, 35.8, 33.7 and 31.7) at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively (P < 0.05). The damage index were decreased at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h in 48.9, 57.8, 67.3 and 72.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrate the need of performing bioassays in order to characterize an effluent before discharge and not base such a decision only upon current normativity. In addition, it was also concluded that the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process decreases the presence of PCT, oxidative stress, genotoxic damage and LC50 in Hyalella azteca. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Today, it is considered state-of-the-art to engineer living organisms for various biotechnology applications. Even though this has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs, the enclosed interior of bacterial cells still restricts interactions with enzymes, pathways and products due to the mass-transfer barrier formed by the cell envelope. To promote accessibility, we propose engineering of biocatalytic reactions and subsequent product deposition directly on the bacterial surface. As a proof-of-concept, we used the AIDA autotransporter vehicle for Escherichia coli surface expression of tyrosinase and fully oxidized externally added tyrosine to the biopolymer melanin. This resulted in a color change and creation of a black cell exterior. The capture of ninety percent of a pharmaceutical wastewater pollutant followed by regeneration of the cell bound melanin matrix through a simple pH change, shows the superior function and facilitated processing provided by the surface methodology. The broad adsorption spectrum of melanin could also allow removal of other micropollutants.

AB Municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) and its constituents, such as chemicals of emerging concern, pose a potential threat to the sustainability of fish populations by disrupting key endocrine functions in aquatic organisms. While studies have demonstrated changes in biological markers of exposure of aquatic organisms to groups of chemicals of emerging concern, the variability of these markers over time has not been sufficiently described in wild fish species. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of biological markers in response to MWWE exposure and to test the consistency of these responses between seasons and among years. Rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) were collected in spring and fall seasons over a 5-year period in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. In addition to surface water chemistry (nutrients and selected pharmaceuticals), measures were taken across levels of biological organization in rainbow darter. The measurements of hormone production, gonad development, and intersex severity were temporally consistent and suggested impaired reproduction in male fish collected downstream of MWWE outfalls. In contrast, ovarian development and hormone production in females appeared to be influenced more by urbanization than MWWE. Measures of gene expression and somatic indices were highly variable between sites and years, respectively, and were inconclusive in terms of the impacts of MWWE overall. Robust biomonitoring programs must consider these factors in both the design and interpretation of results, especially when spatial and temporal sampling of biological endpoints is limited. Assessing the effects of contaminants and other stressors on fish in watersheds would be greatly enhanced by an approach that considers natural variability in the endpoints being measured.

AB Erythromycin is an antibiotic considered as a recalcitrant pollutant because it is currently found in treated wastewaters. In addition, traces of antibiotics are a threatening ecological issue as these compounds are biologically active even at very low concentrations (ng L-1). In this work, we studied enzymatic degradation of this antibiotic in model aqueous solutions containing 20 mg L-1 erythromycin. We used as the biocatalyst an EreB esterase obtained from a genetically modified Escherichia coli W3110 strain carrying the EreB overexpression plasmid. Experiments were carried out with different reactor and biocatalyst configurations (free and immobilized by covalent grafting or adsorption). Free enzymes showed very high activity leading to erythromycin depletion. Experiments with the biocatalyst immobilized by adsorption using an enzymatic membrane reactor showed that even if EreB initially lost part of its activity, it was stabilized and able to continuously degrade erythromycin at a rate of 15.8 mg h(-1) for 100 h.

AB The mechanisms of elimination of an anticancer drug (cyclophosphamide) by a membrane bioreactor were investigated. The membrane bioreactor was run for 153 days with a sludge retention time (SRT) of 20 days. A removal efficiency of 60% was observed despite some variations in the influent. This removal was higher than reported in most of the studies in the literature. Biodegradation was the predominant removal mechanism and sorption onto sludge could be neglected.

AB Sampling and analysis of wastewater from inicipal wastewater treatment plants (VV\ATTPs) has become a useful tool for understanding exposure to chemicals. Both wastewater based studies and management and planning of Lhe catchment require information on catchment population in the time of monitoring. Recently, a model has been developed and calibrated using selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) measured in influent wastewater for estimating population in different catchments in Australia. The present study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of utilizing this population estimation approach in China. Twenty-four hour composite influent samples were collected from 31 WWTPs in 17 cities with catchment sizes from 200000-3,450,000 people representing all seven regions of China. The samples were analyzed for 19 PPCPs using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in direct injection mode. Eight chemicals were defected in more than 50% of the samples. Significant positive correlations were found between individual PPCP mass loads and population estimates provided by WWTP operators. Using the PPCP mass load modeling approach calibrated with WWTP operator data, we estimated the population size of each catchment with good agreement with WWTP operator values (between 50-200% for all sites and 75-125% for 23 of the 31 sites). Overall, despite much lower detection and relatively high heterogeneity in PPCP consumption across China the model provided a good estimate of the population contributing to a given wastewater sample. Wastewater analysis could also provide objective PPCP consumption status in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
