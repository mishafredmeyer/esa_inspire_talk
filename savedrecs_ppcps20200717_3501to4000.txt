AB The aim of this work was to study the efficiency of ozone (O-3)/activated carbon (AC) coupling to remove metoprolol and fluoxetine. A kinetic study was performed at pH ranging from 3 to 9. Results were correctly modelled by a global first-order model (r(2)>0.99) and were compared to those obtained with the ozonation process. It was shown that O-3/AC coupling was the most efficient process. At pH 9, the degradation kinetic constant reached 0.72min(-1) with O-3/AC coupling while its maximum value was 0.34min(-1) with ozonation. In each experimental condition and for the two target compounds, this coupling allowed a fast and total pollutant removal. Moreover, its performances were not significantly influenced by the experimental conditions, contrary to the ozonation process which is strongly influenced by the pH and the nature of the pollutant. O-3/AC coupling remained efficient even if the operational parameters disfavour pollutant oxidation.

AB The efficiency of a microwave-assisted Fenton-like process using special supported catalysts was evaluated using total organic carbon (TOC) removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. No acidification was required. The highest level of TOC removal efficiency from wastewater achieved was 65.88%. Moreover, the maximum number of consecutive uses with high activity was four. Under optimal conditions, the influent value of BOD5/COD was 0.25, and the effluent value of BOD5/COD was elevated to 0.40. In addition, colour was completely removed. This efficiency was compared with the same MW-Fenton-like process using common supported catalysts, where the highest achieved TOC removal efficiency from wastewater was 39.25%, the colour of the wastewater decreased from 50 to 20, and the value of BOD5/COD was elevated from 0.25 to 0.34. The maximum number of consecutive high activity uses was two. This advanced performance was attributed to no presence of copper carbonate or cerium carbonate on the surface of special supported catalysts. The preparation method for these catalysts combined the merits of the isometric impregnation method with some new improvements. Its advantages include high-efficiency performance, short preparation time, low reagent usage (cupric nitrate 3.6 g, cerium nitrate 1.2 g, ammonia 1 mL), and reusability. The properties of the catalyst with the most efficient performance were characterized by determining surface particle size, the relative amount of active components and promoters, and the stable crystal form of the active components.

AB In the past few years, the improvement of advanced analytical tools allowed to confirm the presence of trace amounts of metabolized and unchanged active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as in freshwater surfaces. It is known that the continuous contact with APIs, even at very low concentrations (ng L-1-mu gL(-1)), leads to serious human health problems. In this context, this work shows the feasibility of using ionic-liquid-based aqueous biphasic systems (IL-based ABS) in the extraction of quinolones present in aqueous media. In particular, ABS composed of imidazolium- and phosphonium-based ILs and aluminium-based salts (already used in water treatment plants) were evaluated in one-step extractions of six fluoroquinolones (FQs), namely ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and sarafloxacin, and extraction efficiencies up to 98% were obtained. Despite the large interest devoted to IL-based ABS as extractive systems of outstanding performance, their recyclability/reusability has seldomly been studied. An efficient extraction/cleaning process of the IL-rich phase is here proposed by FQs induced precipitation. The recycling of the IL and its further reuse without losses in the ABS extractive performance for FQs were established, as confirmed by the four consecutive removal/extraction cycles evaluated. This novel recycling strategy supports IL-based ABS as sustainable and cost-efficient extraction platforms.

AB The use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PCPPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has more than doubled since 1950. POPs find their way into aquatic ecosystems through agricultural and industrial runoff, wastewater treatment effluent discharge, and atmospheric deposition. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs), which can produce toxins potent enough to cause human death, have been increasing in intensity, frequency, and spatial scale throughout the same time period as accelerated POP usage. Here, we provide a meta-analysis and suggest that POP stressors may be significantly aggravating nutrient-driven CyanoHABs by suppressing the growth of competing phytoplankton, and/ or by indirectly or directly stimulating cyanobacterial growth.

AB The objective of the study was to evaluate the sorption of a pool of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) onto a clay-sand filter in a dynamic sorption experiment. The chosen adsorbent should have suitable chemical properties for the removal of the targeted PhACs and also a consistent hydrodynamic behavior regarding field application. In this aim, the impact of interfoliar cations (Ca2+ or Na+) intercalated into natural montmorillonite (Swy2) was tested by using different clay-sand ratios (from 0% to 100% of clay minerals). Only Ca-Swy2 showed a consistent hydraulic conductivity for field application with a value of 4.78 x 10(-8) m s(-1) for a 5%/95% clay-sand ratio. The sorption of PhACs onto this filter was investigated using oedometer cells by varying two parameters: the solution matrix (ultra-pure water or natural effluent) and the injection pressure (0.1 MPa and 0.2 MPa). The PhACs were effectively adsorbed onto the filter for each experiment at different levels. The drop in injection pressure was a favorable factor for sorption whatever the matrix was, with median global removal of similar to 45% at 0.2 MPa and similar to 75% at 0.1 MPa. The effect of the matrix exhibited two different trends as a function of the molecular charge of each PhAC. While cationic compounds were more effectively sorbed in the ultra-pure water matrix than in the effluent matrix, the sorption of anionic PhACs was more effective in the effluent matrix than in ultra-pure water. This indicates that the charge of the pollutant is a key parameter in controlling the efficiency of the adsorbent. Despite these removal variations, the filter exhibited a significant sorption capacity especially at 0.1 MPa. It can therefore be an efficient solution for the removal of PhACs by tertiary filtration.

AB Anaerobic biodegradation of mixed non-analogous two substrates was studied in a binary system with and without the primary substrate using an anaerobic multichamber bed (AMCBR). In the binary mixture, the biodegradation of less-degradable oxytetracycline (OTC) was restarted in the presence of more degradable benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the initial runs of the AMCBR, but enhanced biodegradation of the more recalcitrant OTC occurs in the later runs of the AMCBR due to enhanced biomass growth on dual substrates without the primary carbon source. The biodegradation yields of the OTC, BaP were discussed with sole-substrate systems and with the dual substrate system in the presence of the primary substrate. The maximum OTC and BaP yields were 93% in Run 3 with the primary substrate, while the maximum BaP and OTC yields were 95%, 98% in Run 3 without the primary substrate. A dual form of the Monod was found to adequately predict the substrate interactions in the binary mixture of OTC and BaP using only the parameters derived from batch experiments. At low BaP (4 mg L-1) and OTC (40 mg L-1) concentrations, a non-competitive inhibition does not affect the binding of the substrate and so the K-s were was not affected while the mu(max) was lowered. At high BaP (10 mg L-1) and OTC (100 mg L-1) concentrations, the BaP and OTC were biodegraded according to competitive inhibition with increased K-s while mu(max) was not affected. BaP and OTC were biodegraded according to Haldane at high concentrations (>10 mg L-1 for BaP, 100 mg L-1 OTC) where they were used as the sole substrate.

AB In the present study, the sorption and biodegradation characteristics of five pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), crotamiton (CTMT), diethyltoluamide (DEET) and salicylic acid (SA), were studied in laboratory-batch experiments. Sorption kinetics experimental data showed that sorption systems under this study were more appropriately described by the pseudo second-order kinetics with a correlation coefficient (R-2) > 0.98. Sorption equilibrium data of almost all target compounds onto soil could be better described by the Freundlich sorption isotherm model. The adsorption results showed higher soil affinity for SA, following by ACT. Results also indicated a slight effect of pH on PPCP adsorption with lower pH causing lower adsorption of compounds onto the soil except for SA at pH 12. Moreover, adsorption of PPCPs onto the soil was influenced by natural organic matter (NOM) since the higher amount of NOM caused lower adsorption to the soil. Biodegradation studies of selected PPCPs by indigenous microbial community present in soil appeared that the removal rates of ACT, SA and DEET increased with time while no effect had been observed for the rest. This study suggests that the CBZ and CTMT can be considered as suitable chemical sewage indicators based on their low sorption affinity and high resistance to biodegradation.

AB Conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation processes are promising technologies for treating biorefractory industrial wastes with organic loads below 20000 mg L-1. In this work, electrochemical oxidation of a real industrial pharmaceutical wastewater with conductive-diamond anodes has been studied. The electrolyses were carried out in discontinuous operation mode under galvanostatic conditions, using a bench-scale plant equipped with a single compartment electrochemical flow cell. For optimizing the process and studying the interaction between the operating conditions, different experiments were performed by modifying the current density (from 25 to 180 mA cm(-2)) and recirculation flow rate (from 105 to 565 ml min(-1)) with residence times between 0 and 570 minutes. The corresponding contribution of these two operative parameters on COD removal and its evolution versus residence time was studied. A time of 98 minutes was obtained in order to evaluate the highest influence of operative parameters. For this time, the current density was found to have a considerable positive effect, while the flow rate proved to be a statistically insignificant variable. ANOVA test reported significance for three of the five involved variables and Response Surface Methodology technique was used to optimize COD removal.

AB The influence of key process parameters of homogenous catalytic ozonation using ferrous or manganese catalysts on the mineralization rate of salicylic acid (SA), model pharmaceutical pollutant, in water was investigated. In order to assess the combined influence and interactions of studied process parameters as well, the empirical/statistical approach applying Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. Three numerical and one categorical variables representing the key process parameters (initial pH, concentration of ozone, concentration and type of catalyst) were included in applied BBD. RSM models predicting the mineralization rate of SA in dependence on studied process parameters were developed, while their significance and accuracy were evaluated on the basis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and obtained statistical parameters (R-2, F, p). The developed models are characterized as highly accurate and predictive for the studied system behavior. Evaluation of the influence of all four process parameters showed that mineralization rate of SA strongly depends on the initial pH, ozone concentration and combined interactions between the initial pH and type of catalyst. When two processes, O-3/Fe2+ and O-3/Mn2+, were observed separately, significant differences between them were determined, particularly related with complexing chemistry of applied catalysts within the investigated pH range.

AB A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of two diuretics (furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide), five nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (diclofenac, ketoprofen, piroxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen), one fibrate (gemfibrozil) and two antimicrobial agents (triclosan, triclocarban). The compounds were extracted from water samples using Oasis HLB cartridges. The analytes were then identified and quantified using LC-MS/MS with dual-polarity electrospray ionisation in the MRM mode. Good linearity was obtained for all tested compounds (R-2 > 0.99). The limits of detection (LODs) ranged between 0.15 and 24.0 ng l(-1). Spike recoveries ranged from 84 to 115% and from 81 to 117% for urban wastewater and surface water samples, respectively, with satisfactory precision (RSD <20%). Finally, the method was used to analyse real effluent and surface water.

AB Contamination levels of antibiotics, namely ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), oxytetracycline (OTC), and doxycycline (DOX), were quantified in wastewater, soil, plants, and underground water of surrounding areas of the pharmaceutical industry in Lahore. HPLC with a DAD detector, C-18 column, and solid-phase cartridges were used to analyze antibiotic residues. In wastewater CIP was 3.0-5.25 mg/L, LEV was 0-6.20 mg/L, OFL was 2.45-4.12 mg/L, OTC was 0-9.40 mg/L, and DOX was 1.58-6.75 mg/L. From wastewater, antibiotics accumulate in environmental segments and impact human health. From wastewater, antibiotics accumulate in soil and plants and percolate to groundwater. The contamination level was 1,000 times higher in wastewater samples than other samples, as it is the primary source of antibiotics entering the environment. After wastewater, soil was the most contaminated environmental segment and groundwater was least contaminated by these residues, but water is very important as it is source of accumulation of antibiotics for human and animal bodies as well as to plants.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and wastewater products are emerging environmental concerns for manifold reasons, including the potential of some compounds found in these products for endocrine disruption at a very low chronic exposure level. The environmental occurrences and sources of these contaminants in the water, soil, sediment and biota in European nations and the United States are well documented. This work reports a screening-level emission and fate assessment of thirty compounds, listed in the National Reconnaissance of the United States Geological Survey (USGS, 1999-2000) as the most frequently detected organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams and rivers. Estimations of the surface water fate factors were based on Level II and Level III multimedia fugacity models for a 1000 km(2) model environment, the size of a typical county in the eastern United States. The compounds are categorized into three groups based upon the sensitivity of their predicted surface water fate factors to uncertainties in their physicochemical property values and the landscape parameters. The environmental fate factors, mass distributions, and loss pathways of all of the compounds are strongly affected by their assumed modes of entry into the environment. It is observed that for thirteen of the thirty organic wastewater contaminants most commonly detected in surface waters, conventional treatment strategies may be ineffective for their removal from wastewater effluents. The surface water fate factors predicted by the fugacity models were used in conjunction with the surface water concentrations measured in the USGS reconnaissance to obtain emission flux estimates for the compounds into U.S. streams and rivers. These include estimated fluxes of 6.8 x 10(-5) to 0.30 kg/h km(2) for the biomarker coprostanol; 1.7 x 10(-5) to 6.5 x 10(-5) kg/h km(2) for the insect repellent N, N-diethyltoluamide; and 4.3 x 10(-6) to 3.1 x 10(-5) kg/h km(2) for the steroid estriol.

AB Selection of an appropriate coagulant for removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity from wastewater generated in a pharmaceutical industry was demonstrated. The standard jar test procedure was adopted to determine the optimum pH and coagulant dosage needed for enhanced COD and turbidity removal. Alum and bentonite (montmorillonite) were chosen as coagulant and coagulant aid, respectively. Based on the results obtained from experiments, COD removal (CODRE, %) and turbidity removal (T-RE, %) were optimized using response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, the model predicted a CODRE of 67% and T-RE of 90% and CODRE of 55% and T-RE of 70% using alum (coagulant dosage = 0.79 g/L, pH 5.91) and bentonite (coagulant dosage = 0.58 g/L, pH 5.61), respectively. Confirmatory experiments conducted on the optimized condition showed experimental findings within 5% of the projected values. Though alum resulted in higher CODRE and T-RE as compared to bentonite, bentonite can have the advantage of being environmentally benign when compared to the conventionally used coagulant, alum.

AB Reusing biosolids is vital for the sustainability of wastewater management. Pyrolysis is an anoxic thermal degradation process that can be used to convert biosolids into energy rich py-gas and py-oil, and a beneficial soil amendment, biochar. Batch biosolids pyrolysis (60 minutes) revealed that triclocarban and triclosan were removed (to below quantification limit) at 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C, respectively. Substantial removal (>90%) of nonylphenol was achieved at 300 degrees C as well, but 600 degrees C was required to remove nonylphenol to below the quantification limit. At 500 degrees C, the pyrolysis reaction time to remove >90% of microconstituents was less than 5 minutes. Fate studies revealed that microconstituents were both volatilized and thermochemically transformed during pyrolysis; microconstituents with higher vapor pressures were more likely to volatilize and leave the pyrolysis reactor before being transformed than compounds with lower vapor pressures. Reductive dehalogenation products of triclocarban and suspected dehalogenation products of triclosan were identified in py-gas. Application of biosolids-derived biochar to soil in place of biosolids has potential to minimize organic microconstituents discharged to the environment provided appropriate management of py-gas and py-oil.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a chloramination disinfection by-product (DBP) with an uncertain regulatory future. While extensive literature exists on NDMA formation potentials (FP) for natural waters and for model compounds considered as NDMA precursors, less data exists on the kinetics of NDMA formation in surface and wastewaters. NDMA formation kinetics experiments were conducted in seven source waters at two monochloramine doses. NDMA formation was modeled by a simple, second-order model, using the measured NDMA(max) and monitored monochloramine concentrations at selected reaction times. The model fits NDMA formation well (R-2 > 0.88) in all source waters. While the extent of NDMA formation was highly variable, the rate constant (k(app)) values from different waters fell in a narrow range (0.01-0.09 M-1 s(-1)). This suggests that a common precursor or rate limiting step for NDMA formation likely exists despite the differences in matrices. Although further studies are needed to validate the model over a wider range of water conditions such as pH and N: Cl-2 ratios, the model could help water utilities to predict NDMA formation in distribution systems.

AB Human pharmaceuticals have been detected in wastewater treatment plants, rivers, and estuaries throughout Europe and the United States. It is widely acknowledged that there is insufficient information available to determine whether prolonged exposure to low levels of these substances is having an impact on the microbial ecology in such environments. In this study we attempt to measure the effects of exposing cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (UWC1) to six pharmaceuticals by looking at differences in metabolite levels. Initially, we used Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis to discriminate between cell cultures exposed to different pharmaceuticals. This suggested that on exposure to propranolol there were significant changes in the lipid complement of P. putida. Metabolic profiling with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), coupled with univariate statistical analyses, was used to identify endogenous metabolites contributing to discrimination between cells exposed to the six drugs. This approach suggested that the energy reserves of exposed cells were being expended and was particularly evident on exposure to propranolol. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were raised in P. putida exposed to propranolol. Increased energy requirements may be due to energy dependent efflux pumps being used to remove propranolol from the cell.

The physical and chemical properties of the as-prepared materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XPS, Raman and a surface area analyzer. The obtained porous carbon exhibited a hierarchical pore structure, large BET specific surface area (3187.91 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.781 cm(3) g(-1)) when the activation temperature reached 850 degrees C. The maximum adsorption capacities were 1072.86 and 786.18 mg g(-1) for TC and SMZ removal at 298 K, respectively. Moreover, TC and SMZ showed similar adsorption features, kinetic results could fit well using a pseudo-second-order model, intraparticle diffusion was not the rate-controlling step and adsorption isotherm results fit well with the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacities increased with contact time and adsorption temperature and, moreover, pH and external ionic species have a significant effect on adsorption efficiency. Thermodynamic studies implied that physisorption might dominate adsorption and the adsorption process is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable. The results are of importance to indicate that the as-prepared porous carbon could be used as a low-cost and effective adsorbent in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, the concentrations of 15 pharmaceuticals were monitored during four seasons (February, May, July, and November 2010) along a 32 km stretch of a highly wastewater polluted watercourse (River Rakkolanjoki, Lake Haapajarvi) in Eastern Finland. The aim was to study the seasonal variation in the elimination of the pharmaceuticals and the stability of the compounds along the watercourse. The analysis was carried out using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method combined with extraction and preconcentration on HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Pharmaceutical concentrations were determined at 9 points along the watercourse, and loads and removal of parent compounds were calculated using flow data from the discharge point and the last sampling point. The pharmaceuticals were found in concentrations ranging from low ng l(-1) to low mg l(-1) values at the discharge point and at concentrations of 0-556 ng l(-1) at the last sampling point. The rate of elimination of the pharmaceutical load was significantly higher in May and July than in February and November. There were clear differences in the stability of the individual compounds along the watercourse. Carbamazepine was not eliminated during any season, while ibuprofen, ketoprofen and sertraline were fully eliminated over the studied stretch of river during the summer months. Other compounds showed continuous elimination independent of the season, indicating different elimination paths, such as sorption, biodegradation and phototransformation, for the studied compounds.

AB Increased consumption of pharmaceutical compounds compounded by their persistence in biological treatment processes and potential toxicity is becoming a serious concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the fate of an antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), in anaerobic digestion process and its impact on methanogenic metabolism. Biochemical methane potential of CBZ with or without glucose was studied for 40 days in designed batch experiments. About 67.98% and 66.37% of spiked CBZ (about 100 mu g1(-1)) were removed during this period from glucose amended or unamended sets, respectively. Loss of CBZ through adsorption onto suspended particles, as in sterilized seed sludge control (16.98%), was significantly lower in comparison to its biotic counterparts (P=0.002 and P=0.003). Analysis of methane or biogas production revealed no inhibitory effect of CBZ toward methanogenic process at its tested concentration. Differences in cumulative methane yields between glucose containing sets with or without CBZ were insignificant (P=0.885). This study suggests that any residual CBZ concentration lower than the present study, if detected in waste-water, might not significantly affect the methanogenic process.

AB Phragmites australis carbon (PAC) was produced from Phragmites australis by phosphoric acid (H3PO4) activation. To achieve a better amoxicillin (AMX) adsorption performance, manganous dihydrogen phosphate (Mn(H2PO4)(2)) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) were impregnated, producing PAC-MP and PAC-MC, respectively. Adsorption studies were carried out in different initial AMX concentration (15-100 mg L-1), pH (2-10) and contact time (0-60 h) to evaluate AMX adsorption performance and mechanisms. The adsorption isotherms well agreed with the Langmuir model for the three adsorbents. The maximum AMX adsorption capacity on PAC, PAC-MP and PAC-MC was 110, 132 and 122 mg g(-1), respectively. Solution pH had a strong influence on AMX adsorption. For kinetic results, a significant desorption phenomenon was observed. Several possible mechanisms were elaborated which include electrostatic interaction, complexation and degradation of AMX molecules. On the whole, Mn-impregnated PAC showed superior AMX removal efficiency, which presents a promising modification method for activated carbon in the treatment of AMX containing wastewater.

AB A mixture of urban and hospital effluents (50 % v/v) was evaluated for ecotoxicity with an advanced bioassay battery. Mixed effluents were tested before any treatment, after biological treatment alone, and after biological treatment followed by a tertiary ozonation (15 mg O-3/L). Laying a high value on the continuance of organisms' fitness, essential to preserve a healthy receiving ecosystem, the main objective of this study was to combine normalized bioassays with newly developed in vivo and in vitro tests in order to assess alteration of embryo development, growth and reproduction, as well as genotoxic effects in aquatic organisms exposed to complex wastewater effluents. Comparison of the bioassays sensitivity was considered. Contrary to the lack of toxicity observed with normalized ecotoxicity tests, endpoints measured on zebrafish embryos such as developmental abnormalities and genotoxicity demonstrated a residual toxicity in wastewater both after a biological treatment followed or not by a tertiary O-3 treatment. However, the ozonation step allowed to alleviate the residual endocrine disrupting potential measure in the biologically treated effluent. This study shows that normalized bioassays are not sensitive enough for the ecotoxicological evaluation of wastewaters and that there is a great need for the development of suitable sensitive bioassays in order to characterize properly the possible residual toxicity of treated effluents.

DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER
AB Industrial wastewater is a major polluting agent in the environment as huge amounts of untreated effluents are discharged from industries causing serious effects to biotic systems. The pharmaceutical industry effluent used in the present study contains a high concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) about 500 mg L-1. In the present study, an efficient NH3-N removing strain was isolated, and enriched in the effluent with a high NH3-N concentration for its efficient removal. The strain which showed higher removal efficiency was identified as Proteus penneri by ribotyping. The wild type P. penneri exhibited low removal efficiency (64%) in 24 hours even after the conventional enrichment method. Hence, the strain was mutated to improve its degradation efficiency using a modified mariner based transposon system. It was constructed by replacing the Kan(r) gene with Gm(r) gene to develop pSC189::miniTn(Gm), since the isolated strain was resistant to kanamycin. Two mutant strains T-55 and T-132 were shown to have enhanced NH3-N removal efficiency by 84% and 81% respectively, in 24 hours. The kinetic rate constants such as pseudo first and second order kinetics were evaluated for the degradation of NH3-N by wild type P. penneri and transposon mutants; both of them followed second order rate kinetics. The NH3-N removal was confirmed by ion chromatography (IC) and Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). To date, there is no report on the strain improvement using transposon mutagenesis for the treatment of NH3-N.

AB Sewage sludge applied to soil may be a valuable fertiliser but can also introduce poorly degradable and highly adsorptive wastewater-born residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) to the soil, posing a potential risk to the receiving environment Three azole antimycotics (climbazole, ketoconazole and fluconazole), and one quaternary ammonium compound (benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride, BDDA) that are frequently detected in municipal sewage sludge and/or treated wastewater were therefore characterised in their toxicity toward terrestrial (Brassica napus) and aquatic (Lemna minor) plants. Fluconazole and climbazole showed the greatest toxicity to B. napus, while toxicity of ketoconazole and BDDA was by one to two orders of magnitude lower. Sludge amendment to soil at an agriculturally realistic rate of 5 t/ha significantly reduced the bioconcentration of BDDA in B. napus shoots compared to tests without sludge amendment, although not significantly reducing phytotoxicity. Ketoconazole, fluconazole and BDDA proved to be very toxic to L minor with median effective concentrations ranging from 55.7 mu g/L. to 969 mu g/L. In aquatic as well as terrestrial plants, the investigated azoles exhibited growth-retarding symptoms presumably related to an interference with phytohormone synthesis as known for structurally similar fungicides used in agriculture. While all four substances exhibited considerable phytotoxicity, the effective concentrations were at least one order of magnitude higher than concentrations measured in sewage sludge and effluent Based on preliminary hazard quotients, BDDA and climbazole appeared to be of greater environmental concern than the two pharmaceuticals fluconazole and ketoconazole.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil texture and drought stress on the uptake of antibiotics and the internalization of human pathogens into lettuce through root uptake following wastewater irrigation. Lettuce grown in three soils with variability in soil texture (loam, sandy loam, and sand) and under different levels of water stress (no drought control, mild drought, and severe drought) were irrigated with synthetic wastewater containing three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin and oxytetracycline) and one Salmonella strain a single time prior to harvest. Antibiotic uptake in lettuce was compound-specific and generally low. Only sulfamethoxazole was detected in lettuce with increasing uptake corresponding to increasing sand content in soil. Increased drought stress resulted in increased uptake of lincomycin and decreased uptake of oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. The internalization of Salmonella was highly dependent on the concentration of the pathogen in irrigation water. Irrigation water containing 5 Log CFU/mL Salmonella resulted in limited incidence of internalization. When irrigation water contained 8 Log CFU/mL Salmonella, the internalization frequency was significantly higher in lettuce grown in sand than in loam (p = 0.009), and was significantly higher in lettuce exposed to severe drought than in unstressed lettuce (p = 0.049). This work demonstrated how environmental factors affected the risk of contaminant uptake by food crops following wastewater irrigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several parameters of the method, solid-phase extraction (SPE)-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), were optimized to investigate the presence and partitioning of 18 antibiotics (including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, macrolides, and beta-lactams) during various processing stages at two typical pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) in northern China. Oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC), and tetracycline (TC) were all detected in each stage of both PWWTPs. Antibiotics were largely removed through biological units of both PWWTPs, with removal efficiencies of 62.0 to 78.3 %. Mass balance analyses indicated that degradation (44.8-53.7 % for PWWTP1 and 40.1-59.6 % for PWWTP2) was the major mechanism responsible for the removal of tetracyclines, whereas the contribution of sorption by sludge (12.6-20.0 % for PWWTP1 and 18.7-33.5 % for PWWTP2) was less significant for the investigated pharmaceuticals. Although there was significant removal of tetracyclines through PWWTPs, large amounts of tetracyclines were still discharged through the effluent (up to 32.0 +/- 6.0 mg L-1) and dewatered sludge (up to 5,481.1 +/- 123.0 mg kg(-1)), which increased the risk of selecting for antibiotic resistance in the receiving water and soil environments.

AB The estimation of medication use is based on the statistical data from pharmacies and hospitals. Excessive use or misuse of some compounds, especially psychoactive medications, has not yet been monitored in Slovakia. Wastewater analysis provides useful data about the medication use and misuse in individual regions. This study is focused on the analysis of 23 substances in the wastewaters of Slovakia. The monitoring programme has included stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, drug precursors and their metabolites. Urinary markers of these compounds were analysed atWWTP influent in seven regions (Bratislava, Kosice, Zvolen, Banska Bystrica, Trencin, Presov a Piest'any) using LC-MS/MS technique. The analysis was performed from March to October 2013. The pattern in use of these compounds was also monitored. Tramadol and venlafaxine were found to be the most concentrated compounds among of all studied psychoactive pharmaceuticals. The highest specific loads of tramadol were detected in Piestany (409 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) and Zvolen (366 mg/day/1000 inhabitants). There is a considerable number of spa facilities (hotels) situated in these cities and this fact contributes to a higher occurrence of these psychoactive compounds in respective wastewaters.

AB BACKGROUND: Decomposition of amoxicillin (AMX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in aqueous suspensions by two forms of ferrate (VI) were investigated. The effect of the initial concentration of antibiotics, pH, and ferrate (VI) dosage were examined. Model calculations were made by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method (RB3LYP) taking into account the environmental parameters. LanL2DZ and 6-311G(++)(d, p) were taken as basic functions for the calculations. This was followed by analysis of two redox decomposition mechanisms of the ferrate ion, with the O-2 molecule formation and electron density distribution, and the reaction mechanism of superoxide particle formation, which participates in the AMX and CIP oxidation process.
   RESULTS: Ferrate (VI) degraded CIP more effciently than AMX in both forms. Electrogenerated ferrate (VI) was more efficient than direct use of its solid form. The removal efficiencies of CIP and AMX by electrogenerated ferrate (VI) were 80.9% and 63.7%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ferrate (VI), with its high oxidizing capacity and coagulation effect, could be applied to the removal of antibiotics in wastewater treatment. The results of the AMX and CIP electron structure calculations demonstrate that electron transfer to the molecules leads to the formation of meta-stable states and causes the molecules to fragment.

AB BACKGROUND: Sertraline (SER) is a widely used antidepressant persistent in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been studied for degradation of organic contaminants. However, it usually results in poor mineralization efficiency. The effect of H2O2 on ZVI mediated degradation of SER was studied and compared with sole ZVI and the homogeneous Fenton process.
   RESULTS: The effect of ZVI dose on SER degradation was different with 20 and 200 mesh particle sizes. The degradation rate was improved as the dose of larger particle (20 mesh) was increased, while no significant variation was observed with smaller particle (200 mesh). The SER degradation was hindered by the high Fe2(+)/H2O2 ratio as well as the sharp increase of pH when high ZVI doses or small particles were used. The addition of H2O2 (5 mmol L-1) to the ZVI system greatly improved SER degradation and mineralization even at low ZVI dose (0.5 g L-1). SER could be efficiently degraded in a STP effluent mediated by ZVI (20 mesh), especially when H2O2 was employed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The potential of the ZVI/H2O2 process for degradation of SER in effluents from an STP was demonstrated, showing a significant improvement of target contaminant degradation and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Many soils at former industrial sites are degraded. The objective of this research was to determine the ability of compost, biosolids, and biosolids blends to improve soil ecosystem function with minimal potential impact to surface water. Treatments rototilled into the top 12.5 cm of soil were biosolids at 202 Mg ha(-1); biosolids at 404 Mg ha(-1); compost at 137 Mg ha(-1); or a blend consisting of biosolids applied at 202 Mg ha(-1), drinking water treatment residual, and biochar. Rainfall runoff from experimental plots was collected for 3 yr. One year after soil amendments were incorporated, a native seed mix containing grasses, legumes, and forbs was planted. Soil amendments improved soil quality and nutrient pools, established a dense and high-quality vegetative cover, and improved earthworm reproductive measures. Amendments increased soil enzymatic activities that support soil function. Biosolids treatments increased the Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index for grasses. For the forbs group, control plots had the lowest diversity index and the biosolids blend had the highest diversity index. Biosolids and compost increased the number of earthworm juveniles. In general, biosolids outperformed compost. Biosolids increased N and P in rainfall runoff more than compost before vegetation was established. Several microconstituents (i.e., pharmaceutical and personal care products) were detected in runoff water but at concentrations below the probable no-effect levels and therefore should pose little impact to the aquatic environment. Future restoration design should ensure that runoff control measures are used to control sediment loss from the restored sites at least until vegetation is established.

AB Biomixtures comprise the active part of biopurification systems (BPS) for the removal of pesticide-containing wastewater from agricultural origin. Considering that biomixtures contain an important amount of lignocellulosic substrates, their bioaugmentation with degrading ligninolytic fungi represents a promising way to improve BPS. The fungus Trametes versicolor was employed for the bioaugmentation of rice husk-compost-soil (GCS) biomixtures in order to optimize the removal of the highly toxic insecticide/nematicide carbofuran (CFN). Composition of biomixtures has not been optimized before, and usually, a volumetric composition of 50: 25: 25 (lignocellulosic substrate: humic component: soil) is employed. Optimization of the biomixture composition was performed with a central composite design, using the volumetric content of rice husk (pre-colonized by the fungus) and the volumetric ratio compost/soil as design variables. Performance of biomixtures was comprehensively assayed considering CFN removal, the production of toxic transformation products (3-hydroxycarbofuran/3-ketocarbofuran), the ability to mineralize [C-14] carbofuran, and the residual toxicity in the matrix. According to the models, the optimal volumetric composition of the GCS biomixture is 30: 43: 27, which maximizes removal and mineralization rate, and minimizes the accumulation of transformation products. Results support the value of assessing new biomixture formulations according to the target pesticide in order to obtain their optimal performance, before their use in BPS.

AB Wastewaters are considered as a significant source of pathogenic microorganisms and a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals. Disinfecting agents and antibiotics in these wastewaters can directly or indirectly influence the genetic composition of the present microorganisms and thus the occurrence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. In this study, we have investigated the composition of wastewaters from two Slovak and one Czech hospital. Using in-line solid phase extraction liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (in-line-SPE-LC-MS/MS), we monitored the occurrence of 29 pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs and their metabolites and resistant types of microorganisms. It was found that cotinine (max 1980 ng/dm(3)), tramadol (max 1570 ng/dm(3)), venlafaxine (max 248 ng/dm(3)), codeine (max 136 ng/dm(3)), oxazepam (max 113 ng/dm(3)), and oxycodone (max 102 ng/dm(3)) belong to the group of the most concentrated compounds. The number of coliform bacteria ranged from 5.5 to 7 log CFU/cm(3), while majority of strains were ampicillin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin resistant. The number of Staphylococcus aureus was lower (2.7-3.8 log CFU/cm(3)), with predominance of ampicillin and penicillin resistants. In the next part of the study, the possibility of the application of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes connected as anode for hospital wastewaters treatment was investigated. The obtained results indicate that the BDD anode is able to degrade a large scale of analyzed pharmaceuticals and drugs occurred in wastewaters with more than 60 % efficiency in 30 min.

AB Pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in the aquatic environment, and have potentially damaging effects. Effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are major sources of these substances. The use of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) STPs, involving cycling between aerobic and anoxic conditions to promote nitrification and denitrification, is increasing but these have yet to be understood in terms of removal of pharmaceutical residues. This study reports on the development of a laboratory rig to simulate a SBR. The rig was used to investigate the fate of radiolabelled propranolol. This is a commonly prescribed beta blocker, but with unresolved fate in STPs.
   The SBR rig (4.5 L) was operated on an 8 h batch cycle with settled sewage. Effective treatment was demonstrated, with clearly distinct treatment phases and evidence of nitrogen removal. Radiolabelled C-14-propranolol was dosed into both single (closed) and continuous (flow-through) simulations over 13 SBR cycles. Radioactivity in CO2 off-gas, biomass and liquid was monitored, along with the characteristics of the sewage. This allowed apparent rate constants and coefficients for biodegradation and solid:water partitioning to be determined.
   Extrapolation from off-gas radioactivity measurements in the single dose 4-d study suggested that propranolol fell outside the definitions of being readily biodegradable (DegT50 = 9.1 d; 60% biodegradation at 12.0 d). During continuous dosing, 63-72% of propranolol was removed in the rig, but less than 4% of dose recovered as (CO2)-C-14, suggesting that biodegradation was a minor process (K-biol(M) L kg d(-1) = 22 49) and that adsorption onto solids dominated, giving rise to accumulations within biomass during the 17 d solid retention time in the SBR. Estimations of adsorption isotherm coefficients were different depending on which of three generally accepted denominators representing sorption sites was used (mixed liquor suspended solids, reactor COD or mass of waste activated sludge).
   With further development and evaluation, the rig developed for simulating SBR processes has potential to be used for informing better environmental risk assessments for those pharmaceuticals showing ambiguous results in field fate studies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP), a micropollutant found at mu g/L levels in raw wastewater, was investigated with regard to its (bio)transformation during biological wastewater treatment. A pilot-scale, nitrifying/denitrifying Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with municipal wastewater was monitored for TMP removal during a 16-month monitoring study. Laboratory-scaled bioreactors spiked with TMP were applied to identify the transformation products (TPs). In total, six TPs could be identified from TMP. However, the TP formation was influenced by the spike concentration. At an initial concentration of 500 mu g/LTMP, only two TPs were found, whereas at 5 mu g/L a completely different transformation pathway led to four further TPs. At low concentrations, TMP was demethylated forming 4-desmethyl-TMP, which was then quickly hydroxylated, oxidized and cleaved forming 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (DAPC) via two intermediate TPs. DAPC was detected in the SBR effluent in a 3-d composite sample with 61 ng/L, which accounts for 52% of the attenuated TMP. The primary degradation at low spiking levels was best modelled by a pseudo-first order kinetic. Considering the SBR, the model predicted a TMP removal of 88-94% for the reactor, consistent with a monitoring campaign exhibiting an average removal of >83%. Both the TP formation profiles and kinetic modelling indicated that only the results from the bioreactor tests at low spike concentrations were representative of the transformation in the SBR.

AB The efficiency of UV irradiation for the removal of the antimycotic drugs fluconazole (FCZ) and climbazole (CBZ) from water samples is evaluated. Degradation experiments, at laboratory scale, were carried out with spiked aliquots of ultrapure water solutions and treated wastewater samples using low-pressure mercury lamps emitting at 254 nm. Time course of precursor pollutants and identification of arising transformation products (TPs) was performed by injection of different reaction time aliquots in a liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) system. Chemical structures of identified TPs were proposed from their full-product ion spectra, acquired using different collision energies. During UV irradiation experiments, the half-lives (t(1/2)) of FCZ and CBZ were similar in ultrapure water solutions and wastewater samples; however, the first species was more recalcitrant than the second one. Four TPs were identified in case of FCZ resulting from substitution of fluorine atoms by hydroxyl moieties and intramolecular cyclization with fluorine removal. CBZ interacted with UV radiation through reductive dechlorination, hydroxylation and cleavage of the ether bond; moreover, five additional primary TPs, with the same empirical formula as CBZ, were also noticed. Given the relatively long t(1/2) of FCZ under direct photolysis (ca. 42 min), UV irradiation was combined with H2O2 addition to promote formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals. Under such conditions, the degradation rate of FCZ was enhanced significantly and no TPs were detected. These latter conditions allowed also the effective removal of CBZ TPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Amoxicillin (AMX) is a widespread beta-lactam-antibiotic and, together with some of its transformation products (TPs) originating from hydrolysis, a known environmental contaminant. To shed light on the abiotic degradation of AMX and the stability of its known TPs, laboratory hydrolysis experiments of AMX were carried out at pH 3, 7 and 11. Not only the rate of hydrolysis but also the pattern of TPs was strongly pH-dependent. The time courses of the obtained transformation products were analyzed by UPLC-HR-QToF-MS. AMX penicilloic acid (TP 1), AMX 2',5'-diketopiperazine (TP 2), AMX penilloic acid (TP 3) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazinol (TP 4) were found at neutral pH. Surprisingly, the first three were not stable but transformed into 23 yet unknown TPs within three to four weeks. Seven TPs were tentatively identified, based on their product ion spectra and, where possible, confirmed with reference standards, e.g. penicillamine disulfide, 2-[amino(carboxy)methyl]-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and dehydrocarboxylated amoxicillin penilloic acid. Analysis of samples from municipal wastewater treatment plants confirmed these findings with TP 1 being the dominant TP in the influent and a shift towards TP 2, TP 3 and TP 4 in the effluents. The lab experiments predicted up to 13 consecutive TPs from TP 1, TP 2 and TP 3 under neutral conditions. Their detection from surface waters will be difficult, because their large number and slow formation kinetics will lead to comparatively low environmental concentrations. Nevertheless the abiotic degradation of TP 1, TP 2 and TP 3 to further TPs needs to be considered in future studies of the environmental fate of amoxicillin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) was applied to the effluent from a pharmaceutical industrial complex, following the US EPA TIE guidelines. The whole effluent toxicity (WET) test found toxicity greater than 16 toxic units (TU) in the effluent. Dissolved non-polar organic compounds were identified as the major contributor to the observed toxicity in the TIE manipulations in phases I and II. Among the 48 organic compounds identified, three compounds (i.e., acetophenone, benzoimide, and benzothiazole) were related to the pharmaceutical production procedure; however, no contribution to toxicity was predicted in the compounds. The results of the ECOSAR model, which predicts toxicity, indicated that the alkane compounds caused significant toxicity in the effluent. The toxicity test and heavy metal analysis, which used IC and ICP/MS, identified that particulate and heavy metals, such as Cu and Zn, contributed to the remaining toxicity, except dissolved organics. The results showed the applicability of the TIE method for predicting regional effluents produced by the industrial pharmaceutical complex in this study. Although the location was assumed to be affected by discharge of pharmaceutical related compounds in the river, no correlations were observed in the study. Based on the results, advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, are recommended for the wastewater treatment process in this location. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Batch and column experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of organic matter, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals and to identify the removal mechanisms of the target contaminants. The sands used in the experiments were obtained from the Youngsan River located in South Korea. Neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals (iopromide, estrone, and trimethoprim) were removed with efficiencies greater than 80% from different sand media during experiments, due to the effect of sorption between sand and pharmaceuticals. However, the anionic pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac) were more effectively removed by natural sand, compared to baked sand. These observations were mainly attributed to biodegradation under natural conditions of surface organic matter and ATP concentrations. The removal of organic matter and nitrogen was also found to increase under biotic conditions. Therefore, it is indicated that biodegradation plays an important role and act as major mechanisms for the removal of organic matter, nutrients, and selected pharmaceuticals during sand passage and the managed aquifer recharge, which is an effective treatment method for removing target contaminants. However, the low removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals (e.g., carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole) require additional processes (e.g., AOPs, NF and RO membrane), a long residence time, and long travel distance for increasing the removal efficiencies.

AB Iron is the most common metal by mass on earth and represents the basic element of industrial society. The usage of iron to synthesize consumer products and to remediate environment is an attractive approach. This perspective presents applications of the high-valent iron oxo compound (FeO42-)-O-VI (ferrate) in sustainable organic synthesis and treatment technology. In synthesizing organic molecules, C-H bond activation and selectivity are two basic ingredients of efficiency, which are attainable by ferrate. Examples of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and conversion of alcohols to aldehyde/ketone are presented. In addition, many other organic molecules of amines, aniline, phenolic, and thiol functionalities can be oxidized by ferrate. This oxidation chemistry of ferrate is expedient in transforming pharmaceuticals, micropollutants in bodies of water with implications for human and ecological health. A wide range of micropollutants, which are commonly found in drinking water resources and wastewater effluents, can be efficiently oxidized by ferrate on a seconds to minutes time scale. These molecules include endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, beta-blockers, antidepressants, X-ray contrast media, and cosmetic products. The reaction pathways of transformation of the studied pharmaceuticals are discussed. The results of the evaluation of toxicity of the oxidized products are given. The reduced product of ferrate is the environmentally friendly and magnetic iron(III) oxide. Ferrate, as a green molecule, has true potential in sustainable production of organics and treating emerging pollutants in water.

AB In this study, pharmaceutical wastewater with high salinity and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) was treated by an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and an anaerobic bio-entrapped membrane reactor (AnBEMR). The microbial populations and communities were analyzed using the 454 pyrosequencing method. The hydraulic retention time (HRT), membrane flux and mean cell residence time (MCRT) were controlled at 30.6 h, 6 L/m(2) h and 100 d, respectively. The results showed that the AnBEMR achieved higher TCOD removal efficiency and greater biogas production compared to the AnMBR. Through DNA pyrosequencing analysis, both the anaerobic MBRs showed similar dominant groups of bacteria and archaea. However, phylum Elusimicrobia of bacteria was only detected in the AnBEMR; the higher abundance of dominant archaeal genus Methanimicrococcus found in the AnBEMR could play an important role in degradation of the major organic pollutant (i.e., trimethylamine) present in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Annular centrifugal contactors (ACCs), which use centrifugal force to separate the dispersion of two immiscible liquids of different densities, have been utilized in many industrial fields, such as the petroleum, hydrometallurgy, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical processing, protein extraction, enantioselective chemical separation, biodiesel synthesis, and nuclear industries. Detailed hydrodynamic information, such as the liquid hold-up volume and the interface radius, is very important for successful design and operation of ACCs. A new method, namely, the liquid-fast-separation method, was developed to (1) obtain the parameters of the liquid hold-up volume, the actual phase ratio (aqueous phase/organic phase, a/o) of two phases in the mixing zone, and the interface radius, and (2) investigate the effects of the rotor speed, the total flow rate, the flow ratio (a/o), and the diameter of the heavy phase weir on these parameters. The experimental results indicated that the parameters of the liquid hold-up volume, the actual phase ratio (a/o) of two phases in the mixing zone, and the interface radius could be obtained using the liquid-fast-separation method. Moreover, the effects of the rotor speed, the total flow rate, the flow ratio (a/o), and the diameter of the heavy phase weir on these parameters could also be obtained. These results provide a more complete understanding of the fluid flow in ACCs to enable further advancements in their design and operation.

AB This study investigated the powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption of 13 pharmaceuticals from the primary (and secondary) effluents of a wastewater treatment plant. In addition to fresh PAC, PAC that was previously used for pharmaceutical elimination from the secondary effluent was also examined for its reuse potential in the primary effluent. The results showed a comparably negligible pharmaceutical uptake by fresh and used PACs in the primary effluent, in contrast to a substantial uptake by both PACs in the secondary effluent. This result indicated a severe adsorption competition induced from the primary effluent organic matter, i.e. the considerably higher constituents of low molecular and hydrophobic components. Furthermore, the competition effect even resulted in a desorption of the negatively charged pharmaceuticals from the used PAC into the primary effluent. It was concluded that adding fresh PAC to the secondary effluent is preferred and that recycling the used PAC into the activated sludge tank could not offer an additional pharmaceutical adsorption.

AB The occurrence and fate of 48 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different urbanization areas in Xiamen, China was investigated over one year. Results showed that PPCPs were widely detected, but the major PPCPs in the influent, effluent, and sludge were different. Spatial and seasonal variations of PPCP levels in the influent and sludge were observed. The removal efficiencies for most PPCPs were similar among the three WWTPs, although they employed different biological treatment processes. Furthermore, the mass loadings per inhabitant of most pharmaceuticals had a positive correlation with the urbanization levels, indicating that most pharmaceutical usage was higher in the urban core compared to the suburban zones. The total mass loadings of all the 48 PPCPs in the effluent and waste sludge showed close proportions, which suggested the importance of proper waste sludge disposal to prevent a large quantity of PPCPs from entering the environment.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has triggered concern among the general population and received considerable attention from the scientific community in recent years. However, only a few publications have focused on anticancer drugs, a class of pharmaceuticals that can exhibit cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. The present study investigated the photodegradation, biodegradation, bacterial toxicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of cyclophosphamide (CP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The photodegradation experiments were performed at a neutral to slight pH range (7-7.8) using two different lamps (medium-pressure mercury lamp and a xenon lamp). The primary elimination of the parent compounds was monitored by means of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS/MS). NPOC (non-purgeable organic carbon) analyses were carried out in order to assess mineralization rates. The Closed Bottle Test (CBT) was used to assess ready biodegradability. A new method using Vibrio fischeri was adopted to evaluate toxicity. CP was not degraded by any lamp, whereas 5-FU was completely eliminated by irradiation with the mercury lamp but only partially by the Xe lamp. No mineralization was observed for the experiments performed with the Xe lamp, and a NPOC removal of only 18% was registered for 5-FU after 256 min using the UV lamp. Not one of the parent compounds was readily biodegradable in the CBT. Photo transformation products (PTPs) resulting from photolysis were neither better biodegradable nor less toxic than the parent compound 5-FU. In contrast, the results of the tests carried out with the UV lamp indicated that more biodegradable and non-toxic PTPs of 5-FU were generated. Three PTPs were formed during the photodegradation experiments and were identified. The results of the in silico QSAR predictions showed positive mutagenic and genotoxic alerts for 5-FU, whereas only one of the formed PTPs presented positive alerts for the genotoxicity endpoint.

AB Manganese dioxide formed in oxidation process by potassium permanganate exhibits promising adsorptive capacity which can be utilized to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. However, the structure variances of organic molecules lead to wide difference of adsorption efficiency. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a general relationship between removal rate of organic compounds and their quantum parameters. This study focused on building up quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models based on experimental removal rate (r (exp)) of 25 organic compounds and 17 quantum parameters of each organic compounds computed by Gaussian 09 and Material Studio 6.1. The recommended model is r (pre) = -0.502 -aEuro parts per thousand 7.742 f(+)(x) + 0.107 E (HOMO) + 0.959 q(H+) + 1.388 BO (x). Both internal and external validations of the recommended model are satisfied, suggesting optimum stability and predictive ability. The definition of applicability domain and the Y-randomization test indicate all the prediction is reliable and no possibility of chance correlation. The recommended model contains four variables, which are closely related to adsorption mechanism. f(+)(x) reveals the degree of affinity for nucleophilic attack. E (HOMO) represents the difficulty of electron loss. q(H+) reflect the distribution of partial charge between carbon and hydrogen atom. BO (x) shows the stability of a molecule.

AB The uptake of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) by carrot and lettuce was investigated. Degradation of PBDEs in soil in the absence of the plants was discarded. Different carrot (Nantesa and Chantenay) and lettuce (Batavia Golden Spring and Summer Queen) varieties were grown in fortified or contaminated compost-amended soil mixtures under greenhouse conditions. After plant harvesting, roots (core and peel) and leaves were analyzed separately for carrot, while for lettuce, leaves and hearts were analyzed together. The corresponding bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were calculated. In carrots, a concentration gradient of 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-138) became evident that decreased from the root peel via root core to the leaves. For decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) at the low concentration level (7 and 20 ng g(-1)), the leaves incorporated the highest concentration of the target substance. For lettuce, a decrease in the BCF value (from 0.24 to 0.02) was observed the higher the octanol-water partition coefficient, except in the case of BDE-183 (BCF = 0.51) and BDE-209 (BCF values from 0.41 to 0.74). Significant influence of the soils and crop varieties on the uptake could not be supported. Metabolic debromination, hydroxylation or methylation of the target PBDEs in the soil-plant system was not observed.

AB This study analyzed 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two rivers with different urbanization levels in the surrounding watershed (urban and suburb) in Beijing, China. Along the rivers, effluent samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and wastewater samples from direct discharge outlets were also collected to reveal their possible contribution to the occurrence of PPCPs in these two rivers. Among the 15 PPCPs, 14 compounds were detected with caffeine (maximum 11 900 ng L-1) being the dominant compound. The total concentration of the detected PPCPs in direct discharge outlets (median 4706 ng L-1) was much higher than that in river waters (2780 ng L-1) and WWTP effluents (1971 ng L-1). The suburban-influenced Liangshui River had significantly higher PPCP concentrations compared to the urban-influenced Qing River due to more input of untreated wastewater from direct discharge outlets. Source apportionment showed that approximately 55% of the total PPCPs were contributed by untreated wastewater in the suburban-influenced river. Finally, ecological risk assessment has been regarded as a necessary part of general research. According to the environmental risk assessment results, caffeine, trimethoprim and metoprolol were found to be the most critical compounds, due to their high risk quotient values. The results of the present study can provide useful information for future PPCP pollution control and sustainable water management in Beijing, China.

AB Assessment of the fate of pharmaceutical residues in the environment involves the measurement or prediction of their sewage sludge partition coefficient (K-d). Sewage sludge can be classified into four types: primary, activated, secondary and digested, each one with different physical and chemical properties. Published studies have measured K-d for pharmaceuticals in a variety of sludge types. This paper discusses the variability of reported K-d values of pharmaceuticals in different types of sewage sludge, using a dataset generated from the literature. Using a meta-analysis approach, it was shown that the measured K-d values depend on the type of sludge used in the test. Recommendations are given for the type of sludge to be used when studying the partitioning behaviour of pharmaceuticals in waste water treatment plants. Activated sludge is preferred due to its more homogenous nature and the ease of collection of consistent samples at a plant. Weak statistical relationships were found between K-d values for activated and secondary sludge, and for activated and digested sludge. Pooling of K-d values for these sludge types is not recommended for preliminary fate and risk assessments. In contrast, statistical analyses found stronger similarities between K-d values reported for the same pharmaceutical in primary and activated sludges. This allows the pooling of experimental values for these two sludge types to obtain a larger dataset for modelling purposes.

AB The 350 ML per d Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) tertiary facility produces "Class A" water for the city of Melbourne, Australia, which is used for irrigation, dual reticulation and fire fighting. The ETP process utilizes ozone and biological media filtration as part of the advanced treatment train for secondary treated waste-water. An extensive sampling campaign was carried out to evaluate the removal of hundreds of contaminants of concern through various steps in the treatment train, as well as identify the formation of any byproducts of the treatment process. Degradation of contaminants throughout the treatment was mainly controlled by the ozone process. Chemicals with moderate to high reaction rates with ozone and/or (OH)-O-center dot radical (10 M-1 s(-1) <= k(O3) or k(O3) < 10 M-1 s(-1) and k. OH = 5 x 109 M-1 s(-1)) were removed by the tertiary treatment to below the detection limit. However, the advanced treatment train resulted in some contaminants increasing in concentration (i.e. NDMA and desisopropyl atrazine) and other newly forming contaminants, such as trihalomethanes and chloral hydrate. The resulting levels of contaminants of concern remaining in the ETP final effluent were below levels of relevance based on guidelines for reuse in irrigation or discharge to the environment.

AB The purpose of this work was the economic assessment of different municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluent treatment operating strategies based on the combination of nanofiltration (NF) and EDDS-assisted solar photo-Fenton at neutral pH or ozonation at natural pH. The study focused on micro-contaminant (MC) removal as evaluated by LC-Qtrap-MS. Direct treatment of MCs in MWTP effluents was compared with their treatment in an NF rejection stream. Costs were estimated based on a flow rate of 1000 m(3) per day (365 operating days per year) and over 90% degradation of 35 different MCs. The highest operating costs were related to EDDS and the hydrogen peroxide for photo-Fenton, pumping for NF and O-3 generation for ozonation. It was concluded that both photo-Fenton and ozonation applied to NF rejection lowered treatment costs compared to MWTP effluent treatment. Ozonation was the most economical in all cases.

AB Municipal wastewater contains a number of harmful chemicals whose concentrations can fluctuate dramatically. Therefore studying concentrations of harmful chemicals by conventional grab water sampling can give a misleading picture of the true chemical contents. In grab samples the contents can often remain below the quantification limit which does not necessary mean the compound is not present in the aquatic environment but rather implies unsuccessful timing of sampling or limited sample volume. Alternative techniques are needed to improve the reliability of monitoring harmful chemicals and thus in this study the presence of organotin compounds (OTCs) was monitored at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with Chemcatcher (R) passive sampling. Extreme conditions complicate the passive sampling, particularly in influent stream. However, the OTC concentrations determined with passive samplers were similar with those measured from grab samples. In conclusion, fewer OTCs were found with grab sampling than with passive sampling, particularly in effluent. The passive samplers seemed to be more suitable than grab samples for monitoring OTCs in wastewaters. As long-term sampling techniques give a more representative picture of the true chemical contents, passive sampling should be considered as an emerging tool for environmental authorities to implement the monitoring of harmful chemicals at WWTP.

AB This work involves the study of the influence of textural and chemical adsorbent properties on natural organic matter (NOM) removal and the simultaneous adsorption of caffeine and NOM in pharmaceutical wastewater. The performance of a microporous activated carbon, Calgon F400, a synthesized mesoporous carbon from peach stones and a commercial sepiolite in the removal of NOM of a WWTP effluent, and the competitive adsorption of caffeine/NOM were evaluated. It was evidenced that the microporous structure of the adsorbents significantly conditioned the removal of NOM, finding that F400 activated carbon (microporous volume of 0.46 cm(3) g(-1)) led to a NOM removal of 45%. The presence of NOM in the aqueous medium led to worse adsorption parameters, including adsorption capacity at breakthrough time, mass transfer zone length and fractional bed utilization. Additionally, an overshooting in the Total Organic Carbon concentration (TOC/TOC0 = 1.05) was observed in the sepiolite adsorption fixed-bed experiment, due to the displacement of the background NOM. The tested adsorbents were efficient in the removal of caffeine from a pharmaceutical wastewater, finding a competitive effect between the target compound and the background NOM for the active sites.

AB The paucity of information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment in African countries led the authors to investigate 8 acidic pharmaceuticals (4 antipyretics, 3 antibiotics, and 1 lipid regulator) in wastewater, surface water, and sediments from the Msunduzi River in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The method recoveries, limits of detection (LOD), and limits of quantification were determined. The method recoveries were 58.4% to 103%, and the LODs ranged between 1.16 ng/L and 29.1 ng/L for water and between 0.58 ng/g and 14.5 ng/g for sediment. The drugs were all present in wastewater and in most of the surface water and sediment samples. Aspirin was the most abundant pharmaceutical observed, 118 +/- 0.82 mu g/L in wastewater influent, and the most observed antibiotic was nalidixic acid (25.2-29.9 mu g/L in wastewater); bezafibrate was the least observed. The distribution pattern of the antipyretic in water indicates more impact in suburban sites. The solid-liquid partitioning of the pharmaceuticals between sediment and water, measured as the distribution coefficient (log K-D) gave an average accumulation magnitude of 10x to 32x in sediments than in water. The downstream distribution patterns for both water and sediment indicate discharge contributions from wastewater, agricultural activities, domestic waste disposal, and possible sewer system leakages. Although concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were comparable with those obtained from some other countries, the contamination of the present study site with pharmaceuticals has been over time and continues at present, making effective management and control necessary.

   CONTAMINATION
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include a wide variety of compounds like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites. In developing countries, CEC are gaining interest as they are contaminating the water resources. In Tunisia, for the first time, a total of 25 PPCPs and three of their metabolites were analysed in wastewater, reclaimed water, surface water and groundwater. Most of selected CEC were detected not only in raw wastewater, but also in treated wastewater and reclaimed water. High contents of Cl and Na in wastewater and reclaimed water were an indication of industrial discharge. PPCPs were detected in surface water from the Meliane River; the highest concentrations were measured close to the estuary to the Mediterranean Sea. High concentrations of 2-OH-ibuprofene in the Meliane River downstream a wastewater treatment plant might result from the biodegradation of ibuprofen during secondary wastewater treatment. Based on their levels of concentration, it is proposed to use carbamazepine, caffeine, ibuprofene, atenolol, fenofibric acid, methylparabene, bisphenol A, and 2-OH-ibuprofene as indicators of wastewater-derived pollution of surface water resources in Tunisia. Salinity of the groundwater in the study area is controlled by sea water entered decades ago due to over-pumping of groundwater. Groundwater quality is also influenced by CEC as sulfamethoxazol, carbamazepine, methylparabene, propylparabene, bisphenol A, trichlosan, and 1-H-benzotriazole were detected in groundwater collected from an area exposed to irrigation with reclaimed water. The presence of these compounds indicates that they are not completely removed during soil passage according to incomplete sorption and/or biodegradation. Thus, these compounds are suggested as indicators of wastewater contamination confirming the pollution of groundwater resources at sites where wastewater is reused for irrigation in agriculture. Special attention has to be paid to the occurrence of TRS occurring in groundwater since this compound is recognized to produce antibiotic resistance in the environment.

AB Global water scarcity is driving the need for identifying new water source. Wastewater could be a potential water resource if appropriate treatment technologies could be developed. One of the barriers to obtaining high quality water from wastewater arises from the presence of organic micropollutants, which are biologically active at trace levels. Removal of these compounds from wastewater by current physico-chemical technologies is prohibitively expensive. While biological treatment processes are comparatively cheap, current systems are not capable of degrading the wide range of organic micropollutants present in wastewater. As current wastewater treatment processes were developed for treating conventional pollutants present at mg/L levels, degrading the ng/L levels of micropollutants will require a different approach to system design and operation. In this paper we discuss strategies that could be employed to develop biological wastewater treatment systems capable of degrading organic micropollutants.

AB Beneficial reuse of reclaimed water is the use of domestic or municipal wastewater that has been treated to a suitable quality for a specific use and takes the place of potable and/or raw water that would otherwise be needed from another source. This planned practice has been implemented for decades and has been identified as an important option in water supply portfolios for many communities. However, with unique water resources challenges arising as a result of increasing populations, interannual climate variability, projections of prolonged droughts in some regions, and corresponding shifts from reliance on groundwater to surface water supplies for potable water, conjunctive water reuse is being increasingly recognized as an important approach to increase water use efficiency and to diversify water resources management portfolios. Drought is one of the most important drivers for conjunctive reuse, and national trends indicate a growing interest in providing sustainable water supply solutions through broader application of reuse. This chapter identifies the importance of reuse as part of integrated water resources planning and how conjunctive water reuse can provide a locally available, drought- proof supply of water. There are a number of reuse types that this chapter describes, and it also addresses the shift in thinking about reuse as a potable water supply. With a better understanding of the various types of reuse and how treatment technologies can be employed to meet any water quality objective, informed decisions can be made about how to implement reuse to better address the challenges of a changing climate.

AB The growing water stress both in terms of water scarcity and quality deterioration promotes the development of reclaimed water as a new water resource use. This paper reviewed wastewater reuse practices in China, and the opportunities and challenges of expanding reclaimed water use were analyzed. Rapid urbanization with the increasing of water demand and wastewater discharge provides an opportunity for wastewater reuse. The vast amount of wastewater discharge and low reclaimed water production mean that wastewater reuse still has a great potential in China. Many environmental and economic benefits and successful reclamation technologies also provide opportunities for wastewater reuse. In addition, the overall strategy in China is also encouraging forwastewater reuse. In the beginning stage ofwastewater reclamation and reuse, there aremany significant challenges to expand wastewater reuse in China including slow pace in adopting urban wastewater reuse programs, the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs, incoherent water quality requirements, the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and the strengthening of public awareness and cooperation among stakeholders.

AB To investigate the degradation of high concentration pollutant by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature, 10,000mg/L acid orange 7 (AO7) aqueous solution was treated by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at 80 degrees C. First, the effect of the operating temperature (30-80 degrees C) on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles was investigated thoroughly. Then, the studies on the effect of theoretical Cu mass loading, Fe/Cu dosage, stirring speed and initial pH on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles at a high temperature (i.e., 80 degrees C) were carried out, respectively. The degradation and transformation process of AO7 was studied by using COD, TOC and UV-Vis spectra. The results indicate that high concentration pollutant could be removed effectively by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature. And the removal efficiencies of AO7 by Fe/Cu bimetallic system were in accordance with the pseudo-first-order model. Finally, it was observed that the high temperature could accelerate mass transport rate and overcome the high activation energy barrier to significantly improve the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles. Therefore, the higher removal efficiency could be obtained by Fe/Cu system at a high operating temperature. Thus, the high operating temperature played a leading role in the degradation of high concentration pollutant.

AB This article presents the results of the degradation of clofibric acid by ozonation. Furthermore, results of the toxic effect of clofibric acid and its intermediate compound, 4-chlorophene generated during the oxidation process, to alga Selenastrum capricornium, are also discussed. The degradation and mineralization of the compound are studied according to the optimized operating conditions. These variables include pH, conductivity, hydraulic retention time and the use of a mixing maze. All the trials are conducted in a purpose-built pilot-scale reactor. Working under the optimal operating conditions (pH=9, HRT=12.5min and ozone dose=14 +/- 2 gN/m(3)), a degradation value of 98% was obtained, although mineralization of the compound did not occur. Results show that clofibric acid and its intermediate are toxic during the first 10min of treatment for concentrations equal to or greater than 1mg/L. Under optimal conditions toxicity is not observed for any concentrations.

AB Pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are detected in the environment in trace quantities, most at less than one part-per-billion (i. e. <1 mu g/l). There are three main pathways by which active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) can reach the environment. The vast majority of APIs found in water systems are a result of normal patient and consumer use and excretion into sewer and wastewater treatment systems. A second pathway is improper disposal of unused or expired medicines by consumers who flush them down toilets or pour them into drains. The third pathway is through wastewater discharged from API manufacturing sites. There are several other minor pathways, such as landfill leachate or hospital discharges, that may also present localised sources of API introduction to the environment. Given the widespread consumption of pharmaceuticals in developed countries, it is likely that pharmaceutical residues are present in the wastewater of virtually all households where the occupants are using such products as medicines. The contribution of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities to the levels of APIs in the environment is low when compared with the amount excreted by patients consuming the drugs. However, manufacturing losses are one area that can be controlled by manufacturers. The extent of improper disposal of unused medicines is currently unknown. What is known is that flushing them into sewage and wastewater treatment systems can have a significant impact on the API load entering the treatment plant and the concentrations discharged in the effluent. Given the demonstrated presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, coupled with their high profile, it is not surprising that they have attracted a disproportionate amount of attention. While concerns are understandable, one should not lose sight of the fact that there are many other chemical species reaching the environment and that APIs represent just one subset of multiple emerging pollutants.

AB This chapter examines potential risks posed by active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) present in the aquatic environment to humans and aquatic life. We begin by describing the mechanisms by which pharmaceuticals enter the vertebrate body, produce effects and leave the body. Then we describe theoretical and practical issues limiting the certainty which can be expected from risk estimates. This is followed by a description of particular considerations applicable to evaluation of human risks, along with a summary of methods and conclusions from some important studies examining those risks. A similar discussion of theoretical issues and selected data relevant for estimating risks to aquatic life is then presented. We finish by discussing potential contributions of antibiotics present in the environment to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. We conclude that there are too few data to definitively address every concern, particularly risks to aquatic life and contributions to development of antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, available data suggest risks to humans are very low for all active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and risks to aquatic life are very low for most APIs. Although aquatic risks cannot be as confidently ruled out for a few APIs, potential risks are probably limited to particularly contaminated regions in close vicinity to concentrated pollution sources, such as wastewater treatment plant outfalls.

AB Essentially ubiquitous in our environment, residues of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals somewhat paradoxically represent an emerging and increasing risk to wild biota. Whilst in recent years a great deal of analytical effort has been expended to quantify the presence of many pharmaceutical contaminants, especially in freshwater systems, our real understanding of the risks posed to most clades of wildlife, aquatic and terrestrial alike, still lags behind. In particular, relevant field-based studies regarding possible chronic impacts in higher terrestrial wildlife (birds, mammals, reptiles, etc.) remain all too scarce. Yet, for example, over the past two decades Old World Gyps vultures on the Indian subcontinent have been virtually extirpated due to non-target exposure to a single synthetic pharmaceutical compound, diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Here, we highlight and discuss the myriad possible exposure routes to terrestrial wildlife, consider the analytical and monitoring approaches that are already in use or that could be used in future research, and reflect upon a selection of legislative approaches currently being applied to identified terrestrial impacts. Finally, with the ultimate aim of encouraging further applied ecotoxicology-based research in this emerging field, we highlight several priorities for future inquiry, with special emphasis on non-target effects in previously overlooked but potentially vulnerable or highly representative clades of wildlife exposed within environmentally relevant, real-world scenarios.

TI Recovery of tyrosol from aqueous streams using hydrophobic ionic

AB Tyrosol is a high-value added polyphenolic compound with inherent antioxidant properties and increasing market demand for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry applications. As a natural occurring antioxidant, the main source of tyrosol is olive mill wastewater (OMW), a by-product of olive oil processing that causes serious environmental issues due to its large volumes with high organic loads. Therefore, the valorization of OMW by recovering valuable antioxidants whilst reducing the overall toxicity of the aqueous stream is an attractive approach to promote sustainable OMW treatment and management. Herein we propose the utilization of hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) to replace conventional volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as extraction solvents to recover tyrosol from aqueous solutions. The operating temperature, the solvent to feed ratio, the effect of salt addition, the solvent physical properties and the solvent structure have been studied to optimize the extraction efficiency of tyrosol from water using [P-4441][Tf2N], [N-4441][Tf2N], and [N-8881][Tf2N] ILs. Comprehensive experimental comparisons using ethyl acetate as a benchmark VOC solvent for tyrosol recovery have been performed. Moreover, the regeneration of the ILs and their subsequent recycling into the tyrosol extraction process have been addressed. Results show the capability of the aforementioned ILs to efficiently recover tyrosol under optimum operating conditions. Adding sodium salts, mainly NaCl, was proven to enhance the tyrosol selectivity towards the IL phase. Moreover, the solubility of ILs in the aqueous phase was found negligible, unlike ethyl acetate, and the water solubility in ethyl acetate was notably higher than in the hydrophobic ILs. Furthermore, back-extraction of tyrosol using inexpensive NaOH followed by IL recycling into the extraction process was successfully accomplished. Additional quantum chemical calculations were performed to provide insights into the behaviour of tyrosol-IL systems. Finally, [P-4441] [Tf2N] was revealed particularly promising for tyrosol recovery, providing similar extraction efficiency as conventional VOC solvents, proven capacity for regeneration and subsequent recycling, and adequate physical properties.

AB The development of practicable and retrievable adsorbents with high adsorption capacity is a technical imperative for water treatment. Herein, we reported a new convenient macroscopic granular adsorbent for the removal of tetracycline (TC) from water by immobilizing porous carbons (PCs) which were obtained via one-step in situ pyrolysis from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt dihydrate (EDTA-2K center dot 2H(2)O) into carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMCS) gel beads utilising molecular cross-linking. A remarkable similarity can be observed between multivariant gel beads and EDTA-2K center dot 2H(2)O derived porous carbons (EPCs) according to the characterization results. The adsorption performance was evaluated using batch adsorption studies of TC in aqueous solution: the kinetic results could be fit well by a pseudo-second-order model and intraparticle diffusion was treated as the rate-controlling step; equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 136.9 mg g(-1) at 298 K. Importantly, these results indicate that the as-prepared gel beads could be used as facile adsorbents in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in freshwater ecosystems, and several studies have reported bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms in those ecosystems. River biofilms are exceptional indicators of pollution, but very few studies have focused on the accumulation of these emerging contaminants. The objectives of this study were first to develop an efficient analytical methodology for the simultaneous analysis of 44 pharmaceuticals and 13 endocrine disrupting compounds in biofilm, and second, to assess persistence, distribution, and bioaccumulation of these contaminants in natural biofilms inhabiting a WWTP-impacted river. The method is based on pressurized liquid extraction, purification by solid-phase extraction, and analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in tandem. Recoveries for pharmaceuticals were 31-137%, and for endocrine disruptors 32-93%. Method detection limits for endocrine disruptors were in the range of 02-2.4 ng g(-1), and for pharmaceuticals, 0.07-6.7 ng g(-1). A total of five endocrine disruptors and seven pharmaceuticals were detected in field samples at concentrations up to 100 ng g(-1). (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Increasing evidence exists that emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) can be bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms. However, the relative role of trophic transfers in the acquisition of emerging pollutants by aquatic organisms remains largely unexplored. In freshwater ecosystems, wastewater treatment plants are a major source of PhACs and EDCs. Here we studied the entrance of emerging pollutants and their flow through riverine food webs in an effluent-influenced river. To this end we assembled a data set on the composition and concentrations of a broad spectrum of PhACs (25 compounds) and EDCs (12 compounds) in water, biofilm, and three aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa with different trophic positions and feeding strategies (Ancylus fluviatilis, Hydropsyche sp., Phagocata vitta). We tested for similarities in pollutant levels among these compartments, and we compared observed bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to those predicted by a previously-developed empirical model based on octanol-water distribution coefficients (D-ow). Despite a high variation in composition and levels of emerging pollutants across food web compartments, observed BAFs in Hydropsyche and Phagocata matched, on average, those already predicted. Three compounds (the anti-inflammatory drug didofenac, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the flame retardant TBEP) were detected in water, biofilm and (at least) one macroinvertebrate taxa. TBEP was the only compound present in all taxa and showed magnification across trophic levels. This suggests that prey consumption may be, in some cases, a significant exposure route. This study advances the notion that both waterborne exposure and trophic interactions need to be taken into account when assessing the potential ecological risks of emerging pollutants in aquatic ecosystems.

AB In this paper, we investigated the occurrence of three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin) and three antiretroviral (lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine) drugs in the Nairobi River Basin, Kenya. The analytical procedure involved extraction using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS). In this study, 40 sites were selected for sampling, including 38 sites along the rivers and 2 wastewater treatment effluent sites. All the studied compounds were detected with sulfamethoxazole having the highest detection frequency of 97.5% and ciprofloxacin had the lowest at 60%. The results showed that the concentration of the drugs increased in highly populated regions especially within the informal settlements. The maximum (median) concentrations in the river waters for sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine in ng/L were 13,800 (1800), 2650 (327), 509 (129), 5430 (1000), 4860 (769), and 7680 (660), respectively. The maximum concentrations in the river waters were generally higher than those of the wastewater treatment plant effluents signifying that the rivers are substantially contaminated by domestic wastewater. The environmental risk was evaluated by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) for algae, daphnia and fish based on the maximum and median concentrations of the analytes in the river basin and was expressed as the ratios of measured environmental concentrations (MEC) to predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). The RQs ranged from 0 to 507.8 and apart from lamivudine that had a low RQ all the other analytes had RQ > 1 at maximum and median measured concentrations for at least one taxonomic group. The high RQs are indicative of possible adverse ecological effects and calls for corrective and mitigation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acetyl Sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) and acetaminophen (ACM) can be found in municipal sewage sludge, and their content and availability may be influenced by sludge treatments, such as drying and liming. A sludge similarly centrifuged with/without a flocculant was spiked with It-labelled AC-SMX or ACM. Then, it was either limed (20% CaO) or/and dried under different laboratory conditions (1 week at ambient temperature; and 48 h at 40 or 80 degrees C). The total amount and distribution of the C-14-compounds among several chemical fractions, based on the sludge floc definition, were assessed at the end of the treatments.
   All the C-14-activity brought initially was recovered in the limed and/or dried sludges for AC-SMX but only between 44.4 and 84.9% for ACM, with the highest rate obtained for the limed sludge. Drying at 80 degrees C or liming increased the percentage of the sludge total organic carbon recovered in the extracts containing soluble extracellular polymeric substances (S-EPS) and the percentage of the total C-14-activity extracted simultaneously. The non-extractable residues represented only 3.9-11.6% of the total C-14-activity measured in the treated sludges for AC-SMX and 16.9-21.8% for ACM.
   The presence of AC-SMX and ACM residues in the treated sludges, after liming and drying under different conditions, was shown using some C-14-labelled molecules. At this time scale and according to the extraction method selected, most of the C-14-residues remained soluble and easily extractable for both compounds. This result implies that certain precautions should be taken when storing sludges before being spread on the field. Sludge piles, particularly the limed sludge, should be protected from rain to limit the production of lixiviates, which may contain residues of AC-SMX and ACM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecosystem pollution due to the lack of or inefficient wastewater treatment coverage in small communities is still a matter of great concern, even in developed countries. This study assesses the seasonal performance of 4 different full-scale wastewater technologies that have been used in small communities (<2000 population equivalent) for more than 10 years in terms of emerging contaminant (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and NH4-N removal efficiency. The studied technologies, which were selected due to their widespread use, included two intensive treatment systems (an extended aeration system (AS) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC)) and two extensive treatment systems (a constructed wetland (CW) and a waste stabilization pond (WSP)), all located in northeastern Spain. The studied compounds belonged to the groups of pharmaceuticals, sunscreen compounds, fragrances, antiseptics, flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides and plasticizers. The 25 ECs occurred in wastewater at concentrations ranging from undetectable to 80 mu g L-1. The average removal efficiency was 42% for the CW, 62% for the AS, 63% for the RBC and 82% for the WSP. All the technologies except the WSP system showed seasonal variability in the removal of ECs. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that, whilst all the technologies were capable of decreasing the aquatic risk, only the WSP yielded no risk in both seasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study compared the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by conventional ozonation and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process, which involves electrochemically generating H2O2 in-situ from O-2 in sparged O-2 and O-3 gas mixture (i.e., ozone generator effluent) during ozonation. Several pharmaceuticals with k(O3) ranging from <0.1 to 6.8 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) were spiked into four secondary effluents collected from different WWTPs, and then treated by ozonation and the E-peroxone process. Results show that both processes can rapidly remove ozone reactive pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and gemfibrozil), while the E-peroxone process can considerably accelerate the removal of ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals (e.g., ibuprofen and clofibric acid) via indirect oxidation with (OH)-O-center dot generated from the reaction of sparged O-3 with electro-generated H2O2. Compared with ozonation, the E-peroxone process enhanced the removal kinetics of ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals in the four secondary effluents by similar to 40-170%, and the enhancement was more pronounced in secondary effluents that had relatively lower effluent organic matter (EfOM). Due to its higher efficiency for removing ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals, the E-peroxone process reduced the reaction time and electrical energy consumption required to remove >= 90% of all spiked pharmaceuticals from the secondary effluents as compared to ozonation. These results indicate that the E-peroxone process may provide a simple and effective way to improve existing ozonation system for pharmaceutical removal from secondary effluents.

AB This study evaluated the use of particles of molecularly imprinted and non-imprinted polymers (MIP and NIP) as a wastewater treatment method for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). MIP and NIP remove EDCs through adsorption and therefore do not result in the formation of partially degraded products. The results show that both MIP and NIP particles are effective for removal of EDCs, and NIP have the advantage of not being as compound-specific as the MIP and hence can remove a diverse range of compounds including 17-beta-estradiol (E2), atrazine, bisphenol A, and diethylstilbestrol. Removal of E2 from wastewater was also tested to determine the effectiveness of NIP in the presence of interfering substances and natural organic matter. Removal of E2 from wastewater samples was high and increased with increasing NIP. NIP represent an effective way of removing a wide variety of EDCs from wastewater.

AB This study aimed to investigate the antibiotic concentration at each stage of treatment and to evaluate the removal efficiency of antibiotics in different types of secondary and advanced treatment, as well as the effects of the location of their discharge points on the occurrence of antibiotics in surface water. Eight target antibiotics and four hospital wastewater treatment plants in Bangkok with different conventional and advanced treatment options were investigated. Antibiotics were extracted by solid phase extraction and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The antibiotic with the highest concentration at influent was cefazolin at 13,166 ng/L, while the antibiotic with the highest concentration at effluent was sulfamethoxazole at 1,499 ng/L. The removal efficiency of antibiotics from lowest to highest was sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, dicloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and cefalexin. The adopted conventional treatment systems could not completely remove all antibiotics from wastewater. However, using advanced treatments or disinfection units such as chlorination and UV could increase the antibiotic removal efficiency. Chlorination was more effective than UV, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole concentration fluctuated during the treatment process, and sulfamethoxazole was the most difficult to remove. Both these antibiotics should be studied further regarding their contamination in sludge and suitable treatment options for their removal.

AB Water shortage is becoming more common due to droughts and global population increases resulting in the increasing popularity of water reuse to create new water sources. Reverse osmosis (RO) membrane systems are popular in these applications since they can produce drinking water quality effluent. Unfortunately, RO systems have the drawback of generating concentrate streams that contain contaminants rejected by the membrane including chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). CECs are chemicals such as hormones, steroids, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products that are used for their intended purpose and then released into wastewater. CECs are believed to be detrimental to aquatic wildlife health and pose an unknown human health risk. This research gathered the existing knowledge on CEC presence in concentrate, available proven concentrate treatment methods, their CEC removal abilities, and current CEC regulations. It was found that 127 CECs have been measured in RO concentrate with 100 being detected at least once. The most potent treatment process available is UV/H2O2 as it offers the highest removal rates for the widest range of chemicals. The less expensive process of ozone/biologically activated carbon offers slightly lower removal abilities. This comprehensive report will provide the groundwork for better understanding, regulating and treating concentrate stream CECs.

AB The possibility of removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions was examined using ibuprofen (Ibu) oxidation as an example, using in situ electrochemically synthesized ferrate(VI), a strong oxidant and coagulant, with forming of non-harmful byproducts. A solution of ibuprofen of 206 mg/L in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution was treated with different amounts of fresh, electrochemically synthesized ferrate(VI). The changes of ibuprofen concentration in samples were determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The extent of mineralization was estimated using the changes in chemical oxygen demand (COD) values and total organic carbon (TOC) values of test samples. The largest reduction of the concentration of Ibu (41.75%) was obtained by adding 69.2 mg/L ferrate(VI) as Fe (Ibu: Fe = 1: 0.34). An effective removal of ibuprofen from aqueous solutions was recorded up to 68% and it can be done by using ferrate(VI) in the ratio Ibu: Fe = 1: 3 as Fe. The possibility of ibuprofen removal by ferrate(VI) was confirmed by COD and TOC results, which demonstrated reduction up to 65% and 63.6%, respectively.

AB Benzoylecgonine (BE) is the major metabolite of cocaine and a contaminant of emerging concern often detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and surface waters. In this study, an innovative microcapillary film (MCF) array photoreactor made of fluoropolymer material was used to determine the direct photolysis quantum yield at 254 nm of benzoylecgonine. The photolysis quantum yield of BE was found to be (6.22 +/- 0.19) . 10(-3) mol ein(-1). The proposed methodology was validated by estimating the quantum yield of caffeine (7.48 +/- 0.64) 10(-4) mol ein(-1), which was found in agreement with results published in literature. The MCF uses a very small sample volume (in the order of 330 mu L per meter length of material) and allows extremely rapid photolysis with a short contact time ranging from a fraction of seconds to few minutes. The novel microfluidic-based approach presented in this study is particularly useful for determining the photochemical behavior of highly priced pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, metabolites and uncommon or regulated substances.

AB Most of the published studies concerning water and wastewater ozonation for subsequent reutilization or discharge are focused on applying ozone as an advanced treatment process downstream a biological secondary treatment. Ozonation usually shows good performances in improving water quality as shown when monitoring aggregate parameters during ozone treatments. Nevertheless, additional studies related to ozone application on pre-biological treatment stages should be considered for a better understanding of its effects on water quality as well as on the existing process performances. Therefore, the present study investigates the impact of ozone on the organic matter from municipal waste water effluents with the aim to highlight potential benefits depending on the ozone application point. Special focus was made on ozone transfer and kinetics. To do so, aggregate parameters as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) were selected to characterize the effluent quality before and after treatment. These parameters provided useful information regarding the extent of oxidation, the changes in aromaticity and in biodegradability of the effluent organic matter (OM). Ozone application to primary effluents displayed a positive impact on aggregate parameters, improving effluent quality. For both type of effluents, the ozone consumption can be classically described by two characteristics which are the immediate ozone demand and the subsequent constant of first order decay. Their evaluation pointed out the major influence of global organic matter parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In complement to the initial study assessing the impact of hazardous events on membrane bioreactor (MBR) bulk performances, detailed assessment of the consequences of similar events has now been conducted on the removal of a wide range of trace organic chemical contaminants. The investigated chemicals include 12 steroidal hormones, 4 xenoestrogens, 2 pesticides, 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Under salinity, DNP, ammonia and organic carbon shock conditions, overall removal of hydrophobic chemicals (log DpH7 >= 2.5) was not or only slightly affected. Since these chemicals are largely adsorbed to biomass, these results imply that biotransformation within the biomass structure itself was maintained. However, removal of hydrophilic chemicals (log D-pH7 <2.5) was commonly observed to be impeded under shock load conditions, indicating loss of bioactivity. This was observed primarily for chemicals which have low or moderate biotransformability. In comparison, easily biotransformable chemicals were largely removed. The susceptibility of less readily biotransformable hydrophilic chemicals to shock loads was due to their reliance upon specific organisms or metabolic pathways for their biotransformation. The results of these experiments show that hydrophilic chemicals with low biotransformability (e.g., sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, gemfibrozil and naproxen) could be sensitive indicators for monitoring impacts of hazardous events on removal of trace organic chemicals by MBRs.

AB Considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals are used in human and veterinary medicine, which are not efficiently removed during wastewater and slurries treatment and subsequently entering continuously into freshwater systems. The intrinsic biological activity of these non-regulated pollutants turns their presence in the aquatic environment into an ecological matter of concern. We present the first quantitative study relating the presence of pharmaceuticals and their predicted ecotoxicological effects with human population and livestock units. Four representative Iberian River basins (Spain) were studied: Llobregat, Ebro, Jucar and Guadalquivir. The levels of pharmaceuticals were determined in surface water and sediment samples collected from 77 locations along their stream networks. Predicted total toxic units to algae, Daphnia and fish were estimated for pharmaceuticals detected in surface waters. The use of chemometrics enabled the study of pharmaceuticals for: their spatial distribution along the rivers in two consecutive years; their potential ecotoxicological risk to aquatic organisms; and the relationships among their occurrence and predicted ecotoxicity with human population and animal farming pressure. The Llobregat and the Ebro River basins were characterized as the most polluted and at highest ecotoxicological risk, followed by Jucar and Guadalquivir. No significant acute risks of pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms were observed. However potential chronic ecotoxicological effects on algae could be expected at two hot spots of pharmaceuticals pollution identified in the Llobregat and Ebro basins. Analgesics/antiinflammatories, antibiotics and diuretics were the most relevant therapeutic groups across the four river basins. Among them, hydrochlorothiazide and gemfibrozil, as well as azithromycin and ibuprofen were widely spread and concentrated pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments, respectively. Regarding their predicted ecotoxicity, sertraline, gemfibrozil and loratidine were identified as the more concerning compounds. Significantly positive relationships were found among levels of pharmaceuticals and toxic units and population density and livestock units in both surface water and sediment matrices.

AB Increasing numbers of organic micropollutants are emitted into rivers via municipal wastewaters. Due to their persistence many pollutants pass wastewater treatment plants without substantial removal. Transport and fate of pollutants in receiving waters and export to downstream ecosystems is not well understood. In particular, a better knowledge of processes governing their environmental behavior is needed. Although a lot of data are available concerning the ubiquitous presence of micropollutants in rivers, accurate data on transport and removal rates are lacking. In this paper, a mass balance approach is presented, which is based on the Lagrangian sampling scheme, but extended to account for precise transport velocities and mixing along river stretches. The calculated mass balances allow accurate quantification of pollutants' reactivity along river segments. This is demonstrated for representative members of important groups of micropollutants, e.g. pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. A model-aided analysis of the measured data series gives insight into the temporal dynamics of removal processes. The occurrence of different removal mechanismssuch as photooxidation, microbial degradation, and volatilization is discussed. The results demonstrate, that removal processes are highly variable in time and space and this has to be considered for future studies. The high precision sampling scheme presented could be a powerful tool for quantifying removal processes under different boundary conditions and in river segments with contrasting properties.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 13 target compounds, including eight parabens, four chlorinated parabens and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), were detected in surface water samples at 35 sampling sites in the Beijing River system, China. The surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that parabens were ubiquitous in the surface water of Beijing. PHBA was the predominant compound in the surface water samples, with the average concentration of 239 ng L-1,followed by the total amount of chlorinated parabens (average 50.1 ng/L) and parabens (average 443 ng/L). It is noteworthy that octylparaben with longer chain was firstly detected in the surface water. Significant difference was observed for paraben concentrations from different sampling sites, and the highest level of parabens was found in the Xiaotaihou River, which was mainly due to the untreated sewage discharge. Seasonal variation of target compounds in the urban surface water was also studied, and parabens exhibited a different temporal variation from chlorinated derivatives. A combination of factors including high residual chlorine level and water temperature as well as intense ultraviolet radiation might enhance the persistence of chlorinated parabens in chlorinated water during the wet season. Risk assessment showed that parabens and their chlorinated derivatives are not likely to produce biological effects on aquatic ecosystems at current levels in the surface water of Beijing.

AB Herein we report the analysis of 27 selected psychoactive compounds found in the wastewater of the largest suburb in the eastern part of Central Europe Bratislava-Petrzalka, Slovakia. Thirteen of them (MDMA, metham-phetarnine, amphetamine, THC-COOH, benzoylecgonine, codeine, tramadol, venlafaxine, oxazepam, citalopram, methadone, EDDP, cocaine) were found in concentrations above 30 ng/L These compounds were selected for further monitoring. The possibility of complete degradation of these 13 substances by zerovalent iron and iron(VI) was studied in the wastewater from the Petrzalka treatment plant During the week the concentration of the majority of the studied compounds in wastewater was stable. Concentrations of MDMA, cocaine, tramadol, and oxazepam reached significantly higher levels during the weekend. Only about 10% removal efficiency for tramadol, venlafaxine, oxazepam, MDMA, citalopram, methadone, and EDDP was observed at the treatment plant In contrast, methamphetamine, amphetamine, and codeine were removed with 68%, 83%, and 53% efficiency, respectively. The degradation of synthetic drugs (methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA) in wastewater is limited, while cannabis (of natural biological origin) is degraded with efficiency greater than 90%. After utilization of the Fenton reaction, its modification, and use of ferrate(VI), a high efficiency of eliminating all of these substances to values below the limit of detection was achieved.

AB Photocatalysis employing TiO2 nanoparticles was studied to assess the effect of aqueous matrix nature in the degradation of clofibric acid (CFA) under UV-A radiation. Aeroxide TiO2-P25 at 0.50 g/L was the most effective catalyst among those tested, with a CFA degradation of 98.5% after 15 min. The CFA photodegradation in environmental waters (tap, mineral, river and recycled wastewater) and in the presence of inorganic (NaCl, FeCl3, FeCl2, AlCl3, CaCl2, Al-2(SO4)(3), Fe-2(SO4)(3), Na2SO4, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3) and organic compounds (humic acids, and a surfactant) commonly found in real waters was compared to that obtained in pure water. In general, the removal efficiency decreased with inorganic salts, especially with sulfates and carbonates (>70% deactivation), and also in environmental waters (>90%). A general kinetic model has been developed to describe the CFA photo degradation depending on the type and concentration of substances present in water. The first-order kinetic constants were estimated by defining a characteristic parameter for each ion species tested in the aqueous matrix. High correlation (R-2 >0.99 in most cases) was observed between experimental CFA concentrations and those predicted by the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The level of fecal pollution in 17 sites in Puerto Rico was determined by Escherichia coli (E. coli) enumeration using an enzyme substrate medium and Quanti-Tray (R)/2000. Human fecal pollution was identified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of carbamazepine (CBZ) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of the human Bacteroides marker, HF183. Carbamazepine was detected in 16 out of 17 sites, including Condado Lagoon, a popular recreational area. Elevated E. coli levels (>410 CFU 100 mL(-1)) were detected in 13 sites. Average CBZ concentrations ranged from 0.005 mu g L-1 to 0.482 mu g L-1 and 7 sites were positive for HF183. Higher CBZ concentrations were associated with the detection of HF183 (Mann-Whitney test; U = 42.0; df = 7; 1-tailed P value = 0.013). This was the second study to determine surface water concentrations of CBZ in the Caribbean and the first in Puerto Rico. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is detected worldwide in water bodies due to the incomplete removal by wastewater treatments. Contrasting results have been reported on the toxicity of IBU on aquatic biomonitor plants such as duckweed, and no data about IBU detection and metabolism in plants has been reported. In this work, the effects of 1 mg L-1 IBU on Lemna gibba L. were monitored in an 8-day laboratory test. In particular, an increase in frond number (+12%) and multiplication rate (+10%) while no variations in photosynthetic pigment content were observed. Moreover, UPLC-HRMS analysis of the presence of IBU and its metabolites in plants and in the growth medium was performed. The results showed that, besides IBU, 11 IBU metabolites were detected in plants. Among the IBU metabolites, hydroxyl- and dihydroxyl-IBU were found, whereas carboxyl-IBU was undetectable. Interestingly, some IBU metabolites were detected in the plant growth solution at the end of the IBU treatment, while no IBU products were found in the IBU solution without plants, suggesting a role for L. gibba in IBU metabolism. The findings of this work represent an important step for a better evaluation of the effects of IBU and its metabolites in duckweed, with notable implications for the eco-toxicological assessment of IBU in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of caffeine, a widely over-the-counter stimulant drug, has been investigated in effluent wastewater and deionized water (DIW) using graphite-poly vinyl chloride (PVC) composite electrode as anode. Effects of initial concentration of caffeine, chloride ion (Cl-) loading, presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sample volume, type of sample and applied voltage were determined to test and to validate a kinetic model for the oxidation of caffeine by the electrochemical oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of caffeine followed pseudo first-order kinetics, with rate constant values ranged from 0.006 to 0.23 min(-1) depending on the operating parameters. The removal efficiency of caffeine increases with applied voltage very significantly, suggesting a very important role of mediated oxidation process. However, the consumption energy was considered during electrochemical oxidation process. In chloride media, removal of caffeine is faster and more efficiently, although occurrence of more intermediates takes place. The study found that the adding H2O2 to the NaCl solution will inhibit slightly the electrochemical oxidation rate in comparison with only NaCl in solution. Liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) technique was applied to the identification of the by-products generated during electrochemical oxidation, which allowed to construct the proposed structure of by-products.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of combined Fenton oxidation and membrane filtration for the treatment of a real process pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the chemical synthesis of etodolaca pharmaceutical active compound. In single Fenton oxidation experiments, the highest process efficiencies (84% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 95% UV254) were obtained at the H2O2/Fe2+=40 ratio. However, regarding the costs of reagents, the optimum molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ was selected as 20 with COD removal efficiency of 82%. Although COD could not be reduced to discharge standards, etodolac removal is fixed close to 100%. Higher flux, higher rejection rates, and lower flux decline were obtained from the combined Fenton oxidation and nanofiltration (NF) of the raw wastewater from chemical synthesis process. Although effective removals of etodolac (>99.5%) were obtained for combined and single systems, single-stage NF treatment was also insufficient for the removal of organic matter. Combined Fenton oxidation and NF treatment was found to be a promising method for wastewater from chemical synthesis processes of pharmaceutical industry containing etodolac. FT-IR spectrums showed that the calcium salts could be the main foulants on the NF membrane surface.

AB A new technology based on laccase immobilized over ceramic membranes was formerly developed for the degradation of antibiotics from wastewaters. This work has been pointed to the determination of the economic aspects of this new enzymatic decontamination technology. These calculations have been based on previous modeling and simulations of real scale processes for tetracycline degradation in municipal, hospital and industrial WWTP effluents. A mathematical cost estimation model, originally developed for petrochemical wastewater treatment by ceramic membranes, has been adapted for the proposed enzymatic technology and applied to the subsequent economic viability analysis of the different designed processes in order to determine the competitiveness of this new technology compared to alternative decontamination technologies. Finally, some aspects where the new investigation efforts should be focused on to improve the process competitiveness and overcome the identified economic drawbacks have been proposed. Multi-objective optimization tools were employed to determine the magnitude of the required improvements in three main reactor characteristics: enzymatic kinetics, reactor effective lifetime, and membrane conditioning or regeneration costs. Under these improved conditions, the technology could be considered as a competitive alternative with specific total costs around 1 (sic)/m(3). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organophosphate esters (OPEs) have emerged as a new class of contaminants due to their massive use as flame retardants and plasticizers. These contaminants are toxic to aquatic organisms and some of them are not biodegradable in wastewater treatment plants. This study investigated the degradation kinetics of eight typical OPEs during ozone and UV/H2O2 treatments in Milli-Q water, humic acid (HA) solution, and municipal secondary effluent. The studied OPEs included three chlorinated: tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCP); two aromatic: triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and tricresyl phosphate (TCrP); and three aliphatic: tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP). Results indicate that the degradation of target OPEs conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetics and UV/H2O2 was more effective than ozone for their elimination by comparing the overall removal efficiencies and energy consumptions. Two aromatic and two aliphatic OPEs (i.e., TPhP, TCrP, TnBP and TBEP) were effectively degraded by ozone and UV/H2O2 in the test water matrices, while all chlorinated and one aliphatic OPEs (i.e., TCEP, TCPP, TDCP and TEHP) were found to be recalcitrant to oxidation. Moreover, the presence of HA significantly enhanced the degradation of reactive OPEs in ozone treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new yeast strain isolated from the pharmaceutical wastewater was capable of utilizing cefdinir as a sole carbon source for their growth in mineral medium. The yeast was identified and named as Candida sp. SMN04 based on morphology and 18S-ITS-D1/D2/D3 rRNA sequence analysis. The interaction between factors pH (3.0-9.0), inoculum dosage (1-7%), time (1-11 day) and cefdinir concentration (50-450mg/L) was studied using a Box-Behnken design. The factors were studied as a result of their effect on cell dry weight (R1; g/L), extended spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) assay (R2; mm), P450 activity (R3; U/mL) and degradation (R4; %). Maximum values of R1, R2, R3 and R4 were obtained at central values of all the parameters. The isolated yeast strain efficiently degraded 84% of 250mgL(-1) of cefdinir within 6 days with a half-life of 2.97 days and degradation rate constant of 0.2335 per day. Pseudo-first-order model efficiently described the process. Among the various enzymes tested, the order of activity at the end of Day 4 was noted to be: cytochrome P450 (1.76 +/- 0.03)>NADPH reductase (1.51 +/- 0.20)>manganese peroxidase and amylase (0.66 +/- 0.15; 0.66 +/- 0.70). Intermediates were successfully characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The opening of the -lactam ring involving ESBL activity was considered as one of the major steps in the cefdinir degradation process. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis showed the absence of spectral vibrations between 1766 and 1519cm(-1) confirming the complete removal of lactam ring during cefdinir degradation. The results of the present study are promising for the use of isolated yeast Candida sp. SMN04 as a potential bioremediation agent.

AB The effect of colloids on the occurrence, phase distribution and photolysis of twenty-seven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) was studied in domestic and livestock wastewaters (DW and LW), respectively. Filtered water (<1 mu m) was separated into permeate (<1 kDa) and retentate (1 kDa-1 mu m) by cross flow ultrafiltration. Results indicated that total concentration of EOCs ranged from 1220 ng L-1 in permeate of DW to 5065 ng L-1 in retentate of LW. The average EOC fraction associated with colloids was 13.5% and 14.4% in OW and LW. Most of the EOCs exhibited pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics in all water samples. Control experiments using glass and quartz reactors showed that UV light was more effective on the photolysis of most EOCs. The EOCs photolysis in the three fractions of DW and LW could be accelerated or inhibited compared to ultrapure water with the enhancement factor ranging from -0.94 to 7.33. The impact of colloids on the photolysis of EOCs depended on the compound and the source of water. The photolysis of most EOCs in permeates and filtrates was generally accelerated, while inhibited in the retentates, which could be attributed to the relatively high dissolved organic carbon contents in retentates.

AB The use of granular activated carbon (GAC) in fixed bed filters is a promising option for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant effluents. Frequent bacicwashing of the filter bed is inevitable, but its effect on potential filter stratification is not well understood yet and thus has been evaluated in the present study for two commercial GAC products. Bacicwashing of GAC filters was simulated with 10 or 100 filter bed expansions of 20 or 100% at backwash velocities of 12 and 40 m/h, respectively. Five vertical fractions were extracted and revealed a vertical stratification according to grain sizes and material densities. Sieve analyses indicated increasing grain sizes towards the bottom for one GAC while grain sizes of the other GAC were more homogeneously distributed throughout the filter bed. The apparent densities of the top sections were significantly lower than that of the bottom sections of both products. Comparative long term fixed bed adsorption experiments with the top and bottom sections of the stratified GAC showed remarkable differences in breakthrough curves of dissolved organic carbon, UV light absorption at 254 nm wavelength (UVA(254)) and OMP. GAC from the upper section showed constantly better removal efficiencies than GAC from the bottom section, especially for weakly adsorbing OMP such as sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore correlations between UVA(254) reductions and OMP removals were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was established to identify industrial emerging contaminants in the Rhine River. With this approach, quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds (R-Ph3P+) were identified as new emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. The suggested chemical structures were elucidated by MS fragmentation and chemical databank searches and eventually confirmed via authentic standards. R-Ph3P+ are used worldwide by the chemical industry to synthesize alkenes via the Wittig reaction. In total, five compounds [R = butyl (Bu), R = ethyl (Et), R = methoxymethyl (MeOMe), R = methyl (Me), and R = phenyl (Ph)] were found in German rivers and streams. R-Ph3P+ were detected only in those rivers and streams that received an appreciable portion of wastewater from the chemical industry. Up to 2.5 mu g/L Et-Ph3P+ was quantified in a small stream from the Hessian Ried, and in the Rhine, up to 0.56 mu g/L Me-Ph3P+ was detected. R-Ph3P+ were also identified in suspended particulate matter and sediments in the Rhine catchment, with MeOMe-Ph3P+ concentrations of up to 0.75 mg/kg and up to 0.21 mg/kg, respectively. Because of the lack of ecotoxicological studies, the environmental risks caused by R-Ph3P+ can be assessed for neither pelagic nor benthic organisms.

AB An assay for the determination of diclofenac concentration, in the micromolar range in water, was developed. It is based on the use of a recently developed cyclodextrin-based polymer that possesses an inherent affinity for the target pharmaceutical. This competitive assay is exploiting the possibility to displace a fluorescent dye, adsorbed in the cyclodextrin-based polymer, by the target drug. This displacement is followed by measuring the increase in fluorescence polarization of the dye released in solution. The assay was successfully tested on a real wastewater sample with a limit of detection of 1 mu M. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a bacteriostatic antibiotic ubiquitously found in the aquatic environment. Since conventional biological wastewater treatment is not efficient to remove SMX, photolysis in natural waters can represent an important transformation pathway. It was recently shown that SMX transformation products can retain antibiotic activity. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand photochemical processes occurring in natural water just as the formation of active transformation products (TPs).
   During long-term SMX photolysis experiments (one week), nine TPs were identified by reference standards. Moreover, five further TPs of photodecomposition of SMX were found. For the first time, a TP with m/z 271 [M + H](+) was observed during photolysis and tentatively confirmed as 4,x-dihydroxylated SMX. The DOC mass balance clearly showed that only around 5 to 10% were mineralized during the experiment emphasizing the need to elucidate the fate of TPs. Bacterial bioassays confirmed that the mixture retains its antibiotic toxicity toward luminescence (24 h) and that there is no change over the treatment time on EC50. In contrast, growth inhibition activity was found to slightly decrease over the irradiation time. However, this decrease was not proportional to the transformation of the parent compound SMX.

AB Lab-scale photolysis, biodegradation and transport experiments were carded out for naproxen, carbamazepine and tridosan in soil, wastewater and surface water from a region where untreated wastewater is used for agricultural irrigation. Results showed that both photolysis and biodegradation occurred for the three emerging pollutants in the tested matrices as follows: triclosan > naproxen> carbamazepine. The highest photolysis rate for the three pollutants was obtained in experiments using surface water, while biodegradation rates were higher in wastewater and soil than in surface water. Carbamazepine showed to be recalcitrant to biodegradation both in soil and water; although photolysis occurred at a higher level than biodegradation, this compound was poorly degraded by natural processes. Transport experiments showed that naproxen was the most mobile compound through the first 30 cm of the soil profile; conversely, the mobility of carbamazepine and tridosan through the soil was delayed. Biodegradation of target pollutants occurred within soil columns during transport experiments. Triclosan was not detected either in leachates or the soil in columns, suggesting its complete biodegradation.Data of these experiments can be used to develop more reliable fate-on-the-field and environmental risk assessment studies.

AB This review is based on 59 papers published between 2002 and 2015, referring to about 450 treatment trains providing data regarding sludge concentrations for 169 compounds, specifically 152 pharmaceuticals and 17 personal care products, grouped into 28 different classes. The rationale of the study is to provide data to evaluate the environmental risk posed by the spreading of treated sludge in agriculture. Following discussion of the legislative scenario governing the final disposal of treated sludge in European countries and the USA, the study provides a snapshot of the occurrence of selected compounds in primary, secondary, mixed, digested, conditioned, composted and dried sludge originating in municipal wastewater treatment plants fed mainly with urban wastewater as well as in sludge-amended soil. Not only are measured values reported, but also predicted concentrations based on K-d values are reported. It emerges that in secondary sludge, the highest concentrations were found for fragrances, antiseptics and antibiotics and an attenuation in their concentrations occurs during treatment, in particular anaerobic digestion and composting. An in-depth literature survey of the (measured and predicted) K-d values for the different compounds and treated sludge are reported and an analysis of the influence of pH, redox conditions, sludge type was carried out The data regarding measured and predicted concentrations of selected compounds in sludge-amended soil is then analyzed. Finally an environmental risk assessment posed by their occurrence in soil in the case of land application of sludge is examined, and the results obtained by different authors are compared. The most critical compounds found in the sludge-amended soil are estradiol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, caffeine, triclosan and triclocarban. The study concludes with a focus on the main issues that should be further investigated in order to refine the environmental risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The recent development of broad-scope high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) screening methods has resulted in a much improved capability for new compound identification in environmental samples. However, positive identifications at the ng/L concentration level rely on analytical reference standards for chromatographic retention time (t(R)) and mass spectral comparisons. Chromatographic t(R) prediction can play a role in increasing confidence in suspect screening efforts for new compounds in the environment, especially when standards are not available, but reliable methods are lacking. The current work focuses on the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for t(R) prediction in gradient reversed-phase liquid chromatography and applied along with HRMS data to suspect screening of wastewater and environmental surface water samples. Based on a compound t(R) dataset of >500 compounds, an optimized 4-layer back-propagation multi-layer perceptron model enabled predictions for 85% of all compounds to within 2 min of their measured t(R) for training (n = 344) and verification (n = 100) datasets. To evaluate the ANN ability for generalization to new data, the model was further tested using 100 randomly selected compounds and revealed 95% prediction accuracy within the 2-minute elution interval. Given the increasing concern on the presence of drug metabolites and other transformation products (TPs) in the aquatic environment, the model was applied along with HRMS data for preliminary identification of pharmaceutically-related compounds in real samples. Examples of compounds where reference standards were subsequently acquired and later confirmed are also presented. To our knowledge, this work presents for the first time, the successful application of an accurate retention time predictor and HEMS data-mining using the largest number of compounds to preliminarily identify new or emerging contaminants in wastewater and surface waters.

AB The degradation of two organic pollutants (amoxicillin and diclofenac) in 0.1 mM aqueous solutions was studied by using advanced oxidation processes, namely ozonation, photolysis, photolytic ozonation, photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation. Diclofenac was degraded quickly under direct photolysis by artificial light (medium-pressure vapor arc, lambda(exc) > 300 nm), while amoxicillin remained very stable. In the presence of ozone, regardless of the type of process, complete degradation of both organic pollutants was observed in less than 20 min. Photolysis or ozonation on their own led to modest values of total organic carbon (TOC) removal (<6% or 41%, respectively in 180 min), while for photocatalysis (no ozone present) a significant fraction of nonoxidizable compounds remained in the treated water (similar to 15% after 180 min). In the case of photolytic ozonation, the kinetics of TOC removal was slow.
   In contrast, a relatively fast and complete mineralization of amoxicillin and diclofenac (30 and 120 min, respectively) was achieved when applying the photocatalytic ozonation process. The absence of toxicity of the treated waters was confirmed by growth inhibition assays using two different microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Photocatalytic ozonation was also applied to an urban wastewater spiked with both amoxicillin and diclofenac. The parent pollutants were easily oxidized, but the TOC removal was only as much as 68%, mainly due to the persistent presence of oxamic acid in the treated sample. The same treatment allowed the effective degradation of a wide group of micropollutants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones and an industrial compound) detected in non-spiked urban wastewater.

AB In this study, the contamination by polar organic pollutants was investigated along the Rhine River, an important source of drinking water for 22 million people in central Europe. Following the flow of the river, a traveling water mass was sampled using weekly flow-proportional composite samples at ten different downstream sites, including main tributaries. Using a broad analytical method based on solid phase extraction and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the water was analyzed for more than 300 target substances. While the water in Lake Constance contained only 83 substances in often low concentrations, the number of detects found in the water phase increased to 143 substances and a weekly load of more than 7 tons at the last sampling site, the Dutch-German border. Mostly present were chemicals originating from wastewater treatment plants, especially the artificial sweetener Acesulfam and two pharmaceuticals, Metformin and Gabapentin, which dominate the weekly load up to 58%. Although the sample campaign was performed in a dry period in early spring, a large variety of pesticides and biocides were detected. Several industrial point sources were identified along the waterway's 900 km journey, resulting in high concentrations in the tributaries and loads of up to 160 kg. Additionally, an unbiased non-target analysis was performed following two different strategies for the prioritization of hundreds of potentially relevant unknown masses. While for the first prioritization strategy, only chlorinated compounds were extracted from the mass spectrometer datasets, the second prioritization strategy was performed using a systematic reduction approach between the different sampling sites. Among others, two substances that never had been detected before in this river, namely, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine and the solvent 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), were identified and confirmed, and their loads were roughly estimated along the river.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to purposefully eliminate antibiotics and therefore many previous investigations have been carried out to assess their fate in biological wastewater treatment processes. In order to consolidate previous findings regarding influencing factors like the solid and hydraulic retention time an intensive monitoring was carried out in a municipal WWTP in Germany. Over a period of 12 months daily samples were taken from the in- and effluent as well as diverse sludge streams. The 14 selected antibiotics and one metabolite cover the following classes: cephalosporins, diaminopyrimidines, fluoroquinolones, lincosamide, macrolides, penicillins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines.
   Out of the 15 investigated substances, the removal of only clindamycin and ciprofloxacin show significant correlations to SRT, temperature, HRT and nitrogen removal. The dependency of clindamycin's removal could be related to the significant negative removal (i.e. production) of clindamycin in the treatment process and was corrected using the human metabolite clindamycin-sulfoxide. The average elimination was adjusted from -225% to 3% which suggests that clindamycin can be considered as an inert substance during the wastewater treatment Process. Based on the presented data, the mass flow analysis revealed that macrolides, clindamycin/clindamycin-sulfoxide and trimethoprim were mainly released with the effluent, while penicillins, cephalosporins as well as sulfamethoxazole were partly degraded in the studied WWTP. Furthermore, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are the only antibiotics under investigation with a significant mass fraction bound to primary, excess and digested sludge. Nevertheless, the sludge concentrations are highly inconsistent which leads to questionable results. It remains unclear whether the inconsistencies are due to insufficiencies in sampling and/or analytical determination or if the fluctuations can be considered reasonable for digesters. Hence, future investigations have to address antibiotic's temporal dynamics during the sludge treatment to decide whether or not the widely reported standard deviations of sludge concentrations reflect realistic fluctuations.

AB Marine sediment quality of wastewater discharges areas was determined by using in situ caged clams Ruditapes philippinarum taking into account the seasonality. Clams were caged in sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges at four sites (P1, P2, P3, P4) at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain), and one reference site (P6). Exposure to contaminated sediments was confirmed by measurement of metals and As, PAH, pharmaceutical products and surfactants (SAS) in bottom sediments. Biological effects were determined by following biomarkers of exposure (activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase - EROD, dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase - DBF, glutathione S-transferase - GST, glutathione peroxidase - GPX, glutathione reductase - GR and acetylcholinesterase - AChE), effects (lysosomal membrane stability - LMS, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation - LPO), energy status (total lipids TIT and mitochondrial electron transport MET), and involved in the mode of action of pharmaceutical products (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO, alkali-labile phosphates - ALP levels and cyclooxygenase activity COX). In winter, urban effluents were detoxified by phase I biotransformation (CYP3A-like activity), phase II (GST), and the activation of antioxidant defence enzymes (GR). Urban effluents lead to the detoxification metabolism (CYP1A-like), oxidative effects (LPO and DNA damage), neurotoxicity (AChE) and neuroendocrine disruption (COX and ALP levels) involved in inflammation (P1 and P2) and changes in reproduction as spawning delay (P3 and P4) in clams exposed in summer. Adverse effects on biota exposed to sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges depend on the chemical contamination level and also on the reproductive cycle according to seasonality.

AB We investigated the removal of twelve pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which has emerged as a technology for improving the quality of organic waste materials producing a valuable biochar material.
   In this study, the HTC converted sewage sludge samples to a biochar product within 4 h at a temperature of 210 degrees C and a resulting pressure of about 15 bar. Initial pharmaceutical load of the sewage sludge was investigated as well as the residual concentrations in biochar produced from spiked and eight native sewage sludge samples from three waste water treatment plants. Additionally, the solid contents of source material and product were compared, which showed a considerable increase of the solid content after filtration by HTC.
   All pharmaceuticals except sulfamethoxazole, which remained below the limit of quantification, frequently occurred in the investigated sewage sludges in the mu g/kg dry matter (DM) range. Diclofenac, carbamazepine, metoprolol and propranolol were detected in all sludge samples with a maximum concentration of 800 mu g/kg DM for metoprolol. HTC was investigated regarding its contaminant removal efficiency using spiked sewage sludge. Pharmaceutical concentrations were reduced for seven compounds by 39% (metoprolol) to >= 97% (carbamazepine). In native biochar samples the four compounds phenazone, carbamazepine, metoprolol and propranolol were detected, which confirmed that the HTC process can reduce the load of micropollutants. In contrast to the other investigated compounds phenazone concentration increased, which was further addressed in thermal behaviour studies including three structurally similar potential precursors.

AB We carried out a project aimed to evaluate the possible role played by the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the possible decrease of some environmental pollutants recalcitrant to tradition wastewater treatments. By the help of a pilot-plant built in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Milan (Italy), we tested several waste mixtures in order to measure the chemicals' abatement made by mussels' biofiltration. This study represents the last step of the wider project and it aimed to evaluate if the decrease in the concentration of some urban pollutants measured in wastewaters was followed by a corresponding toxicity reduction. Thus, we performed 7-day exposures under laboratory conditions to test the toxicity of the raw wastewaters and those preliminary filtered by zebra mussels, through the measurement of different end-points of acute and chronic toxicity. Results showed a clear positive effect of mussels' biofiltration mainly to decrease the acute toxicity made by the two tested wastewater mixtures, while the biomarkers' suite used to evaluate the chronic toxicity showed contradictory results.

AB Sources for drinking water (DW) production contain increasing concentrations of organic micropollutants, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Traditional purification processes are not suitable for their removal or conversion, but even sophisticated technologies, like advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration, are not able to efficiently remove all compounds from DW. For recalcitrant compounds, affinity adsorption, based on a specific interaction of the adsorbent surface with functional groups in the compounds' molecular structure, may be an effective alternative or addition. It can either be applied as a polishing step in DW purification or for removal of compounds directly at the source.

AB Nowadays, there are many problems related to water pollution, which is a result of intermittent or continuous release of pollutants in the environment. Novelty of this paper is to identify an alternative able to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of the traditional methods in the wastewater field. In this line, a commercial bioactivator, namely, Micropan complex was used for wastewater treatment. The influence of contact time, initial pH and bioactivator amount was studied. The optimal parameters determination was achieved through an experimental model created using MATHCAD 14 programme. The correlation coefficient value indicates the precision with which the set of experimental values was characterized by the determined function. The value obtained was 0.889. When coefficient is the closer to 1 the better description is achived.

ID WASTE-WATER; TREATMENT SYSTEMS; COLLECTION; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN
AB Municipal wastewater contains a mixture of brown (feces and toilet paper), yellow (urine), and gray (kitchen, bathroom and wash) waters. Urine contributes approximately 70-80% of the nitrogen (N), 50-70% of the phosphorus (P) load and 60-70% of the pharmaceutical residues in normal domestic sewage. This study evaluated the impact of different levels of source separation of urine on an existing biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. A process model of an existing biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant was used. Increasing the amount of urine diverted from the water reclamation facilities, has little impact on effluent ammonia (NH3-N) concentration, but effluent nitrate (NO3-N) concentration decreases. If nitrification is necessary then no reduction in the sludge age can be realized. However, a point is reached where the remaining influent nitrogen load matches the nitrogen requirements for biomass growth, and no residual nitrogen needs to be nitrified. That allows a significant reduction in sludge age, implying reduced process volume requirements. In situations where nitrification is required, lower effluent nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations were realized due to both the lower influent nitrogen content in the wastewater and a more favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for denitrification. The external carbon requirement for denitrification decreases as the urine separation efficiency increases due to the lower influent nitrogen content in the wastewater and a more favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for denitrification. The effluent phosphorus concentration decreases when the amount of urine sent to water reclamation facilities is decreased due to lower influent phosphorus concentrations. In the case of chemical phosphate removal, urine separation reduces the amount of chemicals required.

AB The anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine is considered as an indicator of sewage water pollution: however, its uptake by plants and effect on metabolism have not been sufficiently documented, let alone its metabolite (10,11-epoxycarbamazepine). In a model system of sterile, hydroponically cultivated Zea mays (as C-4 plant) and Helianthus annuus (as C-3 plant), the uptake and effect of carbamazepine and 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine were studied in comparison with those of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were effectively extracted from drug-supplemented media by both plants, while the uptake of more hydrophobic carbamazepine was much lower. On the other hand, the carbamazepine metabolite, 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, was, unlike sunflower, willingly taken up by maize plants (after 96 h 88 % of the initial concentration) and effectively stored in maize tissues. In addition, the effect of the studied pharmaceuticals on the plant metabolism (enzymes of Hatch-Slack cycle, peroxidases) was followed. The activity of bound peroxidases, which could cause xylem vessel lignification and reduction of xenobiotic uptake, was at the level of control plants in maize leaves contrary to sunflower. Therefore, our results indicate that maize has the potential to remove 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine from contaminated soils.

AB This piece of research deals with the monitoring of a group of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the metropolitan area of Granada, a city representative of the South of Spain, in order to evaluate the environmental management of the wastewater system. With that aim, the spatial and seasonal occurrence and distribution of a group of ECs in groundwater, surface and irrigation water resources from the aquifer "Vega de Granada" (VG) have been investigated for the first time. A set of the most prescribed drugs in Spain (ibuprofen, loratadine, pantoprazole and paracetamol), a pesticide widely used in agriculture (atrazine) and a typical anthropogenic contaminant (caffeine) were included in the study. Water samples were taken from the metropolitan area of the city of Granada inside of the zone of the aquifer, from the downstream of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and from the two main irrigation channels where surface and wastewater are mixed before distribution for irrigation purposes in the crops of the study area. A total of 153 water samples were analyzed through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) throughout the study that took place over a period of two years, from July 2011 to July 2013. Results demonstrated the occurrence of four of the six target pollutants. Ibuprofen was detected several times, always in both channels with concentration ranges from 5.3 to 20.8 mu g/L. The occurrence of paracetamol was detected in rivers and channels up to 34.3 mu g/l.. Caffeine was detected in all the water resources up to 39.3 mu g/L. Pantoprazole was detected twice in the surface water source near to a WWPT ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 mu g/L. The pesticide atrazine and the drug loratadine were not detected in any of the water samples analyzed. These results show evidence of poor environmental management of the wastewater concerning the water quality of the aquifer studied. The groundwater sources seem to receive a very continuous input of wastewater due to leaks from the drainage and sewerage system. This input may increase during rainy periods when it joins the recharge flow. The relationship between ECs and surface waters can be observed by comparing the averages for the rainy period with those for the driest. The highest concentration of ECs in irrigation water sources were detected in irrigation period times, between March and July. In general, concentration of the ECs uncovered in this study are similar to those reported in water sources from developed countries and environmental interpretation suggests that waste water management should be improved in order to reverse the current situation.

AB Urban source water protection requires knowledge of sources of fecal contamination upstream of drinking water intakes. Combined and sanitary sewer overflows (CSOs and SSOs) are primary sources of microbiological contamination and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) in urban water supplies. To quantify the impact of sewer overflows, predictive simulation models are required and have not been widely applied for microbial contaminants such as fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in urban drainage networks. The objective of this study was to apply a simulation model to estimate the dynamics of three contaminants in sewer overflows - total suspended solids, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and carbamazepine, a WWMP. A mixed combined and pseudo-sanitary drainage network in Quebec, Canada was studied and modelled for a total of 7 events for which water quality data were available. Model results were significantly correlated with field water quality data. The model confirmed that the contributions of E. coli from runoff and sewer deposits were minor and their dominant source was from sewage. In contrast, the main sources of total suspended solids were stormwater runoff and sewer resuspension. Given that it is not present in stormwater, carbamazepine was found to be a useful stable tracer of sewage contributions to total contaminant loads and also provided an indication of the fraction of total suspended solids originating from sewer deposits because of its similar response to increasing flowrates.

AB Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a group of pharmaceuticals widely prescribed to lower blood pressure and treat heart diseases. They have been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and downstream river waters, thus inducing a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about the behavior and fate of CCBs under UV irradiation, which has been adopted as a primary disinfection method for WWTP effluents. This study investigated the degradation kinetics and pathways of three commonly-used CCBs, including amlodipine (AML), diltiazem (DIL), and verapamil (VER), under UV (254 nm) irradiation. The chemical structures of transformation byproducts (TBPs) were first identified to assess the potential ecological hazards. On that basis, a generic solid-phase extraction method, which simultaneously used four different cartridges, was adopted to extract and enrich the TBPs. Thereafter, the photo-degradation of target CCBs was performed under UV fluences typical for WWTP effluent disinfection. The degradation of all three CCBs conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetics, with rate constants of 0.031, 0.044 and 0.011 min(-1) for AML, DIL and VER, respectively. By comparing the MS2 fragments and the evolution (i.e., formation or decay) trends of identified TBPs, the degradation pathways were proposed. In the WWTP effluent, although the target CCBs could be degraded, several TBPs still contained the functional pharmacophores and reached peak concentrations under UV fluences of 40-100 mJ cm(-2).

AB Pharmaceuticals are becoming widely distributed in waters and wastewaters and pose a serious threat to public health. The present study aimed to analyze non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in surface waters, drinking water, and wastewater in Tehran, Iran. Thirty-six samples were collected from surface waters, tap water, and influent and effluent of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). A solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for the determination of pharmaceuticals, namely ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DIC), and indomethacin (IDM). IBP was found in most of the samples and had the highest concentration. The highest concentrations of NSAIDs were found in the municipal WWTP influents and hospital WWTP effluents. In the municipal WWTP influent samples, the concentrations of IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 1.05, 0.43, 0.23, and 0.11 mu g/L, respectively. DIC was found only in one river sample. All NSAIDs were detected in tap water samples. However, their concentration was very low and the maximum values for IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 47, 39, 24, and 37 ng/L, respectively, in tap water samples. Results showed that the measured pharmaceuticals were detected in all rivers with low concentrations in nanograms per liter range, except DIC which was found only in one river. Furthermore, this study showed that the aforementioned pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during their passage through WWTPs. A potential environmental risk of selected NSAIDs for the urban wastewater has been discussed. However, given their low measured concentrations, no ecotoxicological effect is suspected to occur.

AB Contamination of surface waters in underdeveloped countries is a great concern. Treated and untreated wastewaters have been discharged into rivers and streams, leading to possible waterborne infection outbreaks which may represent a significant dissemination mechanism of antibiotic resistance genes among pathogenic bacterial populations.
   The present study aims to determine the multi-drug resistance patterns among isolated and identified bacterial strains in a pharmaceutical wastewater effluent in north Tunisia. Fourteen isolates were obtained and seven of them were identified. These isolates belong to different genera namely, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Exiguobacterium, Delftia and Morganella. Susceptibility patterns of these isolates were studied toward commonly used antibiotics in Tunisia. All the identified isolates were found to have 100% susceptibility against colistin sulfate and 100% resistance against amoxicillin. Among the 11 antibiotics tested, six patterns of multi-drug resistance were obtained. The potential of the examined wastewater effluent in spreading multi-drug resistance and the associated public health implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and Personal care products (PPCPs) are often found in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to insufficient removal during wastewater treatment processes. To understand the factors affecting the removal of PPCPs in classical activated sludge WWTPs, the present study was performed to assess the removal of frequently occurring pharmaceuticals (Naproxen, Fenoprofen, Ketoprofen, Dichlofenac, Carbamazepine) and the biocide Triclosan in activated sludge from four different Danish WWTPs. The respective degradation constants were compared to operational parameters previous shown to be of importance for degradation of micropollutants such as biomass concentration, and sludge retention time (SRT). The most rapid degradation, was observed for NSAID pharmaceuticals (55-90 % for Fenoprofen, 77-94 % for Ketoprofen and 46-90 % for Naproxen), followed by Triclosan (61-91 %), while Dichlofenac and Carbamazepine were found to be persistent in the systems. Degradation rate constants were calculated as 0.0026-0.0407 for NSAID pharmaceuticals and 0.0022-0.0065 for triclosan. No relationships were observed between degradation rates and biomass concentrations in the diverse sludges. However, for the investigated PPCPs, the optimal SRT was within 14-20 days (for these values degradation of these PPCPs was the most efficient). Though all of these parameters influence the degradation rate, none of them seems to be overall decisive. These observations indicate that the biological composition of the sludge is more important than the design parameters of the respective treatment plant.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been frequently found in the environment. It is, however, still not quite clear who is mainly responsible for API emissions. Hospitals have been considered to be the main contributing point sources for wastewater (WW) discharge of APIs. However, recent studies have shown that the contribution of hospitals to the input of APIs into the aquatic environment is quite low. Due to demographic change and the increase of psychiatric diseases, health institutions (His) such as psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes are likely to be important sources as well, but no data is available in this respect. This study aims to assess the impact of His and to provide a methodology to measure their respective contributions. Drawing on pharmaceutical consumption data for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012, this study identified API usage patterns for a psychiatric hospital (146 beds), a nursing home (286 inhabitants), and a general hospital (741 beds), the latter of which comprises three separate locations. All the HIs are located in two sub-regions of a county district with about 400,000 citizens in southwestern Germany. A selection of neurological drugs was quantified in the sewer of these facilities to evaluate the correlation between consumption and emission. The API contribution of His was assessed by comparing the specific consumption in the facilities with the consumption in households, expressed as the emission potential (I-EP). The study shows that the usage patterns of APIs in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home were different from the general hospital. Neurological drugs such as anticonvulsants, psycholeptics, and psydioanaleptics were mainly consumed in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home (74% and 65%, respectively). Predicted and average measured concentrations in the effluent of the investigated HIs differed mostly by less than one order of magnitude. Therefore, the consumption-based approach is a useful method to assess usage patterns of APIs in His and to predict their respective contributions to WW. The national contribution of His on total WW discharge of APIs compared to households was very low. Only the results for the sedative clomethiazole in general hospitals as well as the antidepressant moclobemide and the antipsychotic quetiapine for the nursing homes were found to deserve some attention. The regional comparison showed that in sub-regions with a comparably higher density of His, the allocated facilities could be seen as point sources emitting particular APIs. However, in general, the bulk of the consumed pharmaceuticals to WW discharge has to be attributed to households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pollution status of six anticancer agents in the river water and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Japan was surveyed with comparative analysis of the levels of four microbial and one psychotropic pharmaceuticals widely used for therapeutic medication. The area of survey is located in the Kanzaki-Ai River basin which is a major subcatchment of the Yodo River basin and is centered on a highly populated area that includes the middle and downstream reaches of the Yodo River. Selected cancer agents were bicalutamide, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, doxifluridine, tamoxifen, and tegafur. A combination of strong anion solid-phase extraction cartridge under pH 11 for adsorption and optimization of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) system was necessary to ensure high recovery rates (63-124 % for river water and 52-115 % for STP effluent). The year-round survey of these compounds in four seasons showed that all anticancer compounds were detected at median concentrations ranged from not detected to 32 ng/L in the river water and from not detected to 245 ng/L in the effluents of sewage treatment plants not using ozonation. In the case of bicalutamide (an active antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer), the maximum concentration detected was 254 ng/L in river water and 1032 ng/L in non-ozonated sewage treatment plant effluents. Based on the mass balance, sewage treatment plants were the primary sources of anticancer compounds as well as the other pharmaceuticals in the river, and the attenuation effect of the river water was small. Ozonation at sewage treatment plants was effective in removing these compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the existence of bicalutamide, doxifluridine, and tegafur in the river environment.

AB Trace levels of a variety of currently unregulated organic chemicals have been detected in treated wastewater effluents and surface waters that receive treated effluents. Many of these chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) originate from pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are used widely and that frequently are transported down the drain to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Actual effects of CECs on aquatic life have been difficult to document, although biological effects consistent with effects of some CECs have been noted. There is a critical need to find appropriate ways to screen wastewater sites that have the greatest potential of CEC risk to biota. Building on the work of several researchers, the authors present a screening framework, as well as examples based on the framework, designed to identify high-risk versus lower-risk sites that are influenced by WWTP effluent. It is hoped that this framework can help researchers, utilities, and the larger water resource community focus efforts toward improving CEC risk determinations and management of these risks.

AB Direct linkages between endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) from municipal and industrial wastewaters and impacts on wild fish assemblages are rare. The levels of plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) and Vtg messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to wastewater effluents and dilutions of 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estrogen activity, and fish assemblages in 10 receiving streams were assessed to improve understanding of important interrelations. Results from 4-d laboratory assays indicate that EE2, plasma Vtg concentration, and Vtg gene expression in fathead minnows, and 17-estradiol equivalents (E2Eq values) were highly related to each other (R-2=0.98-1.00). Concentrations of E2Eq in most effluents did not exceed 2.0ng/L, which was possibly a short-term exposure threshold for Vtg gene expression in male fathead minnows. Plasma Vtg in fathead minnows only increased significantly (up to 1136g/mL) in 2 wastewater effluents. Fish assemblages were generally unaffected at 8 of 10 study sites, yet the density and biomass of 79% to 89% of species populations were reduced (63-68% were reduced significantly) in the downstream reach of 1 receiving stream. These results, and moderate to high E2Eq concentrations (up to 16.1ng/L) observed in effluents during a companion study, suggest that estrogenic wastewaters can potentially affect individual fish, their populations, and entire fish communities in comparable systems across New York, USA.

AB The effluent of a wastewater treatment plant was treated in a pilot plant for reclaimed water production through the denitrification biofilter (DNBF) process, ozonation (O-3), and biologic aerated filtration (BAF). The combined process demonstrated good removal performance of conventional pollutants, including concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (27.8 mg center dot L-1) and total nitrogen (9.9 mg center dot L-1) in the final effluent, which met the local discharge standards and water reuse purposes. Micropollutants (e.g., antibiotics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals) were also significantly removed during the proposed process. Ozonation exhibited high antibiotic removal efficiencies, especially for tetracycline (94%). However, micropollutant removal efficiency was negatively affected by the nitrite produced by DNBF. Acute toxicity variations of the combined process were estimated by utilizing luminescent bacteria. Inhibition rate increased from 9% to 15% during ozonation. Carbonyl compound concentrations (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) also increased by 58% as by-products, which consequently increased toxicity. However, toxicity eventually became as low as that of the influent because the by-products were effectively removed by BAF. The combined DNBF/O-3/BAF process is suitable for the advanced treatment of reclaimed water because it can thoroughly remove pollutants and toxicity.

AB This study evaluated the behavior of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at laboratory-scale in removing the emerging contaminants, ibuprofen (IBP) and methylparaben (MPB), at different concentrations. Individual experiments were carried out for each pollutant and they were divided into six stages of operation, which included starting, load variation, and interim periods of system stabilization. The treated wastewater was synthetic, and it included the pollutions MPB or IBP, glucose as a co-substrate, macronutrients, and micronutrients. The inoculum used to start the reactor was an aerobic sludge from an SBR system used in the treatment of domestic wastewater, which presented with high-content organic material and featured good sedimentation characteristics. The removal percentages of the two compounds at concentrations of 300, 500, and 1000 mu g/L were not similar. For MPB, high removal percentages (>96 %) were obtained, while for IBP, decreasing removal percentages were found with increases in analyte concentration, exhibiting average values of 51 +/- 15.3, 26 +/- 16.6, and 16 +/- 5.4 %. Following the removal of IBP, this behavior showed pronounced effects in biomass inhibition during exposure to high concentrations of the pollutant.

AB A standardized protocol is demonstrated for bioluminescent strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYES, BLYAS and BLYR as high-throughput screening tools to monitor the estrogenic, androgenic and toxic potencies in wastewater. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay in wastewater monitoring was evaluated for 7 day semi-continuous batch reactor using activated sludge with hormones spiked raw sewage. Yeast bioluminescent assay successfully captured the rapid removal of estrogenic and androgenic activities in the bioreactors, and demonstrated rapid response (a parts per thousand currency sign4 h) with good reproducibility. This standardized protocol was then applied in a 12 months monitoring of the effluent of a WWTP located at Powell, TN, USA featuring parallel-operated full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) and traditional activated sludge (TAS) treatment. Monitoring results showed that estrogenic activity was persistent in all TAS and most MBR effluent samples, while residual androgenic activity was non-detectable throughout the monitored period. The estrogenic equivalents (EEQ) in TAS effluent ranged from 21.61 ng/L to 0.04 pg/L and averaged 3.25 ng/L. The EEQ in MBR effluent ranged from 2.88 ng/L to 0.0134 pg/L and averaged similar to 10 fold less (0.32 ng/L) than TAS. Despite the large temporal variation, MBR effluent EEQ was consistently lower than TAS on any given sampling date. Most MBR effluent samples also exhibited less cytotoxicity than TAS. Further analysis did not demonstrate significant correlation between effluent EEQ level and WWTP operational parameters including MLSS, SRT, HRT and BOD.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics in the environment has raised much concern in recent years. Understanding their release, fate and behaviour in the environment is vital to assess potential risks. In this study, a novel passive water sampler - diffusion gradients in thin-films for organics (o-DGT) - was employed to assess the occurrence and removal of antibiotics in two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) - one in China and the other in the United Kingdom (UK). Of the targeted compounds, 11 of 19 were detected in the Chinese WWTP (ND-200 ng/L) and 10 of 40 were found in the UK plant (ND-1380 ng/L). Florfenicol, lincomycin, ofloxacin and roxithromycin were most abundant in the Chinese WWTP (influent), while anhydrous erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, ofloxacin and sulfapyridine were the most abundant in the UK influent samples. Estimated Chinese and UK consumption data are used to interpret the results. Neither of the WWTPs was very effective at removing antibiotics: similar to 40-50% (overall) was removed by the two plants, with the rest being discharged into the receiving rivers. This is the first study using o-DGT to assess the occurrence and removal of antibiotics in WWTPs. o-DGT is a useful, cost-effective tool to assess WWTP performance and can highlight the effectiveness of treatment steps, which can be applied to wastewater based epidemiology studies.

AB The aims of this study are to investigate the fate of tetracycline (TC) and degradation products (DPs) in municipal biological wastewater treatment plant (MBWWTP) located in Elazig City (Turkey) and to determine the occurrence and transport of TC and DPs in surface water (SW) (Kehli Stream) which the effluents of the plant discharged. The aqueous phase removal of TC, 4-epitetracycline (ETC), 4-epianhydrotetracycline (EATC), and anhydrotetracycline (ATC) in the studied treatment plant was 39.4 +/- 1.9, 31.8 +/- 1.5, 15.1 +/- 0.7, and 16.9 +/- 0.8 %, respectively. According to the analyses' results of SW samples taken from downstream at every 500-m distance, TC and DPs decreased by the increase in the distance. In downstream, at 2000 m, TC, ETC, EATC, and ATC were 4.12 +/- 0.20, 6.70 +/- 0.33, 8.31 +/- 0.41, and 3.57 +/- 0.17 mu g/L, respectively. As a result, antibiotic pollution in the SW that takes the effluent of MBWWTP exists.

AB Ozonation applied for advanced (waste)water treatment has a great potential to form polar transformation products (TPs) with often unknown toxicity. The antiviral drug acyclovir is transformed during biological wastewater treatment into carboxy-acyclovir. Ozone further transforms carboxy-acyclovir into N-(4-carbamoyl-2-imino-5-oxoimidazolidin)formamido-n-methoxy-acid (COFA). Both TPs have been detected in environmental samples and finished drinking water. Here, carboxyacyclovir and COFA were produced at bench scale using treated wastewater and sewage sludge and were tested for aquatic toxicity in parallel with acyclovir. Carboxy-acyclovir was found to significantly reduce the level of reproduction of Daphnia magna (by 40% at 102 mg L-1), and COFA inhibited the growth of green algae (ErC10 of 14.1 mg L-1); no toxicity was observed for acyclovir up to 100 mg L-1. The predicted genotoxicity was not increased compared to that of the parent compound. In summary, the results highlight the importance of assessing the ecotoxicity of TPs formed during wastewater treatment, particularly in the case of ozonation.

AB Concern is increasing regarding the environmental impact of the high usage rate and intensive release of antibiotics used for human and animal therapy in major urban areas of China. In the present study, regional environmental distribution simulations and risk assessments for 3 commonly used fluoroquinolones in the Wenyu River catchment were conducted using a typical catchment model widely used in Europe. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics investigated (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) are consumed at high levels for personal health care in China. These antibiotics were simulated in the aquatic environment of the Wenyu River catchment across the Beijing City area for annual average concentrations, with regional predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of approximately 711ng/L, 55.3ng/L, and 22.2ng/L and local PECs up to 1.8 mu g/L, 116ng/L, and 43ng/L, respectively. Apart from hydrological conditions, the concentrations of fluoroquinolones were associated closely with the sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their serving population, as well as hospital distributions. The presence of these fluoroquinolones in the catchment area of the present study showed significant characteristics of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment in an urban river, with typical down-the-drain chemicals. Significantly high concentrations of specific antibiotics indicated non-negligible risks caused by the intensive use in the local aquatic environment in a metropolitan area, particularly ofloxacin in upstream Shahe Reservoir, middle stream and downstream Qing River, and Liangma River to the Ba River segment. Specific treatment measures for these pharmaceuticals and personal care products in STPs are required for such metropolitan areas. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2764-2770. (c) 2015 SETAC

AB Despite the high consumption of pharmaceuticals, mass loading and removal of these compounds in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in India have not been investigated. In this study, 43 pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as 13 of their metabolites were analyzed in five domestic STPs (wastewater influent, effluent, and sludge) and in raw domestic sewage collected in open sewerage channels in residential areas in India. The mean concentrations of amphetamine in two of the five STPs (mean: 4300 ng/L and 4720 ng/L) were the highest ever reported for wastewater influents, globally. Among artificial sweeteners, saccharin was the most abundant compound in influents (mean: 303,000 ng/L, df: 100%), followed by cyclamate [ 3460 ng/L, detection frequency (df): 75%] and sucralose (1460 ng/L, df: 100%). Elevated mean concentrations of an antimicrobial (triclocarban = 6180 ng/L), analgesic (ibuprofen = 2320 ng/L), antihypertensive (atenolol = 3180 ng/L), illicit drug (amphetamine = 984 ng/L), and saccharin (419,000 ng/L) were found in the Cooum River in Chennai. The median removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) ranged from 5% (norcocaine) to 100% (triclosan) for the five STPs. On the basis of the concentrations measured in influents, the mass loadings of PPCPs were estimated to range from 0.1 (norquetiapine) to 77,800 (saccharin) mg/d/1000 people. An estimated 2.55 kg of triclocarban, 3.24 kg of carbamazepine, 6.93 kg of amphetamine, and 252 kg of saccharin were discharged from a typical STP with an average flow rate of 20.7 million liters per day (serving a population of 325,000) in India.

AB The detection of microcontaminants in aquatic environments raises concerns about their potential to exert ecotoxicological effects and impact human health. In contrast to freshwater habitats, little information is available on environmental concentrations in urban estuarine and marine environments. This study investigated an extensive range of organic and inorganic microcontaminants in the Darwin Harbour catchment, a tropical estuary in northern Australia undergoing rapid urbanisation and industrial development. We sampled wastewater effluent and surface water from seven sites in Darwin Harbour for pharmaceuticals and personal care products, alkylphenols, hormones, pesticides, herbicides and metals. In vitro bioassays were used to estimate the (anti) estrogenic and (anti) androgenic activities of samples. Seventy-nine of 229 organic microcontaminants analysed were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 20 mu g/L, with acesulfame, paracetamol, cholesterol, caffeine, DEET and iopromide detected at the highest concentrations in wastewater effluent (20 mu g/L, 17 mu g/L, 11 mu g/L, 11 mu g/L, 10 mu g/L and 7.6 mu g/L, respectively). Levels of estrogenic activity ranged from estradiol equivalency quotients (EEQs) of <0.10 to 6.29 +/- 0.16 ng/L while levels of androgenic activity ranged from dihydrotestosterone equivalency quotients (DHTEQs) of <3.50 to 138.23 +/- 3.71 ng/L. Environmental concentrations of organic microcontaminants were comparable to ranges reported from aquatic environments worldwide with sewage effluent discharges representing the dominant source of entry into Darwin Harbour. The measured concentration range of DEET was higher than ranges reported in previous studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the chronic impact and biodegradability of sulfamethoxazole under anaerobic conditions. For this purpose, a lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor was operated in a sequence of different phases with gradually increasing sulfamethoxazole doses of 1 to 45 mg/L. Conventional parameters, such as COD, VFA, and methane generation, were monitored with corresponding antimicrobial concentrations in the reactor and the methanogenic activity of the sludge. The results revealed that anaerobic treatment was suitable for pharmaceutical industry wastewater with concentrations of up to 40 mg/L of sulfamethoxazole. Higher levels exerted toxic effects on themicrobial community under anaerobic conditions, causing the inhibition of substrate/COD utilization and biogas generation and leading to a total collapse of the reactor. The adverse long-term impact was quite variable for fermentative bacteria and methanogenic achaea fractions of the microbial community based on changes inflicted on the composition of the residual organic substrate and mRNA expression of the key enzymes.

AB Previous studies showed the presence of multiple emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in urban surface waters of Singapore even though there are no obvious direct wastewater discharges. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of 17 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disruptive compounds (EDCs) in a tropical urban catchment of Singapore. Monthly samples were collected from a reservoir and its 5 upstream tributaries during a 16-month period. Analysis of samples showed all sites had measurable PPCP and EDC concentrations, with caffeine (33.9-2980 ng/L), salicylic acid (5-838 ng/L), acetaminophen (<4-485.5 ng/L), BPA (<2- 919.5 ng/L) and DEET (13-270 ng/L) being the most abundant. Marked differences in concentrations of target analytes between the reservoir and upstream tributaries were observed, and were tentatively attributed to the spatial differences in source inputs, water dilution capacity as well as natural attenuation of EOCs. Significant correlations between EOCs and conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, turbidity, nutrients and cumulative precipitationwere observed. These factors appeared to affect the distribution and attenuation of EOCs, depending on their physicochemical properties. Rainfall also influenced the temporal distribution of caffeine, BPA, triclosan, fipronil and DEET in the reservoir. Ecological risk assessment showed that caffeine, acetaminophen, estrone, BPA, triclosan and fipronil may warrant further survey. In particular, BPA levels exceeded the literature-based Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) value, highlighting the need for source control and/or water remediation in this urban catchment.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are an increasing concern, since the improvement of analytical tools has enabled the detection of parent compounds, metabolites and transformation products of a wide range of pharmaceuticals. These micro-pollutants might compromise the water quality and therefore might become a risk for the environment in general and particularly for humans. Major concerns are for example antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to control infections with pathogenic bacteria. Excessive utilization of non-degradable antibiotics by human patients or in farm animals might lead to accumulation in the water compartment and subsequently to the promotion of resistance development when wide areas containing relevant bacteria have sufficient concentrations of active antibiotics leading to a constant selection pressure on the bacteria. Therefore, it would be attractive to develop a new generation of biodegradable antibiotics, which would rapidly disintegrate into innoxious and in the best case inorganic molecules such as water, carbonate, nitrate and alike in sewage treatment plants or surface water. The guiding principle is the "benign by design" concept. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to solve the problems of poor biodegradability and high concentrations of non-biodegradable substances from pharmaceutical wastewater after preliminary treatment, the organic components of the tail water (effluent from the preliminary treatment devises of the pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment station) were analyzed and the method of ozonation-hydrolysis acidification was used to treat tail water from the pharmaceutical factory. The ozone dosage, the reaction time and the changes of biodegradability were studied. The results measured by GC-MS showed that there were 51 types of organic substances in tail water which reduce the biodegradability. The results of the tests showed that 30 mg/L of ozone and 60-minutes of oxidation time were suitable conditions. In the ozonation-hydrolysis acidification process the COD removal rate ranged from 20% to 50%. The test results showed that the ozonation-hydrolysis acidification method could effectively improve the biodegradability of wastewater and provide the foundation for the follow treatment in urban sewage treatment plant using biological methods.

AB A substrate-immobilized (SI) TiO2 nanofiber (NF) photocatalyst for multiple uses was prepared through electrospinning and hot pressing. The rate of furfuryl alcohol degradation under UV irradiation was found to be the highest when the anatase to rutile ratio was 70:30; the rate did not linearly increase as a function of the NF film thickness, mainly due to diffusion limitation. Even after eight repeated cycles, it showed only a marginal reduction in the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of cimetidine. The effects of pH and different organic matter characteristics on the photodegradation of cimetidine (CMT), propranolol (PRP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated. The pH-dependence of the photocatalytic degradation rates of PRP was explained by electrostatic interactions between the selected compounds and the surface of TiO2 NFs. The degradation rates of CMT showed the following order: deionized water > L-tyrosine > secondary wastewater effluent (effluent organic matter) > Suwannee River natural organic matter, demonstrating that the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) can affect the photodegradation of CMT. Photodegradation of CBZ was affected by the presence of DOM, and no significant change was observed between different DOM characteristics. These findings suggest that the removal of CMT, PRP, and CBZ during photocatalytic oxidation using SI TiO2 NFs is affected by the presence of DOM and/or pH, which should be importantly considered for practical applications.

AB The phototransformation of acetaminophen (APAP) by UV/H2O2 in deionized water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents was studied systematically by a combination of analysis of the reaction intermediates and kinetic study. 1-(2-amino-5-hydroxyphenyl) ethanone (P1) and the reported N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetamide (P2) were identified as the main transformation intermediates during the transformation of APAP by UV/H2O2. There was no influence of center dot OH on the formation kinetics of P1, while its decay was promoted. The formation and decay kinetics of P2 were accelerated by increases in the concentration of center dot OH. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of center dot OH with APAP, P1, and P2 were 3.9 x 10(9), 8.1 x 10(9), and 4.7 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The kinetic study indicated that the main transformation of APAP also included transformation to 1,4-hydroquinone, although the accumulated concentration of 1,4-hydroquinone was quite low. The presence of anions (Cl-, HCO3-/CO32-, NO2-/NO3-), humic acid, commercial drug components or adjuvants, and dissolved organic matters in STP effluents not only changed the transformation kinetics of APAP, but also altered the distribution of the intermediates. The kinetics and pathway of APAP transformation in STP effluent were markedly different from those in deionized water. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A membrane-integrated continuous system was designed with new orientation of the membrane modules and investigated for treatment of industrial wastewater using forward osmosis (FO) in the upstream and nanofiltration in the recovery stage. Effects of applied pressure, cross-flow rate of feed water, variations of draw solution concentration and the run time on effectiveness of the system in separation and yield of pure water flux were studied in a continuous scheme in the context of pharmaceutical wastewater being a very complex system. Polyamide composite membranes out of a given lot were screened for application in FO and draw solute recovery stages. Two draw solutions in different concentrations (made of NaCl and MgSO4) were examined, where 0.5 M NaCl was found to be the best one for the FO stage. During investigation with pharmaceutical wastewater, more than 97 % purification could be achieved in terms of chemical oxygen demand while analysis of specific compounds such as Nebivolol and Paracetamol indicated almost 100 % removal. The study revealed that the new design could significantly reduce concentration polarization and reverse salt diffusion resulting in a sustained yield of pure water flux of around 52 L/m(2)h using NaCl as draw solute. Downstream nanofiltration module operated at only 12 bar trans-membrane pressure ensured continuous recovery and recycle of 99 % of the draw solute while producing safe reusable water at the rate of 58-60 L/m(2)h. The study culminates not only in a new design for a clean water environment but also in definite policy suggestions.

AB Home and personal care products (HPCPs) including biocides, benzotriazoles (BTs) and ultraviolet (UV) filters are widely used in our daily life. After use, they are discharged with domestic wastewater into the receiving environment. This study investigated the occurrence of 29 representative HPCPs, including biocides, BTs and UV filters, in the riverine environment of a rural region of South China where no wastewater treatment plants were present, and assessed their potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms. The results showed the detection of 11 biocides and 4 BTs in surface water, and 9 biocides, 3 BTs and 4 UV filters in sediment. In surface water, methylparaben (MeP), triclocarban (TCC), and triclosan (TCS) were detected at all sites with median concentrations of 9.23 ng/L, 2.64 ng/L and 5.39 ng/L, respectively. However, the highest median concentrations were found for clotrimazole (CLOT), 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (MBT) and carbendazim (CARB) at 55.6 ng/L, 33.7 ng/L and 13.8 ng/L, respectively. In sediment, TCC, TCS, and UV-326 were detected with their maximum concentrations up to 353 ng/g, 155 ng/g, and 133 ng/g, respectively. The concentrations for those detected HPCPs in surface water and sediment were generally lower in the upper reach (rural area) of Sha River than in the lower reach of Sha River with close proximity to Dongjiang River (Pt-test < 0.05), indicating other input sources of HPCPs in the lower reach. Biocides showed significantly higher levels in surface water in the wet season than in the dry and intermediate seasons. Preliminary risk assessment demonstrated that the majority of HPCPs monitored represented low risk in surface waters. There are potentially greater risks to aquatic organisms from the use of TCS and TCC in the wet season than in dry and intermediate seasons in surface waters. This preliminary assessment also indicates potential concerns associated with TCC, TCS, DEFT, CARB, and CLOT in sediments, although additional data should be generated to assess this fully. Thus future research is needed to investigate ecological effects of these HPCPs on benthic organisms in sediment of rural rivers receiving untreated wastewater discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper describes the fate of a nitrobenzene-degrading bacterium, Klebsiella oxytoca NBA-1, which was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment facility. The 90-day survivability of strain NBA-1 after exposure to sludge under anaerobic and aerobic conditions was investigated. The bacterium was inoculated into sludge amended with glucose and p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) to compare the bacterial community variations between the modified sludge and nitrobenzene amendment. The results showed that glucose had no obvious effect on nitrobenzene biodegradation in the co-metabolism process, regardless of the presence/absence of oxygen. When p-CNB was added under anaerobic conditions, the biodegradation rate of nitrobenzene remained unchanged although p-CNB inhibited the production of aniline. The diversity of the microbial community increased and NBA-1 continued to be one of the dominant strains. Under aerobic conditions, the degradation rate of both nitrobenzene and p-CNB was only 20% of that under anaerobic conditions. p-CNB had a toxic effect on the microorganisms in the sludge so that most of the DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) bands, including that of NBA-1, began to disappear under aerobic conditions after 90 days of exposure. These data show that the bacterial community was stable under anaerobic conditions and the microorganisms, including NBA-1, were more resistant to the adverse environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the rejection of surfactant (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, SDBS) was investigated at different feed solution (FS) chemistries (ionic strengths and SDBS concentrations, with and without the presence of organic foulants BSA and Alg-Na), temperatures and flow velocities in the forward osmosis (FO) process. SDBS rejection increased with the increase of flow velocity and the decrease of temperature and SDBS concentration; while it had no obvious change with the increasing FS ionic strength. SOBS rejection of FO membrane was high (more than 99.77%), mainly due to the size exclusion. Moreover, the water flux and effectiveness of physical cleaning were also measured. SDBS impacted water flux by two ways: one was the positive role that SDBS micelles enhanced the hydrophilia of membrane; the other one was the negative role that SDBS formed a gel cake layer and increase the resistance. The membrane fouling caused by Alg-Na increased solute rejection and water flux in the FO mode, which was beneficial to the total membrane process. Though BSA fouling increased solute rejection in the PRO mode, it declined water flux, and caused a severe pore blocking which was hard to remove just by the simple rinse. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB A countercurrent seepage bioreactor immobilized with Phanerochaete chrysosporium was continuously operated under non-sterile conditions to treat a synthetic wastewater spiked with naproxen and carbamazepine (1000 mu g/L each) for 165 days. There were no serious bacterial contaminations occurred during the operational period. Naproxen was always removed to the undetectable level regardless of the experimental conditions, while the average removal efficiency for carbamazepine, a well-known recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compound, reached around 80%. The excellent removal performance was mainly attributed to the application of countercurrent seepage mode and the cardhouse fabric of the carriers, which provided the high efficiency in the transfer of oxygen and nutrients inside the bioreactor. From the fungal immobilization combined with the temperature adjustment, the fungal activity including the enzyme production was protected as well as the bacterial contamination inside the reactor was suppressed effectively.

AB Widespread use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in mixture concentrations ranging from mg/L in effluent to mu g/L concentrations in surface water. In a 2008 study, 13 pharmaceuticals, ranging in amounts from 0.0028 to 0.1757 mu g/l, were identified in the Tennessee River, USA and its tributaries. In order to address the need for risk assessment of environmentally relevant pharmaceutical mixtures, Daphnia magna 21-d life cycle tests were performed on a mixture of 11 of the 13 pharmaceuticals as well as on the individual components of the mixture. Mixture exposures were based on the same initial ratios of individual compounds, up to 1000x the initial mixture concentrations. The endpoints of mortality, time to first brood, size, and fecundity were assessed. The LOEC of the 11-pharmaceutical mixture was determined to be 100x greater than the measured mixture concentration detected in the Tennessee River, with the NOEC being 75x that of the measured mixture. Single concentrations of pharmaceuticals within the mixture up to the 100x LOEC were not statistically different from control for any of the assessed endpoints. Thus, no single pharmaceutical was deemed predominately responsible for the mixture toxicity at the concentrations tested. While mixtures of pharmaceuticals are common in many systems, based on the findings of the present study, they may not pose a significant acute or chronic hazard to aquatic invertebrates at current concentrations.

AB Acute toxicities of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (ANAMMOX) substrates and four antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewaters on ANAMMOX process were reported. Individual and joint acute toxicity assays were performed using 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Results showed that IC50 values and their 95% confidence interval of ammonium chloride (A), sodium nitrite (B), penicillin G-Na (C), polymyxin B sulfate (D), chloramphenicol (E) and kanamycin sulfate (F) were 2708.9 (2247.9-3169.9), 1475.4 (1269.91680.9), 5114.4 (4946.4-5282.4), 10.2 (1.8-18.6), 409.9 (333.7-486.1) and 5254.1 (3934.4-6573.8) mg L-1 respectively, suggesting toxicities were in the order of D > E > B > A > C > F. Joint acute toxicities of bicomponent mixtures A and B, C and D, C and F, D and F were independent; D and E, E and F were additive while C and E were synergistic. Joint acute toxicities of multicomponent mixtures were synergistic or additive. Luminescent bacteria test is an easy and robust method for forecasting the feasibility of ANAMMOX process for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Kuwait is a country with low rainfall and highly concentrated industrial and domestic effluents entering its coastal waters. These can be both treated and untreated. In this study we sampled a series of coastal and open-sea sites and used a variety of analyses to identify those sites requiring the most attention. We used a high throughput GC-MS screen to look for over 1000 chemicals in the samples. Estrogen and androgen screens assessed the potential to disrupt endocrine activity. An oyster embryo development screen was used to assess biological effect potential. The chemical screen identified sites which had high numbers of identified industrial and domestic chemicals. The oyster screen showed that these sites had also caused high levels of developmental abnormalities with 100% of embryos affected at some sites. The yeast screen showed that estrogenic chemicals were present in outfalls at 2-3 ng/l E2 equivalent, and detectable even in some open water sites. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of solutions with paracetamol and diclofenac has been studied by electro-oxidation (E0x), in a reactor with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a stainless steel cathode. Different current densities were applying: 1.56 to 6.25 mA/cm(2). Close to 50% of mineralization is always achieved due to the great concentration of center dot OH generated at the BDD surface under EOx, with release of NH4+ and NO3- ions. Same solutions have been comparatively treated with electro-Fenton (EF/BDD) process, improved the mineralization reached 80% of efficiency. Reversed-phase chromatography was carrying out to identify some by products that evolve under de degradation process. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB N-nitrosamines and their precursors are significant concerns for water utilities exploiting wastewater-impacted water supplies, particularly those practicing potable reuse of wastewater. Previous efforts to identify specific precursors in municipal wastewater accounting for N-nitrosamine formation have met with limited success. As an alternative, we quantified the relative importance of greywater (i.e., shower, kitchen sink, bathroom washbasin, and laundry) and blackwater (i.e., urine and feces) streams in terms of their loadings of ambient specific and total N-nitrosamines and chloramine-reactive and ozone-reactive N-nitrosamine precursors to domestic sewage. Accounting for the volume fractions of individual greywater and blackwater streams, laundry water represented the most significant source of N-nitrosamines and their precursors, followed by shower water and urine. Laundry water was particularly important for ozone-reactive N-nitrosamine precursors, accounting for,similar to 99% of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors and similar to 69% of precursors for other uncharacterized N-nitrosamines. For the other greywater streams, consumer products contributed additional N-nitrosamines and precursors, but the remarkable uniformity across different products suggested the importance of common macroconstituents. The consumption of a standard dose of the antacid ranitidine substantially increased NDMA and its chloramine-reactive precursors in urine. Nevertheless, nearly 40% of the American population would need to consume ranitidine daily to match the NDMA loadings from laundry water.

AB A novel osmotic dilution process using commercial liquid fertilizer for greenwall irrigtion was evaluated. In this process, clean water was extracted from raw sewage by forward osmosis (FO) using a well all-purpose commercial liquid fertilizer as draw solution. The diluted liquid fertilizer can then be used for direct sustainable greenwall irrigation. Our results show that the presence of organic matter in the liquid fertilizer draw solution did not compromise FO membrane performance. No discernible changes in water flux and key membrane transport parameters (pure water permeability coefficient, A, and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficient, B) were observed when the organic matter concentration in the draw solution was increased to 2000 mg/L. Parameters influencing the osmotic dilution process were examined in terms of reverse salt flux, liquid fertilizer concentration, cross flow rate, and feed and liquid fertilizer draw solution temperatures. The reverse flux of phosphate was much lower compared to those of ammonium and potassium as the reverse flux of these solutes were proportionally related to theft hydrated radii. Cross-flow rate had no discernible impact on either water flux or reverse nutrient transport. Water and reverse nutrient fluxes increased markedly with increasing temperature, driven by higher water and solute diffusivities. More than 80% water recovery was achieved by osmotic dilution using raw sewage feed. Water production was stable and not affected by deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. By contrast, reverse nutrient diffusion was hindered due to enhanced steric hindrance. Results reported here have significant environmental implications. Extracting clean water from raw sewage by commercial liquid fertilizers harnesses unique FO mass transfer phenomena and balances greenwall nutrient requirement, thereby sustaining the greenvvall irrigation process.

AB Wastewater treatment systems are a primary pathway for pharmaceuticals (PhACs) entering the aquatic environment, which require reliable prediction through integrating the specific biodegradation processes into modeling framework. As ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are known to be able to catalyze the oxidation of a wide array of organic compounds, membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) that remove nitrogen autotrophically through aerobic ammonia oxidation by AOB followed by Anammox may be capable of removing PhACs. In this work, a mathematical model was constructed to assess the PhAC biodegradation and removal potential in MABR under various operational conditions. The cometabolic biodegradation kinetics was used to model PhAC biodegradation by both AOB and heterotrophs. Simulations show that AOB play a major role in PhAC biodegradation with minor contribution from heterotrophs under the influent condition with high-strength ammonium. Both oxygen surface loading and influent surface loading (or hydraulic retention time (HRT)) are found to significantly impact the simultaneous removal of PhACs and total nitrogen (TN) at the optimal biofilm thickness of 750 pm. Approximately 80% of PhACs can be removed in the MABR under operational conditions (oxygen surface loading and HRT) optimal for TN removal with above 75% TN removal achieved. When treating low-strength nitrogenous wastewater, PhAC removal efficiency decreases substantially due to the lower abundance of AOB. The presence of organic matters would substantially increase PhAC removal efficiency mainly via heterotrophs biodegradation pathway, but would suppress the Anammox activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Erlotinib is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of the most common type of lung cancer. Due to its recent introduction, very scarce information is available on its occurrence, environmental fate and toxicological effects on aquatic organisms. During chlorination processes normally carried out in wastewater treatment plants and in the pretreatment of hospital effluents, chlorinated transformation products can be formed with an enhanced toxicity relative to the parent compound.
   Thus, the reactivity of the cytostatic drug erlotinib in free chlorine-containing water was investigated for the first time in the present work. A non-targeted screening approach based on the use of differential profiling tools was applied in order to reveal its potential transformation products. Structural elucidation of the detected transformation products was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed approach allowed detecting a total of nineteen transformation products, being eighteen of them described for the first time in this work, which demonstrates its potential in environmental analysis. Among them, six compounds presented chlorine atoms in their structures, which may be of major concern. Other transformation products involved hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. Time-course profiles of erlotinib and its transformation products were followed in real wastewater samples under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. Although the structures of these transformation products could not be positively confirmed due to lack of standards, their chemical formulas and product ions can be added to databases, which will allow their screening in future monitoring studies.

AB The selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen is the most commonly used drug for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen is considered as a pro-drug since it is known to exert its pharmacological effect through its major active metabolites, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, which are mainly excreted in the urine in the days following administration.
   In the present work, the reactivity of tamoxifen and its major active metabolites in free chlorine-containing water was investigated for the first time. Under the studied chlorination conditions, tamoxifen was fairly stable whereas its metabolites were quickly degraded. A total of thirteen chlorinated byproducts were tentatively identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. Time-course profiles of the identified byproducts were followed in real wastewater samples under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. A preliminary assessment of their acute aquatic toxicity at two trophic levels by means of quantitative structure activity relationship models showed that the identified byproducts were up to 110-fold more toxic than the parent compounds.

AB In the present study, the bivalve Scrobicularia plana and the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana were exposed to an increasing carbamazepine (CBZ) concentration gradient. Both species are among the most widely used bioindicators, and CBZ is one of the most commonly found drugs in the aquatic environment. After a chronic exposure (28 days), the results obtained revealed that CBZ induced biochemical alterations in both species. Our findings demonstrated that S. plana and D. neapolitana reduced the CBZ accumulation rate at higher CBZ concentrations, probably due to their capacity to decrease their feeding rates at stressful conditions. Nevertheless, this defence mechanism was not enough to prevent both species from oxidative stress. In fact, S. plana and D. neapolitana were not able to efficiently activate their antioxidant defence mechanisms which resulted in the increase of lipid peroxidation, especially at the highest CBZ concentrations. Comparing both species, it seems that S. piano was the most sensitive species since stronger biochemical alterations were observed in this species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of 14 pharmaceuticals and 3 of their transformation products was studied in a full-scale source separated sanitation system with separate collection and treatment of black water and grey water. Black water is treated in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor followed by oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification-denitrification in a rotating biological contactor and struvite precipitation. Grey water is treated in an aerobic activated sludge process. Concentration of 10 pharmaceuticals and 2 transformation products in black water ranged between low mu g/l to low mg/l. Additionally, 5 pharmaceuticals were also present in grey water in low mu g/l range. Pharmaceutical influent loads were distributed over two streams, i.e. diclofenac was present for 70% in grey water, while the other compounds were predominantly associated to black water. Removal in the UASB reactor fed with black water exceeded 70% for 9 pharmaceuticals out of the 12 detected, with only two pharmaceuticals removed by sorption to sludge. Ibuprofen and the transformation product of naproxen, desmethylnaproxen, were removed in the rotating biological contactor. In contrast, only paracetamol removal exceeded 90% in the grey water treatment system while removal of other 7 pharmaceuticals was below 40% or even negative. The efficiency of pharmaceutical removal in the source separated sanitation system was compared with removal in the conventional sewage treatment plants. Furthermore, effluent concentrations of black water and grey water treatment systems were compared with predicted no-effect concentrations to assess toxicity of the effluent. Concentrations of diclofenac, ibuprofen and oxazepam in both effluents were higher than predicted no-effect concentrations, indicating the necessity of post-treatment. Ciprofloxacin, metoprolol and propranolol were found in UASB sludge in mu g/g range, while pharmaceutical concentrations in struvite did not exceed the detection limits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater compounds are frequently detected in urban shallow groundwater. Sources include sewage or reclaimed wastewater, but origins are often unknown. In a prior study, wastewater compounds were quantified in waters sampled from shallow groundwater wells in a small coastal California city. Here, we resampled those wells and expanded sample analyses to include sewage- or reclaimed water-specific indicators, i.e. pharmaceutical and personal care product chemicals or disinfection byproducts. Also, we developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based model of sanitary sewer exfiltration probability combining a published pipe failure model accounting for sewer pipe size, age, materials of construction, with interpolated depths to groundwater to determine if sewer system attributes relate to wastewater compounds in urban shallow groundwater. Across the wells, groundwater samples contained varying wastewater compounds, including acesulfame, sucralose, bisphenol A, 4-tert-octylphenol, estrone and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Fecal indicator bacterial concentrations and toxicological bioactivities were less than known benchmarks. However, the reclaimed water in this study was positive for all bioactivity tested. Excluding one well intruded by seawater, the similarity of groundwater to sewage, based on multiple indicators, increased with increasing sanitary sewer exfiltration probability (modeled from infrastructure within ca. 300 m of each well). In the absence of direct exfiltration or defect measurements, sewer exfiltration probabilities modeled from the collection system's physical data can indicate potential locations where urban shallow groundwater is contaminated by sewage.

AB Advanced wastewater treatment with granular activated carbon (GAC) is a promising option to reduce emissions of organic micropollutants (OMP) into the aquatic environment. Frequent back-washes of the GAC filters are required due to high particle concentration in the treated wastewater but lead to stratification. Differences in adsorption capacities of individual strata are not known. The present study aimed at investigating physical and chemical differences at different filter depths of a stratified GAC filter. Two different commercial products were stratified during repeated filter bed expansions and sectioned into vertical fractions. Bulk densities, grain size distributions and ash contents of the individual fractions differed significantly. Adsorption tests with pulverized GAC from different levels showed great vertical differences in adsorption properties. OMP removals determined in the upper part of a GAC filter therefore cannot be extrapolated downwards. Both physical and chemical vertical heterogeneities with regard to adsorption capacities and residence times at different filter depths should be considered in the filter design, in the monitoring of a GAC filter, and in the interpretation of the GAC filter performance. Good correlations between abatements of UV light absorption and OMP removals were found for the virgin GAC throughout the non-uniform filter.

AB Aquatic toxicity of municipal wastewater was evaluated in an acute toxicity test using water flea, Daphnia magna as an freshwater aquatic experimental animal model. Toxicity test were performed on samples of both untreated (raw) and treated wastewaters were collected Manisa municipal effluents. Undiluted untread and treated effluents were very toxic to D. magnaand cause to death of all exposed daphnids. Dilution of wastewaters was observed to decrease percentage of influence of biological toxicity based on dilutional rate. Acute toxic effect of untreated wastewater on D. magnawas more than that of treated wastewater. In addition, the longer the period of exposure to D. magna, the more significantly toxic effect increased.

AB Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent; however, the effects of ibuprofen on aquatic organisms are poorly understood. This study presents the transcriptome-wide response of the inland silverside, Menidia beryllina, to chronic exposure to ibuprofen. At the lowest exposure concentration (0.0115 mg/L), we detected a downregulation of many genes involved in skeletal development, aerobic respiration, and immune function. At the highest exposure concentration (1.15 mg/L), we detected increased expression of regulatory genes in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway and several immune genes involved in an inflammatory response. Additionally, there was differential expression of genes involved in oxidative stress responses and a downregulation of genes involved in osmoregulation. This study provides useful information for monitoring the effects of this common wastewater effluent contaminant in the environment and for the generation of biomarkers of exposure to ibuprofen that may be transferable to other fish species.

AB Highly hydrophobic Di 2-ethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most prevalent plasticizers in wastewaters. Since its half-life in biological treatment is around 25 days, it can be used as an efficiency indicator of wastewater treatment plant for the removal of hydrophobic emerging contaminants. In this study, the performance of submerged membrane bioreactor was monitored to understand the effect of DEHP on the growth of aerobic microorganisms. The data showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia concentration were detected below 10 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively for operating conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 4 and 6 hr, sludge retention time (SRT) = 140 day and sludge concentration between 11.5 and 15.8 g volatile solid (VS)/L. The removal efficiency of DEHP under these conditions was higher and ranged between 91% and 98%. Results also showed that the removal efficiency of DEHP in biological treatment depended on the concentration of sludge, as adsorption is the main mechanism of its removal. For the submerged membrane bioreactor, the pore size is the pivotal factor for DEHP removal, since it determines the amount of soluble microbial products coming out of the process. Highly assimilated microorganisms increase the biodegradation rate, as 74% of inlet DEHP was biodegraded; however, the concentration of DEHP inside sludge was beyond the discharge limit. Understanding the fate of DEHP in membrane bioreactor, which is one of the most promising and futuristic treatment process could provide replacement for conventional processes to satisfy the future stricter regulations on emerging contaminants.

AB The ability of a sub-surface treatment filtration system to remove nutrients, thirty-nine organic contaminants, metals, and antibiotic resistant gene (ARG)-bearing organisms, and to attenuate acute toxicity of wastewater lagoon effluents, was assessed. Significant removal was observed for nutrients between the conventional primary and secondary sewage lagoons, with further average attenuation of 59% and 50% of ammonia and total phosphorus (TP), respectively, within the filter. Effluent concentrations of ammonia ranged from 0.4 to 2.6 mg/L and concentrations of TP from 1 to 4.1 mg/L, with decreasing acute toxicity from primary to secondary lagoons, and no toxicity observed in the filtration system based on Microtox (R) assays. Most organic micropollutants were also efficiently removed between the primary and secondary lagoons (e.g., up to 98% for atenolol). However, in general, little attenuation occurred within the filter for estrogenic compounds (e.g., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol); beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol); antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine-Prozac); antibacterial agents (e.g., triclosan), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., diclofenac); lipid regulators (e.g., clofibric acid); and macrolide (e.g., clarithromycin) and sulfonamide (e.g., sulfamethazine) antibiotics; or metals (Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn). This lack of removal was likely due to a minimal hydraulic residence time within the filter (similar to 6 h) under current operating conditions. The lagoon treatment system effectively removed similar to 99% of sulfonamide resistant bacteria, but the filter both reduced tetracycline-resistant bacteria (similar to 58%) in wastewater and harbored them in the biofilms, as relative abundances of sul and tet genes were greatest there. The filter also harbored nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, respectively, contributing to N removal. These results suggest that the constructed sub-surface treatment filtration system can provide a low-cost, low-maintenance, and effective means to reduce nutrient loading and improve microbial community structure and function.

AB In order to evaluate surface water and the sediment quality of rivers connected to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment technologies, fish embryo tests (FET) with Danio rerio were conducted using native water and sediment samples collected upstream and downstream of four WWTPs in Southern Germany. Two of these WWTPs are connected to the Schussen River, a tributary of Lake Constance, and use a sand filter with final water purification by flocculation. The two others are located on the rivers Schmiecha and Eyach in the area of the Swabian Alb and were equipped with a powdered activated carbon stage 20 years ago, which was originally aimed at reducing the release of stains from the textile industry. Several endpoints of embryo toxicity including mortality, malformations, reduced hatching rate, and heart rate were investigated at defined time points of embryonic development. Higher embryotoxic potentials were found in water and sediments collected downstream of the WWTPs equipped with sand filtration than in the sample obtained downstream of both WWTPs upgraded with a powdered activated carbon stage.

AB This study addresses the occurrence of carbamazepine and diazepam and their metabolites in the wastewater of the University Hospital (HUSM) of the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS-Brazil. Samples were collected from three sampling points of the sewage treatment system: point A ('emergency effluent'), point B ('general effluent') and point C ('water course-receptor'). Eight metabolites were identified: carbamazepine-10-11-epoxide, 10-dihydro-carbamazepine, 2-OH-carbamazepine, iminoquinone, acridone, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. The mean concentrations in the emergency, general effluent and water course-receptor were as follows: 433.0 +/- 4.7, 349.0 +/- 5.0 and 485.0 +/- 5.6 ng L-1, for carbamazepine and 550.0 +/- 4.3, 441.0 +/- 7.9 and 586.6 +/- 9.3 ng L-1, for diazepam, respectively. Liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS) proved to be a method fit-to-purpose. The determination of carbamazepine and diazepam, and the identification of active metabolites showing environmental persistence (carbamazepine-10-11-epoxide, nordiazepam and oxazepam) revealed the need for a more effective treatment of the HUSM effluent. As far as we know, no similar study has been carried out on the wastewater of Brazilian hospitals.

AB The presence of five different pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, was determined in influent and effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) near the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland, and in the receiving water, northern Lake Paijanne. In addition, samples of sedimented particles were collected among water samples from five locations near the discharge point of the treated wastewater. The solid phase extracts (SPEs) of water samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The studied pharmaceuticals were detected from influent, effluent, and lake water but also in the sedimented particles. The concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in Lake Paijanne ranged from 1 to 21 ng L-1, 4 to 209 ng L-1, 5 to 836 ng L-1, 9 to 952 ng L-1, and 2 to 129 ng L-1, respectively. The concentrations of ketoprofen in sedimented particles ranged from 79 to 135 mu g g(-1) while only trace amounts of other selected pharmaceuticals were detected. The results indicate that the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are affected by the biological and chemical reactions occurring in the wastewater treatment processes but also by the UV light in the photic layer of Lake Paijanne. It can be concluded that considerable amount of selected pharmaceuticals are present in the influent and effluent of municipal WWTP but also in the water phase and sedimented particles of northern Lake Paijanne.

AB Surface water samples constantly receive a vast mixture of micropollutants mainly originating from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). High-throughput live cell arrays provide a promising method for the characterization of the effects of chemicals and the associated molecular mechanisms. In the present study, this test system was evaluated for the first time for the characterization of a set of typical surface water extracts receiving effluent from WWTPs. The extracts containing complex mixtures of micropollutants were analyzed for the expression of 90 stress responsive genes in the Escherichia coli reporter gene assay. The most affected pathways and the genes most sensitive to surface water samples suggested prominent stress-responsive pathways for wastewater-impacted surface water, such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, and drug resistance. Samples strongly affecting particular pathways were identified by statistical analysis of gene expression. Transcription data were correlated with contamination data from chemical screening and percentages of wastewater in the samples. Samples with particular effects and outstanding chemical composition were analyzed. For these samples, hypotheses on the alteration of the transcription of genes involved in drug resistance and DNA repair attributable to the presence of pharmaceuticals were drawn.

AB Preventive measures for the control of environmental pollution and its remediation has received much interest in recent years due to the world-wide increase in the contamination of water bodies. Contributions of these harmful effluents are caused by the leather processing, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, textile, agricultural and other chemical industries. Nowadays, advanced oxidation processes considered to be better option for the complete destruction of organic contaminants in water and wastewater. Acid Blue 113 is a most widely used di-azo compound in leather, textile, dying and food industry as a color rending compound. In the present study, we have reported the photo catalytic degradation of Acid Blue 113 using a nanocrystalline semiconductor doped rare earth oxide as a photo catalyst under UV light irradiation. The photocatalyst was prepared by a simple precipitation technique and were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRS and FE-SEM analysis. The experimental results proved that the prepared photo catalyst was nanocrystalline and highly active in the UV region. The UV-DRS results showed the band gap energy was 3.15 eV for the prepared photo catalyst. The photodegradation efficiency was analyzed by various experimental parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage, variation of substrate concentration and effect of electrolyte addition. The photo degradation process followed a pseudo first order kinetics and was continuously monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometer. The experimental results proved the efficacy of the nanocrystalline zinc oxide doped dysprosium oxide which are highly active under UV light irradiations. It is also suggested that the prepared material would find wider applications in environmental remediation technologies to remove the carcinogenic and toxic moieties present in the industrial effluents.

AB The aim of present study is to develop a mathematical model to understand the photomineralization process for an antiseptic drug component, chlorhexidine digluconate using catalytic membrane. Overall process was executed in a photo reactor with immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles on the membrane surface, which gives the better recovery and reuse of the catalyst. To assess the overall process performance, a mathematical model has been developed for prediction of substrate concentration in the permeate stream and the theoretical build-up of the polarized layer in case of a membrane coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. In the developed mathematical model, the governing partial differential equation was solved with the help of initial boundary condition over the concentration boundary layer and Kozeny-Carmen equation. In this model the simultaneous change in the active surface area and the polarized layer thickness with the change in substrate concentration in the boundary layer was incorporated to enhance the accuracy of the model. The resulting non-linear partial differential equation, coupled with other nonlinear ordinary differential equation is solved using Runga Kutta fourth order method. Average deviation between theoretical results and the experimental data generated in this study was found to remain within +/- 5% and precision level was maintained at 0.01%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB In recent years deposal of pharmaceutical wastes has become a major problem globally. Therefore, it is necessary to removes pharmaceutical waste from the municipal as well as industrial effluents before its discharge. The convectional wastewater and biological treatments are generally failed to separate different drugs from wastewater streams. Thus, heterogeneous photocatalysis process becomes lucrative method for reduction of detrimental effects of pharmaceutical compounds. The main disadvantage of the process is the reuse or recycle of photocatalysis is a tedious job. In this work, the degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibiotic drug, by heterogeneous photocatalysis was study using supported TiO2 nanoparticle. The major concern of this study is to bring down the limitations of suspension mode heterogeneous photocatalysis by implementation of immobilized TiO2 with help of calcium alginate beads. The alginate supported catalyst beads was characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDAX) as well as the characteristic crystalline forms of TiO2 nanoparticle was confirmed by XRD. The degradation efficiency of TiO2 impregnated alginate beads (TIAB) was compared with the performance of free TiO2 suspension. Although, the degradation efficiency was reduced considerably using TIAB but the recycle and reuse of catalyst was increased quite appreciably. The kinetic parameters related to this work have also been measure. Moreover, to study the susceptibility of the present system photocatalysis of other three drugs ibuprofen (IBP), atenolol (ATL) and carbamazepine (CBZ) has been carried out using immobilized TiO2. The continuous mode operation in PBPR has ensured the applicability of alginate beads along with TiO2 in wastewater treatment. The variation of residence time has significant impact on the performance of PBPR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonamide-based antibiotics are often detected in surface water and secondary wastewater effluent and pose an eminent threat for the development of antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes in aquatic environment. This paper presents the kinetics and stoichiometry of the oxidation of sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethazine, and sulfadimethoxine) by ferrate(VI) (FeO42-, Fe(VI)) in the acidic to basic pH range (2.0-9.6); apparent second-order rate constants (k(app), M s(-1)) decreased non-linearly with increase in pH. The specific rate constants for the individual Fe(VI) species (H3FeC4+, H2FeO4, HFeO4-, and FeO4-) were determined using acid-base equilibria of Fe(VI) and sulfonamides. The reactivity order of Fe(VI) species with the neutral sulfonamide was H3FeO4+>H2FeO4 > HFeO4-, which generally explained the pH dependence behavior of rate constants. Detailed studies regarding the resultant oxidized products (OPs) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry were performed for oxidation of SMX at different molar ratios of Fe(VI) to SMX (i.e., 1.0-15) and at different pH's (i.e., 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0); oxidative degradative products include 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, and hydroxyl-, hydroxylamine-, nitroso-, and nitro-derivatives of SMX. The possible reaction pathways comprise the S-N bond cleavage, ring-opening of isoxazole moiety, oxidation of aromatic amine, and the hydroxylation of the benzene ring; different OPs formed under acidic, neutral, and basic pH conditions are described. The value of k(app), 8.9 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7.0 suggests the oxidative transformation of SMX in seconds by 1 mg L-1 K2FeO4 and interestingly, the removal of SMX could be achieved at neutral pH by Fe(VI) in the presence of humic acid.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and artificial sweeteners (ASs) are emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in the aquatic environment. The presence of PPCPs and ASs in water bodies has an ecologic potential risk and health concern. Therefore, it is needed to detect the pollution sources by understanding the transport behavior of sewage molecular markers in a subsurface area. The aim of this study was to evaluate transport of nine selected molecular markers through saturated soil column experiments. The selected sewage molecular markers in this study were six PPCPs including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CF), crotamiton (CTMT), diethyltoluamide (DEET), salicylic acid (SA) and three ASs including acesulfame (ACF), cyclamate (CYC), and saccharine (SAC). Results confirmed that ACF, CBZ, CTMT, CYC and SAC were suitable to be used as sewage molecular markers since they were almost stable against sorption and biodegradation process during soil column experiments. In contrast, transport of ACT, CF and DEET were limited by both sorption and biodegradation processes and 100% removal efficiency was achieved in the biotic column.
   Moreover, in this study the effect of different acetate concentration (0-100 mg/L) as an easily biodegradable primary substrate on a removal of PPCPs and ASs was also studied. Results showed a negative correlation (r(2) > 0.75) between the removal of some selected sewage chemical markers including ACF, CF, ACT, CYC, SAC and acetate concentration. CTMT also decreased with the addition of acetate, but increasing acetate concentration did not affect on its removal. CBZ and DEET removal were not dependent on the presence of acetate.

AB In the last decades, awareness regarding personal care products (PCP), i.e. synthetic organic chemicals frequently used in cosmetic and hygienic products, has become a forward-looking issue, due to their persistency in the environment and their potential multi-organ toxicity in both human and wildlife. Seafood is one of the most significant food commodities in the world and, certainly, one of the most prone to bioaccumulation of PCP, what can consequently lead to human exposure, especially for coastal population, where its consumption is more marked. The aim of this work was to evaluate the co-occurrence of musk fragrances and UV-filters in both seafood and macroalgae collected in different European hotspots (areas with high levels of pollution, highly populated and near wastewater treatment plants). Despite the fact that UV-filters were detected in three different kind of samples (mussel, mullet, and clam), in all cases they were below the limit of quantification. Galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) were the musk fragrances most frequently detected and quantified in samples from the European hotspots. Cashmeran (DPMI) was also detected in most samples but only quantified in two of them (flounder/herring and mullet). The highest levels of HHCB and AHTN were found in mussels from Po estuary.

AB An optimized solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the effective analysis of 35 antibiotics including sulfonamides (SAs), quinolones (QLs), tetracyclines (TCs), macrolides (MALs), lincomycin (LIN), and chloramphenicol (CAP). The addition of 0.1 % formic acid to the mobile phase was favorable for the formation of [M + H](+) and the enhancement in the detection signals, but using ammonium formate decreased [M + H](+) with a corresponding reduction in the response of CAP. The optimal pH range for the SPE was 4.5 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 5.0 with 6 mL aqueous ammonia/methanol (5/95, v/v) as the optimized eluent. An internal standard (IS) was selected for each type of analytes based on similarities in classification and retention time. The detection was completed in less than 10 min and was excellent with method detection limits (MDL) of 0.29 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 4.03 ng/L. The recoveries of the antibiotics in samples from ultrapure water and groundwater were 67.13 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 93.00 % and 68.91 similar to aEuro parts per thousand 92.67 %, respectively. The antibiotics in samples collected from wastewater, surface water, and groundwater were also effectively detected. This newly developed method has the advantages of short detection times, small sample consumption, excellent reproducibility, and high sensitivity. This provides a reliable and promising technique for the simultaneous detection and monitoring of various residual antibiotics in aqueous environmental samples.

AB This study aimed to determine the effect of sludge stabilization treatments (liming and anaerobic digestion) on the mobility of different pharmaceutical compounds in soil amended by landspreading of treated sludge from different sources (urban and hospital). The sorption and desorption potential of the following pharmaceutical compounds: carbamazepine (CBZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), salicylic acid (SAL), ibuprofen (IBU), paracetamol (PAR), diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), econazole (ECZ), atenolol (ATN), and their solid-liquid distribution during sludge treatment (from thickening to stabilization) were investigated in the course of batch testing. The different sludge samples were then landspread at laboratory scale and leached with an artificial rain simulating 1 year of precipitation adapted to the surface area of the soil column used. The quality of the resulting leachate was investigated. Results showed that ibuprofen had the highest desorption potential for limed and digested urban and hospital sludge. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, diclofenac, and paracetamol were the only compounds found in amended soil leachates. Moreover, the leaching potential of these compounds and therefore the risk of groundwater contamination depend mainly on the origin of the sludge because ibuprofen and diclofenac were present in the leachates of soils amended with urban sludge, whereas paracetamol and salicylic acid were found only in the leachates of soils amended with hospital sludge. Although carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, econazole, and atenolol were detected in some sludge, they were not present in any leachate. This reflects either an accumulation and/or (bio)degradation of these compounds (CBZ, CIP, SMX, KTP, ECZ, and ATN ), thus resulting in very low mobility in soil. Ecotoxicological risk assessment, evaluated by calculating the risk quotients for each studied pharmaceutical compound, revealed no high risk due to the application on the soil of sludge stabilized by liming or anaerobic digestion.

AB Pharmaceuticals, such as anti-inflammatory nonsteroidal drugs, are frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems. Studies about the effects of these substances in nontarget organisms, such as bivalves, are relevant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on antioxidant status caused by ibuprofen (IBU) in oysters Crassostrea gigas exposed for 1, 4, and 7 days at concentrations 1 and 100 mu g L-1. Levels of IBU in tissues of oysters, as well as cell viability of hemocytes, were measured. The transcription of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, CYP30C1), glutathione S-transferase isoforms (GST-omega-like and GST-pi-like), cyclooxygenase-like (COX-like), fatty acid binding protein-like (FABP-like), caspase-like, heat shock protein-like (HSP70-like), catalase-like (CAT-like), and the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also evaluated in the gills of oysters. The highest levels of IBU were observed in animals exposed to 100 mu g L-1. A significant upregulation of CYP2AU1, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, GST-pi-like, COX-like, and FABP-like was observed in oysters exposed to IBU under different experimental conditions. Oysters exposed to 1 mu g L-1 for 7 days showed a significantly higher transcription of CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, and GST-pi-like but lower GR activity. In conclusion, C. gigas exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBU (1 mu g L-1) exhibited increased transcription of certain genes and alterations on antioxidant and auxiliary enzymes, which could, in the the long term, cause damages to exposed organisms.

AB Urban effluents are rich in nutrients, organic matter, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, hydrocarbons, surfactants, and others. Previous studies have shown that oysters Crassostrea gigas accumulate significant levels of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) in sanitary sewage contaminated sites, but there is little information about its toxicological effects in marine bivalves. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcription of genes in two tissues of C. gigas exposed for 12, 24, and 36 h to LABs or sanitary sewage. Likewise, the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes was measured in oysters exposed for 36 h in all groups. Oysters exposed to LABs and oysters exposed to sanitary sewage showed different patterns of transcriptional responses. LAB-exposed oysters showed lower level of biological responses than the oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Despite the ability of the oyster C. gigas to accumulate LABs (28-fold), the data indicate that these contaminants are not the cause for the transcriptional responses observed in oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Possibly, the biological changes observed in the sanitary sewage-exposed oysters are associated with the presence of other contaminants, which might have caused synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. The results show that FABP-like and GST-omega-like messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have a rapid response in tissues of oyster C. gigas exposed to sanitary sewage, suggesting a possible protective response and a role in maintaining homeostasis of these organisms.

AB In the present study, in vitro toxicity as well as biopersistence and photopersistence of four artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharine, and sucralose) and five antibiotics (levofloxacin, lincomycin, linezolid, marbofloxacin, and sarafloxacin) and of their phototransformation products (PTPs) were investigated. Furthermore, antibiotic activity was evaluated after UV irradiation and after exposure to inocula of a sewage treatment plant. The study reveals that most of the tested compounds and their PTPs were neither readily nor inherently biodegradable in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-biodegradability tests. The study further demonstrates that PTPs are formed upon irradiation with an Hg lamp (UV light) and, to a lesser extent, upon irradiation with a Xe lamp (mimics sunlight). Comparing the nonirradiated with the corresponding irradiated solutions, a higher chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for the irradiated solutions of linezolid. Neither cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity was found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their PTPs. Antimicrobial activity of the tested fluoroquinolones was reduced after UV treatment, but it was not reduced after a 28-day exposure to inocula of a sewage treatment plant. This comparative study shows that PTPs can be formed as a result of UV treatment. The study further demonstrated that UV irradiation can be effective in reducing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics, and consequently may help to reduce antimicrobial resistance in wastewaters. Nevertheless, the study also highlights that some PTPs may exhibit a higher ecotoxicity than the respective parent compounds. Consequently, UV treatment does not transform all micropollutants into harmless compounds and may not be a large-scale effluent treatment option.

AB Antibiotics that are widely used in human and veterinary medicine, over the past few years, antibiotics have been considered emerging pollutants due to their continuous input and persistence in the aquatic ecosystem even at low concentrations. Antibiotics as pollutants are detected nowadays in wastewater and surface water. They are carried with animal excreta and liquid manure into streams. Two extraction methods have been studied for detection of antibiotics in human urine using several solvents. The antibacterial and antifungal potentialities of the urine samples extract were determined against yeasts, bacteria and molds studied. The extracted residue was analyzed for antibiotic present using ultraviolet UV, Infrared IR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR, Mass spectra and C-13. This work provided a preliminary investigation of Erythromycin aglycone which is not known in nature, but its presence by hydrolysis were detected in human urine samples.

AB The present study determines removal rates (RR) of 56 pharmaceuticals and metabolites, respectively, in an urban sewage treatment plant using mass flow analysis by comparing influent and effluent loads over a consecutive ten-day monitoring period. Besides well investigated compounds like carbamazepine and metoprolol, less researched targets, such as topiramate, pregabalin, telmisartan, and human metabolites of pharmaceuticals were included. Another aim was to determine the ratio of pharmaceuticals and corresponding metabolites in raw wastewater.
   Valsartan and gabapentin were detected at the highest average concentrations in influent (c(val) = 29.7 (+/- 8.1) mu g/L, c(gab)= 13.2 (+/- 3.3) mu g/L) and effluent (c(val)= 22.1 (+/- 5.1) mu g/L, c(gab)= 12.1 (+/- 2.6) mu g/L) samples. The comparison of mass loads in influent and effluent showed a significant removal (p < 0.1) for 20 compounds but only enalapril, eprosartan, losartan, pregabalin, and quetiapine were removed from the aqueous phase by more than 50%. Another 20 compounds were determined without significant difference and for five compounds (clindamycin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, O-desmethyl venlafaxine, triamterene), a significant higher mass load in the effluent than in the influent was observed.
   It has to be noticed that metabolites like 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy carbamazepine (MHD) are found in higher mass loads than the corresponding parent compound in the sewage samples. Furthermore, metabolites and parent compound behave differently in the sewage treatment process. While MHD (RR= 15.1%) was detected with lower mass load in the effluent than in the influent, oxcarbazepine (RR=-73.2%) showed the contrary pattern. When comparing expected and measured ratios of parent compound and metabolite in raw sewage, citalopram/N-desmethyl citalopram for example, showed good results. However, a major problem exists due to insufficient data regarding metabolism and excretion of many pharmaceuticals. This complicates the prediction of relevant metabolites and further efforts are needed to overcome this problem. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and groundwater recharge can counteract water scarcity and reduce pollution of surface waters, but assessing its environmental risk should likewise consider effects associated to the soil. The present study therefore aimed at determining the impact of wastewater irrigation on the habitat quality of water after soil passage and of soil after percolation by applying bioassays and chemical analysis. Lab-scale columns of four different soils encompassing standard European soil and three field soils of varying characteristics and pre-contamination were continuously percolated with treated wastewater to simulate long-term irrigation. Wastewater and its percolates were tested for immobilization of Daphnia magna and growth inhibition of green algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and water lentils (Lemna minor). The observed phytotoxicity of the treated wastewater was mostly reduced by soil passage, but in some percolates also increased for green algae. Chemical analysis covering an extensive set of wastewater-born organic pollutants demonstrated that many of them were considerably reduced by soil passage, particularly through peaty soils. Taken together, these results indicated that wastewater-born phytotoxic substances may be removed by soil passage, while existing soil pollutants (e.g. metals) may leach and impair percolate quality. Soils with and without wastewater irrigation were tested for growth of plants (Avena sativa, Brassica napus) and soil bacteria (Arthrobacter globiformis) and reproduction of collembolans (Folsomia candida) and oligochaetes (Enchytraeus crypticus, Eisenia fetida). The habitat quality of the standard and two field soils appeared to be deteriorated by wastewater percolation for at least one organism (enchytraeids, plants or bacteria), while for two precontaminated field soils it also was improved (for plants and/or enchytraeids). Wastewater percolation did not seem to raise soil concentrations of classical organic pollutants and priority substances, while a significant retention was found for zinc and several organic micropollutants, particularly in the peaty soils, thus matching these soils' observed higher removal efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that benefits of wastewater irrigation can come with the cost of deteriorating soil habitat quality and depend on the respective soil and considered test organism. The approach employed here represents a feasible tool to assess these integrated effects at lab-scale while being predictive for scenarios at field-scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates if ozonation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent can reduce the negative impacts of effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the adsorption of organic micro-pollutants (OMP) onto powdered activated carbon (PAC). Pre-treatment of the water included membrane filtration for the removal of suspended/colloidal organics, ozonation with various specific ozone consumptions, and subsequent OMP spiking to comparable initial concentrations in all of the ozonated waters. This approach allowed for comparative PAC adsorption tests. Adsorption analyses show that the adsorbability of EfOM decreases with increasing specific ozone consumptions. This is also reflected by liquid chromatography with online carbon and UV254 detection (LC-OCD) which shows the ozone-induced disintegration of large EfOM into smaller fragments. Also, small organic neutrals are decreased while the small organic acids peak continuously increases with rising specific ozone consumptions. UV254 demonstrates that the aromaticity of all LC-OCD fractions continuously declines together with increasing specific O-3 consumptions. This explains the varying EfOM adsorbabilities that occur due to ozonation. The ozone-induced decrease of EfOM adsorbability directly translates into reduced adsorption competition against the adsorption of OMP. With higher specific ozone consumptions, OMP removal and OMP loadings increase. The reduced adsorption competition is reflected in the outputs from equivalent background compound (EBC) modeling. In each of the ozonated waters, correlations between the OMP removals and the UV254 removal were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microbacterium sp. strain BR1 is a bacterial strain that recently received attention for its capability to mineralize sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and other sulfonamides. In this study, the survival of Microbacterium sp. in municipal sludge waters was tested in batch experiments to explore optimal process conditions. Inoculation of Microbacterium sp. was subsequently performed in a pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) operated in two configurations: treating full-scale MBR permeate (post-treatment) and treating raw municipal wastewater. SMX removal by Microbacterium sp. could not be proved in any of the configurations, except for SMX concentrations far higher than the ones normally found in municipal wastewater. By use of molecular tools (fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis) a low capability to survive in activated sludge systems was assessed. After inoculation, Microbacterium sp. was reduced to a small fraction of the viable biomass. The observed growth rate appeared to be many times lower than the one of typical activated sludge micro-organisms. Possibilities of application in full-scale municipal wastewater treatment are scarce.

AB We analyzed bat carcasses (Myotis lucifugus, M. sodalis, M. septentrionalis, and Eptesicus fuscus) from the northeastern United States for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The CECs detected most frequently in samples were PBDEs (100 %), salicylic acid (81 %), thiabendazole (50 %), and caffeine (23 %). Other compounds detected in at least 15 % of bat samples were digoxigenin, ibuprofen, warfarin, penicillin V, testosterone, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). The CECs present at the highest geometric mean wet weight concentrations in bat carcasses were bisphenol A (397 ng/g), I PDBE pound congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 (83.5 ng/g), triclosan (71.3 n/g), caffeine (68.3 ng/g), salicylic acid (66.4 ng/g), warfarin (57.6 ng/g), sulfathiazole (55.8 ng/g), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (53.8 ng/g), and DEET (37.2 ng/g). Bats frequently forage in aquatic and terrestrial habitats that may be subjected to discharges from wastewater-treatment plants, agricultural operations, and other point and nonpoint sources of contaminants. This study shows that some CECs are accumulating in the tissue of bats. We propose that CECs detected in bats have the potential to affect a number of physiological systems in bats including hibernation, immune function, and response to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease causing population-level impacts to bats.

AB A fast and sensitive monitoring method for trace pharmaceuticals in the environment is vital because many of these compounds are ubiquitous, persistent, and biologically active with recognized endocrine-disruption and pharmacological functions. A rapid and reliable ultra high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry was developed in the present study to simultaneously identify, confirm, and quantify 60 target pharmaceuticals in wastewater samples. The method uses a sub-2 A mu m particle column for separating target compounds, which were subsequently quantified with the mass spectrometer. Using this high-throughput analysis method, a single injection could provide results within 5 min for the pharmaceuticals. All of the target compounds were analyzed by the multiple-reaction monitoring with 15-ms fast polarity switching. Both intraday and interday precision analyses indicate excellent coefficient of variability. To evaluate the performance of the method, a standard solution (100 and 1000 ng L-1) was spiked into complex wastewater samples. The tailing factor and peak width were also monitored and adjusted for optimizing peaks from the ultra high-performance liquid chromatograph. Of the target pharmaceuticals in wastewater of a sewage-treatment plant analyzed on an hourly basis, only 17 compounds were detected, and others were lower than the method detection limits. Acetaminophen, cimetidine, and iopromide were all detected at > 1 mu g L-1, and their concentration profiles were similar to that of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug detected in wastewater. Other noticeable pharmaceuticals were sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Sources of pharmaceuticals in wastewater are briefly discussed.

AB Hospital effluents are an important source of residual drugs and other classes of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The raw wastewater from the studied hospital exhibited acute toxicity to vertebrate organisms, and Cyprinus carpi was the most sensitive organism tested. A mixture of 19 commonly used pharmaceuticals caused acute toxicity to C. carpio with an LC50 value of 60.68 mg L-1 after 96 h. This study demonstrated that irradiation for 1-5 days significantly increased the acute toxicity of the pharmaceuticals to fish, leading to increased mortality after a 2-h exposure and approximately 40% of the surviving fish died within 28 days. The pre-irradiated pharmaceutical mixture also induced strange behaviors in the fish that survived the test. The synergistic increase in toxicity caused by the photolysis and mixing of pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored and warrants further examination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen is one of the mostly used drugs worldwide and is most abundant in wastewater. This study aims to adsorb naproxen from wastewater using magnetically modified carbon-based adsorbents. These adsorbents have very large specific area for naproxen adsorption, and magnetite modification provides easy separation and regeneration. The co-precipitation method was used for magnetic modification. Adsorption process was carried out in batches. The effect of adsorption variables was investigated. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms were applied to the equilibrium data. The maximum adsorption capacities of adsorbents from Langmuir isotherm were found as 20.75 mg/g for magnetic multi-wall carbon nanotubes and 87.79 mg/g for magnetic activated carbon. Pseudo-first-order kinetic model, pseudo-second-order kinetic model, intra-particle diffusion model, and Bangham model were used for determination of adsorption mechanisms. The rate-limiting step is electron exchange between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Both film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion occur while the adsorption process. Delta GA degrees, Delta SA degrees, and Delta HA degrees were calculated for the process.

AB Sewage-based epidemiology was applied to examine geographic variations in methamphetamine (METH) and ketamine (MET) use in China. Influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from 36 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 18 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Mean METH loads of the cities ranged from 12.5 +/- 14.9 to 181.2 +/- 6.5 mg/1000 inh/d, whereas mean KET loads ranged from <0.2 to 89.6 +/- 27.4 mg/ 1000 inh/d. No clear geographical pattern was observed in METH use, although slightly lower use in north and east China relative to other regions can be suggested. In contrast, an overall increasing trend from the north to the south was evident for MET loads. Apparent METH removal was greater than 80% at most STPs, whereas KET removal was less than 50% at most STPs and was even negative (i.e., measured effluent concentrations were greater than influent concentrations) at a significant number of STPs. Results in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen indicate that METH use in China may have increased substantially since 2012, whereas MET use did not significantly change, if not decreased. Comparison between seizures and estimated consumptions reveals that seizures in most Chinese provinces are far less than consumptions. In several provinces (e.g., Guangdong and Yunan), however, seizures were found to exceed consumptions, indicating that a significant fraction of METH and MET seized in these provinces is destined for consumption in other places.

AB Excreted trace organic chemicals, e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides, typically undergo incomplete elimination in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and are released to surface water via treated effluents and to agricultural soils through sludge amendment and/or irrigation with freshwater or reclaimed wastewater. Recent research has shown the tendency for these substances to accumulate in food crops. In this study, we developed and applied a simulation tool to predict the fate of three ionizable trace chemicals (triclosan-TCS, furosemide-FUR, ciprofloxacin-CIP) from human consumption/excretion up to the accumulation in soil and plant, following field amendment with sewage sludge or irrigation with river water (assuming dilution of WWTP effluent). The simulation tool combines the SimpleTreat model modified for fate prediction of ionizable chemicals in a generic WWTP and a recently developed dynamic soil-plant uptake model. The simulation tool was tested using country-specific (e.g., consumption/emission rates, precipitation and temperature) input data. A Monte Carlo-based approach was adopted to account for the uncertainty associated to physico-chemical and biokinetic model parameters.
   Results obtained in this study suggest significant accumulation of TCS and CIP in sewage sludge (1.4-2.8 mg kg(DW)(-1)) as compared to FUR (0.02-0.11 mg kg(DW)(-1)). For the latter substance, more than half of the influent load (60.1%-72.5%) was estimated to be discharged via WWTP effluent. Specific emission rates (g ha(-1) a(-1)) of FUR to soil via either sludge application or irrigation were up to 300 times lower than for TCS and CIP. Nevertheless, high translocation potential to wheat was predicted for FUR, reaching concentrations up to 4.3 mu g kg(DW)(-1) in grain. Irrigation was found to enhance the relative translocation of FUR to plant (45.3%-48.9% of emission to soil), as compared to sludge application (21.9%-27.6%).
   A comparison with peer-reviewed literature showed that model predictions were close to experimental data for elimination in WWTP, concentrations in sewage and sludge and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in plant tissues, which showed however a large variability. The simulation tool presented here can thus be useful for priority setting and for the estimation of human exposure to trace chemicals via intake of food crops. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan, gemfibrozil and galaxolide, representing acidic and non-ionized hydrophobic organic compounds, are biologically active and can be accumulated during wastewater treatment in sewage sludge. The interactions of these substances with the soils amended by sewage sludge-originating biosolids may control their environmental fate. Therefore, the sorption of three organic compounds was studied in dune sand, loess soil, clay soil and mixtures of these media with three different sewage sludge-originating biosolids that were incubated under aerobic conditions for 6 months. For each compound, 15 sorption isotherms were produced at pH 7.8-8.0. The sorption of triclosan and gemfibrozil on sand-containing sorbents was examined also under acidic conditions. In some soil series, the compound's Freundlich constants (K-F) are linearly related to the soil organic carbon (OC) content. Notably, for a given OC content, the sand-containing sorbents tend to demonstrate enhanced interactions with triclosan and galaxolide. This may be related with more hydrophobic and/or less rigid soil organic matter (SUM) as compared with the clay-containing soils, implying indirect effects of minerals. Generally the OC-normalized K-F vary among different soil-biosolid combinations which is explained by the differences in the composition and properties of SOM, and is also contributed by the non-zero intercepts of the linear KF upon soil OC dependencies. The negative intercepts suggest that below a certain OC level no considerable organic compound-soil interactions would occur. Interactions of molecular and anionic forms of triclosan with a sand-containing sorbent may be comparable, but interactions involving gemfibrozil molecules could be stronger than interactions involving its anion.

AB Psychiatric pharmaceuticals are the most prescribed active substances throughout the world and their presence in the environment raised concerns. The occurrence and fate of 15 selected psychiatric pharmaceuticals, including eight benzodiazepines, four antidepressants, one antiepileptic and two metabolites of benzodiazepines were investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents, surface water, and final drinking water in Shanghai. Psychiatric pharmaceuticals were in WWTPs influents ranging from low ng L-1 to 68.2 ng L-1, dominated by carbamazepine, doxepin, diazepam and lorazepam. Target analytes were still detected in effluents from low ng L-1 range to 47.3 ng L-1, with carbamazepine, diazepam, and oxazepam as most prevalent. WWTPs were low.effective (<50%) in removing most of them, excluding amitriptyline (mean 60%), doxepin (mean 70%), temazepam (mean 78%) and lorazepam (mean 93%). In addition, carbamazepine, diazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam were detected in low ng L-1 to 75.5 ng L-1 in the surface water of Huang Pu Rive. The pattern of contaminants in surface water is similar to the effluent wastewater, which suggested the main source of organic trace pollutants might be WWTPs. Furthermore, carbamazepine (0.8-2.5 ng L-1), diazepam (0.5-3.2 ng L-1) and alprazolam (2.3 ng L-1) were also detected in drinking water and the concentrations were below the health based precautionary value. The investigation was within the range of those results reported in other countries. Our results indicate ubiquity of the investigated compounds in the aquatic system. These pollutants may potentially reach drinking water via WWTP effluents and/or surface waters and require constant attention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A year-round monitoring survey of sewage flowing into sewage treatment plants located in urban Japan was conducted by targeting seven representative pharmaceutical components-atenolol (ATL), ciprofloxacin (CFX), clarithromycin (CTM), diclofenac (DCF), diltiazem (DTZ), disopyramide (DSP), and sulpiride (SPR)-detected in the river environment. For each of these components, two types of predicted concentration were estimated on the basis of two types of data (the shipping volume and sales volume of each component). The measured concentration of each component obtained through the survey and the two types of estimated predicted concentration of each component were then compared. The correspondence ratio between the predicted concentration estimated from the shipping volume of the component and the measured concentration (predicted concentration/measured concentration) was, for ATL, 3.1; CFX, 1.4; CTM, 1.4; DCF, 0.2; DTZ, 0.9; DSP, 11.6; and SPR, 1.1. The correspondence ratio between the predicted concentration estimated from the sales volume of the component and the measured concentration was, for ATL, 0.5; CFX, 1.1; CTM, 0.8; DCF, 0.1; DTZ, 0.2; DSP, 0.7; and SPR, 0.8. Although a generally corresponding trend was seen regardless of whether the prediction was based on shipping volume or sales volume, the predicted concentrations estimated from the shipping volumes of all components expect DSP were found, to our knowledge for the first time in Japan, to correspond better than those based on sales volumes to the measured concentrations. These findings should help to improve the prediction accuracy of concentrations of pharmaceutical components in river waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membranes that exhibit size-based rejection between small molecules ( < 1500 g/mol) independent of solute charge would be valuable for many separations, but commercial membranes show poor and unpredictable selectivity at this size range. This arises from high pore size polydispersity and charged membrane surfaces that lead to separations affected by solute charge. Furthermore, these membranes are susceptible to fouling. Self-assembly is a promising technique for making polymeric membranes with fouling resistance, high permeability and selectivity along with opportunity for easy fabrication and scalability. We report the first examples of a new class of membrane materials that derive their permeability, size-based selectivity and fouling resistance from the self-assembly of zwitterion-containing amphiphilic random copolymers. Zwitterionic groups strongly resist biomacromolecular fouling due to their high affinity with water, and self-assemble into channel-type clusters of 0.6-2 nm in size. We show that these copolymers self-assemble into bicontinuous nanocdomains. Thin film composite membranes formed by coating these copolymers onto porous supports exhibit permeances as high as 84 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), over three times that of a commercial membrane with similar MWCO. They show size-based selectivity, with a cut-off around 1 nm. This closely matches the size of zwitterionic domains measured by transmission electron microscopy, indicating permeation occurs through these self-assembled "nanochannels." These membranes show excellent fouling resistance during filtration of protein solutions and oil emulsions, completely resisting irreversible fouling and retaining over 96% of their permeance during filtration. These membranes have potential uses in biomolecule separations, purification of pharmaceuticals, and wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) are important drugs used in human and veterinary medicine. Their detection in natural waters and waste water treatment plants, along with increased resistance to FQs among some bacteria, have generated an increased interest in the fate of these drugs in the environment. Partitioning of FQs between an aqueous solution and attendant substrates depends, in part, on the surface reactivity of the adsorbent, commonly a function of particle size, surface charge, and functional groups. This study investigated the surface interactions between the FQ drug ofloxacin (OFL) and titanium oxide (TiO2), a common catalyst and widely-observed constituent in many consumer products. Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, as well as LC/MS, were used to determine the OFL moieties present on TiO2 surfaces and in attendant solutions. Raman spectra indicate that the C=O (ketone) group of the quinolone core, the NH+ of the piperazinyl ring, and CH3 of benzoxazine core are the most active in sorption onto the TiO2 surface. Raman spectra also show that the sorbed benzoxazine-quinolone core and piperazinyl moieties are readily desorbed from the surface by re-suspending samples in water. Importantly, we found that OFL could be degraded by reacting with TiO2 even in the dark. Complementary LC/MS analysis of the attendant supernatants indicates the presence of de-piperazinylated and de-carboxylated OFL breakdown products in supernatant solutions. Together, both Raman and LC/MS analyses indicate that TiO2 breaks the compound into piperazinyl and carboxylate groups which attach to the surface, whereas decarboxylated and hydroxylated quinolone moieties remain in solution. The present study thus identifies the sorption mechanisms and breakdown products of OFL during dark reactions with TiO2, which is critically important for understanding the fate and transport of OFL as it enters the soil and aquatic environment.

AB The issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment has caused increasing concern in the recent years and various strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem. This work describes a Bayesian network (BN)-based socioecological impact assessment of a set of measures aimed at reducing the entry of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. The measures investigated were selected across three sectors: public health market, environmental politics and drug design innovation. The BN model was developed for two drugs, Metformin and Metoprolol, and it models the distribution of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) values as a function of different measures. Results show that the sensitivity of the PEC for the two drugs to the measures investigated reflects the distinct drug characteristics, suggesting that in order to ensure the successful reduction of a broad range of substances, a spectrum of measures targeting the entire lifecycle of a pharmaceutical should be implemented. Furthermore, evaluation of two scenarios reflecting different emission management strategies highlights that the integrated implementation of a comprehensive set of measures across the three sectors results in a more extensive reduction of the contamination. Finally, the BN provides an initial forecasting tool to model the PEC of a drug as a function of a combination of measures in a context-specific manner and possible adaptations of the model are proposed.

AB The remediation of paracetamol (PA), an emerging contaminant frequently found in wastewater treatment plants, has been studied in the low concentration range (0.3-10 mg L-1) using as adsorbent a biomass-derived activated carbon. PA uptake of up to 100 mg g(-1) over the activated carbon has been obtained, with the adsorption isotherms being fairly explained by the Langmuir model. The application of Reichemberg and the Vermeulen equations to the batch kinetics experiments allowed estimating homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion coefficients, reflecting the dependence of diffusion with the surface coverage of PA. A series of rapid small-scale column tests were carried out to determine the breakthrough curves under different operational conditions (temperature, PA concentration, flow rate, bed length). The suitability of the proposed adsorbent for the remediation of PA in fixed-bed adsorption was proven by the high PA adsorption capacity along with the fast adsorption and the reduced height of the mass transfer zone of the columns. We have demonstrated that, thanks to the use of the heterogeneous diffusion coefficient, the proposed mathematical approach for the numerical solution to the mass balance of the column provides a reliable description of the breakthrough profiles and the design parameters, being much more accurate than models based in the classical linear driving force.

AB The effluent organic matter (EfOM) including micropollutants present in the concentrate streams generated from reverse osmosis (RO) based municipal wastewater reclamation processes entails environmental and health risks on its disposal to the receiving environment. The suitability of a biological activated carbon (BAC) process to treat municipal wastewater RO concentrate was evaluated at lab scale during 320 days of operation. BAC alone and combined UV/H2O2 BAC and ozone BAC were performed. The combination of both advanced oxidation processes with the BAC filter improved considerably the water quality parameters. Overall eliminations for dissolved organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm ranged between 50-66%, 48-66% and 73-87%, respectively, improving considerably the removals obtained without pretreatment step (28%, 19% and 37%, respectively). Moreover, although some pharmaceuticals were partially removed by the BAC filter, the integration of the UV/H2O2 or the ozone step was necessary to achieve the total removal of those micropollutants. Finally, biomass assessment techniques allowed determining the diversity of different BAC filter scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we investigated the use of thermally activated persulfate (TAP) as one of the most powerful advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of pharmaceuticals present in effluents. Pilot experiments were carried out on naproxen (NAP) solutions, and the effect of experimental conditions (e.g. inorganic additives, matrix) was assessed so as to better evaluate TAP systems and improve the reaction stoichiometric efficiency. A comparative kinetics study was provided for the removal of NAP vs work previously published using however other classes of pharmaceuticals e.g. bisoprolol, ibuprofen. The activation energy (EA) calculated was found to be 155.03 ( +/-26.4) kJ mol(-1). The best degradation rate was observed at 70 degrees C and found to be equal to 1.286 x 10(-4) mM min(-1). Furthermore, experiments were performed on untreated hospital effluents collected from the largest hospital in Beirut and spiked with NAP solution (50 mu M). Results showed full mineralization of the pharmaceutical effluent that was achieved and monitored via total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry were the techniques used for the identification of NAP and its transformation products. A NAP degradation mechanism was proposed and found to be mainly based on the action of sulfate radicals operating by electron abstraction. This study demonstrated once more that TAP systems are a valid and efficient method that can be used for the removal of dissolved pharmaceuticals in water and sewage water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present work illustrates the development of an analytical method, based on offline solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-electron spray ionisation-single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceuticals belonging to various therapeutic classes (analgesics/anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, antibiotics, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, psychomotor stimulants, glucocorticoid steroids, disinfectants, beta-blockers, H2 receptor antagonists and oestrogens) in surface waters. The method developed was applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters from different sampling points along the aquatic systems of Lake Pamvotis and the River Kalamas, close to the city of Ioannina (Epirus, Greece), while the monitoring programme was carried out during the four seasons of the year. According to the results obtained, the majority of the compounds were detected in discrepant concentrations. The concentrations for all the compounds ranged from levels below quantification limit to 3506ng/L, with caffeine and salicylic acid being the ubiquitous compounds. The results of the monitoring contributed substantially to the knowledge on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in Greece and more specifically in surface waters of the region of Epirus. Regarding the environmental risk due to the presence of target compounds in surface waters, this was estimated calculating risk quotients (RQs) for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish). The results denoted a possible threat for the aquatic environment, rendering in this way the RQ method as a helpful tool for a first approach. Extensive study is needed for triclosan, salicylic acid, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin in order to better correlate their occurrence and potential toxic effects in aquatic life and humans.

AB An integrated workflow based on liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QTOF-MS) was developed and applied to detect and identify suspect and unknown contaminants in Greek wastewater. Tentative identifications were initially based on mass accuracy, isotopic pattern, plausibility of the chromatographic retention time and MS/MS spectral interpretation (comparison with spectral libraries, in silico fragmentation). Moreover, new specific strategies for the identification of metabolites were applied to obtain extra confidence including the comparison of diurnal and/or weekly concentration trends of the metabolite and parent compounds and the complementary use of HMO. Thirteen of 284 predicted and literature metabolites of selected pharmaceuticals and nicotine were tentatively identified in influent samples from Athens and seven were finally confirmed with reference standards. Thirty four nontarget compounds were tentatively identified, four were also confirmed. The sulfonated surfactant diglycol ether sulfate was identified along with others in the homologous series (SO4C2H4(OC2H4)(x)OH), which have not been previously reported in wastewater. As many surfactants were originally found as nontargets, these compounds were studied in detail through retrospective analysis.

AB The widely used anticonvulsant pharmaceutical carbamazepine is recalcitrant in many environmental niches and thus poses a challenge in wastewater treatment. We followed the decomposition of carbamazepine by the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus in liquid culture compared to solid-state fermentation on lignocellulosic substrate where different enzymatic systems are active. Carbamazepine metabolites were identified using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). In liquid culture, carbamazepine was only transformed to 10,11-epoxy carbamazepine and 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine as a dead-end product. During solid-state fermentation, carbamazepine metabolism resulted in the generation of an additional 22 transformation products, some of which are toxic. Under solid-state-fermentation conditions, 10,11-epoxy carbamazepine was further metabolized via acridine and 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine pathways. The latter was further metabolized via five subpathways. When C-14-carbonyl-labeled carbamazepine was used as the substrate, C-14-CO2 release amounted to 17.4% of the initial radioactivity after 63 days of incubation. The proposed pathways were validated using metabolites (10,11-epoxy carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydroxy carbamazepine, and acridine) as primary substrates and following their fate at different time points. This work highlights the effect of growth conditions on the transformation pathways of xenobiotics. A better understanding of the fate of pollutants during bioremediation treatments is important for establishment of such technologies.

AB To minimize the risk of antibiotic wastewater generated by the pharmaceutical industries, the potential separation efficacy of tetracycline (TC) from aqueous solution using forward osmosis (FO) process with thin film composite membrane was systematically studied. First, the microstructure and transport properties of TFC membrane were characterized. Then, the effects of membrane orientation, feed velocity and solution pH on the behavior of the FO process for TC separation were studied. Finally, the performance of TFC membrane for TC separation in a long-term FO mode operation was investigated. The results showed that the membrane performance in FO mode (active layer facing the feed solution) and PRO mode (active layer facing the draw solution) was highly affected by solute resistivity (K) value. The water flux and TC rejection achieved over 20 LMH and 99.0% in FO mode, respectively. High TC concentration factor (CF) of 2.6 was obtained in FO mode, indicating the concentrated TC solution could be harnessed to recover the TC by conventional crystallization. However, severe water flux decline accompanied with low tetracycline CF was found in PRO mode, which was mainly attributed to serious fouling and high K value occurred in the porous support. With the flow velocity rising, the shear stress and mass transfer coefficient (k) on the membrane surface increased, alleviating the membrane fouling. Acidic environment would favor the separation due to the change of TC speciation and TFC membrane properties. A long-term testing demonstrated that more than 97% TC rejection and 74% water flux recovery were well maintained with simple hydraulic cleaning after 5 cycles FO mode operation. This work implied that the FO based technology could be developed as an effective alternative for the treatment of tetracycline antibiotic wastewater as well as the recovery of antibiotics from the wastewater.

AB Adsorption mechanism of diclofenac and isoproturon onto activated carbon has been proposed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Adsorption capacity and optimum adsorption isotherms were predicted by nonlinear regression method. Different kinetic equations, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion model and Bangham kinetic model, were applied to study the adsorption kinetics of emerging contaminants on activated carbon in two aqueous matrices.

AB The pharmaceutical industry generates wastewater discharges of varying characteristics and contaminant concentrations depending on the nature of the production process. The main chemicals present in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants-such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)-and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the geno- and cytotoxicity induced in the common carp Cyprinus carpio by the effluent emanating from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. Carp were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL, 0.1173%) for 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and biomarkers of genotoxicity (comet assay and micronucleus test) and cytotoxicity (caspase-3 activity and TUNEL assay) were evaluated. A significant increase with respect to the control group (p < 0.05) occurred with all biomarkers from 24 h on. Significant positive correlations were found between NSAID concentrations and biomarkers of geno- and cytotoxicity, as well as among geno- and cytotoxicity biomarkers. In conclusion, exposure to this industrial effluent induces geno- and cytotoxicity in blood of C. carpio. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Attenuation of pharmaceuticals due to natural sunlight is expected to be an important removal pathway in wastewater treatment plants using treatment lagoon systems. In this work, the photolysis of two antidepressants, amisulpride and desipramine, has been investigated in both ultrapure water and wastewater under simulated solar irradiation. Results showed that for amisulpride short irradiation times (t(1/2) approximately 3 h in pure water and 4 h in wastewater) were adequate to degrade the parent compound while a longer exposure period was required for desipramine (t(1/2) of approximately 36 h in pure water), although its degradation is enhanced almost three times by indirect photolysis in wastewaters. A significant number of transformation products (TPs) were identified for both pharmaceuticals by high-resolution mass spectrometry. In general, TPs formed are not persistent although acute toxicity tests for desipramine and its TPs showed an increase of the mixture toxicity after solar irradiation, suggesting that some TPs may be more toxic than the parent compound. In wastewaters collected from treatment lagoons, only amisulpride and one of its major TPs, TP 357, were detected. This indicates that long solar exposure times may be necessary for an effective elimination of these substances in lagoon systems or that photolysis may not be the main removal pathway for these particular compounds.

AB Hospital wastewater represents a significant input of pharmaceuticals into municipal wastewater. As Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBRs) appear to remove organic micro-pollutants, hospital wastewater was treated with a pilot plant consisting of three MBBRs in series. The removal of pharmaceuticals was studied in two experiments: 1) A batch experiment where pharmaceuticals were spiked to each reactor and 2) a continuous flow experiment at native concentrations. DOC removal, nitrification as well as removal of pharmaceuticals (including X-ray contrast media, beta-blockers, analgesics and antibiotics) occurred mainly in the first reactor. In the batch experiment most of the compounds followed a single first-order kinetics degradation function, giving degradation rate constants ranged from 5.77 x 10(-3) to 4.07 h(-1), from -5.53 x 10(-3) to 9.24 x 10(-1) h(-1) and from 1.83 x 10(-3) to 2.42 x 10(-1) h(-1) for first, second and third reactor respectively. Generally, the highest removal rate constants were found in the first reactor while the lowest were found in the third one. This order was inverted for most compounds, when the removal rate constants were normalized to biomass, indicating that the last tank had the most effective biofilms. In the batch experiment, 21 out of 26 compounds were assessed to be degraded with more than 20% within the MBBR train. In the continuous flow experiment the measured removal rates were lower than those estimated from the batch experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological treatment processes offer the ideal conditions in which a high diversity of microorganisms can grow and develop. The wastewater produced during these processes is contaminated with antibiotics and, as such, they provide the ideal setting for the acquisition and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This research investigated the occurrence and variation in the ARGs found during the one-year operation of the anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater that contained combinations of sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline-erythromycin (STE) and sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST). The existence of eighteen ARGs encoding resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul2, sul3), erythromycin (ermA, ermF, ermB, msrA, ereA), tetracycline (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetM, tetS, tetQ tetW, tetX) and class I integron gene (intI 1) in the STE and ST reactors was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Due to the limited availability of primers to detect ARGs, Illumina sequencing was also performed on the sludge and effluent of the STE and ST reactors. Although there was good reactor performance in the SBRs, which corresponds to min 80% COD removal efficiency, tetA, tetB, sul1, sul2 and ermB genes were among those ARGs detected in the effluent from STE and ST reactors. A comparison of the ARGs acquired from the STE and ST reactors revealed that the effluent from the STE reactor had a higher number of ARGs than that from the ST reactor; this could be due to the synergistic effects of erythromycin. According to the expression of genes results, microorganisms achieve tetracycline and erythromycin resistance through a combination of three mechanisms: efflux pumping protein, modification of the antibiotic target and modifying enzymes. There was also a significant association between the presence of the class 1 integron and sulfamethoxazole resistance genes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater was collected from various stages and sewage sludge was collected from sludge bed of Vasant Kunj sewage treatment plant (VK STP) in the post-monsoon season. The treatment plant is based on extended aeration activated sludge (EMS) process. Preliminary analysis of the wastewater and sewage sludge samples revealed 11.5 fold reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) of wastewater after treatment while GC-MS analysis showed the presence of bisphenol P (RT =41.63), certain pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial compounds in effluent and sewage sludge, thus indicating the need for further treatments before their discharge into the environment. One indigenous bacterial strain isolated from sewage sludge of VK STP and identified as Serratia sp. ISTVKR1 was used for biodegradation of wastewater contaminants. Preliminary analysis of bacterial treatment culture showed almost 12 fold COD removal after 240h of treatment while the GC-MS analysis revealed removal of complex organic compounds like phosphoric acid triphenyl ester (RT = 30.017) and 4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- (RT= 45.36) and formation of simpler compounds like alcohols and aliphatic hydrocarbons such as 1-heptacosanol (RT = 32.66), docosane (RT =34.18) and hexadecane (RT= 29.621). Results of the study indicate the efficient removal of wastewater organic contaminants by the isolated Serratia sp. ISTVKR1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the rejection of trace pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater by forward osmosis (FO), disposal of the FO concentrate was still an unsolved issue. In this study, by integrating the advantages of forward osmosis and electrochemical oxidation, a forward osmosis process with the function of electrochemical oxidation (FOwEO) was established for the first time to achieve the aim of rejection of trace antibiotics from wastewater and treatment of the concentrate at the same time. Results demonstrated that FOwEO (current density J = 1 mA cm(-2)) exhibited excellent rejections of antibiotics (>98%) regardless of different operation conditions, and above all, antibiotics in the concentrate were well degraded (>99%) at the end of experiment (after 3 h). A synergetic effect between forward osmosis and electrochemical oxidation was observed in FOwEO, which lies in that antibiotic rejections by FO were enhanced due to the degradation of antibiotics in the concentrate, while the electrochemical oxidation capacity was improved in the FOwEO channel, of which good mass transfer and the assist of indirect oxidation owing to the reverse NaCl from draw solution were supposed to be the mechanism. This study demonstrated that the FOwEO has the capability to thoroughly remove trace antibiotics from wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and estrogens, are detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges. However, analytical monitoring of wastewater and surface water does not indicate whether CECs are affecting the organisms downstream. In this study, fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and freshwater mussels Pyganodon grandis Say, 1829 (synonym: Anodonta grandis Say, 1829) were caged for 4 weeks in the North Saskatchewan River, upstream and downstream of the discharge from the WWTP that serves the Edmonton, AB, Canada. Passive samplers deployed indicated that concentrations of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, an estrogen (estrone) and an androgen (androstenedione) were elevated at sites downstream of the WWTP discharge. Several biomarkers of exposure were significantly altered in the tissues of caged fathead minnows and freshwater mussels relative to the upstream reference sites. Biomarkers altered in fish included induction of CYP3A metabolism, an increase in vitellogenin (Vtg) gene expression in male minnows, elevated ratios of oxidized to total glutathione (i.e. GSSG/TGSH), and an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase). In mussels, there were no significant changes in biomarkers of oxidative stress and the levels of Vtg-like proteins were reduced, not elevated, indicating a generalized stress response. Immune function was altered in mussels, as indicated by elevated lysosomal activity per hemocyte in P. grandis caged closest to the wastewater discharge. This immune response may be due to exposure to bacterial pathogens in the wastewater. Multivariate analysis indicated a response to the CECs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Trimethoprim (TPM). Overall, these data indicate that there is a 1 km zone of impact for aquatic organisms downstream of WWTP discharge. However, multiple stressors in municipal wastewater make measurement and interpretation of impact of CECs difficult since water temperature, conductivity and bacteria are also inducing biomarker responses in both fish and mussels.

AB Hospital wastewater contributes a significant input of pharmaceuticals into municipal wastewater. The combination of suspended activated sludge and biofilm processes, as stand-alone or as hybrid process (hybrid biofilm and activated sludge system(Hybas T)) has been suggested as a possible solution for hospital wastewater treatment. To investigate the potential of such a hybrid system for the removal of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater a pilot plant consisting of a series of one activated sludge reactor, two Hybas T reactors and one moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) has been established and adapted during 10 months of continuous operation. After this adaption phase batch and continuous experiments were performed for the determination of degradation of pharmaceuticals. Removal of organic matter and nitrification mainly occurred in the first reactor. Most pharmaceuticals were removed significantly. The removal of pharmaceuticals (including X-ray contrast media, beta-blockers, analgesics and antibiotics) was fitted to a single first-order kinetics degradation function, giving degradation rate constants from 0 to 1.49 h(-1), from 0 to 7.78 x 10(-1) h(-1), from 0 to 7.86 x 10(-1) h(-1) and from 0 to 1.07 x 10(-1) h(-1) for first, second, third and fourth reactors respectively. Generally, the highest removal rate constants were found in the first and third reactors while the lowest were found in the second one. When the removal rate constants were normalized to biomass amount, the last reactor (biofilm only) appeared to have the most effective biomass in respect to removing pharmaceuticals. In the batch experiment, out of 26 compounds, 16 were assessed to degrade more than 20% of the respective pharmaceutical within the Hybas T train. In the continuous flow experiments, the measured removals were similar to those estimated from the batch experiments, but the concentrations of a few pharmaceuticals appeared to increase during the first treatment step. Such increase could be attributed to de-conjugation or formation from other metabolites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During olive oil production a great amount of olive mill wastewater (OMW) is produced that is potentially a rich source of bio-phenols with wide array of biological activity. The purpose of the present work is to recover and concentrate the valuable polyphenols from the OMW using integrated membrane systems. Further study was conducted by employing enzymatic hydrolysis using -glucosidase followed by acid hydrolysis in order to release higher concentration of pure hydroxytyrosol (HT). Meanwhile, efficient treatment of OMW could be achieved for water reuse as well as protecting the environment. The OMW was directly subjected to a microfiltration (MF) where 77.6 and 34.8% reduction of total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively, were achieved. The Permeate of MF was further subjected to ultra-filtration (UF), where the removal was 44.9% and 100% for the COD and TSS, respectively. Another portion of the MF permeate was also subjected to nano-filtration (NF), where COD was reduced from 33 to 6.9g/l and 100% TSS removal was achieved. The polyphenols in raw OMW was 2.5g/l, it was recovered and concentrated in the Retentate of MF, UF and NF to 2.3, 2.0 and 2.4g/l, respectively. Almost all polyphenols were recovered and concentrated in the NF Retentate solution. By employing the enzymatic hydrolysis using -glucosidase on NF Retentate followed by acid hydrolysis an amount of 1.3g/l of pure HT could be released. Based on these results OMW can be used as alternative source of valuable phenolic compound that are useful for industrial and pharmaceutical applications.

AB A fish plasma model (FPM) has been proposed as a screening technique to prioritize potential hazardous pharmaceuticals to wild fish. However, this approach does not account for inter- or intraspecies variability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. The present study elucidated the uptake potency (from ambient water), tissue distribution, and biological risk of 20 pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) residues in wild cyprinoid fish inhabiting treated-wastewater-impacted streams. In order to clarify the uncertainty of the FPM for PPCPs, we compared the plasma bioaccumulation factor in the field (BAF(plasma) = measured fish plasma/ambient water concentration ratio) with the predicted plasma bioconcentration factor (BCFplasma = fish plasma predicted by use of theoretical partition coefficients/ambient water concentration ratio) in the actual environment. As a result, the measured maximum BAF(plasma) of inflammatory agents was up to 17 times higher than theoretical BCFplasma values, leading to possible underestimation of toxicological risk on wild fish. When the tissue blood partition coefficients (tissue/blood concentration ratios) of PPCPs were estimated, higher transportability into tissues, especially the brain, was found for psychotropic agents, but brain/plasma ratios widely varied among individual fish (up to 28-fold). In the present study, we provide a valuable data set on the intraspecies variability of PPCP pharmacokinetics, and our results emphasize the importance of determining PPCP concentrations in possible target organs as well as in the blood to assess the risk of PPCPs on wild fish.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disruptors demonstrate huge potential to cause adverse ecological health effects at very low concentration in aquatic environment. There is a need to improve current purification technologies used in sewage and drinking-water treatment plants. This article aims at providing new insights into the recent development of natural and modified clay-based sorbents for the removal of aqueous contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The removal of six widely used pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, as well as endocrine disrupting chemicals - bisphenol A and a bactericidal agent, triclosan was examined by sorption onto eight adsorbents. Sorption was performed using natural and modified clay minerals - montmorillonite (Mt), vermiculite (VER), bentonite (B), kaolinite (K), commercial acid activated montmorillonites K10 and K30, and two carbonaceous-mineral nanocomposites, MtG5%T, BAIG3%C. This study showed that among the tested natural clays, vermiculite is the most promising sorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals in purification processes. Among the modified clay minerals, the best results were achieved for carbonaceous bentonite and two acid activated montmorillonites K10 and K30. However, the removal of acidic pharmaceuticals on montomorillonite K10 and carbonaceous bentonite was strongly dependent on the pH value. In the case of vermiculite and acid-modified montmorillonite 1<30, the sorption of the selected compounds was not significantly affected by pH, which is crucial in wastewater treatment. The sorption constant divided by the specific surface area (K-d/A) is proposed to assess whether the surface area or chemical properties of the materials control the sorption process. K-d/A values were relatively high in the case of vermiculite, so it should be noticed that individual and specific surface properties of vermiculite were of crucial importance for sorption.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) are widely used around the world to maintain human and animal health. There is growing concern that these compounds pass through sewage-treatment plants and enter the environment for potential harmful effects on living things. In this study, the occurrence of nine PACs (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, methyltestosterone, metoprolol, propranolol, stanozolol, and testosterone) in hospital wastewater, sewage wastewater, raw water used for drinking water, and treated water was studied in three sampling events representing different flow conditions, i.e., December, April, and June 2010-2011. Most of the target compounds were detected in both hospital and sewage wastewater samples rather than in drinking water samples. The most frequently detected compounds in the samples were acetaminophen and caffeine with increased concentrations of up to 160 mu g/L in sewage wastewater, while their concentrations were significantly lower in raw water. Generally, a seasonal variation of the test compounds in the samples was significant. All drugs were detected in higher levels during winter as drug use for diseases might increase through this season and a faster degradation and removal might occur during summer. The results showed that water had been polluted with these substances, and although purified by water treatment, reached humans via drinking water.

AB A probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted for the transformation products (TPs) of 3 beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) and 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) to assess potential threats to aquatic organisms in effluent-dominated surface waters. To this end, the pharmacokinetic literature, the University of Minnesota's Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database Pathway Prediction System aerobic microbial degradation software, and photolysis literature pertaining to beta-blockers and SSRIs were used to determine their most likely TPs formed via human metabolism, aerobic biodegradation, and photolysis, respectively. Monitoring data from North American and European surface waters receiving human wastewater inputs were the basis of the exposure characterizations of the parent compounds and the TPs, where available. In most cases, where monitoring data for TPs did not exist, we assumed a conservative 1: 1 parent-to-TP production ratio (i.e., 100% of parent converted). The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)'s EPISuite and ECOSAR v1.11 software were used to estimate acute and chronic toxicities to aquatic organisms. Hazard quotients, which were calculated using the 95th percentile of the exposure distributions, ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-3) (i.e., all significantly less than 1). Based on these results, the TPs of interest would be expected to pose little to no environmental risk in surface waters receiving wastewater inputs. Overall, we recommend developing analytical methods that can isolate and quantify human metabolites and TPs at environmentally relevant concentrations to confirm these predictions. Further, we recommend identifying the major species of TPs from classes of pharmaceuticals that could elicit toxic effects via specific modes of action (e.g., norfluoxetine via the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT](1A) receptors) and conducting aquatic toxicity tests to confirm these findings. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative probabilistic ecotoxicological assessment of all of the predicted and probable TPs of these pharmaceuticals, and our approach provides a framework for future such studies with other compound classes as data become available.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern present in domestic waste streams include a highly diverse group of potentially biologically active compounds that can be detected at trace levels in wastewater. Concerns about potential uptake into crops arise when reclaimed water is used in food crop production. The present study investigated how 9 contaminants of emerging concern in reclaimed water are taken up into edible portions of two food crops. Two flame retardant chemicals, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and several polar pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) accumulated in a linear, concentration-dependent manner in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) irrigated with reclaimed water, suggesting passive uptake of both neutral and ionizable chemical contaminants in lettuce. Furthermore, concentration-dependent accumulation of TCEP and TCPP from reclaimed water was also observed in strawberry fruits (Fragaria ananassa). Collectively, these data suggest that highly polar or charged contaminants can be taken up by crops from water bearing contaminants of emerging concern and can be accumulated in the edible portions. Using these data, however, estimates of human exposure to these contaminants from reclaimed water food crop accumulation suggest that exposure to the contaminants of emerging concern examined in the present study is likely substantially lower than current exposure guidelines.

AB The present study aims at uncovering valorisation opportunities in the Greek slaughtering industry related to wastewater and animal by-products exploitation. To this end, 12 Greek slaughterhouses were studied, while literature review of published work on wastewater and animal by-products treatment and valorisation was also conducted. Based on the recording of the existing situation in Greece, it was observed that all slaughterhouses operate biological wastewater treatment plants. The activated sludge process was mostly applied. Animal by-products derived from the operation of the slaughterhouses were mainly treated inside the units through incineration or rendering. In many of the slaughterhouses, animal by-products were treated as being category 1 and, thus, potential by-product valorisation remained unexploited. Moreover, ashes from the incineration of animal by-products and of rendering residues were mainly sent to landfills. Considering the above, in order to add value to the Greek slaughtering industry, anaerobic digestion could be applied instead of the activated sludge process or as a first step prior to aerobic treatment of wastewater resulting in both wastewater treatment and biogas generation. Anaerobic digestion is also an attractive valorisation opportunity for treating animal by-products (category 3 and category 2 after pressure sterilisation). Animal by-products category 3 can also be exploited for the extraction of substances and the subsequent manufacture of feedstuffs, cosmetics or medicinal products. Moreover, separately collected blood can be utilised for the recovery of bioactive peptides to be used in the pharmaceutical industry or as a protein source for pet food. Finally, future valorisation potentials for the Greek slaughtering sector can be found in the ash exploitation as a phosphorous source.

AB Fluoroquinolones, such as enoxacin, are poorly removed by common sewage-treatment processes, leading to their discharge into the environment, where they have unknown, and potentially serious, impacts on plants and aquatic organisms. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to understand the degradation of enoxacin by direct UV (ultraviolet) photolysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) involving UV/H2O2 and photo-Fenton [UV/H2O2/Fe(II)], which may provide an alternative method of removing this compound from water in a treatment plant. Aqueous samples of enoxacin (0.06mM) were irradiated at 254nm (Io=2x1016photons-1). The presence of H2O2, as well as the addition of FeSO47H2O (photo-Fenton process) both resulted in faster degradation kinetics compared to direct irradiation, with all of these systems leading to significant mineralization of enoxacin [>80% removal of total organic carbon (TOC)] within 30min. The kinetics for the degradation of enoxacin in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) isolates were also evaluated. Analysis of reaction byproducts by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) suggested that photolysis of enoxacin results in hydroxylation, defluorination, and formation of a geminal diol. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance was used for further verification. In addition, the rate constant for the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) reaction with enoxacin was determined by pulse radiolysis studies to be (5.91 +/- 0.08)x109Lmol-1s-1. These results suggest that center dot OH may play an important role in the photoinduced removal of enoxacin from water, and these systems may be used to remove this compound in treatment plants.(C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB This paper presents an advancing sustainable membrane-based separation process, which is forward osmosis (FO). The review begins with an introduction of the basic principles of the FO process. Then, a comparison to the most currently well-known desalination technology (RO) is presented. Following section summarizes potential applications of FO in the water desalination field, producing either potable water or irrigation water from brackish/saline feeds. Next, two major FO applications in the domain of water reuse are discussed: wastewater and industrial applications. Wastewater applications are such as OSMBR and landfill leachate treatment; and Industrial applications include oil and gas, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage industries. These different FO applications are briefly reviewed and assessed. Although FO has attracted growing attention in many potential applications, it still experiences several considerable limitations, including concentration polarization, membrane fouling, reverse solute diffusion, and need for membrane and draw solution development.

AB The effective treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) contained wastewater remains a significant but challenging task for the environmental restoration. In this work, a novel Pd@MIL-100(Fe) nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated via a facile alcohol reduction approach. The resulting Pd@MIL-100(Fe) has exhibited superior photoactivity toward degradation of three typical PPCPs, that is theophylline, ibuprofen and bisphenol A, under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). Its photoactivity is also much higher than that of original-MIL-100(Fe). Combining with photoelectrochemical analyses, it could be revealed that the introduction of Pd NPs would minimize the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the effects of different kinds of metals, the loading amount of noble-metal, the pH value of reaction solution and initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the photocatalytic degradation activities have been measured in detail. In addition, a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism has been investigated. This work has not only represented the first example of using the MOFs photocatalysts to remove the aqueous PPCPs, but also offered useful information on the fabrication of efficient MOF photo catalysts for environmental restoration.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds, EDCs, are somewhat recently recognized pollutants which are often classed within 'emerging micropollutants' in the environment jargon. These compounds are known to interfere with the delicate balance of the endocrine system of animals and man, causing variety of undesirable outcomes. Their sources in natural waters are the domestic and industrial effluents. The main cause of concern with EDCs is their tendency to accumulate in fish causing gender shifts and reduced fecundity. Moreover, their possible interference with the water cycle and concurrent effects on the human endocrine system has been implicated. Increased usage of medication and surfactants in the household; pesticides in agriculture have all add up to the inventory of EDCs in the aqueous systems.
   Current view in combating EDCs in water cycle is the multi barrier approach. In this concept EDCs are tried to be controlled in effluents as well as in potable drinking waters. Therefore, knowledge on their elimination in classical wastewater treatment plants is vital for establishing sustainable strategies for the future.
   Five different EDCs were selected as model compounds in this study; two natural hormones, estrone and progesterone, which are constantly discharged by humans; carbamazepine, diltiazem and acetaminophen are pharmaceuticals which are widely used by the community. The 24 h composite samples were analyzed in influents and effluents of 7 full scale biological treatment plants of various modifications of activated sludge process, including one MBR plant. One striking finding was the removals obtained in conventional plants, which were far exceeding those obtained in the mid-scale or lab-scale MBR plants. Carbamazepine and diltiazem, two hydrophobic compounds, were found to sorb onto CAS sludge whereas not onto the MBR sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a study about the elimination of anticancer drugs, a group of pollutants considered recalcitrant during conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment, using a biological treatment based on the fungus Trametes versicolor. A 10-L fluidized bed bioreactor inoculated with this fungus was set up in order to evaluate the removal of 10 selected anticancer drugs in real hospital wastewater. Almost all the tested anticancer drugs were completely removed from the wastewater at the end of the batch experiment (8 days) with the exception of Ifosfamide and Tamoxifen. These two recalcitrant compounds, together with Cyclophosphamide, were selected for further studies to test their degradability by T. versicolor under optimal growth conditions. Cydophosphamide and Ifosfamide were inalterable during batch experiments both at high and low concentration, whereas Tamoxifen exhibited a decrease in its concentration along the treatment Two positional isomers of a hydroxylated form of Tamoxifen were identified during this experiment using a high resolution mass spectrometry based on ultra-high performance chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap detector (LTQ-Velos Orbitrap). Finally the identified transformation products of Tamoxifen were monitored in the bioreactor run with real hospital wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles (BioMnOx) has been studied with respect to possible implementation of BioMnOx in wastewater treatment. For this it would be prerequisite that microbial Mn2+ oxidation and BioMnOx-driven pollutant removal can occur in situ, i.e. in the same reactor as the removal. Here we present the in situ reactivity of BioMnOx produced by Pseudomonas putida towards a range of micro-pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations (10 mu g L-1). We found that in situ formed BioMnOx completely removed the steroid hormones estrone and 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, while only 26% removal of diclofenac was achieved. Ibuprofen, tebuconazole, carbamazepine, carbendazim, and terbutryn were not removed under in situ conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The primary fish gill cell culture system (FIGCS) is an in vitro technique which has the potential to replace animals in whole effluent toxicity tests. In the current study FIGCS were transported into the field and exposed to filtered (0.2 mu m) river water for 24 h from 4 sites, on 2 different sampling dates. Sites 1 and 2 are situated in an urban catchment (River Wandle, London, UK) with site 1 downstream of a sewage treatment work; site 3 is located in a suburban park (River Cray, Kent, UK), and site 4 is more rural (River Darent, Kent, UK). The change in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), the expression of the metal responsive genes metallothionein A (mta) and B (mtb), cytochrome P450 1A1 (cyp1a1) and 3A27 (cyp3a27), involved in phase 1 metabolism, were assessed following exposure to sample water for 24 h. TER was comparable between F1GCS exposed to 0.2 gm filtered river water and those exposed to synthetic moderately soft water for 24 h. During the first sampling time, there was an increase in mta, cyp1a1 and cyp3a27 gene expression in epithelium exposed to water from sites 1 and 2, and during the second sampling period an increase in cyp3a27 gene expression at sites 1 and 4. Urban river water is a complex mixture of contaminants (e.g., metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons) and the increase in the expression of genes encoding mta, cyp1a1 and cyp3a27 in FIGCS is indicative of the presence of biologically active pollutants.

AB The appearance of pharmaceutical compounds and their bioactive transformation products in aquatic environments is becoming an issue of increasing concern. In this study, the electrochemical oxidation of the widely used antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was investigated using a commercial mixed oxide anode (Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2) and a single compartment filter press-type flow reactor. The kinetics of SMX degradation was determined as a function of electrolyte composition, applied current density, and initial pH. Almost complete (98 %) degradation of SMX could be achieved within 30 min of electrolysis in 0.1 mol L-1 NaCl solution at pH 3 with applied current densities >= 20 mA cm(-2). Nine major intermediates of the reaction were identified by LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS (e.g., C6H9NO2S (m/z = 179), C6H4NOCl (m/z = 141), and C6H6O2 (m/z = 110)). The degradation followed various routes involving cleavage of the oxazole and benzene rings by hydroxyl and/or chlorine radicals, processes that could occur before or after rupture of the N-S bond, followed by oxidation of the remaining moieties. Analysis of the total organic carbon content revealed that the antibiotic was partially mineralized under the conditions employed and some inorganic ions, including NO3- and SO42-, could be identified. The results presented herein demonstrate the efficacy of the electrochemical process using a Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 anode for the remediation of wastewater containing the antibiotic SMX.

AB Meloxicam is a commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and fever-reducing effects. In this study, photocatalytic degradation of meloxicam in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NP) was optimized and applied for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. A validated stability-indicating orthogonal testing protocol (reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC and capillary zone electrophoresis) was developed and validated for monitoring of meloxicam concentration in the presence of its photodegradation products. Fractional factorial design was employed in order to investigate the effects of pH, irradiation time, UV light intensity, TiO2NP loading, and initial meloxicam concentration on the efficiency of the process. The light intensity was found as the most significant parameter followed by irradiation time and concentration, respectively. The most influencing interactions were noted between irradiation time-concentration and irradiation time-light intensity. The kinetics of meloxicam degradation was investigated at the optimum set of experimental conditions. The protocol was successfully applied for treatment of incurred water samples collected during various cleaning validation cycles. A percentage degradation of 77.34 +/-0.02 % was achieved upon irradiation of samples containing 64.57+/-0.09 mu g/mL with UV light (1012 mu W/cm(2), 8 h) in the presence of 0.4 mg/mL TiO2NP at pH 9.0+/-0.05. Treatment of wastewaters collected during the cleaning validation of each product separately rather than the combined waste should result in a significant improvement in the economics of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. This could be attributed to the relatively small waste volumes and the ability to tailor the experimental conditions to achieve maximum efficiency.

AB Arid agricultural regions often turn to using treated wastewater (reclaimed water) to irrigate food crops. Concerns arise, however, when considering the potential for persistent contaminants of emerging concern to accumulate into plants intended for human consumption. The present study examined the accumulation of a suite of 9 contaminants of emerging concern into 2 representative food crops, lettuce and strawberry, following uptake via the roots and subsequent distribution to other plant tissues. Calculating accumulation metrics (concentration factors) allowed for comparison of the compartmental affinity of each chemical for each plant tissue compartment. The root concentration factor was found to exhibit a positive linear correlation with the pH-adjusted octanol-water partition coefficient (D-OW) for the target contaminants of emerging concern. Coupled with the concentration-dependent accumulation observed in the roots, this result implies that accumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern into plant roots is driven by passive partitioning. Of the contaminants of emerging concern examined, nonionizable contaminants, such as triclocarban, carbamazepine, and organophosphate flame retardants displayed the greatest potential for translocation from the roots to above-ground plant compartments. In particular, the organophosphate flame retardants displayed increasing affinity for shoots and fruits with decreasing size/octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW). Cationic diphenhydramine and anionic sulfamethoxazole, once transported to the shoots of the strawberry plant, demonstrated the greatest potential of the contaminants examined to be then carried to the edible fruit portion.

AB The application of a boron-doped diamond electrode in electrochemical water disinfection was investigated with respect to its inactivation potential of three indicator microorganisms. Drinking water and the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant spiked with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were electrolysed under different conditions in a batch reactor. All three bacteria species could be successfully inactivated in drinking water. The disinfection rate depended on the applied charge, with far more efficiency at high current densities (208 and 333 mA/cm(2)) under high ozone concentrations measured in contrast to low current densities (42 mA/cm(2)) where bacterial inactivation was rather driven by hydroxyl radicals. When oxidising a target pharmaceutical compound in the wastewater treatment plant effluent, the water matrix exhibited an ozone scavenging effect. The resulting decrease in the efficiency could not be detected for the disinfection experiments in the complex water matrix compared to drinking water, which indicates a different disinfection mechanism, probably due to reactive chlorine species.

AB Plant uptake of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasingly leading to concerns about their potential exposure to humans and wildlife via dietary intake. Due to the extraordinary ability of biochars to bind organic compounds, plant uptake experiments were conducted to assess the effect of soil-amendment of three different biochars on the uptake of APIs from spiked soil.
   Pot experiments were undertaken to assess the extent of sorption and corresponding bioaccessibility of two APIs (carbamazepine - CBZ and propranolol -PRL) to ryegrass (Lolium perenne) grown in an API-spiked loamy sand, with and without biochar amendment (5 t/ha equivalent). The soil was amended with three different biochars produced from eucalyptus wood and wheat residues.
   Both APIs were taken up by ryegrass, with CBZ preferentially accumulated (14.3 mg/kg CBZ, 3.8 mg/kg PRL in unamended soil) due to its comparatively high concentration in porewater. Soil amendment with biochars increased partitioning of the two APIs by up to three- fold, with corresponding decreases in porewater (34-72 % of unamended soil) and plant tissue (17-64 %) concentrations.
   Biochars were effective in reducing the uptake of APIs into plant tissues from a contaminated soil and may be effective in the management of API residues in contaminated soils.

AB Recently, the increased use of monocyclic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has resulted in their presence in the environment. This may have potential negative effects on living organisms. The biotransformation mechanisms of monocyclic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the human body and in other mammals occur by hydroxylation and conjugation with glycine or glucuronic acid. Biotransformation/biodegradation of monocyclic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the environment may be caused by fungal or bacterial microorganisms. Salicylic acid derivatives are degraded by catechol or gentisate as intermediates which are cleaved by dioxygenases. The key intermediate of the paracetamol degradation pathways is hydroquinone. Sometimes, after hydrolysis of this drug, 4-aminophenol is formed, which is a dead-end metabolite. Ibuprofen is metabolized by hydroxylation or activation with CoA, resulting in the formation of isobutylocatechol. The aim of this work is to attempt to summarize the knowledge about environmental risk connected with the presence of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, their sources and the biotransformation and/or biodegradation pathways of these drugs.

AB A large number of anthropogenic trace contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, their human metabolites and further transformation products (TPs) enter wastewater treatment plants on a daily basis. A mixture of known, expected, and unknown molecules are discharged into the receiving aquatic environment because only partial elimination occurs for many of these chemicals during physical, biological and chemical treatment processes. In this study, an array of LC MS methods from three collaborating laboratories was applied to detect and identify anthropogenic trace contaminants and their TPs in different waters. Starting with theoretical predictions of TPs, an efficient workflow using the combination of target, suspected-target and non-target strategies for the identification of these TPs in the environment was developed. These techniques and strategies were applied to study anti-hypertensive drugs from the sartan group (i.e., candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and valsartan). Degradation experiments were performed in lab-scale wastewater treatment plants, and a screening workflow including an inter-laboratory approach was used for the identification of transformation products in the effluent samples. Subsequently, newly identified compounds were successfully analyzed in effluents of real wastewater treatment plants and river waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, such as aminopyrine, metamizole, phenazone and propyphenazone, are widely used analgesics that have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents in mu g L-1 concentrations. Acetamido antipyrine (AAA) and formyl aminoantipyrine (FAA) - the main metabolites of aminopyrine and metamizole - have also been detected in sub mu g L-1 concentrations in environmental water bodies and in resources used to produce drinking water, suggesting their highly persistent character. In this study phenazone, propyphenazone, AAA and FAA were treated with ozone under laboratory conditions and 17 degradation products were identified by an elucidation approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap). Typical oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds by ozone was observed among other mechanisms of ring opening. It was demonstrated that reactivity of these compounds with ozone is high (rate constants k(O3) ranging from 6.5 x 10(4) to 2.4 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)). The toxicity of the degradation products from ozonation was estimated by quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). It was shown that, when the carbon-carbon double bond is partially oxidized to an epoxy, the toxicity towards fish and daphnids is higher than that of the parent compound. By further oxidizing the molecules, a common degradation product - 1-acety1-1-methy1-2-phenylhydrazide (AMPH) - was also found to be more toxic than its parent compounds, which is of concern since this compound has previously been reported in environmental waters.

AB In this work, the usefulness of Conductive Diamond Electrochemical Oxidation (CDEO) to degrade caffeine in real urban wastewater matrixes was assessed. The oxidation of actual wastewater intensified with caffeine (from 1 to 100 mg L-1) was studied, paying particular attention to the influence of the initial load of caffeine and the differences observed during the treatment of caffeine in synthetic wastewater. The results showed that CDEO is a technology that is capable of efficiently degrading this compound even at very low concentrations and that it can even be completely depleted. Profiles of the ionic species of S (SO42-), N (NH4+, NO3-) and Cl (ClO-, ClO3- and ClO4-) were monitored and explained for plausible oxidation mechanisms. It was observed that the efficiency achieved is higher in the treatment of real wastewater than in the oxidation of synthetic wastewater because of the contribution of electrogenerated oxidant species such as hypochlorite. The formation of chlorate and perchlorate during electrochemical processes was observed, and a combined strategy to prevent this important drawback was successfully tested based on the application of low current densities with the simultaneous dosing of hydrogen peroxide.

AB An electrocoagulation flotation (ECF) process was used to remove selected nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, from water. A cationic surfactant, cethyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), was added to the solution as a collector and frother. Without the addition of the cationic surfactant, the removal of NSAIDs in a single-NSAID solution was in the range of 10-45%; it decreased to approximately 10% in multiple-NSAID systems. However, after adding a stoichiometric amount of CTAB, the removal of NSAIDs significantly improved in single-NSAID systems. For multiple-NSAID removal, the concentration of CTAB required to achieve ideal removal was equal to the sum of the molar concentrations of all the NSAIDs. In addition, a high current density produced smaller bubbles, thus enhanced the electro-flotation and achieved better removal performance. Removal of multiple-NSAIDs in actual hospital wastewater was significantly lower due to interference by oils and other hydrophobic substances. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals has become a major problem in many countries worldwide. However, little is known about the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water sources in Japan. The objective of this study was to clarify variations in the concentrations of seven nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and in cyclooxygenase(COX)-inhibiting activities in river water and domestic wastewater collected from the Tone Canal and the Edo River Basin in Japan. Total NSAID concentrations were higher in the Tone Canal than in the Edo River, and the highest concentration was observed at the domestic wastewater inflow point located in the Tone Canal (concentration averages of salicylic acid, ibuprofen, felbinac, naproxen, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, and ketoprofen in wastewater samples were 55.3, 162.9, 39.7, 11.8, 30.8, 259.7, and 48.3 ng L-1, respectively). Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that wastewater samples collected during cooler seasons contained higher levels of COX-inhibiting activity. COX-inhibiting activities were highly correlated with NSAID concentrations (particularly for ketoprofen and diclofenac); however, other COX inhibitors, such as NSAIDs that were not examined in this study and/or other chemicals with COX-inhibiting activity, could exist in the water samples because the concentrations of NSAIDs obtained from the water samples did not account for the total COX-inhibiting activities observed. Therefore, COX inhibition assays may be helpful for evaluating the aquatic toxicity of COX inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that COX inhibitors in surface water may influence aquatic organisms more than was expected based on NSAID concentrations. Thus, further studies examining other COX inhibitors in the aquatic environment are necessary.

AB Stability and removal of spironolactone (SP) from wastewater produced at Al-Quds University Campus were investigated. Kinetic studies on both pure water and wastewater coming from secondary treatment (activated sludge) demonstrated that the potassium-sparing diuretic (water pill), spironolactone, underwent degradation to its hydrolytic derivative, canrenone, in both media. The first-order hydrolysis rate of SP in activated sludge at 25 degrees C (3.80 x 10(-5) s(-1)) was about 49-fold larger than in pure water (7.4 x 10(-7) s(-1)). The overall performance of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed in the University Campus was assessed showing that more than 90% of spiked SP was removed together with its newly identified metabolites. In order to look for a technology to supplement or replace ultra-filtration membranes, the effectiveness of adsorption and filtration by micelle-clay filters for removing SP was tested in comparison with activated charcoal. Batch adsorption in aqueous suspensions was well described by Langmuir isotherms, showing a better removal by the micelle-clay material. Filtration of SP water solutions by columns filled with a mixture of sand and a micelle-clay complex showed complete removal of the drug at concentrations higher than in sand/activated-charcoal filled filters.

AB Extracts of wastewater collected from 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) receiving effluents from different sources in South India were investigated for their levels of transcription factor-mediated gene induction in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In addition, the relation between gene induction levels and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wastewater was examined. STP-3, which treats only hospital wastewater, exhibited significantly greater induction potency of all 6 drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes examined, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B15, 3A1, and 3A2, whereas the wastewater at STP-1, which exclusively receives domestic sewage, showed significantly diminished levels of induction of 3 CYP genes when compared to the levels of CYP induction at STP-2, which receives mixed wastewater. Samples collected during the monsoon season showed a significantly altered gene induction capacity compared to that of samples from the pre-monsoon period. The data suggest that the toxicity of wastewater in STPs was not significantly diminished during the treatment process. The chemical-gene interaction data predicted that a vast number of chemicals present in the wastewater would stimulate the genes studied in the rat hepatocytes. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of isolates resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem and streptomycin was significantly correlated with the levels of induction of at least three CYP-isozymes in STP wastewater. In addition, the resistance of isolates in treatment plants was not altered by the treatment steps, whereas the sampling season did have an impact on the resistance to specific antimicrobials. The identification of receptor-mediated gene regulation capacities offers important data not limited to the (synergistic) physiological role of chemicals in biological systems but may provide new insight into the link between the effects of known/unknown drugs and prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in wastewater.

AB The sunlight/H2O2 process has recently been considered as a sustainable alternative option compared to other solar driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in advanced treatment of municipal wastewater (WW) to be reused for crop irrigation. Accordingly, in this study sunlight/ H2O2 was used as disinfection/oxidation treatment for urban WW treatment plant effluent in a compound parabolic collector photoreactor to assess subsequent cross-contamination of lettuce and soil by contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) (determined by QuEChERS extraction and LCQqLIT-MS/MS analysis) and antibiotic resistant (AR) bacteria after irrigation with treated WW. Three CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), flumequine (FLU), and thiabendazole (TBZ) at 100 mu g L-1) and two AR bacterial strains (E. coli and E. faecalis, at 105 CFU mL(-1)) were spiked in real WW. A detection limit (DL) of 2 CFU mL(-1) was reached after 120 min of solar exposure for AR E. coli, while AR E. faecalis was more resistant to the disinfection process (240 min to reach DL). CBZ and TBZ were poorly removed after 90 min (12% and 50%, respectively) compared to FLU (94%). Lettuce was irrigated with treated WW for 5 weeks. CBZ and TBZ were accumulated in soil up to 472 ng g(-1) and 256 ng g(-1) and up-taken by lettuce up to 109 and 18 ng respectively, when 90 min treated WW was used for irrigation; whereas no bacteria contamination was observed when the bacterial density in treated WW was below the DL. A proper treatment time (>90 min) should be guaranteed in order to avoid the transfer of pathogens from disinfected WW to irrigated crops and soil.

AB 25 antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides) were detected in swine wastewater, river water, rivulet water and in groundwater samples from multi-level monitoring boreholes (with sampling ports, respectively, at 10, 25 and 50 m below the land surface) at Jianghan Plain, central China. Except swine wastewater, the antibiotic concentrations in groundwater, river and rivulet water were higher in spring than those in winter. Nineteen antibiotics were detected at 100% frequencies in all kinds of water samples. In groundwater, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were the predominant antibiotics and the total concentrations of 25 antibiotics commonly decreased with the aquifer depth. Most groundwater samples collected in spring had high concentrations of norfloxacin, with average values of 65.27 ng.L-1, 37.28 ng.L-1 and 46.83 ng.L-1, respectively, at 10, 25 and 50 m deep boreholes. By contrast, the concentrations of sulfamethazine and erythromycin were rather low in groundwater, but high in surface water. Groundwater samples collected from sites close to rivers or rivulets had much higher contents of antibiotics than those from other sites, indicating that the dominant source of antibiotics in groundwater should be the contaminated rivers or rivulets, rather than the scattered pig and poultry farms in the study area.

AB In this study, the changes in UV absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) and electron donating capacity (EDC) were investigated as surrogate indicators for assessing removal of micropollutants and bromate formation during ozonation of wastewater effluents. To measure the EDC, a novel method based on size exclusion chromatography followed by a post-column reaction was developed and calibrated against an existing electrochemical method. Low specific ozone doses led to a more efficient abatement of EDC than of UVA(254). This was attributed to the abatement of phenolic moieties in the dissolved organic matter (DOM), which lose their EDC upon oxidation, but are partially transformed into quinones, which still absorb in the measured UV range. For higher specific ozone doses, the relative EDC abatement was lower than the relative UVA abatement, which can be explained by the oxidation of UV absorbing moieties (e.g. non-activated aromatic compounds), which contribute less to EDC. The abatement of the selected micropollutants (i.e., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), carbamazepine (CBZ), atenolol (ATE), bezafibrate (BZF), ibuprofen (IBU), and p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA)) varied significantly depending on their reactivity with ozone in the examined specific ozone dose range of 0-1.45 mgO(3)/mgDOC. The decrease of EE2 and CBZ with high ozone reactivity was linearly proportional to the reduction of the relative residuals of UVA254 and EDC. The abatement of ATE, BZF, IBU, and pCBA with intermediate to low ozone reactivities was not significant in a first phase (UVA(254)/UVA(254,0) = 1.00-0.70; EDC/EDC0 = 1.00-0.56) while their abatement was more efficient than the degradation of the relative residual UVA(254) and much more noticeable than the degradation of the relative residual EDC in a second phase (UVA(254)/UVA(254,0) = 0.70-0.25; EDC/EDC0 = 0.56-0.25) because the partially destroyed UV absorbing and electron donating DOM moieties become recalcitrant to ozone attack. Bromate formation was pronounced for specific ozone doses >0.25 mgO(3)/mgDOC. At these ozone doses, the residual DOM competes less with bromide for ozone as the electron-rich DOM moieties are almost completely degraded. Overall, these results imply that a combination of the relative residual UVA(254) and EDC more truly reflects the intrinsic reactivity of DOM associated with the removal of micropollutants and bromate formation than the single use of the UV absorbance-based surrogate indicators.

AB A combination of surrogate parameters and indicator compounds were measured to predict the removal efficiency of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) using low pressure (LP)-UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP), engaged with online sensor-based monitoring system. Thirty-nine TOrCs were evaluated in two distinct secondary wastewater effluents in terms of estimated photochemical reactivity, as a function of the rate constants of UV direct photolysis (k(UV)) and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) oxidation (k(OH)(center dot)). The selected eighteen TOrCs were classified into three groups that served as indicator compounds: Group 1 for photo-susceptible TOrCs but with minor degradation by (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (diclofenac, fluoxetine, iohexol, iopamidol, iopromide, simazine and sulfamethoxazole); Group 2 for TOrCs susceptible to both direct photolysis and (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (benzotriazole, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, naproxen and sucralose); and Group 3 for photo-resistant TOrCs showing dominant degradation by (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, gemfibrozil, primidone and trimethoprim). The results indicate that TOC (optical-based measurement), UVA(254) or UVT254 (UV absorbance or transmittance at 254 nm), and total fluorescence can all be used as suitable on-line organic surrogate parameters to predict the attenuation of TOrCs. Furthermore, the automated real-time monitoring via on-line surrogate sensors and equipped with the developed degradation profiles between sensor response and a group of TOrCs removal can provide a diagnostic tool for process control during advanced treatment of reclaimed waters.

AB In this study, a control anaerobic membrane bioreactor (C-AnMBR) and a bioaugmented anaerobic membrane bioreactor (B-AnMBR) were operated for 210 d to treat pharmaceutical wastewater. Both the bioreactors were fed with the pharmaceutical wastewater containing TCOD of 16,249 +/- 714 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 29,450 +/- 2209 mg/L with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 13.0 +/- 0.6 kgCOD/m(3)d. Under steady-state condition, an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 46.1 +/- 2.9% and 60.3 +/- 2.8% was achieved by the C-AnMBR and the B-AnMBR, respectively. The conventional anaerobes in the C-AnMBR cannot tolerate the hypersaline conditions well, resulting in lower TCOD removal efficiency, biogas production and methane yield than the B-AnMBR seeded from the coastal shore. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that marine bacterial species (Oliephilus sp.) and halophilic bacterial species (Therrnohalobacter sp.) were only present in the B-AnMBR; these species could possibly degrade complex and recalcitrant organic matter and withstand hypersaline environments. Two different dominant archaeal communities, genus Methanosaeta (43.4%) and Methanolobus (61.7%), were identified as the dominant methanogens in the C-AnMBR and the B-AnMBR, respectively. The species of genus Methanolobus was reported resistant to penicillin and required sodium and magnesium for growth, which could enable it to thrive in the hypersaline environment.

AB For human pharmaceuticals, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are a major point of entry to surface waters. The receiving waters provide vital functions. Modeling the impact of STPs on susceptible functions of the surface water system allows for a spatially smart implementation of abatement options at, or in the service area of, STPs.
   This study was performed on a nation-wide scale for the Netherlands. Point source emissions included were 345 Dutch STPs and nine rivers from neighboring countries. The Dutch surface waters were represented by 2511 surface water units. Modeling was performed for two extreme discharge conditions. Monitoring data of 7 locations along the rivers Rhine and Meuse fall mostly within the range of modeled concentrations. Half of the abstracted volumes of raw water for drinking water production, and a quarter of the Natura 2000 areas (European Union nature protection areas) hosted by the surface waters, are influenced by STPs at low discharge. The vast majority of the total impact of all Dutch STPs during both discharge conditions can be attributed to only 19% of the STPs with regard to the drinking water function, and to 39% of the STPs with regard to the Natura 2000 function.
   Attributing water treatment technologies to STPs as one of the possible measures to improve water quality and protect susceptible functions can be done in a spatially smart and cost-effective way, using consumption-based detailed hydrological and water quality modeling.

AB Paracetamol (PAM) has emerged as an important wastewater contaminant due to its wide usage. In this study, Fenton reactions were introduced to microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for bio-electrochemical degradation of PAM without external power supply. Dual-chamber MFC reactors were employed: in the anode chambers, bio-electrons were released by oxidizing biodegradable pollutants in low-strength real domestic wastewater; in the cathode chambers, the input fluxes of bio-electrons from the anode could promote the yield of free radical (OH)-O-center dot by facilitating the regeneration of iron source. Compared to conventional Fenton reactions in which no bio-electrons were transferred, our approach exhibited the advantage that no continuous addition of Fenton reagents was required in MFC-Fenton system. Significant changes in the UV-vis spectra of catholytes from an MFC-powered process strongly indicated that bio-electricity input played an important role in PAM degradation. The performance of electro-Fenton system was in good agreement with the bio-electricity output-capacity from MFC reactor under expected optimal conditions. At total iron concentration of 5 mg L-1, initial pH value of 2.0 and external resistance of 20 Omega, the highest PAM degradation efficiency of 70% was attained within 9 h. A 25% PAM could be completely mineralized while the majority was mainly converted to intermediate metabolites of p-nitrophenol via p-aminophenol and to less hazardous dicarboxylic/carboxylic acids. These results suggested that MFC-Fenton could be applied as an energy-saving and efficient approach to PAM-containing wastewater treatment, and further to non-biocompatible pharmaceuticals degradation in aquatic environment.

AB Cytostatic drug residues in the aqueous environment are of concern due to their possible adverse effects on nontarget organisms. Here we report the occurrence and removal efficiency of cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) by biological and abiotic treatments including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Cyclophosphamide was detected in hospital wastewaters (14-22,000 ng L-1), wastewater treatment plant influents (19-27 ng L-1) and effluent (17 ng L-1), whereas IF was detected only in hospital wastewaters (48-6800 ng L-1). The highest removal efficiency during biological treatment (attached growth biomass in a flow through bioreactor) was 59 +/- 15% and 35 +/- 9.3% for CP and IF, respectively. Also reported are the removal efficiencies of both compounds from wastewater using hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), ozonation (O-3) and/or UV, either individually or in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrodynamic cavitation did not remove CP and IF to any significant degree. The highest removal efficiencies: 99 +/- 0.71% for CP and 94 +/- 2.4% for IF, were achieved using UV/O-3/H2O2 at 5 g L-1 for 120 min. When combined with biological treatment, removal efficiencies were >99% for both compounds. This is the first report of combined biological and AOP treatment of CP and IF from wastewater with a removal efficiency >99%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, quantitative interspecies-toxicity relationship methodologies were used to improve the prediction power of interspecies toxicity model. The most relevant descriptors selected by stepwise multiple linear regressions and toxicity of chemical to Daphnia magna were used to predict the toxicities of chemicals to fish. Modeling methods that were used for developing linear and nonlinear models were multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The obtained results indicate the superiority of SVM model over other models. Robustness and reliability of the constructed SVM model were evaluated by using the leave-one-out cross-validation method (Q(2)=0.69, SPRESS= 0.822) and Y-randomization test (R-2=0.268 for 30 trail). Furthermore, the chemical applicability domains of these models were determined via leverage approach. The developed SVM model was used for the prediction of toxicity of 46 compounds that their experimental toxicities to a fish were not being reported earlier from their toxicities to D. magna and relevant molecular descriptors.

AB Aminophenols (AP) are synthetic intermediates in pharmaceutical, photographic and chemical dye industry. They can be released into the environment from wastewater and can react during water treatment processes. Therefore, it was interesting to study the oxidation of AP with chlorine and monochloramine in aqueous solution. In particular, the chlorination and monochloramination of 3-aminophenol (3AP) were investigated, and the formation of first by-products and kinetic rates were determined. The chlorination rate was 3.6 x 10(5) times greater than the monochloramination rate at pH 8.6. Two reaction pathways can explain the variation of the monochloramination apparent rate constant with pH. The first one was an electrophilic substitution of Cl+ on the aromatic ring of the non-ionized 3AP, leading to the formation of chloroaminophenol, with an individual rate constant of 6.7 x 10(2) M-1 h(-1). The second reaction pathway was a monochloramine attack on the amino group of 3AP catalyzed at acidic pH with an individual rate constant of 9.2 x 10(9) x M-2 x h(-1).

AB The idea of wastewater application on soils, returned to Western Hemisphere during 1950-60. Modern living requires an increased per capita use of water for coverage of individual needs. Nowadays, two main principles related to water management seem to gain the attention of both the scientific communities and the stakeholders: 1. water saving in irrigation of agricultural crops without the reduction of food production, and 2. water saving during human use and industrial activity can only be promoted through water recycling. The increasing water demands at the level of Mediterranean countries are continuously intensified, because of the influence of a number of factors such as agricultural use and industrial consumption. The reuse of municipal wastewater in Mediterranean countries is now considered a useful practice. Countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Italy, Spain, France, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Greece, reuse the treated wastewater to a greater or a lesser extent in agriculture. There are several advantages and disadvantages in the proposed practice. However, existing technologies can help overcome such problems as for example the degradation and thus, the removal of pharmaceutical and xenobiotic compounds.

AB This study describes the occurrence, fate, and removal of free estrogens (estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)) and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (estrone-3-sulphate (E1-3S), 17 beta-estradiol-3-sulfate (E2-3S), estriol-3-sulfate (E3-3S), estrone-3-glucuronide (E1-3G), 17 beta-estradiol-3-glucuronide (E2-3G), and estriol-3-glucuronide (E3-3G)) in 12 sewage treatment plants in Japan. Glucuronide conjugates were only rarely detected in sewage influents and entirely eliminated within the treatment plants. E1 was found at 69 ng/L, E2 at 108 ng/L, E1-3S at 18 ng/L, and E2-3S at 78 ng/L in the sewage influents. The average removal efficiency for E1, E2, and sulfate conjugates was 88, 92, and 93%, respectively, following activated sludge treatment. The removal of E1 and E2 was improved with increasing the sludge retention time (SRT), with the highest removal typically found from 12 days SRT onward. The removal of sulfate conjugates was also related to SRT with highest removals found from eight days SRT onward. No correlation was found between the hydraulic retention time and the removal of any of the estrogens. The ozone dosage of 4-7 mg/L reduced E3 and E2-3S and E3-3S to below detection levels. Overall ozonation reduced the estrogenicity of the effluents as expressed as estradiol equivalents from 8.4 to 0.7 ng/L. The results suggest adequate river basin management of estrogens in Japan could be accomplished by a mixture of activated sludge plants with long SRT and where necessary, the addition of tertiary ozonation.

AB Utilization of relatively low-cost modification of Fenton reaction for the elimination of selected antibiotics and resistant coliforms in different part of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was studied. The concentration of antibiotics and occurrence of resistant gems in different stages of WWTP in the capital city of Slovakia - Bratislava was analyzed by LC-MS/MS technique. Consequently, Fenton-like reaction was applied for the elimination of chemical and biological contaminants. Comparative study with classical Fenton reaction was also done. Very high concentrations of clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin in influent water were found. Coliform bacteria were predominantly resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. After the mechanical stage, the concentration of antibiotics in water was significantly decreased because of the sorption during this step. Biological step degraded 12 types of antibiotics. Analyses of effluent water showed very bad elimination of azithromycin (919 ng/L) and clarithromycin (684 ng/L). Contrary, ciprofloxacin was removed with very high efficiency (95%). The number of resistant bacteria was also significantly decreased in effluent water. In the case of Escherichia coil only ampicillin and gentamicin resistance bacteria were detected. Our results show that antibiotics as well as resistant bacteria were eliminated by the modification of classical Fenton reaction with high efficiency. The modification of the Fenton reaction can decrease the process wages, environmental impact. Moreover, the degradation process was easily controlled, monitored and tuned. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of different organic loading rate (OLR) to an anaerobic reactor performance and sulphate reduction was investigated. Sulphate concentration in the feed varied from 100 to 3000 mg.L-1 and up to 97% removal efficiency was observed at OLR 0.43 - 1.23 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1). However, the removal efficiency showed some decline (to 53 - 67% removal) at OLR 1.53 - 3.73 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1), probably due to high sulphate concentration in the feed during this period. At a reactor OLR of 1.86 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1) (HRT 4 d), the soluble COD reduction was around 70 - 75%. Nevertheless, when the OLR was increased to 2.48 - 3.73 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1), the COD removal efficiency decreased to 45%. The microbial aspects of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) results indicated that sulfidogenic bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, had contributed substantially to the treatment process (around 16 - 36% when the reactor was operated at OLR 0.86 - 2.98 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1)).

AB The occurrence and pollution characteristics of common antibiotics in manure, soil, and sewage sludge in Shenyang, the biggest city in northeastern China, were investigated. Commonly used antibiotics tetracyclines (TCs), including tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and deoxytetracycline; and sulfonamides (SAs), including sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimidine, and sulfamethoxazole, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry via solid-phase extraction. Multiple antibiotics could be simultaneously measured in a single manure sample. The highest concentration of antibiotics in manure was 143.97 mg kg(-1) (chlortetracycline). There were no significant differences in concentrations of antibiotics between large-scale farms and individual household farms. The concentrations of TCs were significantly higher than those of SAs in manure and soils. However, the concentrations and detection frequencies of antibiotics in soils were significantly lower than in manure. The concentrations of antibiotics varied from 2.56 mu g kg(-1) of sulfadimidine to 1590.16 mu g kg(-1) of chlortetracycline, and the detection frequencies were 27.14-64.29 % for TCs and 5.71-28.57 % for SAs in soils. The concentrations of antibiotics in the vegetable field fertilized with manure were higher than those in the corn field not fertilized with manure. Various kinds of antibiotics were detected in sewage sludge, although concentrations were not high. Concentrations of antibiotics were higher in winter than in summer, The concentrations of antibiotics observed in this study were similar to those observed in other regions of China, but, in general, higher than those in other countries.

AB Ultrasonic and ozone pre-treatment technologies were employed in this study to improve the anaerobic digestion efficiency of pharmaceutical waste activated sludge. The sludge solubilisation achieved 30.01% (150,000 kJ/kg TS) and 28.10% (0.1 g O-3/g TS) after ultrasonic treatment and ozone treatment. The anaerobic biodegradability after ultrasonic treatment was higher compared to ozonation due to the higher cumulative methane volume observed after 6 days (249 ml vs 190 ml). The ozonated sludge released the highest concentration of Cu2+ into the liquid phase (6.640 mg L-1) compared to 0.530 mg/L for untreated sludge and 0.991 mg/L for sonicated sludge. The acute toxicity test measured by luminescent bacteria showed that anaerobic digestion could degrade toxic compounds and result in a reduction in toxicity. The main mechanism of action led to some differences in the treated sludge exhibiting higher potential for methane production from pharmaceutical waste sludge with ultrasonic treatment.

AB This study assessed the influence of different treatment configurations on the removal of six types of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) (dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzylphthalate (BBP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and bis (2-ethyl) hexylphthalate (DEHP)) from domestic wastewater in twelve pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs). Removal methods were investigated using orthogonal array testing with the following parameters of interest: four different water flow types, three substrates, two types of live plants, and three hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Results showed that PAE removal efficiencies differed based on chemical properties. Water flow type in the wetland was the most important factor in eliminating PAEs; downward vertical flow wetlands were most effective. The removal of high hydrophobicity DEHP and DOP was significantly impacted by substrate type; gravel systems were better than vesuvianite and zeolite systems. In addition, HLRs were important factors in reducing PAEs; the optimal HLR is 0.125-0.25 m/day, allowing PAEs to come into contact with substrate biofilm. Study results suggest that microbiological activity and adsorption were the most prevalent removal route for PAEs in constructed wetlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of intersex fish, where male reproductive tissues show evidence of feminization, have been found in freshwater systems around the world, indicating the potential for significant endocrine disruption across species in the ecosystem. Estrogens from birth control medications in wastewater treatment plant effluent have been cited as the likely cause, but research has shown that endocrine disruption is not solely predictable based on hormone receptor interactions. Many other non-hormone pharmaceuticals are found in effluent at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than estrogens, yet there is little data indicating the impacts of these other medications. The widely prescribed anti-diabetic metformin is among the most abundant of pharmaceuticals found in effluent and is structurally dissimilar from hormones. However, we show here that exposing fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to a concentration of metformin found in wastewater effluent causes the development of intersex gonads in males, reduced size of treated male fish, and reduction in fecundity for treated pairs. Our results demonstrate that metformin acts as an endocrine disruptor at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The little data about pharmaceutical residue contamination in African water bodies motivated our study on the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in the water and sediment of Msunduzi River in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa; and in the Darvill wastewater treatment plant found in Msunduzi catchment. Samples collected along the River and wastewater treatment plant were extracted and analysed for pharmaceutical residues selected based on statistics of drug usage in South Africa i.e. antipyretics, antibiotics, caffeine, an antiepileptic and an antipsychotic drug were determined using HPLC-MS/MS.
   In all the matrices investigated, the antipyretic ibuprofen had the highest concentration of up to 117 mu g L-1, 84.60 mu g L-1 and 659 ng g(-1) in wastewater, surface water and sediment respectively. Antibiotics were detected in generally low concentrations of <10 mu g L-1 in surface water samples and up to 34.50 mu g L-1 in wastewater; moreover they were not completely removed during wastewater treatment. The percentage removal efficiency of the studied group was 6.55-98.00% for antipyretics, 73.33-98.90% for antibiotics, 48.80% for the anti-epileptic drug and 86.40% for Caffeine. Clozapine exhibited a negative removal.
   In surface water, Henley dam exhibited a high concentration of the pharmaceutical residues and the highest concentration of metronidazole in sediment (up to 1253.50 ng g(-1)) detected. Metronidazole was only detected in sediment and bio-solids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metformin (MET) as an emerging contaminant has been detected in surface water and wastewater in numerous countries, due to insufficient retention in classical waste water treatment plants. In order to characterize the uptake of the compound during phytotreatment of waste water, a short term Pitman chamber experiment was carried out to assess the characteristics of MET uptake and transport by roots. Three different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mmol L-1) were applied to cattail (Typha latifolia) and reed (Phragmites australis) roots which were used to investigate the uptake mechanism because they are frequently utilized in phytoremediation. In addition, quinidine was used as an inhibitor to assess the role of organic cation transporters (OCTs) in the uptake of MET by T. latifolia. The transport process of MET is different from carbamazepine (CBZ) and caffeine (CFN). In both T. latifolia and P. australis, the uptake processes were independent of initial concentrations. Quinidine, a known inhibitor of organic cation transporters, can significantly affect MET uptake by T. latifolia roots with inhibition ratios of 70-74%. Uptake into the root could be characterized by a linear model with R-2 values in the range of 0.881-0.999. Overall, the present study provides evidence that MET is taken up by plant roots and has the potential for subsequent translocation. OCTs could be one of the important pathways for MET uptake into the plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional activated sludge (CAS) wastewater treatment processes are insufficient at removing many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater. In addition, negative mass balances, where the effluent concentration is greater than the influent concentration, have been observed in wastewater treatment studies and a further understanding of these results is needed. In this study, the fate and occurrence of 57 PPCPs and hormones were evaluated in an activated sludge process and the mass balances were determined. The goal of the project was to understand the PPCPs biological degradation and the extent of sorption to solids. The samples containing in situ PPCPs (i.e. samples were not spiked with additional PPCPs) were evaluated. Forty-eight of the PPCPs were detected in the soluble form and 29 were detected sorbed to solids. Two notable results were found. First, the results of this study indicate a subset of the highly biodegradable PPCPs stop being degraded at low, yet notable, concentrations. Second, the results revealed that negative mass balances were present for a subset of the PPCPs when evaluating both the soluble and sorbed concentration, for example carbamazepine and ofloxacin. Desorption from solids was not found to attribute to negative mass balances. Overall, the results from this study provide new insights into the fate of PPCPs during CAS wastewater treatment by evaluating the degradation kinetics and sorption and the results may explain the consistent levels of highly degradable PPCPs being emitted from WWTPs worldwide.

AB Two multi-residue methods based on off-line solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS have been applied in samples collected from three sewage treatment plants for the identification and quantification of licit and illicit drugs. The occurrence of the drugs in wastewater appears to be influenced by both the operational parameters of each plant and their consumption in the area served by the corresponding plant. Generally, the present study demonstrated that both licit and illicit drugs were found in the effluent wastewater of all urban wastewater treatment plants; a fact suggesting that they are bioresistance. These compounds were determined in relatively high concentrations (licit drugs: below limit of detection (BLD) to 5520 ng/L and illicit drugs: BLD to 5815 ng/L) in all effluent wastewater samples monitored in this study. The major groups of licit drugs detected in the effluents were antibiotics, b-blockers, analgesics, and non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs suggesting that these compounds show a noticeable resistance against the biological treatment applied. The concentrations of antibiotics and b-blockers in the effluents ranged from ca. 4 to 200 ng/L and 40 to 500 ng/L, respectively. Concerning the illicit drugs, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were detected in almost all effluent samples with median values of 1 and 3 ng/L, respectively.

AB Groundwater recharge using reclaimed water is considered a promising method to alleviate groundwater depletion. However, pollutants in reclaimed water could be recharged into groundwater during this process, thereby posing a risk to groundwater and human health. In this study, 12 cities in northern China were selected for reclaimed water and groundwater sampling. Analysis of the samples revealed the presence of nine pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and five endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). In reclaimed water, all the PPCPs and EDCs were found, with sulpiride (SP) and estriol (E3) being most frequently detected. In groundwater samples, only ketoprofen (RP), mefenamic acid (MA), nalidixic acid (NA) and SP were detected among PPCPs, while bisphenol-A (BPA) was dominant among the target EDCs. The risk quotients (RQs) of all target PPCPs and EDCs except 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and E3 were below 1 in groundwater samples, indicating that EE2 and E3 deserve priority preferential treatment before recharging.

Compounds found with highest median concentrations included: sulfadimethoxine (164 ng/L), sulpiride (77.3 ng/L), atenolol (52.9 ng/L), and indomethacin (50.9 ng/L). Antibiotic was the predominant class detected and contributed about half of the overall PPCPs contamination level. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were demonstrated to be the predominant pathways through which PPCPs entering into aquatic environment in all investigated areas. The ratio of persistent PPCPs like sulpiride and carbamazepine was identified to be feasible in tracing their contamination sources in rivers. Concentrations of most detected PPCPs showed significant positive correlations with total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Two groups of representative PPCPs were selected as the chemical indicators for predicting the overall PPCPs contamination, based on the significant correlations between PPCPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The overuse of antibiotics in livestock farms is general, leading to a wide distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environment adjacent to livestock farms. However, researches of the distribution and types of ARGs in aquatic environment of China are still in the initial stage. In this study, wastewater and surface water samples were collected from 12 livestock farms (four pig farms, four cattle farms, and four chicken farms) in Jiangsu Province of China. The prevalence, abundance, and distribution of 22 ARGs were investigated, which were categorized into six groups, including nine tetracyclin resistance genes, three sulfonamides resistance genes, three quinolone resistance genes, two macrolide resistance genes, three aminoglycoside resistance genes, and two multidrug resistance genes, employing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results suggested that all of the 22 ARGs were detected in samples. Sul1, sul2, and tetM were the most abundant with the average concentration of 3.84 x 10(1) copies/16S recombinant RNA (rRNA) gene copies, 1.62 x 10(1) copies/16S rRNA gene copies, 2.33 x 10(1) copies/16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Principle component analysis revealed that the comprehensive pollution of ARGs in northern Jiangsu was more serious. ARGs in wastewater were more abundant when compared to that in surface water. A preliminary study regarding the fate of ARGs after an aerobiotic process showed that tetA, tetC, sul1, sul2, oqxB, and qnrS were significantly increased. And, among the tetracycline resistance genes, the efflux pump genes were enriched while the ribosomal protection protein encoding genes were decreased in the aerobiotic process. The prevalance of ARGs in water environment is of concern; more surveillance is required to determine the pollution level and pattern of antibiotic resistance genes.

AB Production and human consumption of pharmaceuticals result in contamination of surface waters worldwide. Little is known about the long-term (i.e., over decades) fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems. Here, we show that the most prescribed anxiolytic in Sweden (oxazepam) persists in its therapeutic form for several decades after being deposited in a large freshwater lake. By comparing sediment cores collected in 1995 and 2013, we demonstrate that oxazepam inputs from the early 1970s remained in the sediments until sampling in 2013, despite in situ degradation processes and sediment diagenesis. In laboratory and pond experiments, we further reveal that therapeutic forms of oxazepam can persist over several months in cold (5 degrees C) lake water free from UV light. We conclude that oxazepam can persist in lakes over a time scale much longer than previously realized and that levels can build up in lakes due to both a legacy of past inputs and a growing urban population.

AB BACKGROUNDPharmaceutical industry generates a large amount of liquid effluents rich in toxic compounds that reach natural water streams, if improperly degraded, being a threat for ecosystems. In this context, ozonation appears as an interesting alternative to conventional treatments. This work aims to study the effect of this technology aided by two ceramic catalysts (the laboratory Mn-Ce-O and the commercial N-150) on the degradation of a mixture of two contaminants: sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac. RESULTS: The presence of the catalysts had no significant impact on pharmaceuticals removal when compared with single ozonation. However, both materials increased the amount of COD removed per mg of ozone applied (0.10 mgCOD(removed) mg(-1)O(3) and 0.067 mgCOD(removed) mg(-1)O(3) for catalytic and single ozonation, respectively). The performance of Mn-Ce-O was very dependent upon the solution pH whereas no significant pH impact was detected for N-150. The generalized kinetic model (GKM) was able to satisfactorily describe the lumped kinetic mechanism concerning COD abatement. Moreover, no differences in the degradation results were observed for the Mn-Ce-O system when comparing two types of waters (ultrapure and natural) used to dissolve the pharmaceutical compounds. Importantly, the presence of the solid catalyst improved ozone usage and reduced the effluents' toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONAlthough work has been published regarding the removal of single emerging contaminants, the analysis of mixtures is not so frequent. The use of Mn-Ce-O truly enhances COD degradation revealing its potential as heterogeneous catalytic material to improve ozone action on pollutants. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB BACKGROUNDSynthetic musks are massively used in personal care and cosmetic products and they reach the environment mainly because they are not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this work, an innovative and simple chemical scoring and ranking approach was developed as a screening tool to evaluate the overall impact of musks on the environment, identifying priority compounds. This system is idealised as an important tool for a subsequently feasible environmental risk assessment of musks that may represent the overall contamination on a regional scale.
   RESULTSPhysicochemical and toxicological properties of 18 synthetic musks estimated by (Q)SAR were successfully used for the chemical scoring and combined with observed data to estimate the environmental impact posed by these compounds on four environmental compartments.
   CONCLUSIONThe prioritisation approach for musks shows that the risk of a compound can vary depending on the compartments, although HHCB posed a high to very high risk to all of them. For instance, AHMI has a relevant risk to soil and air, but very low to low in water and sediments, while AHTN was considered to be of medium risk for water and soil, but of a very high risk to sediments and air.

DE Diclofenac; Photoelectrocatalysis; Mechanism; Kinetics; Reactive species
AB Diclofenac is a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which has been widely used in clinic that leads to the frequently detection in the freshwater bodies. In the present study, we explored the visible-light-driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) degradation of diclofenac solution by the as-fabricated N, STiO2/TiO2 NTs photoelectrode. Meanwhile, the PEC degradation performance and kinetics were also investigated. It was found that 73.3% of diclofenac could be degraded within 12 h visible light irradiation with the help of external potential (+ 0.4V vs SCE). Additionally, the PEC processes followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model, in which the highest apparent rate constant of 0.101 h (1) could be achieved. Moreover, the further study of reactive species indicated that both H2O2 and center dot OH radicals were responsible for the major degradation of diclofenac molecule. Besides, five degradation intermediates were elucidated by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Based on these results, three tentative pathways for the PEC degradation of diclofenac solution were proposed, for example hydroxylation addition to parent pharmaceuticals, C-N cleavage of side chain from the diclofenac attacked by photogenerated holes and directly decarboxylation, subsequently dechlorination and oxidation processes. This study provides an effective strategy for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater or freshwater bodies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eight typical pharmaceuticals in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Xi'an city in China were investigated to determine their occurrence and removal efficiencies. Target pharmaceuticals were extracted from wastewater and sludge samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) after derivatization. The results indicated that the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.39 to 642 mu g L (1) in the influents, which were similar with or one order magnitude higher than that of previous reports, and phenacetin, gemfibrozil and caffeine were main contributors. The concentrations in the effluents were between 0.075 and 7.01 mg L (1), and 80-100% pharmaceuticals were removed in the WWTPs except diclofenac, which was removed nearly 72-85%. Three main removal pathways including physicochemical process, biodegradation and sludge adsorption were involved in the removal of the pharmaceuticals. Almost 20-50% of the pharmaceuticals were removed through physicochemical operating units, and high concentration pharmaceuticals were examined in the floating oil from aerated grit chamber. Nearly 11-89% and 0-15% pharmaceuticals were removed by biodegradation and sludge adsorption, respectively. Aerobic condition was advantageous for the biodegradation of phenacetin, gemfibrozil and caffeine, while cholesterol was easily decomposed by anaerobic microorganism. It showed that high temperature was beneficial to the biological removal of gemfibrozil, and acidic condition could be more helpful to the biodegradation of diclofenac and its removal efficiency reached 60% at pH 4.5. However, biodegradability of diclofenac should be further investigated to eliminate its adverse effects on human health and ecological environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a persistent pharmaceutical compound, cannot be effectively removed (<10%) by conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study investigates the removal of this molecule in water solution using a photocatalytic process at 365 nm. Five commercial TiO2-based photocatalysts (P90, P25, UV100, PC500, and ST01) were tested over a range of operating parameters (type and concentration of photocatalysts, pH, treatment time, and light intensity). The best operating conditions for CBZ degradation in solution (99% CBZ removal) were obtained using P90 as photocatalyst at a concentration of 1.5 g/L for 90 min of treatment with a pH of 5.0 and a light intensity of 18.9 W/m(2). Under these conditions, removal of 74% of total organic carbon was recorded. This optimized photocatalytic process can treat either relatively high concentrations of CBZ (5 mg/L to 20 mg/L) or low concentrations of CBZ (37 mu g/L) in water. The initial rate of photocatalytic degradation of CBZ using P90 as photocatalyst can be described by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood CL-H) kinetic model with a reaction rate constant of 2.22 +/- 0.003 mg/L/min at ca. 20 degrees C.

AB Present study evaluated the effect of effluent from submerged aerated biological filter (SABF) and activated sludge process (ASP) on the performance of membrane bioreactor (MBR). MBR was operated both in external configuration and internal configuration mode. Feeding SABF effluent to MBR resulted in a flux reduction of 2.3% and 12% under external and internal configurations, respectively. Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) removal from SABF effluent by MBR was only 13% in the external configuration mode whereas VOC was completely eliminated in the internal configuration mode. Treatment of effluent from ASP caused significant flux reduction and increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) in the MBR. For both internal and external membrane configurations, substantial increase in extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) and suspended solids resulted in higher membrane fouling during the treatment of ASP effluent. VOC removal from ASP effluent by MBR was achieved only while adopting internal configuration mode. Effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, with less impact on membrane performance and reduced VOC emission to the atmosphere, can be achieved by coupling SABF with MBR and adopting internal configuration mode.

AB This study investigated the characteristics of 10 subtypes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for sulfonamide, tetracycline, beta-lactam and macrolide resistance and the class 1 integrase gene (intI1). In total, these genes were monitored in 24 samples across each stage of five full-scale pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) using qualitative and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from(2.08 +/- 0.16) x 10(3) to (3.68 +/- 0.27) x 10(6) copies/mL. The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for only 0.6%-59.8% of influents of the five PWWTPs, while the majority of the ARGs were transported to the dewatered sludge with concentrations from (9.38 +/- 0.73) x 10(7) to (4.30 +/- 0.81) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). The total loads of ARGs discharged through dewatered sludge was 7-308 folds higher than that in the rawinfluents and 16-638 folds higher than that in the final effluents. The proliferation of ARGs mainly occurs in the biological treatment processes, such as conventional activated sludge, cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) and membrane bio-reactor (MBR), implying that significant replication of certain subtypes of ARGs may be attributable to microbial growth. High concentrations of antibiotic residues (ranging from 0.14 to 92.2 mg/L) were detected in the influents of selected wastewater treatment systems and they still remain high residues in the effluents. Partial correlation analysis showed significant correlations between the antibiotic concentrations and the associated relative abundance of ARG subtypes in the effluent. Although correlation does not prove causation, this study demonstrates that in addition to bacterial growth, the high antibiotic residues within the pharmaceutical WWTPs may influence the proliferation and fate of the associated ARG subtypes.

AB Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug frequently detected in the influent and effluent of sewage treatment plants. The Gram-positive strain Planococcus sp. S5 was able to remove approximately 30 % of naproxen after 35 days of incubation in monosubstrate culture. Under cometabolic conditions, with glucose or phenol as a growth substrate, the degradation efficiency of S5 increased. During 35 days of incubation, 75.14 +/- 1.71 % and 86.27 +/- 2.09 % of naproxen was degraded in the presence of glucose and phenol, respectively. The highest rate of naproxen degradation observed in the presence of phenol may be connected with the fact that phenol is known to induce enzymes responsible for aromatic ring cleavage. The activity of phenol monooxygenase, naphthalene monooxygenase, and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase was indicated in Planococcus sp. S5 culture with glucose or phenol as a growth substrate. It is suggested that these enzymes may be engaged in naproxen degradation.

AB During the rejection of trace antibiotics from wastewater using forward osmosis (FO), spacer was added over the membrane to regulate the operation conditions. Interesting results were obtained, which demonstrated that when the spacer was added over the FO membrane, rejections of trace antibiotics increased by 23-2.8% in the active layer facing feed solution (AL-FS) orientation. Similarly, in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) orientation, rejections of antibiotics increased by 5.3-8.5% after the spacer being added. To explore the mechanism of the enhancement for antibiotic rejections, the flow field in the FO cell was investigated using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) technology. It was confirmed that turbulence was produced in the FO cell due to the added spacer. And it was proposed that the turbulence could disturb the boundary layer at the membrane surface and urge the antibiotics to diffuse from the layer back into the bulk solution, which reduced the diffusive driving force of antibiotics through the membrane into the draw solution, hence leading to an increase in rejections.

AB Two laboratory scale fully aerated continuous flow wastewater treatment systems were used to compare the removal of five benzotriazoles and one benzothiazole by suspended and attached growth biomass. The activated sludge system was operated under low organic loading conditions. The moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) system consisted of two serially connected reactors filled with K3-biocarriers. It was either operated under low or high organic loading conditions. Target compounds were removed partially and with different rates in tested systems. For MBBR, increased loading resulted in significantly lower biodegradation for 4 out of 6 examined compounds. Calculation of specific removal rates (normalized to biomass) revealed that attached biomass had higher biodegradation potential for target compounds comparing to suspended biomass. Clear differences in the biodegradation ability of attached biomass grown in different bioreactors of MBBR systems were also observed. Batch experiments showed that micropollutants biodegradation by both types of biomass is co-metabolic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin (AMX), florfenicol (FF) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), that inhibit bacteria via different target sites, were selected to evaluate the acute toxicity and long-term effects on anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) granules. The specific anammox activity (SAA) levels reduced by approximately half within the first 3 days in the presence of antibiotics but no nitrite accumulation was observed in continuous-flow experiments. However, the SAA levels and heme c content gradually recovered as the antibiotic concentrations increased. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) analysis suggested that anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria gradually developed a better survival strategy during long-term acclimatization, which reduced the antibiotic stress via increased EPS secretion that provided a protective 'cocoon.' In terms of nitrogen removal efficiency, anammox granules could resist 60 mg-AMX L-1, 10 mg-FF L-1 and 100 mg-SMZ L-1. This study supported the feasibility of using anammox granules to treat antibiotic-containing wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anti-cancer drugs are compounds that are of high environmental relevance because of their lack of specific mode of action. They can be extremely harmful to living organisms even at low concentrations. The present study evaluated the toxic effects of four frequently used anti-cancer drugs against plant seedlings, namely Cyclophosphamide (CP), Methotrexate (MTX), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Imatinib (IM). The phytotoxicity experiments were performed with Lactuca sativa seedlings whereas cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations were performed with the well-established Allium cepa assays. MTX was the most phytotoxic compound, followed by 5-FU, CE and IM. Significant differences in the Mitotic Indexes (MI) were observed in three of the studied compounds (MTX, 5-FU and CP), indicating potential cytotoxic activity of these substances. Chromosome aberrations were registered in cells that were exposed to 5-FU, CE and IM. All the four compounds caused the formation of micronucleated cells indicating mutagenic potential. Besides, the assays performed with MTX samples presented a high number of cell apoptosis (cell death). Although it is unlikely that the pharmaceuticals concentrations measured in the environment could cause lethal effects in plants, the obtained results indicate that these compounds may affect the growth and normal development of these plants. So, both tests can constitute important tools for a fast screening of environmental contamination e.g. in the context of the reuse of treated wastewater and biosolids of agricultural purpose.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in the chemical concentration of interstitial water in the vadose zone was previously observed under apparently homogeneous surface conditions on two leveled fields sprinkler irrigated with treated sewage effluents on the phreatic Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel. This phenomenon greatly hampers the monitoring of groundwater quality. In this study we report on the presence of puddles of different size and shape that were sporadically observed in these fields. Temporal variability noted in the concentration of treated sewage effluents components in the puddles were considered to be related to evapotranspiration and degradation. For example: increases in the electrical conductivity (up to 1.32 mS/cm), and in the concentrations of chloride (up to 521 mg/L), dissolved organic carbon (up to 28.4 mg/L), and carbamazepine (up to 780 ng/L) and decreases in the concentrations of nitrate (up to 20.1 mg/L) and caffeine (3396 ng/L). Variable trends in concentration were observed for sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine and o-desmethylvenlafaxine. The presence of puddles was not necessarily related to areas with high irrigation water input. It is postulated that the continuous chemical variability in the puddles, whose location and size are also variable, determine a heterogeneous influx of solutes into the soil and subsequently into the vadose zone.

AB Treated sewage sludge is commonly used in agriculture as fertilizer. It is, therefore, necessary to determine possible detrimental influences of sludge application on soil contamination and accumulation of contaminants in tissues of terrestrial animals, which in the long run could also have undesirable effects on humans. With that aim, the study was performed using earthworm Eisenia fetida as test organism and semi-solid depot sludge from a wastewater treatment plant as exposure media. The concentrations of 26 metals/metalloids were determined in depot sludge, and their bioaccumulation was estimated in whole tissue of E. fetida, and for the first time in the soluble tissue fraction, which represents metal fraction available for metabolic requirements and toxic effects. Obtained results have revealed acceptable levels of several elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) in depot sludge, when compared to currently valid regulations, and only moderate accumulation of some elements (e.g. As, Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Tl, V, and Zn) in earthworms, as a consequence of exposure to depot sludge. However, a concentration increase after exposure to depot sludge was observed in E. fetida for several elements (Cd, Mo, and Zn), which were present in lower concentrations in the exposure mixtures than in soil. Contrary, a concentration decrease was observed for Cs, Mn, and Rb, although they were present in higher concentrations in depot sludge than in soil. It was an indication of disturbance in metal homeostasis in earthworms, possibly caused by exposure to complex mixture of contaminants present in depot sludge. The cumulative effect of exposure to a number of various contaminants (inorganic, organic, microbiological and pharmaceutical), even if each of them was not present in very high concentrations, could have caused distress in earthworms exposed to depot sludge.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare microcontaminant degradation of a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluent by direct solar photo-Fenton treatment at neutral pH and a combined nanofiltration (NF)/solar photo-Fenton process at pilot plant scale. Photo-Fenton was run with Fe [(S,S)-ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS)] complex. The membrane pilot plant consisted of NF modules with a total surface area of 5.2 m(2), and photo-Fenton was run in a solar pilot plant (total surface of solar collectors 3 m(2), total volume of the plant 35 L) with an iron complexing agent at low iron (<0.2 mM) and H2O2 (<2 mM) concentrations. A QTRAP MS/MS system was used to evaluate micropollutant degradation (35 were evaluated, seven in concentrations over 1000 ng L-1) and >90% degradation took less than 12 min. It was demonstrated that the use of the combined NF/solar photo-Fenton process reduced required H2O2 consumption by 53% and energy by 67%, compared with direct photo-Fenton treatment of the same MWTP effluent.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate the achievable limits of aerobic sludge stabilization applied on waste-activated sludge generated in domestic, tannery, and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. Stabilization study involved monitoring of conventional parameters and model evaluation of oxygen uptake rate and particulate components of waste sludge. Multi-component biomass approach was adopted based on death-regeneration mechanism. The results showed that sludge stabilization efficiency ranged between 25% and 30%, which was closely related to the fate of different particulate fractions of biomass, that is, viable biomass, hydrolysable particulates, and microbial metabolic products. Model calibration exercises yield in rate coefficient ranges of 0.18-0.32/day for biomass decay and 0.60-0.65/day for hydrolysis of non-biomass components. Degradation rates of particulate metabolic products were estimated as 0.035, 0.04, and 0.01/day for domestic, tannery, and pharmaceutical sludge, respectively. Relatively low degradation rates compared to conventional biological treatment processes confirmed reduced microbial activity in the course of aerobic stabilization.

AB Two antibacterials, amoxicillin trihydrate and cefuroxime axetil spiked into wastewater were completely removed by sequential wastewater treatment plant's membranes, which included activated sludge, ultrafiltration (hollow fibre and spiral wound membranes with 100 and 20 kDa cut-offs), activated carbon column and reverse osmosis. Adsorption isotherms in synthetic water which employed activated carbon and micelle-clay complex (octadecyltrimethylammonium-montmorillonite) as adsorbents fitted the Langmuir equation. Q(max) of 100 and 90.9 mg g(-1), and K values of 0.158 and 0.229 L mg(-1) were obtained for amoxicillin trihydrate using activated carbon and micelle-clay complex, respectively. Filtration of antibacterials in the ppm range, which yielded variable degrees of removal depending on the volumes passed and flow rates, was simulated and capacities for the ppb range were estimated. Stability study in pure water and wastewater revealed that amoxicillin was totally stable for one month when kept at 37 degrees C, whereas cefuroxime axetil underwent slow hydrolysis to cefuroxime.

AB Effective oil/water separation and removal of organic molecules from water are of worldwide importance for water source protection. Multifunctional sorbent materials with excellent sorption capacity, stability, and recyclability properties need to be developed. Here, flexible and multifunctional polymer/porous boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) membranes with high water permeability, exhibiting high effectiveness and stability in the purification of simulated wastewater tainted with either oil/water emulsion or organic molecules, are reported. Remarkably, the flexible nature of these porous membranes enables simplicity of operation for water remediation processing and ease of post-processing collection. The composite membrane also displays a remarkably high permeability of 8 x 10(4) L m m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), roughly three orders of magnitude higher than pure polymer, and excellent filter efficiencies for the pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin, chlortetracycline, and carbamazepine (up to 14.2 L g(-1) of BNNSs in the composite membrane for a concentration of 10 mg L-1 ciprofloxacin) and the dye methylene blue (up to 9.3 L g(-1) of BNNSs in the composite membrane at a concentration of 30 mg L-1). Exhausted membranes can be readily rejuvenated by simple washing with retention of their high-performance characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential efficacy and practicality of these membranes for water cleaning.

AB Biological effects of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were investigated in Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) caged for one month 800 m and 1100 m from the WWTP discharge site and at a reference site 4 km away. Significant antioxidant, genotoxic and lysosomal responses were observed close to the point of the WWTP discharge. Passive samplers (POCIS) attached to the cages indicated markedly higher water concentrations of various pharmaceuticals at the two most impacted sites. Modeling the dispersal of a hypothetical passive tracer compound from the WWTP discharge site revealed differing frequencies and timing of the exposure periods at different caging sites. The study demonstrated for the first time the effectiveness of the mussel caging approach in combination with passive samplers and the application of passive tracer modeling to examine the true exposure patterns at point source sites such as WWTP pipe discharges in the Baltic Sea.

AB The current investigation of marine water from 30 sites adjacent to stormwater outlets across the entire Sydney estuary is the first such research in Australia. The number of analytes detected were: 8/59 pharmaceutical compounds (codeine, paracetamol, tramadol, venlafaxine, propranolol, fluoxetine, iopromide and carbamazepine), 7/38 of the pesticides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 3,4-dichloroaniline, carbaryl, diuron, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), mecoprop and simazine) and 0/3 of the personal care products (PCPs) analysed. An artificial sweetener (acesulfame) was detected, however none of the nine antibiotics analysed were identified. Sewage water is not discharged to this estuary, except infrequently as overflow during high-precipitation events. The presence of acesulfame (a recognised marker of domestic wastewater) and pharmaceuticals in water from all parts of the estuary after a dry period, suggests sewage water is leaking into the stormwater system in this catchment. The pesticides are applied to the environment and were discharged via stormwater to the estuary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to investigate the organics removal and microbial community dynamics in accordance with variable amoxicillin (AMX) concentrations, a 1.47 L expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor was designed and operated for 241 days treating with artificial antibiotic wastewater. Furthermore, microbiological community dynamics with increasing AMX concentrations were also investigated using clone libraries and the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene. AMX concentration in the reactor was controlled at 19.2 mg L-1 at first and then gradually increased to around 241.7 mg L-1 from the day 146 to 241. COD and AMX removal efficiencies reached to 85% and 80%, respectively. And T-RFLP results showed that the microbial community structure in the reactor changed with the increased AMX concentrations. Especially for bacteria, T-RFs of 486, 482, 166, 160 and 88 bp were dominant at all stages, whereas abundance of T-RFs 91,163 and 170 bp showed remarkable changes. Besides, clone results combined with T-RFLP showed Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae and Thermotogae were most dominant bacterial groups in the system and some geneses were also expected to be responsible for the degradation of AMX. For achaea, its community structure (T-RFs of 96, 122 bp) kept stable in all the stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Slow sand filtration (SSF) has been widely used as a means of providing potable water due to its efficacy, low cost, and minimal maintenance. Advances in analytical instrumentation have revealed the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in surface water as well as in ground water. It is unclear if the presence of these compounds in the feed water can interfere with the performances of an SSF unit. The aim of this work was to examine i) the ability of two SSF units to remove six PhACs (caffeine, carbamazepine, 17-beta estradiol [E2], estrone [E1], gemfibrozil, and phenazone), and ii) the impact of these PhACs on the removal of bacteria by two SSF units. The presence of PhACs in feed water for SSF can occur in surface waters impacted by wastewater or leakage from sewers and septic tanks, as well as in developing countries where unregulated use and improper disposal are prevalent. Two pilot-scale SSF units were used during the study. Unit B1 was fed with stream water with 1% of primary effluent added, while unit B2 was fed with stream water alone. Although limited removal (<10%) of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and phenazone occurred, the complete removal of caffeine, and the partial removal (11-92%) of E2 and E1 were observed in the two SSF units. The results of this study suggest that the occurrence of the selected PhACs, probably estrogens and caffeine, in the feed water at 50 mu g L-1 affected the ability of the schmutzdecke to remove total coliform and Escherichia coli. The bacterial removal achieved within the schmutzdecke dropped from 95% to less than 20% by the end of the study. This decrease in removal may be related to the change in the microbial community within the schmutzdecke. A diverse microbial community, including Bacteroidetes and several classes of Proteobacteria, was replaced by a microbial community in which Gammaproteobacteria was the predominant phylum (99%). Despite the low removal achieved within the schmutzdecke, removal of total coliform and E. coli greater than 99% occurred after both SSF units throughout the study. Bacterial removal occurred in the upper half of the sand filter. This was probably due to a diverse microbial community established in the packing material, in which Bacteroidetes (13-25%), Acidobacteria (7-17%) and several classes of Proteobacteria (35-52%) (Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria) were the predominant phyla.

AB The interaction-based hazard index (HIint) allows a prediction of mixture effects different from linear additivity by including information on binary mixtures between the chemicals. The aim of this study is to make a solid estimate on the possible synergistic potential of combined antibiotics and to quantify the subsequent effect for the case of the receiving river Elbe, Germany. Pieces of information on binary interactions between antibiotic groups were used from literature and from knowledge on human antibiotic combination therapy. Applying a moderate and a worst-case scenario, in terms of the interaction magnitude, resulted in 50 to 200% higher environmental risks, compared to the classical assessment approach applying simple concentration addition. A subsequent sensitivity analysis revealed that the data strength for some binary antibiotic combinations is too low to be considered for a solid estimate of synergistic effects. This led to the definition of certain preconditions in order to decide whether or not to include certain interaction information (e.g. the necessary number of interaction studies). The exclusion of information with low data strength resulted in an attenuated risk increase of 20 to 50%, based on the currently available scientific information on binary antibiotic mixtures. In order to include antibiotics with the highest share in the overall risk (macrolides, quinolones, and cephalosporins) as well as their corresponding metabolites, investigations should focus on binary interactions between them.

AB Illicit drug consumption in five cities in South Korea was estimated by analyzing 17 drug residues in untreated wastewater samples collected during the Christmas and New Year period of 2012-13. Only methamphetamine, amphetamine, and codeine were detected at concentrations of tens of nanograms per liter or even lower concentrations in more than 90% of the samples. Other illicit drug residues (including cocaine, methadone, and benzoylecgonine) that have been detected frequently in wastewater from other countries were not found in this study. Methamphetamine was found to be the most widely used illicit drug in South Korea, and the estimated average consumption rate was 22 mg d(-1) (1000 people)(-1). This rate is, for example, 2-5 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in Hong Kong and other parts of China and 4-80 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in cities in Western countries. It should be noted that the wastewater samples analyzed in this study were collected during a holiday season, when daily consumption of illicit drugs is often higher than on an average day. The methamphetamine usage rates were calculated for different cities in South Korea, and the usage rates in smaller cities was higher (2-4 times) than the average. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of nanoconcentrations of persistent pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater effluent and in surface water has been frequently reported. A novel organic inorganic hybrid sorbent based on adsorbing quarternized poly vinyl-pyridinium-co-styrene (QPVPcS) to montmorillonite (MMT) was designed for the removal of the anionic micropollutants. QPVPcS-clay composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR., thermal gravimetric analysis, Zeta potential and element analysis. Based on these measurements polymer clay micro- and nanostructures, as a function of polymer loading, were suggested. The affinity of the anionic pharmaceutical, diclofenac (DCF), to the composite was high and did not decrease dramatically with an increase of ionic strength, indicating that the interactions are not only electrostatic. The presence of humic acid (HA) did not hinder DCF removal by the composite; whereas, its filtration by granulated activated carbon (GAG) was compromised in the presence of HA. The kinetics and adsorption at equilibrium of DCF to the composite and to GAG were measured and modeled by the time dependent Langmuir equation. The adsorption of DCF to the composite was significantly faster than to GAG. Accordingly, the filtration of micro- and nanoconcentrations of DCF by composite columns, in the presence of HA, was more efficient than by GAG columns.

AB In search of new options to achieve removal of pharmaceuticals in the environment, combined ultrasound and ozonation has become a focus of intense investigation for wastewater treatment. In this study, three pharmaceuticals were selected as model compounds for degradation experiments: diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ). Comparison of the degradation rates for both ozonation and combined ultrasound/ozonation treatments was performed on single synthetic solutions as well as on a mixture of the selected pharmaceuticals, under different experimental conditions. For single synthetic solutions, the efficiency removal for ozonation reached 73%, 51% and 59% after 40 min for DCF, SMX and CBZ, respectively. Comparable results were obtained for pharmaceuticals in mixture. However, the combined ultrasound/ozone treatment was found to increase degradation efficiencies for both DCF and SMX single solutions up to 94% and 61%, respectively, whereas lower removal yields, up to 56%, was noted for CBZ. Likewise, when the combined treatment was applied to the mixture, relatively low removal efficiencies was found for CBZ (44%) and 90% degradation yield was achieved for DCF.

AB The transformation of two X-rays contrast media iopromide (IOPr; non-ionic) and diatrizoate (DTZ; ionic) in reverse osmosis (RO) brines during UVA-TiO2 oxidation was investigated. The scavenging effect of chlorides, alkalinity and fulvic acid (HA) was comparatively evaluated against ultrapure water. The transformation of both compounds followed a pseudo-first reaction order, but rate of IOPr oxidation was higher than DTZ regardless of the water matrix. In ultrapure water, 98% IOPr transformation was achieved compared to only 42% for DTZ after a 6 h experiment. In contrast, transformation was significantly reduced in RO brines with only 18 and 9% transformation for IOPr and DTZ, respectively, whereas chlorides displayed very low to none scavenging effect, fulvic acid and alkalinity decreased rate constants by about 50% due to competitive radicals scavenging. The scavenging effect of HA was more evident for DTZ than IOPr. The ratio of deiodination/transformation was higher in DTZ, indicating that the initial transformation involves deiodination, e.g. takes place predominantly in the triiodinated skeleton. In contrast, the ratio of deiodination/transformation was lower in IOPr, indicating that the initial transformation proceeds without deiodination, e.g. takes place predominantly in the side chains. Finally, in both cases, kinetic experiments showed that oxidation leads to iodide evolution without iodate formation.

AB Environmental pollution by neuroactive pharmaceuticals from wastewater discharge is a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. However, the ecotoxicologic effect of waterborne abused drugs remains unclear. Embryos of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to aqueous solutions of 2 hallucinogenic drugs, ketamine (MET) and methamphetamine (MET) (0.004-40 mu M) to assess developmental toxicity, oxidative stress and behavioral alteration in early life stages. The environmentally relevant concentration (0.004 mu M) of both MET and MET significantly delayed blood circulation and hatching time in embryos and altered larval swimming behavior (e.g., maximum velocity and relative turn angle). KET and MET induced similar oxidative stress responses in embryos, which were unrecoverable in hatchlings in drug-free solutions. Early life exposure to the 2 drugs conferred distinct patterns in larval locomotion: KET induced hyperactivity and a less tortuous swimming path, but MET-treated larvae showed hypoactivity and a clockwise swimming direction at high doses. The alteration in locomotor responses were generally similar in mammals and zebrafish. We report sensitive biomarkers (e.g., heartbeat, hatching and swimming behavior) by developmental stage of medaka that reflect environmentally relevant exposures of abused drugs. They could be useful for ecological risk assessment of waterborne neuroactive drugs. The toxicity results implicate a potential ecotoxicological impact of controlled or abused drugs on fish development and populations in aquatic environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Na-montmorillonite (Mont) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB-Mont) and tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB-Mont) was used to remove salicylic acid (SA) under batch kinetic and different solution conditions. The adsorption capacity of CTAB-Mont (202.1 mg/g) was larger compared to TMAB-Mont (10.2 mg/g) under the same conditions. Characterization of the modified Monts was performed with X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, elemental analyses, zeta potential, and molecular simulation by the Forcite module of Materials Studio 5.0 software. The Freundlich isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit the experimental data well. The results indicated that the adsorption mechanism of SA absorbed on CTAB-Mont is based on strong interaction of SA with the exposed siloxane surface and also on pi-pi interaction of SA with the absorbed SA molecules in the interlayer. The arrangement of molecules in the interlayer was studied by molecular simulation and the results were consistent with the experimental results. The consistency verified the hypothesized adsorption mechanism.

AB Three horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands and three sand filters (without plants) were set up at the campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Eight pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, ketoprofen, salicylic acid, and clofibric acid were enriched in the wetland inflow. Three factors, namely, with/without the presence of vegetation, operational modes (batch and continuous), and hydraulic residence time were investigated by a polynomial regression model with analysis of variance, including factorial design, to find the relationships between contaminant removal and the affecting factors, as well as to determine the dominant variables and how each of them interact for each parameter. The objective of this study was to compare the removal efficiencies of selected pharmaceuticals under different wetland retention times, planted versus unplanted modes, and feeding strategies.

AB The recycling of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation and road cleaning is an important strategy to minimize water scarcity in megacities. However, little is known regarding the potential accumulation of antibiotics contained in reclaimed wastewater in urban soil. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of eight quinolones (QNs), nine sulfonamides (SAs), and five macrolides (MLs) antibiotics in urban surface soil in Beijing and Shanghai, China. QNs, especially norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were the predominant antibiotics in urban surface soil, and NOR revealed the highest average concentration of 94.6 mu g kg(-1). The antibiotic concentrations in urban soil in our study were higher than those detected in agricultural soils after long-term wastewater irrigation and manure fertilization. The concentrations of antibiotics in Shanghai urban soil showed a significant negative correlation with soil pH and a positive correlation with total organic carbon (TOC), reflecting the effect of speciation and soil organic matter content on sorption and retention. In addition, antibiotic concentrations in the urban soil were positively correlated with heavy metal contents, likely due to their coexistence in reclaimed wastewater and the promoting effect of metals on the sorption of antibiotics. In several soil samples, NOR, OFL, CIP, enrofloxacin (ENR), and fleroxacin (FLE) showed higher concentrations than the trigger value of 100 mu g kg(-1) in soil, indicating a potential risk for the environment.

AB This paper deals with the photolytic and the photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMT) dissolved in Milli-Q water and in synthetic wastewater. Besides the direct photolysis, oxidation processes including UV/H2O2, UV/TiO2, and UV/TiO2/H2O2 using UV-A and UV-C radiation were investigated. Pseudo-first-order kinetics was observed for the degradation of SMT in all investigated processes. Additions of an electron acceptor (H2O2) and a catalyst (TiO2 film) accelerated the photolytic degradation of SMT for both the UV-A- and the UV-C-based processes. The most efficient process was UV-C/TiO2/H2O2 with complete degradation of SMT obtained in 10 min. The UV-A-based processes have been less efficient in terms of irradiation time required to totally degrade SMT than the UV-C-based processes. It was also confirmed that different wastewater components can significantly reduce the degradation rate of SMT. An almost ninefold reduction in the rate constant of SMT was observed for the specific synthetic wastewater. Although UV-A radiation experiments need more time and energy (2.7 times more electrical energy was consumed per gram of demineralized SMT) than UV-C experiments, they have a potential for practical use since natural UV-A solar radiation could be used here, which lowers the overall cost of the treatment. Five degradation products were detected during the degradation processes, and their structural formulae are presented. The structural formulae were elucidated based on mass spectra fragmentation pattern obtained using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and NMR analysis.

AB The electrochemical degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in both synthetic solutions (CBZo = 12 mg/L) and enriched municipal effluents (CBZo = 60-70 mu g/L) was investigated using an electro-Fenton (EF) process. Different operating parameters were investigated, including current intensity, pH, reaction time, ferrous ion concentration, and the type of anode material. The current intensity, the type of anode material, and the concentration of ferrous ions played an important role in the CBZ degradation efficiency. The degradation was mainly attributed to direct anodic oxidation. The best operating conditions for the synthetic sample were obtained at a current density of 0.2 A, a pH of 3.0, and 120 min of treatment using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode in the presence of 0.25 mM of Fe2+. Under these conditions, 52 % of total organic carbon (TOC) and 73 % of CBZ were removed. The process was also tested as tertiary treatment for a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, and CBZ was completely removed.

AB The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is found worldwide in natural water bodies and toxicological investigations report harmful effects for aquatic species even at low concentrations. Diclofenac is one of the pharmaceutical substances on the first watch list of the European Water Framework Directive. If it will be categorized as a priority substance, emission limits will be established. One of the discussed methods of diclofenac reduction in wastewater are advanced oxidation processes. In this paper, the degradation of diclofenac in water was investigated using a sonoelectrochemical system, consisting of an ultrasound transducer with a frequency of 850 kHz and boron doped diamond electrodes. With the combination of acoustic cavitation and electrochemical oxidation, as advanced oxidation processes, more than 90% of diclofenac could be degraded within 5 min at an initial concentration of 50 mu g L-1. These studies provide optimization of ultrasound density, voltage and electrode positioning on diclofenac degradation. The reaction was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.505 min(-1). Samples were concentrated with solid phase extraction and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography using a diode array detector. The formation of oxidative species was visualized by chemiluminescence of luminol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here, we evidenced the photo-induced degradation of mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, through the 254-nm light excitation of nitrite. The results demonstrated that the photodegradation of mefenamic acid was enhanced, and the mefenamic acid photodegradation rate significantly increased, from 0.00627 to 0.0350 min(-1) as the nitrite was increased from 0 to 0.5 mmol L-1. The photodegradation rate increased from 0.0287 to 0.0512 min(-1) as the pH was elevated, from 5.0 to 10.0. The actual second-order rate constant for the reaction of mefenamic acid with center dot OH was investigated to 1.079x10(10) M-1 s(-1) according to steady-state center dot OH concentration of 3.5x10(-14) mmol L-1 and the contribution to the rate of center dot OH of 67.1 %. The photoproducts were identified using HPLC/MS/MS, and possible nitrite-induced photodegradation pathways were proposed by hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, hydration, nitrosylation, and ketonized reactions. The toxicity of the phototransformation products was evaluated using the Microtox test, which revealed that the photoproducts were more toxic than mefenamic acid for the generation of nitrosation aromatic compounds.

AB This study describes a multidisciplinary approach that investigates the breakdown potential of a laccase mediated system from Trametes pubescens MUT 2400 against several micropollutants including already recognized endocrine disrupting chemicals at their natural residual concentrations (from mu g/L up to ng/L).
   In model solution, the chemical speciation focused on a mixture of 18 analytes and adopted stir bar sorptive extraction with directed in-situ derivatization followed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis. The method's key performance parameters were evaluated in consideration of the chemical peculiarities and complexity of real wastewaters: precision, accuracy, estimated working range extended to a wide residual concentration interval (10 ng/L to100 mu g/L) indicated its fitness for purpose.
   Laccases were extremely active towards all the target compounds, both in term of removal yields and rate. The maximal percentage of removal was obtained for 4-t-butylphenol, 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 4-n-octylphenol, salicylic acid and estrone (percentage of removal above 90%). Enzymes concentration played a central role and in most of the cases, the catalyzed reactions were very fast: the initial concentration of 9 compounds was halved within the first 3 h.
   The laccase-mediated treatment was then applied to a municipal wastewater collected in a real wastewater treatment plant, containing at least 9 xenobiotics as drugs, pesticides, plasticizers and personal care products. Although the harsh chemical and biological conditions of the effluent influenced enzyme stability, the reaction took place, and above 70% transformation was obtained for most analytes during the 24 h experiment. Bioassays were carried out to estimate the estrogenic activity (the E-screen test and the MELN gene-reporter luciferase assay) and the ecotoxicity (Lepidium sativum, Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata and Vibrio fischeri), demonstrating the capability of laccases to mediate an effective detoxification of the wastewater and a decrease of the estrogenic activity.

AB Drug disposal programs have been seen as a remedy to the concern of environmental contamination resulting from pharmaceutical disposal down the toilet or sink; however a thorough review of peer-reviewed literature and publicly available information on these programs indicates limited research has been conducted to validate the effectiveness of these programs at reducing pharmaceuticals in the environment. The purpose of this research was to determine if drug disposal programs could actually reduce pharmaceutical residues in the environment. The concentration of hydrocodone in wastewater effluent released from a wastewater treatment plant in Denton, Texas was monitored before and after a take back program called Denton Drug Disposal Day (D4). Data collected and analyzed suggests D4 events were successful in contributing to a reduction of pharmaceutical loading to the environment; however there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that D4 events were exclusively responsible for these improvements.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiency of seven pharmaceuticals (norfloxacin, trimethoprim, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine) were determined in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic, anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditches processes in Xuzhou City, Eastern China. The results showed that seven pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent samples with concentrations ranging from 93 to 2540 ng center dot L-1. The removal of these substances among the three different STPs varied from 36 to 84%, with the highest performance obtained by the wastewater treatment works with tertiary treatment (sand filtration). Most of the compounds were removed effectively during biologic treatment while sand filtration treatment also made a contribution to the total elimination of most pharmaceuticals. The efficiency comparison of the three sewage treatment processes showed that the STP which employed anaerobic/anoxic/oxic was more effective to remove pharmaceuticals than the oxidation ditches and anoxic/oxic.

AB The occurrence of a broad spectrum of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in raw sewage from a small resort town and their removal by a full- and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was analysed in this study. The MBR systems demonstrated similar reduction of chemical oxygen demand. However, the full-scale MBR sustained higher and more stable nutrient removal (>95% for both total nitrogen, TN and phosphate, PO43--P) than the pilot-scale system (ca. 80% TN and 30% PO43--P removal). Of the 45 monitored TrOCs including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), industrial chemicals, steroid hormones, and pesticides, 41 compounds were detected in the raw sewage above detection limits of 5-20 ng L-1. A correlation between the removal of TN and eight TrOCs (atenolol, caffeine, naproxen, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, DEET, estrone and diuron) was observed. Additionally, the full-scale MBR demonstrated higher and/or more stable removal for sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, diclofenac, diuron and amitriptyline. With the exception of caffeine, estrone and triclosan, TrOC concentrations in MBR effluent were lower than the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Augmentation of Drinking Water Supplies.

AB This study characterizes the extracellular polymeric substances and bacterial community composition of aerobic granules exposed to cefalexin (CLX). The presence of CLX potentially decreases granular stabilities, resulting in a lowered granule diameter. Chemical oxygen demand and NH4+-N removal efficiencies were slightly decreased and the denitrification process was inhibited with CLX addition. Extracellular polymeric substance contents were significantly increased in aerobic granules exposed to CLX. The shifts of fluorescence intensities and peak locations in 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicated changes of EPS components. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed aerobic granules with CLX addition in synthetic wastewater had superior diversity of microbial species, and this was the reason that the level and components of EPS changed. The species richness for bacteria was increased from 341 to 352, which was revealed by Chao1. The Shannon index of diversity rose slightly from 3.59 to 3.73 with CLX addition. The abundance of Proteobacteria significantly decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi underwent a highly significant increase in aerobic granules exposed to CLX.

AB The increasing demand for fresh water has forced many countries to use reclaimed wastewater for agricultural purposes. This water contains pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that remain biologically active following passage through wastewater treatment plants. Run-off from farms and contaminated water from treatment facilities exposes aquatic ecosystems to PPCPs. This study examined the effects of PPCPs on a lower trophic organism. Culex quinquefasciatus larvae were reared in water contaminated with environmentally relevant concentrations of common PPCPs. Acetaminophen alone and a mixture of contaminants were found to increase developmental time of larvae. Susceptibility to Bti increased in larvae exposed to antibiotics, acetaminophen, or a mixture of PPCPs. Antibiotics, hormones, and the mixture altered the mosquito bacterial microbiome. Overall, the results indicate that at environmentally relevant concentrations, PPCPs in reclaimed water can have biologically important effects on an ecologically and medically important lower trophic level insect.

AB This study compared the biosorption of tetracycline, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections, in aqueous solution under various conditions using two brown seaweeds commonly found in Hong Kong waters-Pachydictyon coriaceum and Sargassum hemiphyllum. Two environmental effects (temperature and shaking speed) and two chemical effects (pH and salinity) were investigated to determine the optimal conditions for sorption of tetracycline by biomass. It was found that the maximum biosorption capacity (q (max)) of tetracycline by the two types of seaweed was generally higher at lower temperature (15 A degrees C) and higher shaking speed (250 rpm). The sorption performances of P. coriaceum and S. hemiphyllum were better in slightly acidic solution (pH 3), with q (max) around 9 mg/g for P. coriaceum. Higher salinity (100 mM NaCl) reduced the sorption ability of both brown seaweeds by reducing the solubility of the aqueous tetracycline. It was found that S. hemiphyllum could tolerate and had higher sorption in a slightly saline solution (50 mM NaCl), while P. coriaceum performed better without the presence of NaCl. This study provides crucial information for achieving optimal sorption of aqueous tetracycline using P. coriaceum over S. hemiphyllum as an effective biomass for removing antibiotics in wastewater.

AB This study investigated the removal efficiency and mechanisms of water contaminants (mainly N-nitrosamines) during municipal wastewater reclamation by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) hybrid system. The removal of bulk water contaminants was governed by the microbial activities in the MBR and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the NF membranes. The removal of N-nitrosamines by the MBR was primarily attributed to biodegradation by aerobic bacteria, which can be determined by the reactivity of the amine functional groups with the catabolic enzymes (removal efficiency = 45-84%). Adsorption and formation of membrane fouling can enhance the removal of N-nitrosamines by the NF membranes. However, size-exclusion is found to play a major role in the removal of N-nitrosamines by the NF membranes since the removal efficiencies of N-nitrosamines varied significantly depending on molecular weight of the N-nitrosamines and MWCO of the NF membranes (removal efficiency: NE90 > NE70).

AB This study aims to develop a predictive framework to assess the removal and fate of trace organic chemicals (TrOCs) during wastewater treatment by anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The fate of 27 TrOCs in both the liquid and sludge phases during AnMBR treatment was systematically investigated. The results demonstrate a relationship between hydrophobicity and specific molecular features of TrOCs and their removal efficiency. These molecular features include the presence of electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) or donating groups (EDGs), especially those containing nitrogen and sulphur. All seven hydrophobic contaminants were well removed (>70%) by AnMBR treatment. Most hydrophilic TrOCs containing EDGs were also well removed (>70%). In contrast, hydrophilic TrOCs containing EWGs were mostly poorly removed and could accumulate in the sludge phase. The removal of several nitrogen/sulphur bearing TrOCs (e.g., linuron and caffeine) by AnMBR was higher than that by aerobic treatment, possibly due to nitrogen or sulphur reducing bacteria.

AB Ozonation, solar photocatalytic oxidation and a combination of both systems (i.e., solar photocatalytic ozonation) have been studied to treat a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant containing a selection of six emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, antipyrine, bisphenol A, caffeine, metoprolol and testosterone). Fe(III), Fenton reagent and TiO2 were used in photocatalytic experiments, which were conducted in a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector photo-reactor using solar radiation as energy source. Emerging contaminants (0.2 mg L-1 each), at pH 3, were completely removed by photo-Fenton and single ozonation in 90 and 25 min, respectively. Moreover, solar photocatalytic ozonation treatments (Fe(III)/O-3/light and Fe(III)/H2O2/O-3/light systems) were able to completely remove the ECs in about 20 min with UV doses of 2-6 kJ L-1. However, the organic matter mineralization level achieved was limited (<35% TOC removal) even after the application of solar photocatalytic ozonation, for which an enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals was measured in experiments carried out in the presence of the hydroxyl radical probe p-chlorobenzoic acid. Daphnia magna bioassays were used to test toxicity of samples before and after their treatment, showing that samples subjected to solar photocatalytic ozonation were less toxic (% inhibition <15%) than the mixture of emerging contaminants in the secondary effluent (% inhibition about 25%). Finally, a simplified estimation of operating costs shows some solar photocatalytic ozonation processes advantageous over the solar photo-Fenton system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental benefits and burdens of phosphorus recovery in four centralized and two decentralized municipal wastewater systems were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA). In centralized systems, phosphorus recovered as struvite from the solids dewatering liquid resulted in an environmental benefit except for the terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, with power and chemical use offset by operational savings and avoided fertilizer production. Chemical-based phosphorus recovery, however, generally required more resources than were offset by avoided fertilizers, resulting in a net environmental burden. In decentralized systems, phosphorus recovery via urine source separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials but increased terrestrial ecotoxicity and salinization potentials due to application of untreated urine to land. Overall, mineral depletion and eutrophication are well-documented arguments for phosphorus recovery; however, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily present a net environmental benefit. While avoided fertilizer production does reduce potential impacts, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily offset the resources consumed in the process. LCA results indicate that selection of an appropriate phosphorus recovery method should consider both local conditions and other environmental impacts, including global warming, ozone depletion, toxicity, and salinization, in addition to eutrophication and mineral depletion impacts.

AB The present study aims to investigate the efficiency of on-site produced ferrate(VI) for drinking water treatment as well as for the removal of micro pollutants. The study examined and validated the laboratory electrochemical production of ferrate(VI) and tested water treatment efficiency of the resulting ferrate(VI) in comparison with that of FeClSO4 and poly-aluminium chloride (PACl). The performance of water treatment was compared by the removal efficiency of turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, microbial count and trace organic micro pollutants. Major observations were that 0.5mg/L of ferrate(VI) as Fe was sufficient to remove most of the contaminants and achieve complete disinfection irrespective of the original microbial counts. Ferrate(VI) has considerable oxidation potential to degrade commonly occurring trace organic micropollutants (other than melamine) in the Danube River water. In contrast, FeClSO4 or PACl cannot remove any trace micro pollutants.

AB The adverse effects of micropollutant residues in water on the environment and public could take place under a very low range of concentrations; from several g/L to ng/L. Since there is no efficient unit process to remove these pollutants, efficient technologies are sought to treat them. Ferrate(VI) exhibits high oxidation/reduction potentials and has many advantages because of its dual functions of oxidation and coagulation. Removal of micropollutants by ferrate(VI) was pH dependant and this was in coordinate with the chemical/physical properties of the pollutants and ferrate(VI) speciation. Promising performance of ferrate(VI) in the treatment of real wastewater was observed. It is important to determine whether the ferrate(VI)-treated water contains any toxic or mutagenic substances as this should relieve public health concerns when a new chemical is employed for water treatment. The toxicity studies on the ferrate(VI)-treated effluent were carried out initially via Ames tests and recently via zebrafish embryos tests conducted at author's group. These results suggest that ferrate(VI) reagents do not produce mutagenic by-products for study conditions. However, a recent study showed the formation of adsorbable organic haloids as by-products in the ferrate(VI)-treated wastewater effluents. Obviously, more researches are needed to investigate the potential formation of harmful by-products during ferrate(VI) treatment. Other future work is suggested in order to implement ferrate(VI) into full-scale water treatment and other environmental remediation requirements.

This is a pioneering method for the quantification of acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, atenolol, metoprolol, diethyltoluamide and oxybenzone in atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mode. The method was validated for high repeatability and reproducibility with relative standard deviations less than 10%. Instrument quantification limits for PPCPs were within the range of 0.05-1.0 mu gL(-1), and the method quantification limits (MQLs) for ultrapure water were within the range of 0.3-15ngL(-1). All samples were extracted using Oasis (c) hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced cartridges with optimised sample size and extraction conditions. Good accuracy was demonstrated, with solid-phase extraction recoveries above 80% for most PPCPs. In environmental matrices, the MQLs for river water, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and STP influent were 4-25, 10-153 and 38-386.5, respectively. The method was successfully applied to investigate occurrences of persistent PPCPs in Malaysian river and sewage samples.

AB Due to their widespread use and limited human metabolism, beta-blockers were widely detected in sewage effluents and surface waters. beta-blockers are persistent in agricultural soils that have been irrigated with treated wastewater or fertilized with sewage sludge. It is important to study beta-blockers interaction with kaolinite and talc because kaolinite is a major component of soil that formed under warm and humid conditions, and talc is frequently used as an excipient for drug formulation. In this study, the interactions between metoprolol (MT), a beta-blocker, and kaolinite and talc, clay minerals of 1:1 and 2:1 structural types, were investigated under varying physical and chemical conditions. Uptake of MT on both minerals was instantaneous with capacities close to the cation exchange capacity of the substrates. MT sorption was exothermic and the free energy of sorption was small and negative. These parameters pointed out to physical sorption for the uptake of MT on these minerals. Both solution pH and ionic strength had significant effects on MT uptake on kaolinite, but minimal influence on talc, contrasting different mechanisms of MT uptake on these minerals. The FTIR results showed bands blue shifted for both in-plane and out-of-plane bending of NH2. Meanwhile, blue shift was also found for the 1246 and 1011 cm(-1) bands, attributed to aromatic ether, after MT sorption on kaolinite and talc. For talc, blue shift of the band at 965 cm(-1), attributed to aliphatic ether, was also observed. These results suggested that electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding played important roles in MT uptake on kaolinite. In contrast, the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction were likely the main mechanisms of MT uptake on talc. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a carbon nanotube (CNT) electrochemical filter was investigated for treatment of aqueous antibiotics using tetracycline (TC) as a model compound. Electrochemical filtration of 0.2 mM TC at a total cell potential of 2.5 V and a flow rate of 1.5 mL min(-1) (hydraulic residence time <2 s) resulted in an oxidative flux of 0.025 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2). Replacement of the perforated Ti cathode with a CNT cathode increased the TC oxidative flux by 2.3-fold to 0.020 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2) at a total cell potential oaf 1.0 V. Effluent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and disk agar biocidal diffusion tests indicate that the electrochemical filtration process can degrade the TC molecular structure and significantly decrease its antimicrobial activity, respectively. Addition of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) negatively affected the TC electrooxidation because of competition for CNT sorption and electrooxidation sites. At 2.0 V total cell potential, TC spiked (0.2 mM) into drinking water reservoir and wastewater treatment plant effluent samples had an oxidative flux of 0.015 +/- 0.001 and 0.022 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2), respectively, and an energy requirement of 0.7 kWh kgCOD(-1) or 0.084 kWh m(-3). These results indicate a CNT electrochemical filter may have potential to effectively and efficiently treat antibiotics in water and wastewater effluent.

In general, transformation efficiencies of CECs either increased or were retained at the higher ozone dose. The higher ozone dose of 0.72 mg O-3/mg DOC (Z(spec) = 0.6 mg O-3/mg DOC) was sufficient to transform 21 of the 31 detected CECs by over 80% as well as achieving the disinfection target of < 200 MPN E. coli per 100 mL.

AB Sensitive and selective spectrophotometric procedures were proposed for the determination of Fe(III) and Cu(II) using simple chromogenic reagents. The procedure of iron determination was based on the formation of ternary complex between Fe(III) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-bathophenanthroline (DPBP)-eosin in acid medium. On the other hand, the procedure of copper (II) determination was based on the formation of ternary complex between Cu(II) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-bathophenanthroline (DPBP)-Eriochrome Black-T (EBT) in alkaline medium. The ternary complexes were extracted in the presence of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide with chloroform. The molar absorptivities of the Fe(III)-DPBP-eosin and Cu(II)-DPBP-EBT ternary complexes were 2.23 center dot 10(5) and 9.35 center dot 10(4 )L mol(-1) cm(-1) at 542 and 565 nm, respectively. Beer's law is valid over the concentration ranges from 0.280 to 7.814 and from 0.320 to 8.260 mu g mL(-1) for Fe(III) and Cu(II), respectively. Sandell sensitivity (0.0025 and 0.0679 ng cm(-2)), relative standard deviation (0.257-1.94 and 0.305-1.85), limits of detection (0.076 and 0.045 mu g mL(-1)) and quantification (0.253 and 0.150 mu g mL(-1)) for Fe(III) and Cu(II) ions, respectively, are calculated. The procedures are applied for the determination of Fe(III) and Cu(II) in different polluted water sources, drinking water, river water as well as cooling water and boiler scales. The results obtained are compared with those obtained using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The effects of different tolerances are studied in the presence of masking agents.

AB Digestion of municipal wastewater biosolids is a necessary prerequisite to their beneficial use in land application, in order to protect public health and the receiving environment. In this study, 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), 11 musks, and 17 polybrominated diphenyl ethers were analyzed in 84 samples including primary sludge, waste activated sludge, digested biosolids, dewatered biosolids, and dewatering centrate or filtrate collected from five wastewater treatment plants with aerobic or anaerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion processes were sampled during both warm and cold temperatures to analyze seasonal differences. Among the studied compounds, triclosan, triclocarban, galaxolide, and BDE-209 were the substances most frequently detected under different treatment processes at levels up to 30,000 ng/g dry weight. Comparing aerobic and anaerobic digestion, it was observed that the levels of certain PPCPs and musks were significantly higher in anaerobically digested biosolids, relative to the residues from aerobic digestion. Therefore, aerobic digestion has the potential advantage of reducing levels of PPCPs and musks. On the other hand, anaerobic digestion has the advantage of recovering energy from the biosolids in the form of combustible gases while retaining the nutrient and soil conditioning value of this resource.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as trace pollutants in natural surface water bodies, ground water and drinking water has recently led to some concern. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which utilize free radical reactions to degrade chemical contaminates, are an alternative to traditional water treatment. Anti-inflammatory drug balsalazide (as model compounds) besides actual waste-water samples were UV photodegraded using suspended titanium silicon oxide (TiSiO4) or UV/H2O2/O-2 systems. The photodegradation was favourable in the pH 8-12.8 range. The effect of various parameters such as photocatalyst amount, balsalazide (BSZ) concentration, pH of aqueous solution, irradiation time, addition of H2O2 and temperature on photocatalytic oxidation was investigated. The kinetics of the photocatalytic oxidation of BSZ in aqueous TiSiO4 suspensions was investigated as a function of catalyst loading (2-12 mg/L) and the concentration of BSZ (0.01-0.05 mg/mL) at pH 11.5. The optimum conditions for the degradation of the BSZ have been found as 0.045 mg/mL drug concentration, pH 11.5 and 0.1 g/L catalyst dose. The results indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of BSZ was well described by pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The effect of temperature on the efficiency of photodegradation of BSZ was also studied in the range 278-298 K. The activation energy was calculated according to Arrhenius plot and was found equal to 24+/-1 kJ mol(-1) for TiSiO4. Decolourization and mineralization of BSZ in the absence of light and/or catalyst were performed to demonstrate that the presence of light and catalyst is essential for the decolourization of this BSZ. This work adds to the global discussion on the role of the advanced oxidation processes in water treatment.

The results showed that the total usage of TCS in whole China was 100 t/year, and the discharge to the receiving environment was estimated to be 66.1 t/year. The predicted TCS concentrations by the level III fugacity model were within an order of magnitude of the reported measured concentrations. TCS (90.8 %) was discharged into the water compartment and 9.2 % to the soil compartment. The TCS concentration levels in east China were found generally higher than in west China. In addition, the input flux for TCS to seawater was largely attributed to the seasonal variations in advection flows. Preliminary risk assessment showed that medium to high ecological risks for TCS would be expected in the eastern part of China due to the high population density.

AB Removal and fate of 18 pharmaceuticals of different compound classes and 11 human metabolites were investigated in a subsurface flow constructed wetland (SSF), a pond and a pond with floating plants. Equal in surface area and flow rate, they functioned as the advanced treatment stage following conventional biological wastewater treatment in a municipal wastewater treatment plant equipped for nutrient removal. The influent and the effluents of the three treatment wetlands were measured in two studies during summer and one study during winter. The influence of the treatment design and the inherent environmental conditions (redox potential and irradiation) on the range of compounds removed as well as on the removal efficiency was investigated. This field-site study was accompanied by an in situ degradation experiment to assess the influence of photodegradation and biodegradation on the overall removal of pharmaceuticals.
   In total, 13 compounds (diclofenac, 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (3-OH-CBZ), venlafaxine (VLX), O-desmethylvenlafaxine (O-DM-VLX), tramadol (TMD), trimethoprim, erythromycin, clarithromycin, metoprolol, atenolol, bezafibrate, acyclovir and codeine) were consistently removed in quantities more than 70% in at least one of the treatment systems during summer. In the open water pond, photodegradation was found to be an important process for the removal of diclofenac, Odesmethyltramadol (O-DM-TMD), O-DM-VLX as well as 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (2-OH-CBZ) and 3-OH-CBZ. In contrast to the field-site study, no removal of target compounds by biodegradation was observed in the in situ degradation experiments without sediment additions except for metoprolol. This suggests that biodegradation of most substances is improved by the presence of microbially active surfaces such as those provided by the sediment in the pond and, to a higher extent, by the filter passage in the SSF.
   Low redox conditions (absence of nitrate) within the SSF and the pond with floating plants in summer were favourable for the anaerobic degradation of some compounds that are aerobically quite persistent, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diatrizoate. During winter, the increase of redox conditions (presence of oxygen) in the SSF consistently led to an enhanced removal of aerobically degradable compounds such as iopromide. In contrast, the removal of the target pharmaceuticals in the open water pond was generally lower during winter. This could be attributed to a decrease of photodegradation and biodegradation due to the lower global radiation and microbial activity, respectively.
   Based on the conclusion drawn from the influence of constructed wetland design and season on the compound specific removal, a hybrid constructed wetland is suggested. The combination of an inundated SSF followed by a shallow open water pond would steadily remove a wide range of aerobically degradable pharmaceuticals throughout the year. Additionally during summer, the open water pond would allow for photodegradation and the SSF for partial degradation of anaerobically degradable pharmaceuticals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals in drinking water sources (DWSs) have raised significant concerns for their persistent input and potential human health risks. Currently, little is known about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in DWSs in China. In this study, a survey for multi-class pharmaceuticals in DWSs of five major river watersheds in China was conducted from 2012 to 2013. Samples were collected from 25 sampling sites in rivers and reservoirs. 135 pharmaceuticals were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that a total of 70 pharmaceuticals were present in the samples, and the most frequently detected ones included sulfonamides, macrolides, antiepileptic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers, etc. Amongst these, maximum concentrations of lincomycin, sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen and paraxanthine were between 44 ng/L and 134 ng/L, and those of metoprolol, diphenhydramine, venlafaxine, nalidixic acid and androstenedione were less than 1 ng/L. Concentrations of the two that were most persistent, DEET and carbamazepine, were 0.8-10.2 ng/L and 0.01-3.5 ng/L, respectively. Higher concentrations of cotinine were observed in warm season than in cold season, while concentrations of lincomycin were the opposite. In a causality analysis, the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in DWSs depends mainly on the detection limits of the methods, their usage and the persistence in the aquatic environment.

AB The environmental loads of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in Beijing were estimated from direct discharge of untreated wastewater and WWTP treated effluent. The annual environmental loads of 15 PPCP components ranged from 16.3 kg (propranolol) to 9.85 tons (caffeine). A fugacity model was developed to successfully estimate the PPCP pollution based on the estimated environmental load. The modeled results approximated the observed PPCP concentrations in Beijing. The untreated wastewater contributed significantly to PPCP pollution in Beijing, ranging from 46% (propranolol) to 99% (caffeine). The total environmental burden of target PPCPs ranged from 0.90 kg (propranolol) to 536 kg (caffeine). Water is the most important media for the fate of PPCPs. Monte Carlo-based concentration distributions of PPCPs are consistent with the observed results. The most important way to reduce the PPCP pollution is to both improve wastewater collection rate and adopt deep treatment technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work analyses the presence of twenty-five pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven different therapeutic groups and one iodinated contrast media (ICM) in a Spanish medium-size hospital located in the Valencia Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the hospital wastewater was performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (HPLC-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds investigated. Additionally, the environmental hazard associated to the various compounds measured was assessed through the calculation of the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) Index, which categorizes compounds according to their environmentally damaging characteristics. The results of the study showed the presence of twenty-four out of the twenty-six compounds analysed at individual concentrations ranging from 5 ng L-1 to 2 mg L-1. The highest concentrations corresponded to the ICM iomeprol, found at levels between 424 and 2093 mu g L-1, the analgesic acetaminophen (15-44 mu g L-1), the diuretic (DIU) furosemide (6-15 mu g L-1), and the antibiotics (ABIs) ofloxacin and trimethoprim (2-5 mu g L-1). The lowest levels corresponded to the anti-inflammatory propyphenazone, found at concentrations between 5 and 44 ng L-1. Differences in terms of concentrations of the analysed compounds have been observed in all the therapeutic groups when comparing the results obtained in this and other recent studies carried out in hospitals with different characteristics from different geographical areas and in different seasons. The screening level risk assessment performed in raw water from the hospital effluent showed that the analgesics and anti-inflammatories (AAFs) acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen, the antibiotics (ABIs) clarithromycin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim, and the p-blocker (BBL) propranolol were present at concentrations leading to HQ values higher than 10, thus indicating high risk. When applying a factor to take into account potential dilution and degradation processes, only the compound ibuprofen showed a HQ higher than 1. Likewise, the cumulative HQ or Toxic Units (TUs) calculated in the raw water for each of the therapeutic groups studied showed that these three classes of drugs were at concentrations high enough to potentially generate high risk to aquatic organisms while taking into account possible dilution and degradation processes only one of them, the AAFs can be considered to represent high risk. Finally, the environmental hazard assessment performed showed that the AAFs diclofenac and ibuprofen and the ABI clarithromycin have the highest, maximum value of 9 of PBT Index due to their inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.
   The methodology followed in the present case study can be taken as a novel approach to classify and categorize pharmaceuticals on the basis of their occurrence in hospital effluents, their derived environmental risks, and their associated environmental hazard. This classification becomes important because it can be used as a model or orientation for hospitals in the process of developing environmentally sustainable policies and as an argument to justify the adoption of advanced, specific treatments for hospital effluents before being discharged into the public sewage system.

AB Selected pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, antipyretics, a stimulant, an antiepileptic and an antipsychotic drug were determined in wastewater, surface water and sediment along the Umgeni River which is the main source of water to Durban City in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS) after clean up and pre-concentration by solid phase extraction (SPE). At the wastewater treatment plant outlet, the antipyretic ibuprofen was detected in concentrations up to 12.94 mu g/L and 15.96 ng/g in wastewater and bio-solids, respectively. The antipsychotic clozapine was detected in concentrations up to 14.43 mu g/L and 18.75 ng/g in wastewater and bio-solids, respectively. Other pharmaceuticals namely sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim, acetaminophen, caffeine and carbamazepine were also detected but in lower concentration compared to clozapine and ibuprofen (<10 mu g/L or 10 ng/g). Clozapine and ibuprofen were detected at high concentrations in the surface water and sediment of Umgeni River. The highest concentration of clozapine (78.33 mu g/L) was detected at the business park, while that for ibuprofen (62.0 mu g/L) was detected at the point where a tributary, Msunduzi, joins Umgeni. Metronidazole was only detected in sediment, and caffeine (2243.52 ng/g) was detected at the highest concentration in the sediment at the blue lagoon sampling site. The antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was also detected in appreciable amounts up to 507.34 ng/g in the sediment at the Msunduzi tributary sampling site. The data collected implies that while insufficiently treated wastewater contributes to surface water contamination, human activities also contribute appreciably to the pharmaceutical loading of River Umgeni.

AB Incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment can result in their discharge into the aquatic environment. The discharge of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents into rivers, lakes and the oceans has led to detectable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment in many countries. However, to date studies of WWTP discharges into the aquatic environment have largely been confined to areas of relatively high population density, industrial activity or systems impacted on by such areas. In this work, two sites in the far north of Scotland were used to assess whether, and which, pharmaceuticals were being introduced into natural waters in a rural environment with low population density. Samples from two WWTPs (with differing modes of operation), and one receiving water, the River Thurso, were analysed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, clofibric acid, erythromycin, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, tamoxifen, trimethoprim and dextropropoxyphene). Ten of the 12 pharmaceuticals investigated were detected in at least one of the 40 WWTP effluent samples. Maximum concentrations ranged from 7 ng L-1 (sulfamethoxazole) to 22.8 mu g L-1 (paracetamol) with diclofenac and mefenamic acid being present in all of samples analysed at concentrations between 24.2 and 927 ng L-1 and 11.5 and 22.8 mu g L-1, respectively. Additionally, the presence of four pharmaceuticals at ng L-1 levels in the River Thurso, into which one of the WWTPs discharges, shows that such discharges result in measurable levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment. This provides direct evidence that, even in rural areas with low population densities, effluents from WWTPs can produce quantifiable levels of human pharmaceutical in the natural aquatic environment. These observations indicate that human pharmaceuticals may be considered as contaminants, with potential to influence water quality, management and conservation not only in urban and industrial regions but also those more rural in nature.

AB Pharmaceutical products are a major group of chemical compounds that are continuously released into the environment. The primary pathway of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is the discharge of wastewater effluents. The Psychiatric hospital of Montpon (Dordogne, France) operates with its wastewater treatment plant. We first evaluated the presence and concentrations of 27 pharmaceuticals compounds in these effluents. All of the 27 compounds were detected in these wastewater effluents at concentrations ranging between 37,500 ng L-1 (paracetamol) and 150 ng L-1 (citalopram). The aim of the study was then to evaluate the exposure effects of the effluents on cytochrome P450, GST, and MXR responses in Corbicula fluminea gills and digestive glands. Experiments on clams exposed during 1, 3, 7 14, and 21 days revealed a strong and continuous overexpression of mdr1 (multidrug resistant 1) gene expression in gills and transitory variations in pi-gst expression and GST activity. EROD activity increased also transitory after 1 day in the digestive gland of exposed clams. These results indicated that in the effluent, some molecules have undergone metabolism of phase 1 and/or phase 2.

AB The effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) include a complex mixture of nutrients and pollutants. Nutrients can subsidise autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, while toxic pollutants can act as stressors, depending, for instance, on their concentration and interactions in the environment. Hence, it is difficult to predict the overall effect of WWTP effluents on river ecosystem functioning. We assessed the effects of WWTP effluents on river biofilms and ecosystem metabolism in one river segment upstream from a WWTP and three segments downstream from the WWTP and following a pollution gradient. The photosynthetic capacity and enzymatic activity of biofilms showed no change, with the exception of leucine aminopeptidase, which followed the pollution gradient most likely driven by changes in organic matter availability. The effluent produced mixed effects on ecosystem-scale metabolism. It promoted respiration (subsidy effect), probably as a consequence of enhanced availability of organic matter. On the other hand, and despite enhanced nutrient concentrations, photosynthesis-irradiance relationships showed that the effluent partly decoupled primary production from light availability, thus suggesting a stress effect. Overall, WWTP effluents can alter the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and produce spatial discontinuities in ecosystem functioning along rivers as a consequence of the mixed contribution of stressors and subsidisers.

AB The removal of four pharmaceutically active compounds, i.e., anti-inflammatory painkiller diclofenac (DCF), lipid-regulating agent clofibric acid (CFA), epilepsy drugs carbamazepine (CBM), and broad-spectrum anti-bacterial agent triclosan (TCS), present in sewage sludge was investigated using anaerobic digestion processes in the mesophilic and thermophilic modes. Sludge retention times (SRTs) were set at 10, 15, and 20 days, respectively, for the mesophilic mode and 7, 15, and 20 days, respectively, for the thermophilic mode. The effective isolation and purification pre-treatment to extract the target compounds from the sewage sludge samples were firstly established, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis to identify and quantify them. The removal efficiencies of the target compounds could be raised to a certain extent with the increase on SRTs, especially under the mesophilic condition. The removal of CFA and TCS under thermophilic condition hardly varied when the SRTs were above 15 days. All the compounds could be partly removed from the sewage sludge under the two temperature conditions, particularly TCS that was reduced by about 74 %. Besides, CFA, firstly reported in this study, could be reduced by maximal 65 %. On the whole, the thermophilic mode was more conducive to the removal of CBM and TCS, but did not have a noticeable effect on the removal of CFA. Furthermore, DCF could be better removed in the mesophilic mode. In addition, NH3-N accumulation in this measured range might positively affect the removal of the selected compounds, particularly in the mesophilic mode.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater treatment plant effluents is an issue of great concern due to the negative effects that these compounds may have on human health and ecosystems. The present study aims to assess the capacity of two aquatic plants (Lemna sp. and Spirogyra sp.), commonly found in polishing ponds, for removing six pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and propranolol), two EDCs (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and bisphenol A), and one stimulant (caffeine) under laboratory-scale conditions. Planted and unplanted reactors fed with secondary-treated wastewater or ultrapure water in both covered and uncovered conditions were studied. The highest removal efficiencies, which ranged from 31 to 100 %, were achieved in uncovered planted systems containing secondary-treated wastewater after 20 days of incubation. The results demonstrated that non-charged compounds with a log Kow between 2 and 4 were affected by the presence of vegetation, probably due to their plant uptake, whereas negatively charged compounds were not. This highlights that the presence of plants in polishing ponds plays an important role in the removal of pharmaceuticals and EDCs.

AB This paper investigates the elimination of drugs of abuse from six different chemical classes and their metabolites in natural fluvial waters (nearby the output of a sewage system). Mineralization of these substances and toxicological characterization before and after treatment by a heterogeneous photo-Fenton system has been evaluated. This advanced oxidation technology was able to significantly reduce the concentration of the drugs of abuse in all the tested conditions (different hydrogen peroxide and catalyst loadings). However, toxicological analyses measured as inhibition of fern spore mitochondrial activity, showed only a complete elimination of acute and chronic toxicity when a higher solid catalyst loading was used (0.6 g/L). A lower catalyst loading of 0.2 g/L was not enough for toxicity elimination. These results evidence the need for combining toxicological tests and chemical analyses in order to establish the effectiveness of the water treatment technologies based on advanced oxidation processes.

AB A full-scale hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system based on three stages of different wetlands configurations showed to be a very robust ecotechnology for domestic wastewater treatment and reuse in small communities. It consisted of a 317-m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF), a 229-m(2) horizontal subsurface flow (HF), and a 240-m(2) free water surface (FWS) CWs operating in series. VF and HF wetlands were planted with Phragmites australis and the FWS contained a mixture of plant species. An excellent overall treatment performance was exhibited on the elimination of conventional water quality parameters (98-99% average removal efficiency for TSS, BOD5 and NH4-N; n = 8), and its final effluent proved to comply with existing Spanish regulations for various reuse applications. The removal of studied emerging contaminants, which included various pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disruptors, was also very high (above 80% for all compounds), being compound dependent (n = 8). The high rates were achieved due to high temperatures as well as the differing existing physico-chemical conditions occurring at different CW configurations, which would allow for the combination and synergy of various abiotic/biotic removal mechanisms to occur (e.g. biodegradation, sorption, volatilization, hydrolysis, photodegradation). While aerobic metabolic pathways and solids retention are enhanced in the VF bed, other removal mechanisms such as anaerobic biodegradation and sorption would predominate in the HF bed. At last, photodegradation through direct sunlight exposure, and less importantly, sorption onto organic matter, seem to take an active part in organic contaminant removal in the FWS wetland.

AB This study evaluated the effects of halide ions (chloride and bromide) on the degradation of acetaminophen, a widely used drug, with the UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation treatment. Chloride showed minimal effects on the acetaminophen degradation, whereas increasing bromide concentration reduced the degradation rate because bromide promoted the formation of Br-2(center dot-) which had a lower reaction rate than OH. Interestingly, acetaminophen degradation was enhanced when both chloride and bromide were present in the solution. This was probably attributed to the high yield of ClBr center dot- radicals predicted by using the Kintecus model. Additional tests using five model compounds (4-chlorophenol, 4-methoxyphenol, 4-hydroxylbenzoic acid, 17 beta-estradiol, and bisphenol A) suggested that CIBr center dot- radicals selectively reacted with electron-rich moieties of the organic pollutants. In the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), increasing concentration of chloride or bromide reduced the degradation rate of acetaminophen. In contrast, with a constant concentration of co-existing chloride, the acetaminophen degradation was promoted by increasing bromide concentration. The product analysis showed that the HO center dot and halide radicals resulted in different pathways of acetaminophen degradation. The HO center dot radicals favored electrophilic aromatic substitution at the ortho and para positions, forming the -OH substituted acetaminophen, whereas halide radicals preferentially led to one-electron oxidation and formation of phenoxyl radicals as intermediates. These results highlight the multiple roles of salinity in water and wastewater treatment. In addition to acting as HO center dot scavengers, halogen radicals may significantly contribute to the organics degradation via their high selectivity towards electron-rich moieties. The resultant intermediate products require further toxicity assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climbazole is an antidandruff active ingredient commonly used in personal care products, but little is known about its environmental fate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of climbazole in water, sediment, soil and air compartments of the whole China by using a level III multimedia fugacity model. The usage of climbazole was calculated to be 345 t in the whole China according to the market research data, and after wastewater treatment a total emission of 245 t was discharged into the receiving environment with approximately 93% into the water compartment and 7% into the soil compartment. The developed fugacity model was successfully applied to estimate the contamination levels and mass inventories of climbazole in various environmental compartments of the river basins in China. The predicted environmental concentration ranges of climbazole were: 0.20-367 ng/L in water, and 0.009-25.2 ng/g dry weight in sediment. The highest concentration was mainly found in Haihe River basin and the lowest was in basins of Tibet and Xinjiang regions. The mass inventory of climbazole in the whole China was estimated to be 294 t, with 6.79% in water, 83.7% in sediment, 9.49% in soil, and 0.002% in air. Preliminary risk assessment showed high risks in sediment posed by climbazole in 2 out of 58 basins in China. The medium risks in water and sediment were mostly concentrated in north China. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on the emissions and multimedia fate of climbazole in the river basins of the whole China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although pharmaceutical metabolites are found in the aquatic environment, their toxicity on living organisms is poorly studied in general. Endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHTam) are two metabolites of the widely used anticancer drug tamoxifen for the prevention and treatment of breast cancers. Both metabolites have a high pharmacological potency in vertebrates, attributing prodrug characteristics to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites are body-excreted by patients, and the parent compound is found in sewage treatment plan effluents and natural waters. The toxicity of these potent metabolites on non-target aquatic species is unknown, which forces environmental risk assessors to predict their toxicity on aquatic species using knowledge on the parent compounds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of two generations of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex towards 4OHTam and endoxifen. Two chronic tests of 4OHTam and endoxifen were run in parallel and several end points were assessed. The results show that the metabolites 4OHTam and endoxifen induced reproductive and survival effects. For both metabolites, the sensitivity of Daphnia pulex increased in the second generation. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) decreased with increasing 4OHTam and endoxifen concentrations. The No-Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) calculated for the reproduction of the second generation exposed to 4OHTam and endoxifen were <1.8 and 4.3 mu g/L, respectively, whereas the NOECs that were calculated for the intrinsic rate of natural increase were <1.8 and 0.4 mu g/L, respectively. Our study raises questions about prodrug and active metabolites in environmental toxicology assessments of pharmaceuticals. Our findings also emphasize the importance of performing long-term experiments and considering multi-endpoints instead of the standard reproduction outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present work highlights the novel approach of combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. The initial part of the work concentrates on the critical analysis of the literature related to the combined approaches based on hydrodynamic cavitation followed by a case study of triazophos degradation using different approaches. The analysis of different combinations based on hydrodynamic cavitation with the Fenton chemistry, advanced Fenton chemistry, ozonation, photocatalytic oxidation, and use of hydrogen peroxide has been highlighted with recommendations for important design parameters. Subsequently degradation of triazophos pesticide in aqueous solution (20 ppm solution of commercially available triazophos pesticide) has been investigated using hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation operated individually and in combination for the first time. Effect of different operating parameters like inlet pressure (1-8 bar) and initial pH (2.5-8) have been investigated initially. The effect of addition of Fenton's reagent at different loadings on the extent of degradation has also been investigated. The combined method of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone has been studied using two approaches of injecting ozone in the solution tank and at the orifice (at the flow rate of 0.576 g/h and 1.95 g/h). About 50% degradation of triazophos was achieved by hydrodynamic cavitation alone under optimized operating parameters. About 80% degradation of triazophos was achieved by combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and Fenton's reagent whereas complete degradation was achieved using combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and zonation. TOC removal of 96% was also obtained for the combination of ozone and hydrodynamic cavitation making it the best treatment strategy for removal of triazophos. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a toxicity assay using a mesophilic wastewater treatment plant sludge-based (SI) and a thermophilic manure-based inoculum (MI), under different biomass concentrations was performed to define the effects of diclofenac (DCF), triclosan (TCS), and nonylphenol (NP) on anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Additionally, the influence of DCF, TCS, and NP on the relative abundance of the methanogenic populations was investigated. Results obtained demonstrated that, in terms of methane production, SI inoculum was more resistant to the toxicity effect of DCF, TCS, and NP, compared to the MI inoculum. The IC50 values were 546, 35, and 363 mg L-1 for SI inoculum and 481, 32, and 74 mg L-1 for MI inoculum for DCF, TCS, and NP, respectively. For both inocula, higher biomass concentrations reduced the toxic effect of TCS (higher methane production up to 64%), contrary to DCF, where higher biomass loads decreased methane yield up to 31%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were more resistant to the inhibitory effect of DCF, TCS, and NP compared to aceticlastic methanogens.

AB The usefulness of ultraviolet-C (UVC: 254nm) and vacuum UV (VUV: 185+ 254nm) photolysis for elimination and mineralization of four selected pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in mixed aqueous solution were tested in laboratory batch experiments. UVC photolysis was unable to eliminate moderate and refractory PhCs. Moreover, it was not at all useful for mineralization of the PhCs (<10% TOC removal, 30min reaction) and longer reaction period (i.e. 60min) had no significant positive impact on the mineralization efficiency. On the other hand, VUV photolysis eliminated the PhCs almost completely in a short reaction period irrespective of their nature, and 90% mineralization was achieved in an hour. The greatly enhanced elimination and mineralization efficiencies for VUV photolysis were attributed to accelerated direct and indirect photolysis reactions. Based on the results, it was concluded that VUV photolysis was very promising over UVC photolysis for mineralization of PhCs in mixed aqueous solution. However, more studies are necessary for practical applicability of the method in wastewater treatments.

AB This is the first report of the detection of two new anti-influenza drugs, peramivir (PER) and laninamivir (LAN), in Japanese sewage effluent and river waters. Over about 1 year from October 2013 to July 2014, including the influenza prevalence season in January and February 2014, we monitored for five anti-influenza drugs-oseltamivir (OS), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), zanamivir (ZAN), PER, and LAN-in river waters and in sewage effluent flowing into urban rivers of the Yodo River system in Japan. The dynamic profiles of these anti-influenza drugs were synchronized well with that of the numbers of influenza patients treated with the drugs. The highest levels in sewage effluents and river waters were, respectively, 82 and 41 ng/L (OS), 347 and 125 ng/L (OC), 110 and 35 ng/L (ZAN), 64 and 11 ng/L (PER), and 21 and 9 ng/L (LAN). However, application of ozone treatment before discharge from sewage treatment plants was effective in reducing the levels of these anti-influenza drugs in effluent. The effectiveness of the ozone treatment and the drug dependent difference in susceptibility against ozone were further evidenced by ozonation of a STP effluent in a batch reactor. These findings should help to promote further environmental risk assessment of the generation of drug-resistant influenza viruses in aquatic environments.

AB A method for simultaneous determination of four benzodiazepines (bromazepam (BMZ), carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP) and nordiazepam (NDZ)) and four barbiturates (barbital (BTL), pentobarbital (PTB), phenobarbital (PNB) and secobarbital (SCB)) in river water and wastewater using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-(electrospray) tandem mass spectrometry (LC-(ESI)MS/MS) was developed. LC-(ESI)MS/MS analysis was performed in positive and negative modes for benzodiazepines and barbiturates, respectively, and in selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.2-5ng/L for benzodiazepines and 2.5-50ng/L for barbiturates. Precision (repeatability and reproducibility between days) expressed as %RSD (n=5) was lower than 17% for low concentration (depending on the matrix between 50 and 250ng/L for barbiturates, and between 5 and 25ng/L for benzodiazepines), and lower than 15% for high concentration (between 200 and 1250ng/L for barbiturates, and between 20 and 125ng/L for benzodiazepines). Low matrix effect was observed for all compounds, except for BTL (75%) and PTB (-48%) in wastewater. The method was applied to water samples from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) and the rivers Ebre, Ter and Llobregat, located in Catalonia. CBZ was the target compound found at the highest concentration in river water (2.1-3.3ng/L). In both influent and effluent wastewater samples, PNB, BMZ, CBZ, DZP and NDZ were determined at concentration levels ranging from 5.0 to 2337.3ng/L.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered to be the cure-all of any pain: from headache and cold symptoms to toothaches and even labour pain. Their wide use in human medicine has been favoured by the possibility to purchase them without medical prescription, their low cost and by the absence of opioid-like side effects. At the same time, their administration to domestic and food-producing animals has become a common practice to improve their well-being. Therefore, human and veterinary applications are the main sources of NSAIDs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge through sewage treatment plants. Although their environmental occurrence is well-known, there is a lack of data regarding their levels in surface waters of Central Italy. In this study, a monitoring campaign was arranged in some of the most important rivers and lakes of Central Italy, characterised by a different anthropic impact, in spring-summer and autumn-winter 2012. A broad range of NSAIDs for human and animal use was analysed through a reliable analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, appropriately developed and validated. Results have shown the constant presence of all drugs commonly used in human medicine with a composition that mirrored the incidence of seasonal diseases quite well. A veterinary drug (flunixin) was found in Bracciano Lake (Rome district), an important tourist attraction surrounded by farmlands. Salicylic acid is a phytohormone and this explains its presence in all the analyzed samples. All the results collected during the extensive survey have proved that Central Italy is aligned with the rest of Europe since its natural waters have shown low levels of contamination (ngL(-1)) but with a chronic input.

AB The main objective of this work is the modelling and optimization of antidepressant drug fluoxetine degradation in aqueous solution by ozone/H2O2 process using central composite design. The operational parameters were ozone concentration, initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, reaction time and initial fluoxetine concentration. A good agreement between the predicted values of fluoxetine removal and experimental results were observed (R-2 = 0.976 and Adj-R-2 = 0.955). Pareto analysis indicated that all selected factors and some interactions were effective on the removal efficiency. It was found that the reaction time is the most effective parameter in the ozone/H2O2 process. The maximum removal efficiency (86.14%) was achieved at ozone concentration of 30 mg L-1, initial H2O2 concentration of 0.02 mM, reaction time of 20 min and initial fluoxetine concentration of 50 mg L-1 as the optimum conditions.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is frequently used in combination with ultraviolet (UV) light to treat trace organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In small-scale applications, such as wellhead and point-of-entry water treatment systems, the need to maintain a stock solution of concentrated H2O2 increases the operational cost and complicates the operation of AOPs. To avoid the need for replenishing a stock solution of H2O2, a gas diffusion electrode was used to generate low concentrations of H2O2 directly in the water prior to its exposure to UV light. Following the AOP, the solution was passed through an anodic chamber to lower the solution pH and remove the residual H2O2. The effectiveness of the technology was evaluated using a suite of trace contaminants that spanned a range of reactivity with UV light and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) in three different types of source waters (i.e., simulated groundwater, simulated surface water, and municipal wastewater effluent) as well as a sodium chloride solution. Irrespective of the source water, the system produced enough H2O2 to treat up to 120 L water d(-1). The extent of transformation of trace organic contaminants was affected by the current density and the concentrations of HO center dot scavengers in the source water. The electrical energy per order (E-EO) ranged from 1 to 3 kWh m(-3), with the UV lamp accounting for most of the energy consumption. The gas diffusion electrode exhibited high efficiency for H2O2 production over extended periods and did not show a diminution in performance in any of the matrices.

AB In this study, the occurrence and spatial distribution of 38 antibiotics in surface water and sediment samples of the Hailing Bay region, South China Sea, were investigated. Twenty-one, 16 and 15 of 38 antibiotics were detected with the concentrations ranging from <0.08 (clarithromycin) to 15,163 ng/L (oxytetracycline), 2.12 (methacycline) to 1318 ng/L (erythromycin-H2O), <1.95 (ciprofloxacin) to 184 ng/g (chlortetracycline) in the seawater, discharged effluent and sediment samples, respectively. The concentrations of antibiotics in the water phase were correlated positively with chemical oxygen demand and nitrate. The source analysis indicated that untreated domestic sewage was the primary source of antibiotics in the study region. Fluoroquinolones showed strong sorption capacity onto sediments due to their high pseudo-partitioning coefficients. Risk assessment indicated that oxytetracycline, norfloxacin and erythromycin-H2O posed high risks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Following soil applications of recycled water and biosolids, pharmaceutical residues can eventually enter the terrestrial environment. In vitro and in vivo assays have largely focused on the acute ecotoxicity of these compounds in aquatic systems. However, studies on the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals in soil biota are especially scarce.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the acute toxicity of 18 pharmaceuticals (4 NSAIDs, 5 blood lipid-lowering agents, 6 beta-blockers and 3 antibiotics) that are usually found in the environment by using an Eisenia fetida bioassay. In addition, the presence of these pharmaceuticals in artificial soil was verified at the end of the test.
   Our results indicate that seven of the studied drugs cause acute adverse effects in E. fetida, in particular, the NSAIDs and the blood lipid-lowering agents. Ibuprofen (LC50=64.80 mg/kg) caused the highest acute toxicity for all tested compounds, followed by diclofenac (LC50=90.49 mg/kg) and simvastatin (LC50=92.70 mg/kg). Other tested pharmaceuticals from NSAIDs and blood lipid-lowering families have toxicity effects, from a LC50=140.87 mg/kg for gemfibrozil to 795.07 mg/kg for lovastatin. Atorvastatin, bezafibrate, beta-blockers and antibiotics showed no detectable lethality in E. fetida. The four NSAIDs showed evidence of modification of their original chemical structure after 14 days so the detected toxicity may be due to the original product as well as their degradation products. The three blood lipid-lowering agents seem to be more stable in soil.
   From an environmental perspective, the lethal concentrations of the tested drugs are much greater than those reported in wastewater and biosolids, therefore acute toxic effects may be improbable. However, little is known about the accumulation of these substances in soils after regular applications, so accumulative and chronic effects cannot be excluded. Moreover, more studies are needed to determine the role of the degradation products of these pharmaceuticals on terrestrial toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two USEPA Regional Laboratories developed direct-injection LC/MS/MS methods to measure Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in water matrices. Combined, the laboratories were prepared to analyze 185 PPCPs (with 74 overlapping) belonging to more than 20 therapeutical categories with reporting limits at low part-per-trillion. In partnership with Suffolk County in NY, the laboratories conducted PPCP analysis on 72 samples belonging to 4 Water Systems (WS). Samples were collected at different stages of the WS (hospital effluents, WWTP influents/effluents) to assess PPCP relevance in hospital discharges, impact on WWTP performance and potential ecological risk posed by analytes not eliminated during treatment. Major findings include: a) acceptable accuracy between the two laboratories for most overlapping PPCPs with better agreement for higher concentrations; b) the measurement of PPCPs throughout all investigated WSwith total PPCP concentrations ranging between 324 and 965 mu g L-1 for hospital effluent, 259 and 573 mu g L-1 forWWTP influent and 19 and 118 mu g L-1 for WWTP effluent; c) the variable contribution of hospital effluents to the PPCP loads into the WWTP influents (contribution ranging between 1% (WS-2) and 59% (WS-3); d) the PPCP load reduction after treatment for all WS reaching more than 95% for WS using activated sludge processes (WS-2 and WS-4), with inflow above 6500m(3) d(-1), and having a lower percentage of hospital effluent in theWWTP influent; e) the relevance of four therapeutical categories for the PPCP load inWWTP effluents (analgesics, antidiabetics, antiepileptics and psychoanaleptics); and f) the risk quotients calculated using screening-level Predicted Non Effect Concentration indicate thatWWTP effluents contain 33 PPCPs with potential medium to high ecological risk. To our knowledge no other monitoring investigation published in the scientific literature uses direct-injection methods to cover as many PPCPs and therapeutical categories in different types of WS.

AB Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) inmunicipalwastewater effluents that are discharged to streams are of potential concern to ecosystem and human health. This study examined the fate of a suite of TOrCs and estrogenic activity in water and sediments in an effluent-dependent stream in Tucson, Arizona. Sampling campaigns were performed during 2011 to 2013 along the Lower Santa Cruz River, where TOrCs and estrogenic activitywere measured in aqueous (surface) and solid (riverbed sediment) phases. Some TOrCs, including contributors to estrogenic activity, were rapidly attenuated with distance of travel in the river. Those TOrCs that are not sufficiently attenuated and percolate to ground water have in common low biodegradation probabilities and low octanolwater distribution ratios. Independent experiments showed that attenuation of estrogenic compounds may be due in part to indirect photolysis caused by formation of organic radicals fromsunlight absorption. Hydrophobic TOrCs may accumulate in riverbed sediments during dry weather periods, but riverbed sediment quality is periodically affected through storm-related scouring during periods of heavy rainfall and runoff. Taken together, evidence suggests that natural processes can attenuate at least some TOrCs, reducing potential impacts to ecosystem and human health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater reuse is currently considered globally as the most critical element of sustainable water management. The dissolved effluent organic matter (dE(f)OM) present in biologically treated urban wastewater, consists of a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds with diverse structures and varying origin, including dissolved natural organic matter, soluble microbial products, endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products residues, disinfection by-products, metabolites/transformation products and others, which can reach the aquatic environment through discharge and reuse applications. dE(f)OM constitutes the major fraction of the effluent organic matter (EfOM) and due to its chemical complexity, it is necessary to utilize a battery of complementary techniques to adequately describe its structural and functional character. dE(f)OM has been shown to exhibit contrasting effects towards various aquatic organisms. It decreases metal uptake, thus potentially reducing their bioavailability to exposed organisms. On the other hand, dE(f)OM can be adsorbed on cell membranes inducing toxic effects. This review paper evaluates the performance of various advanced treatment processes (i.e., membrane filtration and separation processes, activated carbon adsorption, ion-exchange resin process, and advanced chemical oxidation processes) in removing dE(f)OM from wastewater effluents. In general, the literature findings reveal that dE(f)OM removal by advanced treatment processes depends on the type and the amount of organic compounds present in the aqueous matrix, as well as the operational parameters and the removal mechanisms taking place during the application of each treatment technology.

AB The viability of a multi-barrier treatment (MBT) for safe discharge or potential reuse of synthetic industrial wastewater was evaluated in this study. The proposed MBT consists of microfiltration membrane pre-treatment (MF), followed by hydrogen peroxide photolysis (H2O2/UVC) using a medium pressure Hg lamp (MP) and granulate activated carbon (GAC). The synthetic wastewater (SIWW) obtained by addition of different industrial organic pollutant (orange II, phenol, 4-chlorophenol and phenanthrene) to the effluent taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used in this study.
   At optimal operational conditions complete degradation of added contaminants, about 85% of total mineralization and total disinfection were achieved after MBT treatment. Toxicity tests with Vibrio fischeri and Paracentrotus lividus sea-urchin (fertilization and embryo-larval development assays) were conducted with water after each treatment step and drastic decrease of toxicity was observed after applied process. However, it was demonstrated that after H2O2/UVC step toxicity of water significantly increased and was even higher than that of SIWW. Novel equation for estimation of UVC dose was introduced as one of the most important scaling parameter. The main operational and maintenance cost (O&M) of MBT process was evaluated in this work. Thus, the high quality of the obtained effluent suggests its suitability for water reuse or safe discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic oestrogen in oral contraceptives, is one of many pharmaceuticals found in inland waterways worldwide as a result of human consumption and excretion into wastewater treatment systems. At low parts per trillion (ppt), EE2 induces feminisation of male fish, diminishing reproductive success and causing fish population collapse. Intended water quality standards for EE2 set a much needed global precedent. Ozone and activated carbon provide effective wastewater treatments, but their energy intensities and capital/operating costs are formidable barriers to adoption. Here we describe the technical and environmental performance of a fast-developing contender for mitigation of EE2 contamination of wastewater based upon small-molecule, full-functional peroxidase enzyme replicas called "TAML activators". From neutral to basic pH, TAML activators with H2O2 efficiently degrade EE2 in pure lab water, municipal effluents and EE2-spiked synthetic urine. TAML/H2O2 treatment curtails estrogenicity in vitro and substantially diminishes fish feminization in vivo. Our results provide a starting point for a future process in which tens of thousands of tonnes of wastewater could be treated per kilogram of catalyst. We suggest TAML/H2O2 is a worthy candidate for exploration as an environmentally compatible, versatile, method for removing EE2 and other pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewaters.

AB Growing concern about environmental issues has prompted the pharmaceutical industry to investigate appropriate and environmentally friendly treatment technologies. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption is one of the most promising techniques, due to its convenience. In the present communication adsorption of Entacapone from wastewater using low-cost non-carbon adsorbent unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) has been reported. Results showed that adsorption of Entacapone onto UPR have some advantages such as high adsorption capacity and short adsorption time. Different thermodynamic parameters like Gibb's free energy (Delta G degrees), enthalpy (Delta H degrees), and entropy (Delta S degrees) of the undergoing process have also evaluated through these adsorption models. The estimated values for Delta G degrees were -11.953 x 10(3) kJ mol(-1) over UPR at 303 K (30 degrees C) indicate toward a spontaneous process. The rate equations showed that the adsorption kinetic data generally fitted the rate equations from which the rate constants and diffusion rate constants were evaluated. However, the Lagergren pseudo first-order rate equation gave the best fit, and thus the process followed first-order rate kinetics.

AB Pharmaceuticals compounds are widely used to maintain human and animal health worldwide. After human consumption pharmaceutical compounds in the urban aquatic environment reach to the wastewater facilities and eventually find their way to the surface waters. Aim of this study was to determine the effects of various sludge retention times (SRT) and hydraulic retention times (HRT) using lab-scale continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for the removal of diclofenac and paracetamol in activated sludge. In order to find out removal rates of these pharmaceutical compounds, activated sludge reactor were operated at different sludge retention times (SRT: 10, 20, 30 days) and different hydraulic retention times (HRT: 12 and 24 hours). The highest removal rates were obtained under 30 days of SRT and 24 hours of HRT operating conditions. Maximum removal of 95% was observed for paracetamol and 44% for diclofenac. The operational implementation of SRT and HRT has been shown to increase the removal efficiency of pharmaceutical compounds.

AB An erythromycin-degrading bacterium was isolated from the activated sludge of a sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on the morphological and physiological characteristics, the isolated strain was identified and named as Pseudomonas sp. ERY-E. In an inorganic salt medium inoculated at 1 % (v/v) of ERY-E strain containing 50 mg/L of erythromycin (ERY), the removal efficiency of ERY as high as 83.7 % was obtained under the optimum conditions with temperature of 30 degrees C, pH of 7.0, and 10 mg/L of yeast as the external carbon source. Subsequently, the ERY-E strain was used for bioaugmenting a biological aerated filter (BAF) to treat surface water containing low-concentration ERY. The influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and air-liquid ratio (A/L) on the performance of BAF was investigated. The average removal efficiencies of ERY and permanganate index (CODMn) were about 60.6 and 26.1 % in bioaugmented system (BAF(2)) and 26.9 and 26.0 % in unbioaugmented system (BAF(1)), respectively, under the optimum conditions with HRT of 4.0 h and A/L of 4:1 at steady state. Due to the stable removal of CODMn in BAF(2) as compared with BAF(1), it can be concluded that the introduction of ERY-E strain could collaborate with the indigenous microorganisms to attain a better ERY removal efficiency. As a result, the bioaugmented BAF method can be considered as an alternative technology for the treatment of surface water containing low-concentration emerging pollutants.

AB A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation efficiency and treatment cost of 17 beta-estradiol using coagulation, adsorption, and advanced oxidation processes. The results show that granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption collocated Ultraviolet C (UVC)/H2O2 shows the best 17 beta-estradiol (E2) removal. The E2 concentration of effluent water cannot be detected by instrument after one hour reaction. GAC adsorption collocated Ultraviolet A (UVA)/TiO2 after one hour reaction degraded 92% of E2. Adsorption plays the main role in the removal efficiency above. The ultraviolet light (UV)/H2O2 oxidation program requires the least cost and has the best removal rate compared with other single processes. In economic assessment, a unit gram of E2 could be removed for as low as 53 U.S. dollar cost. GAC adsorption collocated UVC/H2O2 could completely removal E2 in water. It costs 76 U.S. dollar to treat one gram E2. The studies provide important information about E2 degradation and compare the technical development for E2 removal. Most importantly, this study provides information of process efficiency and cost for industrial application to contribute to the removal of E2 and industrial application.

AB The occurrence of 21 selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in river water was examined; meanwhile the presence and removal of these PhACs at different water treatment steps in two conventional drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) were evaluated. Monitoring results showed that of all 21 target PhACs, twelve PhACs were ubiquitously detected in water samples from the Yangtze river and its two tributaries (Jialing River and Huaxi stream), whereas alodipine was not found in any river water sample. The concentrations of PhACs detected in Huaxi stream were statistically significantly higher than those found in the Jialing River and the Yangzi River because of the direct discharges of uncontrolled domestic sewage and poultry wastewater and the abuse of PhACs in the rural areas served by the Huaxi stream. An environmental risk assessment of PhACs based on the risk quotient value approach indicated that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin and dehydrated erythromycin and clofibric acid had a medium risk, and the mixture of the studied PhACs showed high risk for the aquatic ecosystems. Fourteen out of 21 target PhACs were found in the raw water of the two studied DWTPs with azithromycin having the highest concentration (about 20 ng/ L). Following the conventional water treatment processes, the studied PhACs were found to be removed by an average of 54 and 48% in DWTP A andDWTP B, respectively. Among the targetPhACs, sixandthreePhACswere detectedinfinished water ofDWTP B andDWTPA, respectively. This is the first study in southwestern China reporting the presence of PhACs in surface water and drinking water.

AB The impacts of carbamazepine (CBZ) on aquatic organisms are yet not well investigated. The present study aimed to better understand the chronic effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of CBZ. The experiment was performed by exposing the filter feeding clam Ruditapes philippinarum to 0.00, 0.03, 0.30, 3.00 and 9.00 mu g/L, during 28 days. To assess the chronic toxicity of the drug a battery of biomarkers related with health status and oxidative stress was applied. In order to quantify CBZ in the clam's tissues and in water samples ELISA was used. The present study showed three types of responses on the clams after a chronic exposure to CBZ. For control condition and the lower concentrations (0.03 and 030 mu g/L) a "similar" metabolic state was observed and the most efficient antioxidant status leading to the elimination of reactive oxygen species formed during the metabolism of CBZ. The concentration of 3.00 mu g/L seemed to be a "threshold" concentration, beyond which the concentration levels of CBZ began to exert a toxic effect, compromising the activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, with notorious effects at the highest CBZ concentration (9.00 mu g/L). CBZ also seemed to alter the energy-related responses, especially the glycogen and electron system responses, revealing a slowdown in metabolism at the higher exposure concentrations (3.00 and 9.00 mu g/L). Overall, the present study demonstrated that the higher CBZ concentrations can lead to the impairment of antioxidant enzymes compromising the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, and thus the ability to cope with oxidative stress.

AB Natural estrogens are important endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), which may pose adverse effects on our environment. To avoid time-consuming sample preparation and chemical analysis, estimation of their concentrations in municipal wastewater based on their human urine/feces excretion rates has been generally adopted. However, the data of excretion rates available are very limited and show significant difference among countries. In the context of increasing reporting on the concentrations of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater around the world, this study presented a simple method to estimate their human excretion rates based on the concentrations of natural estrogens in raw sewage. The estimated human excretion rates of natural estrogens among ten countries were obtained, which totally covered over 33 million population. Among these, Brazilians had the largest excretion rates with estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as 236.9 and 60 mu g/day/P, respectively, while Iran had the lowest value of 2 mu g/day/P for E1 and 0.5 mu g/day/P for E2. The average estimated human excretion rates of E1, E2, and estriol (E3) are 17.3, 6.4, and 39.7 mu g/day/P, respectively. When the estimated human excretion rates obtained were applied for prediction, the predicted results showed better accuracies than those based on human urinary/feces excretion rates. The method in this study is simple, cost-effective and time-saving, which may be widely applied.

A total of 105 water samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-TOF/MS). The mean concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals in STP influent and effluent ranged from < limit of quantification (LOQ) to 3909 ng L-1 and 12 to 577 ng L-1, respectively. The mean concentrations of the detected pharmaceuticals in the hospital influent and effluent ranged from 28 to 1644 ng L-1 and 20 to 1540 ng L-1, respectively. The highest concentration detected in the sampling points was 9099 ng L-1 for caffeine in influent STP. The presence of prazosin has never been reported before in literature. In this study, prazosin was detected in all studied samples, and the highest concentration was 525 ng L-1 in influent STP. Chemometric analysis was used to assess the presence of pharmaceuticals in samples.

AB Antibacterial residues in the natural environment have been of increasing concern due to their impact on bacteria resistance development and toxicity to natural communities and ultimately to public health. China is a large country with high production and consumption of antibacterials for its population growth and economic development in recent years. In this article, we summarized the current situation of human-use antibacterial pollution in Chinese water (wastewaters, natural and drinking waters) and solid matrices (sludge, sediment, and soil) reported in 33 peer-reviewed papers. We found that, although there are adequate wastewater treatment systems in China, human-use antibacterial residues in the natural environment were reported almost throughout the whole country. Three most frequently prescribed classes of antibacterials in China, including quinolones, macrolides, and beta-lactam, were also the predominant classes of residues in Chinese environment, manifested as the high concentration and detection frequency. In view of this alarming situation, we have presented that ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) might be implemented in the antibacterial drug administration of China, as the active participation of the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory authorities from the diffuse source of antibacterial pollution. Considering EPV experience of developed countries together with the actual conditions of China, we have identified some approaches that can be taken, including:
   . Focus on education;
   . Further strengthening and persevering the antibacterial stewardship strategies and pharmaceutical take-back programs in China;
   . Designing greener antibacterials with better degradability in the environment;
   . Implementing environmental risk assessment prior to launch of new drugs;
   . Strengthening collaboration in EPV-related areas.

AB In spite of good performances of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) process, permeate from it can still contain refractory pollutants that have to be removed before water reuse or discharge. The present study is an attempt to combine the advantages of two well-known technologies, which are nanofiltration (NF) and electrochemical oxidation (EO) to treat MBR effluent from hospital wastewater. The concept is based on a preconcentration of micropollutants with a reduction of the wastewater volume by NF and treatment of the NF retentate by oxidation. During filtration process the rejection of ciprofloxacin, as a target molecule, reached beyond 97%. Then the NF retentate was treated by EO using a boron-doped diamond anode (BDD). Galvanostatic electrolyses showed that this anode is efficient to mineralize not only ciprofloxacin but also all the micropollutants and organics contained in MBR effluent. The results demonstrated that rapid mineralization occurred: the removal of total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 97% and 100%, respectively, in our conditions in 300 min maximum. The specific energy consumption for the total removal of COD was calculated to be 50 kW h kg(-1) COD.

AB A synergistic hybrid of two treatment processes, managed aquifer recharge (MAR) combined with ozonation, was proposed for wastewater reclamation and water reuse applications. Batch reactor and soil-column experiments were performed to evaluate reclaimed water quality using various chemical and bacterial analyses. The ozone process was optimized at low ozone dose (0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC) based on the control of N-nitrosodimethylamine (< 5 ng L-1) and bromate (< 10 mu g L-1), and applied prior to (i.e., O-3-MAR) and after MAR (i.e., MAR-O-3). This work demonstrates that effluent organic matter (EfOM) and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) are effectively removed during the hybrid process of MAR combined ozonation, compared to MAR only. Based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrices analyses, both MAR and ozonation reduce soluble microbial (protein-like) products while only ozonation contributes in reducing humic and fulvic substances. Even at low ozone dose of 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC, the O-3-MAR hybrid significantly reduced UV absorbance by a parts per thousand yen2 m(-1), BDOC by a parts per thousand yen64 %, and total (I ) pound TOrC concentrations by a parts per thousand yen70 % in the effluent water quality. However, no significant improvement (< 10 %) in the removal of I 16 pound TOrC concentrations was observed for the increased ozone dose at 1.0 mg O-3/mg DOC during MAR combined ozonation processes. Overall, O-3-MAR was effective by 10-30 % in treating effluent water than MAR based on DOC, UV254 nm EfOM, TOrC and bacterial analyses. In addition, MAR-O-3 was better than O-3-MAR for the reduction of fluorescence (close MQ), TOrCs (a parts per thousand yen74 %) and total bacteria cell concentrations (> 3 log reduction). Therefore, implementing MAR prior to ozonation appears to remove the bio-amenable compounds that react rapidly with ozone, thereby reducing oxidant demand and treatment efficiency.

AB Sample extraction is a major step in environmental analyses due both to the high complexity of matrices and to the low concentration of the target analytes. Sample extraction is usually expensive, laborious, time-consuming and requires a high amount of organic solvents. Actually, there is a lack of miniaturized methodologies for sample extraction and chiral analyses. Here, we developed a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) to extract the pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol, as models of basic chiral compounds, from wastewater samples. Compounds were then analysed by enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography. We monitored the influence of sample pH, extracting and dispersive solvent and respective volumes, salt addition, extracting and vortexing time. The DLLME method was validated within the range of 1-10 A mu g L-1 for fluoxetine enantiomers and 0.5-10 A mu g L-1 for metoprolol enantiomers. Accuracy ranged from 90.6 to 106 % and recovery rates from 54.5 to 81.5 %. Relative standard deviation values lower than 7.84 and 9.00 % were obtained for intra- and inter-batch precision, respectively.

AB Predicting the input loads of antibiotics to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) using certain input data (e.g. prescriptions) is a reasonable method if no analytical data is available. Besides the spatiotemporal uncertainties of the projection itself, only a few studies exist to confirm the suitability of required excretion data from literature. Prescription data with a comparatively high resolution and a sampling campaign covering 15 months were used to answer the question of applicability of the prediction approach. As a result, macrolides, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were almost fully recovered close to 100% of the expected input loads. Nearly all substances of the beta-lactam family exhibit high elimination rates during the wastewater transport in the sewer system with a low recovery rate at the WWTP. The measured input loads of cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin fluctuated greatly through the year which was not obvious from relatively constant prescribed amounts. The latter substances are an example that available data are not per se sufficient to monitor the actual release into the environment. Furthermore, the extensive data pool of this study was used to calculate the necessary number of samples to determine a representative annual mean load to the WWTP. For antibiotics with low seasonality and low input scattering a minimum of about 10 samples is required. In the case of antibiotics exhibiting fluctuating input loads 30 to 40 evenly distributed samples are necessary for a representative input determination. As a high level estimate, a minimum number of 20-40 samples per year is proposed to reasonably estimate a representative annual input load of antibiotics and other micropollutants.

AB The present study was performed to determine the occurrence of 64 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in source water and finished water at 6 drinking water purification plants and 2 industrial water purification plants across Japan. The analytical methods employed were sample concentration using solid-phase extraction cartridges and instrumental analysis by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC/MS), or trimethylsilyl derivatization followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Thirty-seven of the 64 target substances were detected in the source water samples. The maximum concentrations in the source water were mostly below 50 ng/L except for 13 substances. In particular, residual concentrations of iopamidol (contrast agent) exceeded 1000 ng/L at most facilities. Most of the residual pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the source water samples were removed in the course of conventional and/or advanced drinking water treatments, except for 7 pharmaceuticals and 1 metabolite, i.e., amantadine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, epinastine, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, iopamidol, and oseltamivir acid. The removal ratios of the advanced water treatment processes including ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration were typically much higher than those of the conventional treatment processes. The margins of exposure estimated by the ratio of daily minimum therapeutic dose to daily intake via drinking water were substantial, and therefore the pharmacological and physiological impacts of ingesting those residual substances via drinking water would be negligible.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical drug is mainly due to several diseases in human and in animal husbandry. As these drugs are discharged into waterways via wastewater, they cause a major impact on the environment. Many of these drugs are hormones; in which even at low concentrations can alter metabolic and physiological functions in many organisms. Hormones were found in surface water, groundwater, soil, and sediment at concentrations from nanograms to milligrams per liter of volume-quantities known to cause changes in the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. This study aimed to develop a methodology for hormone detection (estriol, estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone) on surface and treated water samples. Sample toxicity was assessed by ecotoxicology tests using Daphnia magna. A liquid chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (LC-ESI-MS/ MS) was used for the analysis. The results showed that samples were contaminated by the hormones estriol, estrone, progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol during the sampling period, and the highest concentrations measured were 90, 28, 26, 137, and 194 ng.L-1, respectively. This indicates the inflow of sewage containing these hormones at some points in the Piracicaba River in the State of Sao Paulo-Brazil. Results indicated little toxicity of the hormone estriol in D. magna, indicating that chronic studies with this microcrustacean are necessary.

AB In recent years, it has been demonstrated that sewage-based epidemiology can deliver interesting information on trends in illicit drug consumption. However, until now, no real evidence exists that the measured concentrations of drugs in sewage can be exactly correlated with the amounts of drugs used by a specific population. This study aimed therefore at correlating detailed monthly prescription figures of 11 pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, citalopram, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, losartan, telmisartan, valsartan, carbamazepine, metformin, and tramadol) with measured concentrations of these compounds in influent sewage from five sewage treatment plants in Belgium. For 7 out of the 11 substances, a ratio between loads calculated from the prescription figures and loads calculated from measured concentrations in the range of 0.30-3.00 was observed. For four pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bisoprolol, telmisartan, and venlafaxine), the observed relationship was less pronounced. The manuscript gives an overview of the possible uncertainties that are related with the calculated correlations. This study highlights the need for gathering all the necessary information regarding sewage sampling, stability of substances in sewage, pharmacokinetics, and analytical method performance when sewage-based epidemiology studies are performed.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen that forms in drinking water as a disinfection byproduct. Several specific precursor chemicals present during chloramination are known but cannot account for the total observed NDMA formation potential (FP) in drinking waters. We discovered a pharmaceutical precursor of NDMA with high FP using a liquid chromatography/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/QTOF-MS) screening procedure. The pharmaceutical methadone, which is used to mitigate heroin withdrawal symptoms and is also prescribed for chronic pain, contains a dimethylisopropylamine functional group that reacts to form large amounts of NDMA upon chloramination. In this study, methadone had a molar NDMA yield ranging from 23 to 70% depending on chloramine dose (1-150 mg of Cl-2/L) and was responsible for between 1 and 10% of NDMA FP in most raw surface waters in which it was detected and up to 62% of NDMA FP in wastewater. Samples with higher methadone concentrations had greater NDMA FP. We measured a median methadone concentration of 23 ng/L with a range of 1-2256 ng/L among detections, which was consistent with high occurrence rates and environmental persistence for methadone in the published literature for surface waters and wastewaters. A literature review of methadone use, metabolism, and fate in the United States resulted in a prediction of low nanogram per liter levels of methadone-associated NDMA FP at drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) downstream of communities using methadone. Medicinal use of methadone potentially displaces and transforms the health risks associated with heroin use by individuals to possible cancer risk for populations served by downstream DWTPs. This work is among the first to contrast known public health benefits of pharmaceutical-taking patients against the potential exposure of millions of people to physiologically relevant levels of carcinogenic NDMA in chloraminated drinking water.

AB Seen as a solution to water shortages, wastewater reuse for crop irrigation does however poses a risk owing to the potential release of organic contaminants into soil and water. The frequency of detection (FOD), concentration, and migration of nonylphenol (NP) isomers in reclaimed water (FODRW), surface water (FODSW), and groundwater (FODGW) were investigated in a long-term wastewater irrigation area in Beijing. The FODRW, FODSW and FODGW of any or all of 12 NP isomers were 66.7% to 100%, 76.9% to 100% and 133% to 60%, respectively. The mean (+/- standard deviation) NP concentrations of the reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater (NPRW, NPSW, NPGW, repectively) were 469.4 +/- 73.4 ng L-1, 694.6 +/- 248.7 ng(-1) and 244.4 +/- 230.8 ng(-1), respectively. The existence of external pollution sources during water transmission and distribution resulted in NPSW exceeding NPRW. NP distribution in groundwater was related to the duration and quantity of wastewater irrigation, the sources of aquifer recharge, and was seen to decrease with increasing aquifer depth. Higher riverside infiltration rate nearby leads to higher FODGW values. The migration rate of NP isomers was classified as high, moderate or low. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of levofloxacin (LFX) degradation in aqueous solutions in ferrous ion-activated persulfate (S2O82-/Fe2+), peroxide-activated persulfate (S2O82-/H2O2), and base-activated persulfate (S2O82-/OH-) systems was evaluated and compared. The LFX degradation by all studied activated persulfate systems was divided into two oxidation periods: a fast degradation of target compound within the first minute and subsequent gradual oxidation within the remaining reaction time. Notably, without consideration of the first minute, the rest of the LFX degradation in the S2O8 (2-)/Fe2+ and S2O82-/H2O2 system followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Among the studied activation techniques, the Fe2+-activated persulfate system demonstrated the highest efficacy in LFX degradation, mineralization and persulfate utilization, followed by the peroxide-activated persulfate oxidation. Generally, all studied sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation technologies proved to be promising tool for the treatment of LFX contaminated water/wastewater and, especially, groundwater.

AB The industrial development, urbanization and agriculture play a major role in the degradation of the global environmental. Thus, the wastewater treatments need to be monitored continuously to ensure efficient operation. This manuscript presents an application of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) associated with chemometric and quantitative analyses to study the wastewater before and after the sewage treatment plant (STP). The concentration of compounds related to organic matter degradation ranged with treatment and seasonality. Anomalous discharges and the influence of stormwater on the sewage composition were further identified. All the variations indicated that the employed procedure might be useful to enhance the effectiveness of STPs, plan prevention actions for equipment protection and preserve the environment.

AB Many different excipients are used in galenical pharmaceutical production, in addition to the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Excipients are little investigated regarding their environmental fate and impact, even though some of them are used in appreciable quantities. For 35 excipients used in galenical production at Roche Basle and Roche Kaiseraugst, both in Switzerland, in the years 2013 and 2014, the environmentally relevant properties were collated. A predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was calculated for the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the receiving water, the River Rhine for both sites, based on maximum daily losses of the single excipients to wastewater, derived by mass balance, and the site-specific dilution factor. Predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived for the WWTPs and the River Rhine. PECs and PNECs were compared for the WWTPs and the receiving water, in an environmental risk assessment. Additionally, to simulate a worst case scenario, certain galenical productions where given excipients are used in the highest amounts were assumed to take place in parallel on the same day, resulting in theoretical maximum excipient losses to wastewater. All PEC/ PNEC risk characterisation ratios for the excipients currently used by Roche in Switzerland are well below 1 throughout. Together with the fact that based on biodegradability data many excipients will be removed in the WWTP, this indicates that the excipients currently used do not present a risk to the environment.

AB This study investigated the applicability of bulk organic parameters like dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and total fluorescence (TF) to act as surrogates in predicting trace organic compound (TOrC) removal by granular activated carbon in water reuse applications. Using rapid small-scale column testing, empirical linear correlations for thirteen TOrCs were determined with DOC, UV254, and TF in four wastewater effluents. Linear correlations (R-2 > 0.7) were obtained for eight TOrCs in each water quality in the UV254 model, while ten TOrCs had R-2 > 0.7 in the TF model. Conversely, DOC was shown to be a poor surrogate for TOrC breakthrough prediction. When the data from all four water qualities was combined, good linear correlations were still obtained with TF having higher R-2 than UV254 especially for TOrCs with log D-ow > 1. Excellent linear relationship (R-2 > 0.9) between log D-ow and the removal of TOrC at 0% surrogate removal (y-intercept) were obtained for the five neutral TOrCs tested in this study. Positively charged TOrCs had enhanced removals due to electrostatic interactions with negatively charged GAC that caused them to deviate from removals that would be expected with their log D-ow. Application of the empirical linear correlation models to full-scale samples provided good results for six of seven TOrCs (except meprobamate) tested when comparing predicted TOrC removal by UV254 and TF with actual removals for GAC in all the five samples tested. Surrogate predictions using UV254 and TF provide valuable tools for rapid or on-line monitoring of GAC performance and can result in cost savings by extended GAC run times as compared to using DOC breakthrough to trigger regeneration or replacement.

AB BACKGROUND7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) is the most critical intermediate for cephalosporin antibiotics but has caused serious water pollution. In this study, a bench-scale test was conducted with a novel multi-stage loop membrane bioreactor (MsLMBR) to treat chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing 7-ACA.
   RESULTSThe MsLMBR system comprised a multi-stage loop aerobic reactor and a separate membrane module operated at different temperatures. Results showed that for MsLMBR1 at 15 degrees C, MsLMBR2 at 25 degrees C and MsLMBR3 at 35 degrees C, the average total chemical oxygen demands (TCODs) of the effluent were all less than 80 mg L-1. For MsLMBR2 and MsLMBR3, the microorganisms had better microbial activities and drug-resistances, and the biological removal was given priority to TCOD removal. But for MsLMBR1, there was no significant difference between biological removal and physical removal at the early stage. Average 7-ACA concentration of effluent was less than 40 mg L-1 at 35 degrees C. The laboratory data fitted the simulated data well using a time series analysis model (TSAM) in a MsLMBR system.
   CONCLUSION7-ACA pharmaceutical wastewater was effectively treated in a MsLMBR system, which also performed well at low temperature. In addition, the TSAM was a valid means to simulate and predict the efficiency of removal of an organic substance. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The combined effects of erythromycin-tetracycline-sulfamethoxazole (ETS) and sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST) antibiotics on the performance of anaerobic sequencing batch reactors were studied. A control reactor was fed with wastewater that was free of antibiotics, while two additional reactors were fed with ETS and ST. The way in which the ETS and ST mixtures impact COD removal, VFA production, antibiotic degradation, biogas production and composition were investigated. The effects of the ETS mixtures were different from the ST mixtures, erythromycin can have an antagonistic effect on sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. The anaerobic pre-treatment of these antibiotics can represent a suitable alternative to the use of chemical treatments for concentrations at 10 mg/L of S and 1 mg/L of T; 2 mg/L of E, 2 mg/L of T and 20 mg/L of S for the ST and ETS reactors respectively, which corresponds to min 70% COD removal efficiency.

AB This work aimed to study both the removal of nutrients and pharmaceuticals, namely salicylic acid or paracetamol, from water by the culture of Chlorella sorokiniana. The removal of nutrients was nearly complete at the end of the batch culture; above 70% for nitrates and 89% for phosphates in the semicontinuous culture. The pharmaceuticals removal kinetics were 2.3 times greater for the salicylic acid than paracetamol, reaching volumetric efficiencies above 93% for salicylic acid in the semicontinuous culture. Finally, to separate the microalgae biomass from treated water, metal salts, synthetic polyelectrolytes and a biopolymer were tested as coagulants-flocculants. The best flocculation results were achieved with AlCl3 (95.23% with 200 mg g(-1), 1 min incubation time). However, given that resulting flocs had different characteristics, flocculants must be chosen on the basis of the subsequent use of the biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four typical organic micro-pollutants in effluent sewage were subjected to the various treatments using three ozone-based oxidation processes, i.e. individual ozonation (O-3), ultrasonic ozonation (US/O-3) and photocatalytic ozonation (PC/O-3) under different experimental conditions involving supplied ozone dose, pH value and humic acid (HA) concentration of the effluent, ultrasonic radiation power, and photocatalyst dose. The target compounds, i.e. clofibric acid (CFA), nonylphenol (NP), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and carbamazepine (CBZ), were selected from 11 organic pollutants frequently detected in the aquatic environment through a developed screening system. The increase on the supplied ozone doses would improve the performances of ozonation of the target compounds. Besides, the removal rates of the compounds during the three ozone-based oxidation processes increased with the rise on pH value in the set range (3.7-9.5) of this study. However, the removal rates on the whole reduced with the increasing HA addition, especially during the US/O-3 combined process. Compared with the individual O-3, the two combined processes enhanced considerably the removal rates, by 13.9% or above for CFA, 12.6% or above for NP, over 13.3% for EEZ, and no less than 14.8% for CBZ. The optimal removal of the target compounds was obtained at the ultrasonic power 240 W for the ultrasonic ozonation treatment. For the PC/O-3 combined process, the enhanced removal of the targets was mainly due to the larger amount of oxidizing species generated through the enhancement effects of photocatalysis as the adsorption of the targets to the photocatalyst was far less. The US/O-3 combined process could achieve the best removal of the target micro-pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A heterogeneous advanced Fenton process (AFP) based on the use of zero valent iron (ZVI) has been investigated for the treatment of a real industrial wastewater, generated from a drug manufacturing plant. The effluent consists of a complex mixture of organic substances which are refractory to conventional treatments. The concentration of ZVI and oxidant (H2O2) were studied. The use of moderate concentrations of oxidant and ZVI commercial catalyst led to total organic carbon (TOC) reductions of 70% and 55% of diluted (TOC0 0.1 g L-1) and as-received pharmaceutical wastewater (TOC0 5 g L-1), respectively, with a remarkable enhancement of the biodegradability in all cases. Apart from that, it was demonstrated a notable effect of the magnetic agitation system (speed and size of the stir bar) on the catalytic performance of the ZVI/H2O2 system. The aggregation of ZVI particles on the magnetic stir bar surface, due to its intrinsic magnetic properties makes that the availability of active ZVI particles was somewhat controlled by the size of the magnetic stir bar. For the best operation conditions, a higher TOC conversion was accomplished during the first minutes of reaction, slowing down afterwards, probably due to passivation of the ZVI catalyst. The different stratified layers of iron/hydrous oxides covering the metallic ZVI surface formed under the different reaction conditions were studied by XRD, TPR and XPS characterization techniques.

AB Management of wastewater sludge continues to pose a challenge as its generation is rising as a result of an increase in wastewater treatment and because its quality varies widely. Lately, emerging pollutants have gained importance based on their persistence and potential risk once they enter the environment. Different treatment processes have been proposed to reduce their concentration, such as electrooxidation. Electrooxidation using boron doped diamond electrodes has properties that make them suitable for a wide variety of applications, including wastewater and sludge. Electrooxidation was applied to sludge from a wastewater treatment plant receiving industrial discharges located in Toluca, Mexico. Different pH and current densities were tested at the laboratory and, based on soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) reduction, operating conditions were set at a pH of 3 and a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) during 1 h. Oxidation of organic matter was limited by the concentration of solids during treatment as phased separation (flotation) occurred due to gas generation and additional tests were performed to overcome this situation. 4,4'-(Propane-2,2-diyl) diphenol, Nonylphenol, and 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol were removed by 73%, 89%, and 82% under improved test conditions. Sludge volatile solids were degraded 23% and total COD 27%. Overall, the proposed process represents a promising technology to reduce emerging pollutants in wastewater sludge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The reactivity of three imidazolic, environmental persistent antimycotic drugs (clotrimazole, CTZ; ketoconazole, KTZ; and miconazole, MCZ) upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is discussed. First, precursor compounds were immobilized in a silicone support which was further exposed to UV light at two different wavelengths: 254 and 365 nm. After solvent desorption, degradation kinetics of the precursor pharmaceuticals, identification of the arising transformation products (TPs) and evaluation of their time-course were investigated by liquid chromatography (LC) with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) detection. The three antimycotics displayed similar stabilities when exposed to 254 nm light; however, CTZ was significantly more stable than MCZ and KTZ when irradiated with the 365 nm lamp. TPs identified in silicone supports resulted from de-chlorination, cleavage, intra-molecular cyclization and hydroxylation reactions. Many of these species were also detected when exposing other solid matrices, such as sand and agricultural soil, previously spiked with target compounds, to UV light. The 50% estimated lethal concentration, calculated using the 48-h Daphnia magna test, for the two main TPs of CTZ and MCZ, at both wavelengths, were lower than those corresponding to the precursor drugs.

AB Wastewater reclamation plants using reverse osmosis as the final polishing treatment produce reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC), which consists of high salinity, nutrients and (recalcitrant) organics. The ROC collected from the water reclamation plant in Sydney was treated with a micro filtration (MF)-GAC hybrid system that removed natural and synthetic organics prior to its discharge into the environment. The MF-GAC hybrid system's performance was studied in terms of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) development, and organics removal. These features were measured using liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), Fluorescence Excitation-Emission matrix (F-EEM), and Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Adding GAC into the membrane reactor reduced the TMP by reducing membrane fouling both through mechanical scouring and pre-adsorption of organics. F-EEM confirms the removal of humics-like and fulvic-like compounds by GAC from ROC. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were also removed by the MF-GAC hybrid system.

AB Sericin protein having high additional value in many industries such as textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is always discharged in silk reeling wastewater which causes serious environmental pollution. In this paper, different combined process of acidulation precipitation-ultrafiltration (UF)-nanofiltration (NF) was investigated and optimized to recover high-purity sericin protein from silk reeling wastewater. Inner-pressure hollow fiber polyamide NF composite membrane was prepared through the interfacial polymerization. The results showed that the recovery of sericin protein in the supernatant liquid after acidulation precipitation treatment could reach 72.1% when using the UF membrane (MWCO 6000)-NF membrane integrated process. When the mixture of sericin protein precipitation and concentrated liquid after UF and NF filtration was diluted four times, the better comprehensive results were achieved. The loss rate of sericin protein and the salt content of concentrated liquid was 34.1% and 29.1%, respectively while the conductivity after UF membrane treatment was lower than that of the local tap water. More than 86% sericin protein from cocoon cooking wastewater, refining wastewater and mixed wastewater could be recovered by the optimized UF-NF combination process. Using 0.2 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid as the cleaning agent could effectively recover the water flux of NF membrane. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological treatment of saline wastewater is considered unfavorable due to salinity inhibition on microbial activity. In this study, intertidal wetland sediment (IWS) collected from a high saline environment Was investigated: as a novel inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline pharmaceutical wastewater. Two parallel lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR) were set up to compare the organic removal potential of IWS with conventional anaerobic digested sludge (ADS). Under steady-state condition, IWS reactor (R-i) showed organic reduction performance significantly superior to that of ADS reactor (R-a), achieving COD removal efficiency of 71.4 +/- 3.7 and 32.3 +/- 6.1%, respectively. In addition, as revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, a higher relative abundance of methanogenic populations was detected in R-i. A further 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing test was conducted to understand both the bacterial and archaeal community populations in the two AnSBRs. A predominance of halophilic/tolerant microorganisms (class Clostridia of bacteria, genera Methanosarcina, and Methanohalophilus of archaea) in R-i enhanced its organic removal, efficiency. Moreover, several Microbial groups related with degradation of hardly biodegradable compounds (PAHs, n-alkenes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alkanes, etc.) were detected in the IWS. All these findings indicated that IWS is a promising inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals ate active substances found in sewage effluents and can :negatively impact, aquatic systems even at low concentrations. A fraction of these chemicals can be attached onto suspended solids and end up in sediments. This research shows concentrations of a wide group of pharmaceuticals in Sediments from an urban estuarine setting (Jamaica Bay, New York). Highest concentrations (>75 ng g(-1)) were measured in surface sediments from the inner part of the bay, directly affected by sewage discharges and where water circulation is :more restricted. Only 16 but of 61 target compounds were detected, and those positively charged (e.g., metoprolol) and/or highly hydrophobic (e.g., tamoxifen) were predominant Their sediment-pore water partition coefficients were also calculated far the first time and were in a range between 11 and 2.041 L/kg depending on the compound. Analysis. Of dated sediment cores revealed that pharmaceuticals were well preserved along the sedimentary column, a highly reducing environment. There was an increase in the concentration of most target compounds over the last five decades correlated with the increase in their usage, with some exceptions such as sulfamethazine (now used only for veterinary purposes). Thus, overall concentration of pharmaceuticals in sediment cores showed a doubling time of 9.2 years. Vertical distribution profiles for selected compounds also allowed reconstructing the history of contamination at Jamaica Bay by pharmaceuticals. The use of some of these chemicals as sewage molecular markers was also investigated.

AB Surface water contamination by human faecal wastes is a widespread hazard for human health. Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are the most widely used indicators to assess surface water quality but are less-human-specific and have the potential to survive longer and/or occur naturally in tropical areas. In this study, 13 wastewater chemicals (chloride, boron, orthosphophate, detergents as methylene blue active substances, cholesterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, diethylhexyl phthalate, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sucralose and saccharin) were investigated in order to evaluate tracers for human faecal and sewage contamination in tropical urban catchments. Surface water samples were collected at an hourly interval from sampling locations with distinct major land uses: high-density residential, low-density residential, commercial and industrial. Measured concentrations were analysed to investigate the association among indicators and tracers for each land-use category. Better correlations were found between different indicators and tracers in each land-use dataset than in the dataset for all land uses, which shows that land use is an important determinant of drain water quality. Data were further segregated based on the hourly FIB concentrations. There were better correlations between FIB and chemical tracers when FIB concentrations were higher. Therefore, sampling programs must be designed carefully to take the time of sampling and land use into account in order to effectively assess human faecal and sewage contamination in urban catchments. FIB is recommended as the first tier in assessment of surface water quality impairment and chemical tracers as the second tier. Acetaminophen and coprostanol are recommended as chemical tracers for high-density residential areas, while chloride, coprostanol and caffeine are recommended for low-density residential areas.

AB Organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, estrogens or pesticides enter the environment continuously through the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Enhanced treatment of wastewater (WW) by ozone (O-3) is probably one of the simplest measures for abatement of organic micropollutants to avoid their discharge to the aquatic environment. During zonation most organic micropollutants present in treated WW are oxidized either by a direct reaction with O-3 or by secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot). However, undesired oxidation by-products from the oxidative transformation of matrix components can also be formed. A modular laboratory decision tool based on the findings of previous investigations is presented to test the feasibility of zonation as an option to upgrade specific WWTPs. These modules consist of investigations to assess (i) the matrix effects on ozone stability, (ii) the efficiency of micropollutant removal, (iii) the oxidation by-product formation, as well as (iv) bioassays to measure specific and unspecific toxicity of the treated WWs.
   Matrix effects on ozone stability (quantified as O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures) can give first indications on the suitability of an ozonation step. Ozonation of WWs yielding O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot exposures and micropollutant abatement similar to reference values evoked a significant improvement of the water quality as indicated by a broad range of bioassays. Irregular behavior of the ozonation points towards unknown compounds, possibly leading to the formation of undesired degradation products. It has been observed that in such WWs ozonation partly enhanced toxicity. In summary, the presented tiered laboratory test procedure represents a relatively cheap and straight-forward methodology to evaluate the feasibility of ozonation to upgrade specific WWTPs for micropollutant removal based on chemical and biological measurements.

AB Micro-filtered, biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSE) generally has high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) concentrations. Therefore it cannot be directly used for irrigating sensitive crops. A study was conducted on a micro-filtered BTSE from a Sydney water treatment plant to determine whether the BTSE can be treated using nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) to bring these risk parameters within safety limits. The study showed that using NF and RO alone could not produce the required ratio of SAR. Furthermore, NF alone did not remove the necessary levels of Na and Cl ions while RO did. However, blending equal proportions of NF permeate and RO permeate obtained from a two stages hybrid treatment system consisting of NF followed by RO resulted in a product quality suitable for irrigation in terms of the above mentioned risk factors. Utilizing NF prior to RO reduced the RO membrane fouling as well. Both NF and RD removed most of the pharmaceutical and personal care products from the feed water and this may subsequently protect soil and ground water from potential hazards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and seasonality on the removal efficiency of 26 organic microcontaminants from urban wastewater was studied in two pilot high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs). The targeted compounds included pharmaceuticals and personal care products, fire retardants, surfactants, anticorrosive agents, pesticides and plasticizers, among others. The pilot plant, which was fed at a surface loading rate of 7-29 g of COD m(-2) d(-1), consisted of a homogenisation tank and two parallel lines, each one with a primary settler and an HRAP with a surface area of 1.5 m(2) and a volume of 0.5 m(3). The two HRAPs were operated with different HRTs (4 and 8 d). The removal efficiency ranged from negligible removal to more than 90% depending on the compound. Microcontaminant removal efficiencies were enhanced during the warm season, while the HRT effect on microcontaminant removal was only noticeable in the cold season. Our results suggest that biodegradation and photodegradation are the most important removal pathways, whereas volatilization and sorption were solely achieved for hydrophobic compounds (log Row >4) with a moderately high Henry's law constant values (11-12 Pa m(-3) mol(-1)) such as musk fragrances. Whereas acetaminophen, ibuprofen and oxybenzone presented ecotoxicological hazard quotients (HQs) higher than 1 in the influent wastewater samples, the HQs for the effluent water samples were always below 1.

AB Secondary treated urban wastewater was further polished by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and the water quality of RO permeates was assessed for their utilizations in agricultural irrigation. The performances of brackish water reverse osmosis (AK-BWRO) and seawater reverse osmosis (AD-SWRO) membranes were investigated at 10 bar as applied pressure. The AD-SWRO membrane was tested also at 20 bar. Conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) and color were rejected by AK-BWRO membrane with average values of 94.6%, 95.2%, 85.8%, 76.4% and 91.3%, respectively, whereas the same contaminants were rejected with average values of 98.3%, 98.3%, 84.6%, 69.7% and 86.6%, respectively with AD-SWRO membrane. Except for TOC, AD-SWRO membrane showed similar rejections at 10 bar and at 20 bar of applied pressures. Although their rejection efficiencies were similar, AK-BWRO and AD-SWRO membranes revealed differences in their permeate flux which is 38.0 L/hm(2) for AK-BWRO membrane and 3.81 L/hm(2) for AD-SWRO membrane. An average value of permeate flux was 14.8 L/hm(2) at 20 bar for AD-SWRO membrane. Assessment of water quality of product water obtained by blending of the two effluents (secondary treated urban wastewater and RO permeate) based on salinity, electrical conductivity, specific ionic toxicity and miscellaneous hazards proved that blending of 20-30% of secondary treated effluent and 80-70% of RO permeate is a good strategy to minimize the unwanted components in treated water for its reuse in agricultural irrigation.

AB In this study, a novel Pandoraea sp. strain WL1 capable of mineralizing p-xylene as sole carbon and energy source was isolated from the activated sludge of a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. A nearly complete degradation of 16.6 similar to 99.4 mg L-1 p-xylene in the liquidzphase was achieved within 6 similar to 18 h accompanied by 15.9 similar to 56.3 mg dry cell weight (DCW) L-1 for bacterial growth. A complete pathway for p-xylene degradation by strain WL1 was presented through identification of a major intermediate (p-toluic acid) and final products (2.193 g(CO2) g(p-xylene)(-1) Of CO2 production and 0.215 g(DCW) g(p-xylene)(-1) of bacterial yield). Kinetics of bacterial growth and p-xylene degradation were evaluated using Haldane-Andrews model and pseudo first-order model, respectively. Furthermore, a biotrickling filter (BTF) was employed to evaluate the application of strain WL1 on the removal of gas-phase p-xylene under gas flow rates of 0.41 similar to 1.98 m(3) h(-1) for inlet loading rates of 5 similar to 248 gm(-3) h(-1). The BTF inoculated with strain WL1 proved to be robust against fluctuations of gas flow rates and inlet p-xylene concentrations. All the results obtained highlight the potential of strain WL1 for the treatment of p-xylene. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iodinated contrast media (ICM), which are used for radiological visualization of human tissue and cardiovascular system, are poorly biodegradable; hence, new methods of their removal are sought. In this study, the effectiveness of selected X-ray ICM removal by means of UVand UV/TiO2 pretreatment processes from synthetic hospital wastewater was demonstrated. The following compounds were investigated: iodipamide, iohexol, and diatrizoate. The experiments were as follows: (i) estimated susceptibility of the ICMto decay by UV radiation in different aquatic matrices, (ii) determined an optimal retention time of hospital wastewater in the UV reactor, (iii) determined optimum TiO2 concentration to improve the effectiveness of the UV pretreatment, and (iv) investigated removal of ICM by combination of the photochemical and biological treatment methods. The quantum yields of selected ICM decay in deionized water (pH=7.0) were established as 0.006, 0.004, and 0.029 for iohexol, diatrizoate, and iodipamide, respectively. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that diatrizoate and iohexol removal in the UV/TiO2 process is more efficient than in UV process alone. For diatrizoate, the removal efficiency equaled to 40 and 30 %, respectively, and for iohexol, the efficiency was 38 and 27 %, respectively. No significant increase in iodipamide removal in UVand UV/TiO2 processes was observed (29 and 28 %, respectively). However, highest removal efficiency was demonstrated in synthetic hospital wastewater with the combined photochemical and biological treatment method. The removal of diatrizoate and iohexol increased to at least 90 %, and for iodipamide, to at least 50 %.

AB Millions of tourists visit Kenting National Park (KNP) in southern Taiwan every year, causing great amount of sewage discharges in this area. This study aimed to assess the impact of sewage on KNP surface waters using zebrafish embryo-larval bioassays combined with chemical analyses of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Surface water samples were collected monthly from May to October in 2010. During the monthly bioassays, zebrafish embryos were exposed to the water samples for 144 h. Hatchability, embryonic heart rate, larval survival rate, and deformities were recorded. Larval swimming behavior was also digitally quantified at the end of exposure. Significant decreases in hatchability and larval survival rate were observed at all sites. Both hatchability and larval survival rate were negatively correlated with nitrite and ammonia concentrations in the water. The field water had little effect on embryonic heart rate and morphology. However, lower swimming speeds and activity levels were observed in the larvae, suggesting neurobehavioral toxicity of the surface waters. The general detection frequency of the 28 target PPCPs was 75%. High levels of some PPCPs, particularly caffeine, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), and nonylphenol, were measured in the water samples. Our results show that surface waters in KNP have been strongly impacted by human activities, resulting in lethal and behavioral toxicities in developing fish.

AB The influents/effluents from Calgary's water resource recovery facilities and the surface water were analyzed for pharmaceuticals in the present study. The median concentrations in the effluents for the 15 targeted pharmaceuticals were within the range of 0.006 to 3.32 ppb. Although the wastewater treatment facilities were not designed to remove pharmaceuticals, this study indicates that the wastewater treatment processes are effective in removing some of the pharmaceuticals from the aqueous phase. The removal rate estimated can be 99.5% for caffeine, whereas little or no removal was observed for carbamazepine. Biodegradation, chemical degradation, and sorption could be some of the mechanisms responsible for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The drug residues in downstream surface water could be associated with incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals during the treatment process and may lead to concerns in terms of potential impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. However, this study does not indicate any immediate risks to the downstream aquatic environment.

AB The aim of this work is to use environmental-friendly materials (low-cost) as adsorbents for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents. A really difficult category of environmental pollutants is that consisted of pharmaceutical compounds. Many of these compounds are not completely removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and consequently they are detectable in WWTP effluents, surface waters and ground and drinking water all over the world. Therefore, the environmental impact of drugs/compounds is crucial. Activated carbon is the most promising adsorbent material, presenting high adsorption capacity for many pollutants (dyes, metals etc.). However, the need to turn on more environmental-friendly materials leads to the use of low-cost ones derived from agricultural sources. In the present study, potato peels (supplied as wastes from restaurants) were used to produce samples of carbons after (i) pyrolysis or (ii) hydrothermally treatment. After activation with KOH and modification with oxidation agents, the aforementioned materials were used for the removal of two drug compounds (dorzolamide and pramipexole) from synthetic aqueous effluents. The adsorption evaluation was done with a series of adsorption-desorption experiments studying major parameters as the effect of pH, temperature, initial drug concentration, contact time and regeneration ability (desorption pH, cycles of reuse). The characterization was realized with SEM images and FTIR spectroscopy. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal variations of caffeine and antibiotic concentrations were investigated along the selected sites of the Danube using solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The potential risks on the aquatic organisms were evaluated. HPLC methods for caffeine and antibiotic determination were modified and validated showing good accuracy, repeatability, selectivity, and robustness. The obtained results confirmed the presence of caffeine at four sampling points, near the wastewater discharges. The mean caffeine concentrations for summer, autumn, winter, and spring were 24.78, 26.83, 24.61, and 86.29 ng/L, respectively. The analyzed antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and tiamuline) were under the limit of detection in all tested samples taken from the Danube. The maximum risk indexes (MaxRIs) were calculated for caffeine at each sampling site. Four out of seven selected sampling sites showed sublethal effects on the aquatic organisms with 10 < MaxRI < 100 (class II), while the other three had no potential risk for aquatic organisms. The highest potential risk was calculated for the sampling site in the vicinity of one of the biggest wastewater discharges.

AB The electricity production from waste water collected from food industry, oil mill, pharmaceutical industry, kitchen and sewage have been studied by microbial fuel cell duel chamber assembly. The set-up was fully designed in our laboratory using acid treated and platinum coated carbon cloth as anode and cathode respectively. Electricity generation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of these types of water samples were monitored using only 50 mL of waste water in anodic chamber. All 5 samples shows good potential of energy, which is stored in the form of organic waste out of which, sewage waste water produces highest current density (1.025 mA/cm(2)) and power density (804.0 mu W/cm(2)) at 7th day of inoculation. The highest COD removal of 91% was observed with sewage waste water. The carbon cloth (CC) anode was characterized for Microbial fuel cell (MFC) application by cyclic voltammetry. The electrode shows stability for 45 days with minor change in resistivity and bio-compatibility.

AB In the environment, chemical substances appear as complex mixtures and consequently organisms are exposed to a variety of chemicals from different sources (e.g. wastewater treatment plants, agriculture runoffs). When studying chemical mixtures, there are two conceptual models usually used to predict toxicity: the Independent Action (IA) and Concentration Addition (CA) models. However, deviations from these reference models can occur as synergism or antagonism, dose ratio or dose level dependency. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of triclosan and carbendazim, and their binary mixture to Daphnia magna. With this purpose, immobilisation, feeding inhibition, and reproduction were assessed as main ecotoxicity endpoints. In addition, in vivo genotoxicity of both chemicals was investigated using the comet assay. In the single exposure, carbendazim was more toxic to Daphnia magna than triclosan. When daphnids were exposed to both single compounds, DNA damage was observed. Concerning mixture exposures, different endpoints followed different patterns of response, from additivity: IA model (feeding inhibition and reproduction data), to deviations that indicate interaction between chemicals inside the organism: dose level dependency (immobilisation data) and dose ratio dependency (DNA damage). This study showed that additivity does not rule the dose-effect relation in chemical mixtures of carbendazim and triclosan and interactions between both chemicals might induce generally higher toxicity than predicted based on single chemical exposures.

AB O-3/UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) was employed to degrade antibiotic berberine hydrochloride (BH) in pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of initial solution pH, H2O2 dosage and O-3 dosage on the berberine hydrochloride removal performance were investigated with synthetic wastewater. The optimum conditions of initial pH value of 7.0, H2O2 dosage of 3.0 mM, O-3 dosage of 10.3 mg/min and the reaction time of 45 min were determined and the removal efficiency of berberine hydrochloride (C-0 = 1500 mg/L) reached 94.1 %. A small amount addition of H2O2 to O-3/UV system greatly improved the berberine hydrochloride removal efficiency. The variations of pH value, ammonium nitrogen and conductivity were analyzed to confirm the degradation of BH. Under the optimal experimental conditions, O-3/UV/H2O2 was used to treat the actual berberine hydrochloride wastewater. It demonstrated that the biodegradability of berberine hydrochloride wastewater was obviously promoted and the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to chemical oxygen demand (COD) was improved from 0.02 up to 0.29, 15 times greater than that of original wastewater. The costs of four O-3-based advanced oxidation processes, O-3, O-3/UV, O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV/H2O2, were also calculated and compared, indicating that O-3/UV/H2O2 was the best choice taking into account both the cost and the efficiency. It suggested that the O-3/UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process could not only remove berberine hydrochloride more efficiently but also reduce the costs significantly.

AB The emergence of antibiotics in aquatic environment has led to an increasing concern about the potential environmental risks and the spread of antibacterial resistance among microorganisms. Electrochemical oxidation processes are promising technologies to treat low contents of toxic and bio-refractory pollutants in water. Anodic oxidation of berberine, the frequently detected antibiotic in surface waters, was carried out by using RuO2/Ti, IrO2/Ti, RuIrO2/Ti, and Pt/Ti electrodes. It showed that with Pt/Ti anode, the removal efficiency of berberine was significantly higher than that with the other electrodes. Moreover, all the four electrodes showed 3-5 times higher reaction rate constant in NaCl solution than in Na2SO4 solution. The addition of chloride salts increased the oxidation rate of berberines due to the formation of active chlorines. In the case of Pt/Ti anode and simulated berberine wastewater, the effects of applied anodic bias, initial pH, Cl- and berberine concentrations, and reaction time on the removal efficiency of berberines were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of applied bias of 2.0 V, initial pH of 5.0, and Cl- concentration of 0.1 mol/L, the removal efficiency was higher than 90.0 % after 1-h reaction when the berberine concentration was lower than 50 mg/L. The acute toxicity of the simulated berberine wastewater could be largely reduced under the optimum conditions. Ultraviolet-visible adsorption spectra and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra also confirmed that although berberines could not be fully mineralized after 1 h of electrochemical treatment, most of them were easily oxidized and decomposed by the electrolysis, thus forming some intermediate products with simple aromatic structures. Based on the results obtained, the electrochemical process with Pt/Ti electrode can be a feasible alternative as a post-treatment or treatment for berberine wastewater.

AB Fenton oxidation was used to treat the berberine finished mother liquor wastewater in pilot scale. To evaluate berberine and COD removal efficiency, the main factors, including pH, H2O2 dosage, Fe2+/H2O2 mass ratio and the water flow (Q), were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that under the optimal conditions, pH 3, H2O2/COD molar ratio of 1.25, Fe2+/H2O2 molar ratio of 0.1, Q 100 L/h [with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 h], the COD and berberine removal efficiencies were 35.6 and 91.4 % at initial COD concentration of 4061 mg/L and berberine concentration of 709 mg/L, respectively. The (BOD5)/(COD) ratio (B/C) of the wastewater increased from 0 to 0.3, indicating significantly improved biodegradability of wastewater.

AB Resin adsorption is a promising technology for pharmaceutical removal from wastewater. In this study, polymeric adsorption resin H103 was studied for the removal of berberine from pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of adsorption temperature, initial pH and equilibrium time on adsorption were investigated. It was found that the optimal temperature, pH and equilibrium time were 343 K, 7.0, and 8 h, respectively, for berberine removal by H103 adsorption. The adsorption kinetics of berberine by H103 could be simulated by first-order kinetic model. The results show that adsorption rate was dependent on both film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion, which limited the adsorption rate when the H103 dosage was less than 2.0 g. When H103 dosage was more than 2.0 g, the film diffusion became the only control factor of adsorption rate. The adsorption isotherms could be expressed by Freundlich model very well indicating that the adsorption of berberine by H103 was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

AB Soil aquifer treatment is widely applied to improve the quality of treated wastewater in its reuse as alternative source of water. To gain a deeper understanding of the fate of thereby introduced organic micropollutants, the attenuation of 28 compounds was investigated in column experiments using two large scale column systems in duplicate. The influence of increasing proportions of solid organic matter (0.04% vs. 0.17%) and decreasing redox potentials (denitrification vs. iron reduction) was studied by introducing a layer of compost. Secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as water matrix for simulating soil aquifer treatment. For neutral and anionic compounds, sorption generally increases with the compound hydrophobicity and the solid organic matter in the column system. Organic cations showed the highest attenuation. Among them, breakthroughs were only registered for the cationic beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol. An enhanced degradation in the columns with organic infiltration layer was observed for the majority of the compounds, suggesting an improved degradation for higher levels of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. Solely the degradation of sulfamethoxazole could clearly be attributed to redox effects (when reaching iron reducing conditions). The study provides valuable insights into the attenuation potential for a wide spectrum of organic micropollutants under realistic soil aquifer treatment conditions. Furthermore, the introduction of the compost layer generally showed positive effects on the removal of compounds preferentially degraded under reducing conditions and also increases the residence times in the soil aquifer treatment system via sorption.

AB Contaminant exposure in aqueous systems typically involves complex chemical mixtures. Given the large number of compounds present in the environment, it is critical to identify hazardous chemical interactions rapidly. The present study utilized a prototype for a novel high-throughput assay to quantify behavioral changes over time to identify chemical interactions that affect toxicity. The independent and combined effects of 2 chemicals, diazinon (an insecticide) and 4-nonylphenol (a detergent metabolite), on the swimming behavior of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex were examined. Cumulative distance and change in direction were measured repeatedly via optical tracking over 90min. Exposure to low concentrations of diazinon (0.125-2 mu M) or 4-nonylphenol (0.25-4 mu M) elicited significant concentration- and time-dependent effects on swimming behavior. Exposure to 0.5 mu M 4-nonylphenol alone did not significantly alter mean cumulative distance but did elicit a small, significant increase in mean angle, the measure of change in direction. When 0.5 mu M 4-nonylphenol was used in combination with diazinon (0.125-0.5 mu M), it augmented the adverse impact of diazinon on the swimming behavior of Daphnia. Additionally, enhanced sensitivity to diazinon was observed in animals exposed to treated wastewater effluent for 24h prior to a diazinon challenge. The present experiments demonstrate that exposure to 4-nonylphenol and complex chemical mixtures (e.g., treated wastewater) can enhance the toxicity of exposure to the insecticide diazinon.

AB The elimination of five selected emerging contaminants (1-H-benzotriazole, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), chlorophene, 3-methylindole, and nortriptyline HCl) dissolved in different water matrices (surface water and secondary effluents) was carried out by sequential membrane filtration and chemical oxidation processes. First, a membrane filtration (ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration(NF)) pre-treatment was conducted, and both permeate and retentate were afterwards treated by chemical oxidation, using ozone or chlorine. The application of UF and especially of NF provided a large volume of permeate, whose quality can be improved by a chemical treatment to completely remove residual contaminants except 1-H-benzotriazole. Chlorination and especially ozonation have demonstrated to be effective for the reduction of emerging contaminants in the concentrated stream, thus generating an effluent that might be recycled to the activated sludge treatment in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In a second group of experiments, a chemical oxidation pre-treatment (by using ozone, chlorine, O-3/H2O2, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or UV/H2O2) was applied followed by a nanofiltration process. Results of removals and rejection coefficients for the emerging contaminants showed that the chemical pre-treatment exerted a positive influence on the subsequent NF process, not only in terms of ECs removal but also of dissolved organic carbon content (DOC) reduction. While global removals higher than 97% were reached for DEET, chlorophene, 3-methylindole, and nortriptyline HCl, lower values were obtained for 1-H-benzotriazole, especially for chlorine pre-treatment and in those water matrices with high content of natural organic matter. Therefore, both sequential treatments are promising to remove the selected micropollutants while reducing the chlorine doses needed to achieve final water disinfection.

AB In this work, we investigated the emerging pollutants in Taiwanese groundwater for the first time and correlated their presence with possible contamination sources. Fifty target pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated chemicals in groundwater were mostly present at ng L-1 concentrations, except for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen (maximums of 1822, 1820, and 1036 ng L-1, respectively). Perfluorinated compounds were detected with the highest frequencies in groundwater at almost all of the sample sites, especially short-chained perfluorinated carboxylates, which were easily transferred to the groundwater. The results indicate that the compounds found to have high detection frequencies and concentrations in groundwater are similar to those found in other countries around the world. Most common pharmaceuticals that contain hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonamide antibiotics and caffeine, are easily transported through surface waters to groundwater. The results also indicated that the persistent natures of emerging contaminants with high detection frequencies in surface water and groundwater, such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (risk quotient >1), caffeine, and carbamazepine, should be further studied and evaluated.

AB Landfill leachate samples (n = 11) were collected from five USA municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and analyzed for ten trace organic pollutants that are commonly detected in surface and municipal wastewater effluents (viz., carbamazepine, DEET, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, PFOA, PFOS, primidone, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim). Carbamazepine, DEET, PFOA and primidone were detected in all leachate samples analyzed and gemfibrozil was detected in samples from four of the five-landfill sites. The contaminants found in the highest concentrations were DEET (6900-143 000 ng L-1) and sucralose (<10-621 000 ng L-1). Several compounds were not detected (fluoxetine) or detected infrequently (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and PFOS). Using the average mass of DEET in leachate amongst the five landfills and scaling the mass release from the five test landfills to the USA population of landfills, an order of magnitude estimate is that over 10 000 kg DEET yr(-1) may be released in leachate. Some pharmaceuticals have similar annual mean discharges to one another, with the estimated annual discharge of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, primidone equating to 53, 151 and 128 kg year(-1). To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that primidone has been included in a landfill leachate study. While the estimates developed in this study are order of magnitude, the values do suggest the need for further research to better quantify the amount of chemicals sent to wastewater treatment facilities with landfill leachate, potential impacts on treatment processes and the significance of landfill leachate as a source of surface water contamination.

AB Direct CO2 emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are commonly excluded from the greenhouse gas emission inventory as proposed by the International Panel on Climate Change, should be partly taken into consideration, because some of the fossil organic carbons (i.e. detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals) are also biodegradable, leading to the emission of CO2 during wastewater treatment. For the purpose of understanding the characteristics of direct CO2 emissions during biological nutrient removal from urban WWTPs, we investigated four different processes. Full-scale tests were carried out continuously during a two-year period, consisting of the anoxic/anaerobic/oxic (A(2)O) process, the anoxic/oxic (AO) process, the oxidation ditch, and the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) processes. Our experimental results show large differences in CO2 fluxes in the various treatment tanks (or periods), e.g. the aerated units/periods in four different WWTPs all contributed more than 96.0% of the entire direct CO2 emission caused by aerobic respiration and aeration stripping. On the other hand, CO2 emissions from non-aerated areas were quite low giving rise to small amounts of CO2 emissions during anaerobic metabolism. The direct emission of CO2 when treating per m(3) wastewater (g CO2/m(3) wastewater) corresponded with the following descending order among the four processes: SBR (347.34) > oxidation ditch (343.78) > A(2)O (175.68) > AO (173.37). However, this order changed into SBR (0.97) > oxidation ditch (0.76) > AO (0.68) > A(2)O (0.58) when treating per kilogram COD (kg CO2/kg COD).

AB This study was designed to analyze pharmaceuticals removal using biological sewage and wastewater treatment processes. Since pharmaceutical removal efficiency in a bioreactor was very low, it was determined that removing pharmaceuticals using biological treatment alone is very difficult. Thus, it attempted to identify the pharmaceutical removal characteristics with main physical and chemical processes such as coagulation sedimentation, ozonation, activated carbon treatment, and chlorine disinfection process as targets. The removal efficiency by coagulation and sedimentation turned out to be highest in atenolol with 16%. Other substances exhibited low removal rates regardless of coagulant dosage. Results of the batch test in which 30 mg/L of ozone was injected stepwise showed that diclofenac and trimethoprim showed a 95% removal rate at an ozone concentration of 5 mg/L, while iopromide with the lowest processing efficiency exhibited a 90% removal rate at a high ozone concentration of 30 mg/L. The same trend was found in the activated carbon adsorption process in that substances such as iopromide and mefenamic acid showed satisfactory removal rates at EBCT = 15 min.

AB Amantadine wastewater is quite recalcitrant to biological treatment because of the quite stable adamantine backbone. To improve amantadine wastewater biodegradability, the combined advanced oxidation process, such as Fenton/ultrasonic process, was proposed to treat amantadine industrial wastewater. The efficiency comparisons for the treatment of amantadine wastewater using Fenton oxidation, ultrasonic process, and Fenton/ultrasonic process were conducted. The results of wastewater treatment with Fenton/ultrasonic process indicated that the TOC removal reached 65.6 %, showing almost 4 times of the degradation rate by individual oxidizing action of hydrogen peroxide. Kinetic study revealed that degradation of amantadine wastewater fitted first order kinetics for the three processes under investigation. The synergistic index (f) for the combined process was calculated as 2.24, indicating an obvious synergy effect. The energy consumption for hydrodynamic cavitation-based process has been analyzed on the basis of cavitational yield. Fenton and combined processes reduced the toxicity of wastewater by 50 and 55 %, respectively, while ultrasonic process showed no obvious effect on toxicity reduction. The monitoring of treated wastewater by EEM and GC-MS showed that the Fenton/ultrasonic process effectively removed the organic matters in the wastewater, especially the biodegradation-resistant matters containing benzene ring.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater contains large amounts of high concentration refractory organic intermediates, which have got potential hazards to human health and the environment. It has attracted great attention from the governments, the public and the researchers. In this context, understanding current state of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment research can help guide future research. A bibliometric analysis based on the science citation index expanded from web of science (WoS) was carried out to assess the research pattern and tendencies of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment from 1994 to 2013. Study emphases herein included performance of publication covering annual outputs, mainstream journals, WoS categories, leading countries, institutions, research tendencies and hotspots. The results showed that the annual output of related scientific articles had increased steadily, with approximately 88 % of all articles on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment during 1994-2013 published since 2003. Water research, chemosphere and environmental science and technology were the three most common journals in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment research. The United States takes the dominant position in this field, followed by Spain and Germany. A summary of the most frequently used keywords obtained from words in paper title analysis, author keyword analysis and keywords plus analysis provided the clues to discover current research emphases. The mainstream research related to pharmaceutical wastewater was on wastewater treatment methods and the related contaminants. Adsorption, ozonation and photocatalysis were common treatment techniques and are getting popular. The commonly researched pharmaceutical wastewater contaminants were carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and triclosan, which have emerged as the frequently studied contaminants in recent years.

AB Nineteen biocides were investigated in the Yangtze River to understand their spatiotemporal distribution, mass loads and ecological risks. Fourteen biocides were detected, with the highest concentrations up to 166 ng/L for DEET in surface water, and 54.3 ng/g dry weight (dw) for triclocarban in sediment The dominant biocides were DEET and methylparaben, with their detection frequencies of 100% in both phases. An estimate of 152 t/y of 14 biocides was carried by the Yangtze River to the East China Sea. The distribution of biocides in the aquatic environments was significantly correlated to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN), suggesting dominant input sources from domestic wastewater of the cities along the river. Risk assessment showed high ecological risks posed by carbendazim in both phases and by triclosan in sediment Therefore, proper measures should be taken to reduce the input of biocides into the river systems.

AB This manuscript reports a 3-year study on occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and triclosan in surface waters of a central urban region of So Paulo State of Southeast Brazil (the Monjolinho River in So Carlos). Water samples collected once at every 2 months were pre-concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The most frequently detected compounds in higher concentrations were caffeine, paracetamol, and atenolol (maximum concentrations 129,585, 30,421, and 8199 ng L-1, respectively), while hormones estrone and 17-beta-estradiol were the least detected, in levels up to 14.8 ng L-1. There was an increasing trend in concentrations of most of the compounds along the river course, especially downstream of the river where there is discharge of both wastewater treatment plant effluent and raw sewage from a particular region of So Carlos city. Concentrations of contaminants were higher during dry periods as a result of decline in the water levels. Decrease in concentrations near the river mouth occurred to different extents for each compound. It was high for caffeine and atenolol, but was very low for carbamazepine and diclofenac. The present study reports the first data about the occurrence of some major emerging contaminants in the Monjolinho River. Besides its regional significance, this work may assist in composing a dataset for water contamination diagnosis focusing on emerging contaminants, both in the Brazilian as well as in the Global studies related to aquatic ecosystems. Such datasets can be helpful for making future public policies on water quality, since these compounds are not yet legally regulated.

AB The contamination of major continental river systems by endocrine-active chemicals (EACs) derived from the discharge of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can affect human and ecosystem health. As part of a long-term effort to develop a native fish model organism for assessment of endocrine disruption in Australia's largest watershed, the Murray-Darling River Basin, the present study evaluated endocrine disruption in adult males of the native Australian Murray rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) exposed to effluent from an activated sludge WWTP and water from the Murray River during a 28-d, continuous-flow, on-site experiment. Analysis of the WWTP effluent and river water detected estrone and 17-estradiol at concentrations up to approximately 25ngL(-1). Anti-estrogenicity of effluent samples was detected in vitro using yeast-based bioassays (yeast estrogen screen) throughout the experiment, but estrogenicity was limited to the first week of the experiment. Histological evaluation of the testes indicated significant suppression of spermatogenesis by WWTP effluent after 28d of exposure. Plasma vitellogenin concentrations and expression of vitellogenin messenger RNA in liver were not significantly affected by exposure to WWTP effluent. The combination of low contaminant concentrations in the WWTP effluent, limited endocrine disrupting effects in the Murray rainbowfish, and high in-stream dilution factors (>99%) suggest minimal endocrine disruption impacts on native Australian fish in the Murray River downstream from the WWTP outfall.

AB The fates of psychoactive pharmaceuticals, including two antischizophrenics, six sedative-hypnotic-anxiolytics, four antidepressants, four antihypertensives, and their select metabolites, were determined in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Albany area of New York. All target psychoactive pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were found at a mean concentration that ranged from 0.98 (quetiapine) to 1220 ng/L (atenolol) in wastewater and from 0.26 (lorazepam) to 1490 ng/g dry weight (sertraline) in sludge. In this study, the fraction of psychoactive pharmaceuticals that was sorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) was calculated for the first time. Over 50% of the total mass of aripiprazole, norquetiapine, norsertraline, citalopram, desmethyl citalopram, propranolol, verapamil, and norverapamil was found sorbed to SPM in the influent. The mass loadings, i.e., influx, of target psychoactive pharmaceuticals in WWTPs ranged from 0.91 (diazepam) to 347 mg/d/1000 inhabitants (atenolol), whereas the environmental emissions ranged from 0.01 (dehydro-aripiprazole) to 316 mg/d/1000 inhabitants (atenolol). The highest calculated removal efficiencies were found for antischizophrenics (quetiapine = 88%; aripiprazole = 71%). However, the removal of some psychoactive pharmaceuticals through adsorption onto sludge was minimal (<1% of the initial mass load), which suggests that bio-degradation and/or chemical-transformation are the dominant mechanisms of removal of these pharmaceuticals in WWTPs.

AB The use of caffeine, nicotine and some major metabolites was investigated by wastewater analysis in 13 sewage treatment plants (STPs) across Italy, and their suitability was tested as qualitative and quantitative biomarkers for assessing population size and dynamics. A specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. All these compounds were found widely at the mu g/L level. Mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. Some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of Italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. There were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. Most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. Nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. Caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. This exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The anti-gout agent allopurinol is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in Germany and is widely metabolized into oxypurinol (80%) as well as the corresponding riboside conjugates (10%) within the human body. To investigate the occurrence of allopurinol and oxypurinol in the urban water cycle an analytical method was developed based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   In raw wastewater concentration levels of oxypurinol ranged up to 26.6 mu g L-1, whereas allopurinol was not detected at all. In wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, concentrations of allopurinol were <LOQ, whereas oxypurinol concentrations ranged from 2.3 mu g L-1 to 21.7 mu g L-1. Elevated concentrations of oxypurinol in biologically treated wastewater originate from the transformation of allopurinol as well as the cleavage of allopurinol-9-riboside, which was confirmed by laboratory experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal WWTP.
   Further tracking of oxypurinol in the urban water cycle revealed its presence in rivers and streams (up to 22.6 mu g L-1), groundwater (up to 0.38 mu g L-1) as well as in finished drinking water (up to 0.30 mu g L-1). Due to the high biological stability and the almost ubiquitous presence in the urban water cycle at elevated concentrations, oxypurinol might be used as marker for domestic wastewater in the environment. This was confirmed by correlation analysis to other wastewater markers with strong correlations of the concentrations of oxypurinol and carbamazepine (r(2) = 0.89) as well as of oxypurinol and primidone (r(2) = 0.82).

AB With growing water scarcity worldwide, reclaimed wastewater is an increasingly attractive option for meeting household water demand, especially in urban areas. However, reluctance by households to use treated wastewater persists. In this article, we discuss the 'yuck factor,' health risk concerns, and cost considerations, which are key obstacles to wastewater reuse by households. We then summarize successful and unsuccessful case studies of wastewater reuse around the world. Reasons for the success (or failure) of each case study draws upon unique contextual, historical, and cultural circumstances. Direct potable reuse-where purified wastewater is added to the potable water supply directly-is rare; most successful projects are nonpotable wastewater reuse schemes-where purified water is placed into an environmental buffer before entering a drinking water distribution system. Our review of experiences around the world suggests approaches for improving public acceptability of wastewater reuse schemes. The literature also suggests that there is an urgent need to collect more wastewater treatment and reuse data, to research ways of better assessing and reducing health risk associated with emerging pollutants in reclaimed wastewater, and to better price both drinking water and recycled wastewater.

AB The performance of a full-scale riverbank filtration facility in Colorado was evaluated from initial start-up over a period of seven years including the impact of seasonal variations to determine whether sustainable attenuation of various chemical constituents could be achieved. Both, annual and seasonal average concentrations were determined for several wastewater-derived constituents including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, nitrate, phosphate for the years 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, and trace organic chemicals (TOrC) for years 2009, 2010, and 2012. ANOVA analyses and Student's t-tests were performed to evaluate the consistency of contaminant attenuation at the site. Findings revealed no significant statistical differences for any of the bulk parameters with the exception of phosphate suggesting a highly reliable attenuation of DOC and nitrate from start-up to full-scale performance. Phosphate attenuation, however, exhibited a steady decline, which was likely attributed to exhaustion of sorption sites in the subsurface porous media. The river's flow regime influenced both occurrence levels and attenuation of TOrC during riverbank filtration, i.e. less river discharge resulted in higher TOrC concentrations and lower proportion of river water in the recovered groundwater. Differences in removal performance between annual data sets for caffeine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine were caused by variations in the source; concentrations in riverbank filtrate remained similar over several years. The seasonal assessment for TOrC revealed steady or improving removal between winter and summer seasons based on the statistical analysis with atenolol being the only exception likely due to an increased microbial activity at elevated temperatures.

AB N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), the active component of many insect repellents, is among the most frequently detected compounds in aqueous environments with concentrations reported in the ng L-1 to mu g L-1 range. However, DEET is often detected in blanks and reported concentrations differ significantly depending on the analytical technique employed. In addition, relatively sparse data are available regarding the seasonal variability of DEET concentrations in water and there are apparent inconsistencies with expected use patterns. Therefore, the present study investigates potential interferences affecting the detection and quantification of DEET then the geographical and seasonal variations of DEET concentrations. To examine potential analytical interferences, DEET was analyzed in five geographically-diverse wastewater effluents using both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detectors. At times, the concentrations quantified by the employed analytical methods varied significantly. Five compounds with similar molecular weights and structures as DEET were investigated as potential mimics and some were shown to induce an overestimation of DEET. Further experimentation suggested that the solvents used in sample preparation and HPLC analysis are another possible source of interference. Besides potential interferences, the seven-month weekly monitoring of DEET in the primary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant demonstrated a clear seasonal trend with decreasing concentration from summer to winter. These data collectively demonstrate that there are many challenges in the quantification of DEET in complex environmental samples and that co-occurrence of similarly structured substances present in the water sample and/or the solvents used for the analysis could induce analytical bias.

AB BACKGROUNDThe decomposition of carbamazepine (CBZ) in synthetic solution and in municipal effluent was investigated using a sono-electrochemical reactor. Sono-electrolysis was conducted using two concentrical electrodes installed in a cylindrical reactor containing a ceramic transducer.
   RESULTSCBZ concentration (C-0=10 mgL(-1)) optimally diminished up to 90% by applying a current intensity of 4.86A for 177 min and by imposing an ultrasound power of 38.29 W. The optimal conditions were subsequently applied for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater effluent contaminated with 10 mu g CBZL(-1). The reported removal efficiencies of CBZ, TOC, COD and colour were 93%, 60%, 93% and 86%, respectively. Likewise, the toxicity was completely removed (bacterium Vibrio fisheri) from the municipal wastewater effluent (>96%).
   CONCLUSIONSThe advantages of coupling ultrasonication and electrooxidation (US-EO) treatment for CBZ removal were demonstrated. An experimental design methodology based on response surface methodology was applied to determine the optimal experimental conditions in terms of cost/effectiveness of removal.

AB The removal of estrogenicity in a University of Cape Town-biological nutrient removal (UCT-BNR) wastewater treatment process was investigated using pilot and bench scale systems, batch experiments and mathematical modeling. In the pilot BNR process, 96 +/- 5% of the estrogenicity exerted by the influent wastewater was removed by the treatment process. The degradation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones of the pilot BNR bioreactor were 11 +/- 9%, 18 +/- 2% and 93 +/- 10%, respectively. In order to further understand the performance of the BNR process in the removal of estrogenicity from wastewater, a bench scale BNR process was operated with synthetic wastewater dosed with E1 and E2. The removal of estrogenicity in the bench scale system (95 +/- 5%) was comparable to the pilot BNR process and the degradation efficiencies were estimated to be 8 +/- 0.8%, 38 +/- 4% and 85 +/- 22% in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones, respectively. A biotransformation model developed to predict the fate of El and E2 in batch tests using the sludge from the BNR process was calibrated using the data from the experiments. The biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of E2 to El were estimated as 71 +/- 15, 31 +/- 3.3 and 1 +/- 0.9 L g COD-1 d(-1) for the aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic batch tests, respectively, while the corresponding biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of El were estimated to be 73 +/- 1.0, 3 +/- 2.0, and 0.85 +/- 0.6 L.g COD-1 d(-1). A steady state mass balance model formulated to describe the interactions between E2 and El in BNR activated sludge reasonably described the fate of El and E2 in the BNR process, (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, four one-dimensional flow and transport models based on the data of a field scale experiment in Greece were constructed to investigate the transport behavior of sixteen organic trace pollutants during soil aquifer treatment. At the site, tap water and treated wastewater were intermittently infiltrated into a porous aquifer via a small pilot pond. Electrical conductivity data was used to calibrate the non-reactive transport models. Transport and attenuation of the organic trace pollutants were simulated assuming 1st order degradation and linear adsorption. Sorption was found to be largely insignificant at this site for the compounds under investigation. In contrast flow path averaged first order degradation rate constants were mostly higher compared to the literature and lay between 0.036 d(-1) for clofibric acid and 0.9 d(-1) for ibuprofen, presumably owing to the high temperatures and a well adapted microbial community originating from the wastewater treatment process. The study highlights the necessity to obtain intrinsic attenuation parameters at each site, as findings cannot easily be transferred from one site to another. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, a highly sensitive and selective simultaneous electrochemical method to monitor the emerging organic contaminants tartrazine (TRT), dexamethasone (DMZ) and diclofenac (DCL) in sewage treatment plants was developed. The sensing was based on electroreduction of TRT (-0.22 V), DMZ (-0.93 V) and DCL (-1.12 V) on hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), using citrate buffer pH 2.5 as electrolyte. The fast electrodic kinetics of these chemicals provided improvements on selectivity at high scan rates. The unique electrochemical properties of HMDE were associated to analytical performance of the square-wave voltammetry to quantify trace concentrations of TRT, DMZ and DCL, with detection limits ranging from 2.78 x 10(-8) to 1.48 x 10(-7) mol L-1. After wastewater treatment by using solid-phase extraction, the proposed procedure was successfully applied for the direct quantification of the studied compounds with high precision, accuracy and stability of the measurements, even in the presence of other electroactive contaminants.

AB Cetirizine dihydrochloride, a pharmaceutical drug of the class antihistamines is frequently detected in wastewater samples. In the present work, the degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride is carried out using a novel technique of laccase enzyme as a catalyst under the influence of ultrasound irradiation. Effect of various process parameters such as enzyme loading, temperature, power, duty cycle, frequency and speed of agitation has been studied along with identification of the degradation intermediates. The maximum degradation of 91% is achieved at optimized experimental parameters such as 0.02% enzyme loading (w/v), 50 degrees C temperature, power input of 100W, 25 kHz frequency and 50% duty cycle with agitation speed of 200 rpm. It is observed that enzymatic degradation of Cetirizine dihydrochloride under the influence of ultrasound irradiation not only enhances the degradation but also reduces the time of degradation as compared to conventional enzymatic degradation technique.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a chiral fluorinated pharmaceutical mainly indicated for treatment of depression and is one of the most distributed drugs. There is a clear evidence of environmental contamination with this drug. Aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactors constitute a promising technology for wastewater treatment; however the removal of carbon and nutrients can be affected by micropollutants. In this study, the fate and effect of FLX on reactor performance and on microbial population were investigated. FLX adsorption/desorption to the aerobic granules was observed. FLX shock loads (<= 4 mu M) did not show a significant effect on the COD removal. Ammonium removal efficiency decreased in the beginning of first shock load, but after 20 days, ammonia oxidizing bacteria became adapted. The nitrite concentration in the effluent was practically null indicating that nitrite oxidizing bacteria was not inhibited, whereas, nitrate was accumulated in the effluent, indicating that denitrification was affected. Phosphate removal was affected at the beginning showing a gradual adaptation, and the effluent concentration was <0.04 mM after 70 days. A shift in microbial community occurred probably due to FIX exposure, which induced adaptation/restructuration of the microbial population. This contributed to the robustness of the reactor, which was able to adapt to the FLX load. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Physiological responses to, and recovery from, exposure to 3 concentrations of a pharmaceutical mixture (diclofenac and propranolol) were examined experimentally in Baltic Sea blue mussels Mytilus edulis trossulus collected with increasing distance to a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) outlet. Respiration, absorption efficiency and consumption were measured, and also combined into scope for growth (SFG). The response and recovery patterns varied both between exposure concentrations and sampling site within the bay. After exposure, mussels exposed to the highest concentration (2000 mu g l(-1)) in general had lower SFG, and mussels from 2 (out of 3) sites exposed to the medium concentration (200 mu g l(-1)) had higher SFG than the controls. In general, mussels from the 2 sites nearest the WTP recovered from the exposure response, while individuals collected further from the WTP outlet were more affected by the exposure and did not recover to the same extent. The response pattern of consumption was mainly affected by exposure concentration, whereas respiration was affected by all 3 factors (concentration, time of measurement, sampling site). Absorption efficiency was not affected at all. The differences in responses and recovery patterns could possibly be explained by the mussels sampled closer to the WTP having a history of higher food availability, improving their general health status, and/or a history of pre-exposure to natural disturbances, as well as to the test substances, via the WTP effluent. Pre-exposure to stressors could have both positive and negative impact on a community by increasing the resilience towards some stressors, but may also reduce the adaptability when facing other stressors.

AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater must be pretreated before traditional biological treatment to improve the biodegradability of pollutants due to their high concentration and complex composition. This study investigated O-3 and O-3/H2O2 systems to pretreat hydrocortisone wastewater. The optimum treatment efficiency of the O-3 system was achieved under pH value of 5.76, dosage of O-3 of 217.5 mg/L, and reaction time of 90 min. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) was 94% and 92%, respectively. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) increased from 0.066 to 0.310. Moreover, the optimum H2O2/O-3 molar ratio was 0.3 with the optimum pH of 3, and reaction time was reduced to 15 min to reach COD removal efficiency of 67.3% in the O-3/H2O2 oxidation system. Interestingly, isobutanol was assumed to be a good hydroxyl radical trapping agent due to the great decrease of Fenton reagent reaction rate constant. By comparing two different kinetic models, oxidation mechanism could be interpreted by the pseudo first-order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient R-2 above 0.9787. It can be concluded that ozonation system was controlled by both direct oxidation and free radical oxidation, and particularly the later one played a dominant role.

AB Amoxicillin is widely used as an antibiotic in the modern medicine. Due to its chemical structure, polarity, activity level, antibiotic specifications, and environmental sustainability, Amoxicillin leaks into the ground waters, surface waters, and drinking water wells. Many physical and chemical methods have been suggested for removing Amoxicillin from aquatic environments. However, these methods are very costly and have many performance problems. In this study, biodegradation of Amoxicillin by submerged biological aerated filter was evaluated in the aquatic environment. In order to assess the Amoxicillin removal from the aquatic environment, this bioreactor was fed with synthetic wastewater based on sucrose and Amoxicillin at three concentration levels and four hydraulic retention times. The maximum efficiencies for Amoxicillin and soluble chemical oxygen demand removal were 50.7 and 45.7%, respectively. The study findings showed that Stover-Kincannon model had very good fitness in loading Amoxicillin in the biofilter (R-2 > 99%). There was no accumulation of Amoxicillin in the biofilm and the loss of Amoxicillin in the control reactor was negligible. This shows that Amoxicillin removal from the system was due to biodegradation. It can be concluded that there was no significant inhibition effect on mixed aerobic microbial consortia. It was also observed that Amoxicillin degradation was dependent on the amount of Amoxicillin present in the influent and by increasing the initial Amoxicillin concentration, Amoxicillin biodegradation increased as well.

AB Mineralization of organics in secondary effluent by the peroxone process was studied at a direct potable water reuse research treatment system serving an occupied four-bedroom, four bath university residence hall apartment. Organic concentrations were measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and kinetic runs were monitored at varying O-3/H2O2 dosages and ratios. COD degradation could be accurately described as the parallel pseudo-1st order decay of rapidly and slowly-oxidizable fractions, and effluent COD was reduced to below the detection limit (<0.7 mg/L). At dosages >= 4.6 mg L-1 h(-1), an O-3/H2O2 mass ratio of 3.4-3.8, and initial COD <20 mg/L, a simple first order decay was indicated for both single-passed treated wastewater and recycled mineral water, and a relationship is proposed and demonstrated to estimate the pseudo-first order rate constant for design purposes. At this O-3/H2O2 mass ratio, ORP and dissolved ozone were found to be useful process control indicators for monitoring COD mineralization in secondary effluent. Moreover, an average second order rate constant for OH center dot oxidation of secondary effluent organics (measured as MCOD) was found to be 1.24 x 10(7) +/- 0.64 x 10(7) M-1 S-1. The electric energy demand of the peroxone process is estimated at 1.73-2.49 kWh electric energy for removal of one log COD in 1 m(3) secondary effluent, comparable to the energy required for desalination of medium strength seawater. Advantages/disadvantages of the two processes for municipal wastewater reuse are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of pharmaceutical residues in treatment of WWTP sludge was evaluated during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) and six sanitization technologies (pasteurization, thermal hydrolysis, advanced oxidation processes using Fenton's reaction, ammonia treatment, thermophilic dry digestion, and thermophilic anaerobic digestion). Sludge spiked with a selection of 13 substances was used and in total 23 substances were detected. A correlation between substance lipophilicity and sludge partitioning was found after sample centrifugation, with e.g., SSRI drugs (90-99%) and estrogens (96-98%) mainly found in the solid phase. A correlation between lipophilicity and persistence of pharmaceutical residues during AD was also detected, indicating that hydrophobic substances are less available to degrading microorganisms. Overall, AD was found to be the most effective technology in reducing a wide spectrum of organic substances (in average ca 30% reduction). Similar effects were obtained for both AD treatments, suggesting that temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic) is less important for micropollutant reduction. Advanced oxidation processes using Fenton's reaction also affected several compounds, including substances showing general stability over the range of treatments such as carbamazepine, propranolol, and sertraline. Pasteurization, ammonia treatment, and thermophilic dry digestion exhibited relatively modest reductions. Interestingly, only thermal hydrolysis efficiently removed the ecotoxicologically potent estrogenic compounds from the sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Performance of an up-flow submerged aerated biological filter (SABF), treating mixture of VOCs in pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated. Methanol, acetone, dichloromethane, benzene and toluene were chosen as target pollutants. The effects of airflow rate, hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate on VOC emission were evaluated. During the start-up phase, SABF removed over 92% of COD, up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.09 +/- 0.05 kg/m(3)/d at 12 h HRT. It was observed that the limited mass transfer of VOC to the gas phase at low air flow rate (0.4 L/min, with an empty bed residence time of 114 s) reduced its emission from the reactor. Performance of SABF varied with hydraulic retention time (HRT) and maximum COD removal (93%) was achieved at 10 h. Reduced contact time (less than 10 h) between pollutant and biomass affected the degradation of dichloromethane, benzene and toluene in the liquid phase. SABF exhibited effective degradation (95%) of VOCs up to an OLR of 17.45 +/- 0.01 kg/m(3)/d. Enzyme inactivation reduced the efficiency (72%) of the SABF for increased OLR of 20.85 +/- 0.03 kg/m(3)/d. Irrespective of organic loading rate, competition for the active site between the pollutants mainly affected the degradation of benzene and toluene in the liquid phase. Presence of high biomass and reduced mass transfer of VOCs to gas phase due to low air flow rate reduced VOC stripping even at higher organic loading rate. Average gas phase emission reduced to 0.075% for DCM, benzene, toluene whereas methanol and acetone was completely removed from the gas phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are two types of microbial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that use microorganisms to convert chemical energy in wastewaters into useful energy products such as (bio)electricity (MFC) or hydrogen gas (MEC). These two systems were evaluated for their capacity to attenuate trace organic compounds (TOrCs), commonly found in municipal wastewater, under closed circuit (current generation) and open circuit (no current generation) conditions, using acetate as the carbon source. A biocide was used to evaluate attenuation in terms of biotransformation versus sorption. The difference in attenuation observed before and after addition of the biocide represented biotransformation, while attenuation after addition of a biocide primarily indicated sorption. Attenuation of TOrCs was similar in MFCs and MECs for eight different TOrCs, except for caffeine and trimethoprim where slightly higher attenuation was observed in MECs. Electric current generation did not enhance attenuation of the TOrCs except for caffeine, which showed slightly higher attenuation under closed circuit conditions in both MFCs and MECs. Substantial sorption of the TOrCs occurred to the biofilm-covered electrodes, but no consistent trend could be identified regarding the physico-chemical properties of the TOrCs tested and the extent of sorption. The octanol water distribution coefficient at pH 7.4 (log D-pH 7.4) appeared to be a reasonable predictor for sorption of some of the compounds (carbamazepine, atrazine, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and diphenhydramine) but not for others (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). Atenolol also showed high levels of sorption despite being the most hydrophilic in the suite of compounds studied (log D-pH (7.4) = -1.99). Though BESs do not show any inherent advantages over conventional wastewater treatment, with respect to TOrC removal, overall removals in BESs are similar to that reported for conventional wastewater systems, implying the possibility of using BESs for energy production in wastewater treatment without adversely impacting TOrC attenuations.

AB Effluent from the secondary treatment of municipal wastewater was treated with membrane filtration to reduce its toxicity. Five different inorganic membranes were tested, namely, an a-alumina microfiltration membrane, an anatase titania ultrafiltration membrane, a gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane, an amorphous titania nanofiltration membrane, and an amorphous hybrid organo-silica membrane. The permeabilities and selectivities (color, UV254-absorbing components, conductivity and inorganic nitrogen compounds) of the membranes were determined, and the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane was found to be the most promising membrane for the treatment of the effluent. The effluent flux was measured to be approximately 40 L m(-2) h(-1) for the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane, and it removed nearly 75% of the UV254-absorbing components and 15% of the ions. It also removed 40% of the CuCl and 25% of the CuSO4 from the spiked effluent. The fouling resistance was less pronounced for the gamma-alumina membrane compared with the other membranes. The removal of fecal indicator bacteria was determined by measuring the amounts of Escherichia coli and Enterococci, and the removal of toxic compounds was investigated in bioassays with Daphnia magna and Aliivibrio fischeri. The gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane reduced the wastewater concentration of E. coli (97.3%) and Enterococci (98.4%), and the bioassays demonstrated that filtration with the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane reduced the overall toxicity of the effluent.

AB Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and dydrogesterone (DDG) are synthetic progestins widely used in human and veterinary medicine. Although aquatic organisms are exposed to them through wastewater and animal farm runoff, very little is known about their effects in the environment. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to MPA, DDG, and their binary mixtures at measured concentrations between 4.5 and 1663 ng/L. DDG and both mixtures impaired reproductive capacities (egg production) of breeding pairs and led to histological alterations of ovaries and testes and increased gonadosomatic index. Transcriptional analysis of up to 28 genes belonging to different pathways demonstrated alterations in steroid hormone receptors, steroidogenesis enzymes, and specifically, the circadian rhythm genes, in different organs of adult zebrafish and eleuthero-embryos. Alterations occurred even at environmentally relevant concentrations of 4.5-4.8 ng/L MPA, DDG and the mixture in eleuthero-embryos and at 43-89 ng/L in adult zebrafish. Additionally, the mixtures displayed additive effects in most but not all parameters in adults and eleuthero-embryos, suggesting concentration addition. Our data suggest that MPA and DDG and their mixtures induce multiple transcriptional responses at environmentally relevant concentrations and adverse effects on reproduction and gonad histology at higher levels.

AB Endocrine disrupting determination at low concentration levels comprises one of the most important targets in environmental analytical chemistry. In spite of inherent high sensitivities obtained for HPLC, these techniques have some limitations depending on the contaminants. As a result, interest in preconcentration using solid-phase extraction (SPE) still continues increasingly for endocrine disrupting determinations by HPLC due to the high accuracy of this method. In this work, we evaluated three different adsorbents in preconcentration of endocrine disruptors in three different categories: pharmaceuticals (sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim and diclofenac), hormones (estrone, 17 beta-estradiolacetate and 17 beta-estradiol) and plastic materials (bisphenol A) in multicomponent aqueous solution using the combination SPE -HPLC. The adsorbents investigated were such as modified silica (octadecylsilane)-DSC-18 (Supelco) and two polymers, a divinylbenzene-N-vinilpirolidona-Oasis((R)) HLB (Waters) and a styrene-divinylbenzene modified with butyrolactone-Strata-X (TM) (Phenomenex). The parameters selected to evaluate the best adsorbent were sample loaded, breakthrough volume, recovery and adsorption capacity. The results showed that the polymeric sorbents Oasis and Strata presented good separation and selective ability, then the most efficient sorbent for the described test was applied to the determination of endocrine disruptor (ED) in a wastewater real sample. Almost all endocrine disruptors studied in the present work were found and quantified in the effluent sample, suggesting the selected cartridge could be useful for preconcentration technique of endocrine disruptors in environmental analytical applications. Correlation analysis identified the adsorption parameters which had the most influence in efficiency of SPE adsorbents, such as initial ED concentration, breakthrough volume and recovery.

AB Wastewater treatment by deactivated and activated sludge was investigated to evaluate the removal of estrogens [estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)] via adsorption and degradation. Different treatment conditions were used, including three mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (MLVSS) concentrations, three methanol concentrations (carbon source) and three types of aqueous media (water, synthetic solution, and supernatant). The E2 was degraded the fastest by the bacterial community. In all cases the removal rate increased when the initial MLVSS and methanol concentrations increased and when the macro-and micronutrients were present in the solution. In the experiments with deactivated sludge, the synthetic compound EE2 was more easily removed via sorption. The bacterial communities of the activated sludge were studied, which indicated a similarity of more than 75% between the different samples. A similarity of only 50% was found between the activated and deactivated sludges.

AB ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel method on granular porous natural scoria. Structure and morphology of scoria, synthesized ZnO nanoparticles, and ZnO/scoria nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Approximately 49 mg of nano ZnO was immobilized per gram of scoria. Photocatalytic performance of ZnO/scoria nanocomposite was examined for phenazopyridine and Acid Blue 113 removal from synthetic aqueous solutions under UV irradiation in a continuous open channel reactor. Removal of Acid Blue 113 in pH of 5.5, flow rate of 15 ml/min and Acid Blue 113 concentration of 20 mg/L was obtained 70.78%. Removal of phenazopyridine in pH of 6.0, flow rate of 15 ml/min and concentration of 15 mg/L was obtained 72.55%. Also, prepared photocatalyst was used for treatment of pharmaceutical and textile pollutants from real wastewaters. COD reductions of these wastewaters were 40.55% and 58.25% respectively in their natural pH, 5 ml/min with initial COD of 800 and 510. Results reveal that ZnO/scoria nanocomposite is efficient for photocatalytic removal of pharmaceutical and textile pollutants with reusability. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Recent droughts in the southwestern United States have heightened the interest in using more reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation. Treated wastewater effluent is a source of irrigation water and contains many pharmaceutical microcontaminants. Currently, there is little knowledge on if these microconstituents will enter food crops and if so where they will be found within the plant. For this experiment, the uptake of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, fluoxetine HCl (Prozac (R)), and ibuprofen within different sections of a celery stalk over a 24-h time period was examined. Results found that all of these pharmaceuticals were taken up into the celery stalks within 24 h. Ibuprofen was found to have reached concentrations of 1 mu g/g within the leaves in just 1 h. Metabolites of the ibuprofen were also detected at all locations within the stalk for all time periods. The concentration of EE2 in the submerged section of the stalk was found to increase from 0.031 to 0.911 mu g/g of celery in just 23 h. The EE2 began to rise higher within the stalk to reach a concentration of 8.94 ng/g about 6 in above the base after 24 h. Fluoxetine HCl concentrations rose to 0.832 mu g/g of celery within the submerged section of the stalk during the 24 h. After 12 h, fluoxetine HCl was detected within the bottom 4 in of the stalk. EE2, fluoxetine HCl, and ibuprofen all exhibit potential for uptake within food crops. Further studies on additional food crops and pharmaceuticals would be required to assess the full risk posed to human eating food crops irrigated with treated wastewater effluent.

AB Discharge of substances like pesticides, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, and chelating agents in surface waters has increased over the last decades due to the rising numbers of chemicals used by humans and because many WWTPs do not eliminate these substances entirely. The study, results of which are presented here, focused on associations of (1) concentrations of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, surface waters, sediments, and tissues of fishes; (2) results of laboratory biotests indicating potentials for effects in these samples and (3) effects either in feral chub (Leuciscus cephalus) from two German rivers (Schussen, Argen) or in brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in bypass systems to streamwater of these rivers or in cages directly in the rivers. The Schussen and Argen Rivers flow into Lake Constance. The Schussen River is polluted by a great number of chemicals, while the Argen River is less influenced by micropollutants. Pesticides, chelating agents, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were detected in effluents of a WWTP discharging to the Schussen as well as in surface water, and/or fishes from downstream of the WWTP. Results obtained by biotests conducted in the laboratory (genotoxicity, dioxin-like toxicity, and embryotoxicity) were linked to effects in feral fish collected in the vicinity of the WWTP or in fishes exposed in cages or at the bypass systems downstream of the WWTP. Dioxin-like effect potentials detected by reporter gene assays were associated with activation of CYP1A1 enzymes in fishes which are inducible by dioxin-like chemicals. Abundances of several PCBs in tissues of fishes from cages and bypass systems were not associated with these effects but other factors can influence EROD activity. Genotoxic potentials obtained by in vitro tests were associated with the presence of micronuclei in erythrocytes of chub from the river. Chemicals potentially responsible for effects on DNA were identified. Embryotoxic effects on zebrafish (Dania rerio), investigated in the laboratory, were associated with embryotoxic effects in trout exposed in streamwater bypass systems at the two rivers. In general, responses at all levels of organization were more pronounced in samples from the Schussen than in those from the Argen. These results are consistent with the magnitudes of chemical pollution in these two streams. Plausibility chains to establish causality between exposures and effects and to predict effects in biota in the river from studies in the laboratory are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely distributed in low concentrations in the water compartment. Conventional sewage treatment plants (STP) are not capable to remove pharmaceuticals to the full extent, so alternative methods such as ozonization or photooxidation are tested as additional stage. However, it has been shown that in many cases no complete mineralization is achieved during these processes and transformation products occur. Up to now only little is known about these transformation products in terms of their structure and toxicity. The antibiotic sulfathiazole (STZ) is used in veterinary medicine and it can be detected in different water matrices such as STP effluent or surface water. We tested the ability of photooxidation for degradation of STZ using a medium pressure mercury lamp. LC-UV showed the formation of several minor compounds and one main transformation product which has been isolated subsequently. Using NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry techniques, we were able to reveal the structure of promizole, an antituberculotic, used in the 1950s. This compound showed a reduced microbial activity in Brilliant Black Reduction Maximum Residue Level test. Furthermore, there was no difference in the effects of promizole when compared to STZ on cell toxicity and cell proliferation in two murine cell lines.

AB Eight pharmaceuticals, the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, two antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin, and five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ketorolac, and ketoprofen were analyzed in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants in Jordan. After solid phase extraction at pH 4, the analytes were determined by LC-MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring mode. For quantitation purposes, external calibration was applied first. Regression coefficients of >= 0.995 indicated the linearity in the concentration range of 0.5-100 ng/mu L. Finally, single-point standard addition was applied to compensate matrix effects. The instrumental detection limits were between 0.05 and 20 pg amount injected. The method quantitation limits for spiked influent and effluent samples were 0.5 and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively. Recovery rates were >= 78%. Precision given as relative standard deviations for within-day precision and time-different intermediate precision ranged from 2 to 21 and 1 to 19%, respectively. In this study, the maximum average concentrations found for ibuprofen were 5.7 mu g/L in the influent and 2.2 mu g/L in the effluent samples. The other pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 and 0.2 to 1.3 mu g/L, respectively. Ketorolac and ketoprofen were not detected.

   ASSESSMENT
AB Cytostatic drugs, used in chemotherapy, are excreted unchanged by urine and feces or modified as metabolites. Elimination of these drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is often incomplete and residues reach surface water. Their presence in the natural environment depends on consumption patterns, excretion fraction and the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment. This study compiled the total consumption of cytostatic drugs in Catalonia (NE Spain) and provides data on the occurrence and risk of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment by calculating predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). PECs were estimated using publicly available consumption data in the period of 2010-2012, published or calculated excretion values and wastewater elimination rates for a suite of 132 compounds. This allows predicting the range of concentrations in effluent wastewaters and receiving waters. Out of the 132 cytostatics, mycophenolic acid and hydroxycarbamide had a PEC value higher than 10 ng L-1. PECs were compared with MECs (measured environmental concentrations) to evaluate the reliability of the estimation. A risk assessment was conducted to determine the potential adverse effects of cytostatics in the environment. All the risk quotients calculated using EC50 in Daphnia magna were below 1, showing no significant risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of Watershed Susceptibility to Contaminants of Emerging
   Concern
SO JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are raising public awareness because of their potential effect on aquatic ecosystems and public health. For this study, the authors applied spatial analyses to four selected US watersheds to identify critical areas susceptible to CECs and used watershed characteristics (i.e., potential source distribution, land use, climatic/hydrologic conditions) to prioritize the types of CECs. The results identified sub-basins where major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are located as critical areas for potential CEC point source pollution in general. Sub-basins containing intensive agricultural activities with high precipitation greatly contributed to CEC pollution especially during wet-weather periods. The rank of prioritized prescribed pharmaceutical groups was similar for most watersheds because of the groups' association with population demographics. Prioritized pesticide types were dependent on the type and areas of crops and urban yards in each watershed. This study demonstrates the utility of using spatial analysis for effectively assessing CECs in watersheds, which is important for the implementation of monitoring and management strategies.

AB This paper provides data on the occurrence of selected human pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibrate, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) including steroid hormones (17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, and estrone) in influents/effluents to/from the four principal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving the city of Rome (Italy), in two different sampling campaigns. Target compounds were also analyzed in the receiving River Tiber and River Aniene. Analytical determination was carried out by LC-MS/MS after sample cleanup and concentration by off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE). The aim of the study was to increase the information currently available on the presence and persistence of pharmaceuticals in Italian urban wastewaters and to evaluate the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical residues discharged through effluents into the receiving rivers. Results indicated that after the treatment processes, most of pharmaceuticals were not completely eliminated, as average removal efficiencies were in the 14-100 % wide range during both sampling periods, with higher yields in spring than in winter. Levels detected in overall samples ranged from 5 to 2,230 ng/L in influents and from 5 to 1,424 ng/L in effluents. Carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil showed the highest persistence to removal. Concentrations in the receiving waters were about one order of magnitude lower than in effluents, with a tendency to increase progressively through the urban tract of the river. Finally, an environmental risk analysis showed that carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and estrone can pose a high risk at the concentrations detected in effluents and a medium risk in rivers, highlighting their potential hazard for the health of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Ten pharmaceuticals and two consumer products were investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shanghai, China. The concentrations of target compounds in the wastewater influents ranged from below the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 9340 ng/L, with the frequency of detection of 31-100 %, and the removal efficiencies were observed to be -82 to 100 % in the four WWTPs. Concentrations of most target compounds (i.e. diclofenac, caffeine, metoprolol, sulpiride) in the wastewater influents were around three to eight times higher in urban WWTPs than in suburb ones, probably due to the different population served and lifestyles. Mean concentrations of target compounds in the wastewater influent generally decreased by 5-76 % after rainfall due to the dilution of raw sewage by rainwater, which infiltrated into the sewer system. In the WWTPs located in the suburb area, the increased flow of wastewater influent led to a shortened hydraulic retention time (HRT) and decreased removal efficiencies of some compounds. On the contrary, the influence of rainfall was not significant on the removal efficiencies of investigated compounds in urban WWTPs, probably due to the almost unchanged influent flow, good removal performance, or bypass system employed.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) has been detected in significant amounts in municipal treated wastewater effluent. Diverse studies report that trace concentrations of DCF may induce toxic effects on different aquatic organisms as well as developmental, reproductive and renal damage. This study aimed to determine whether short and long-term exposure to DCF alter the oxidative stress (OS) status in blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver of common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of DCF at 96 h (96-h LC50) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed (short and long-term) to the latter value for different exposure times (4 and 24 days) and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxides content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Also, the DCF was determined by LC-MS/MS. Significant increases in HPC, LPX and PCC were observed respect to control (P<0.05) particularly in blood, muscle, gill, brain and liver. SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased in these organs, with respect to controls (P<0.05). DCF concentrations decreased and increased in water system and carp, respectively. Cyprinus carpio exposed to DCF was affected in OS status during the initial days of the study (at 4 days), exhibiting an increased response at 24 days in blood and liver. In contrast, a decrease was observed in muscle, gills and brain at 24 days with respect to 4 days. In conclusion, DCF induces OS on blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver in the carp C. carpio in short and long-term exposure. The biomarkers employed in this study are useful in the assessment of the environmental impact of this agent on aquatic species.

AB Early life-stage bioassays have been used as an alternative to short-term adult toxicity tests since they are cost-effective. A single couple can produce hundreds or thousands of embryos and hence can be used as a simple high-throughput approach in toxicity studies. In the present study, zebrafish and sea urchin embryo bioassays were used to test the toxicity of four pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes: diclofenac, propranolol, simvastatin and sertraline. Simvastatin was the most toxic tested compound for zebrafish embryo, followed by diclofenac. Sertraline was the most toxic drug to sea urchin embryos, inducing development abnormalities at the ng/L range. Overall, our results highlight the potential of sea urchin embryo bioassay as a promising and sensitive approach for the high-throughput methods to test the toxicity of new chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, and identify several drugs that should go through more detailed toxicity assays.

AB Steroidal and non-steroidalanti-inflammatories are pharmaceutical prescribed in human medicine and have the potential to contaminate water and sediments via inputs from sewage treatment plants. Their impacts on humans and ecosystems are emerging issues in environmental health. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of diclofenac and dexamethasone in male fish Hoplias malabaricus after trophic exposure. Fish were fed twice every week with Astyanax sp. submitted to intraperitoneal inoculation with diclofenac (0; 0.2; 2.0 or 20.0 mu g/kg) or dexamethasone (0; 0.03; 03 or 3.0 mu g/kg). After 12 doses, blood was collected for testosterone dosage. The gonad and liver were collected to calculate gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Antioxidants enzymes activity and biotransformation were also evaluated in liver and gonads. In liver, diclofenac caused oxidative stress with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipoperoxidation (LPO). The GST activity was reduced by diclofenac in liver. Trophic exposure of H. malabaricus to dexamethasone caused an increase in antioxidant system (GPx, CAT, GST, and GSH) and LPO in liver. However, it reduced antioxidant system (GPX and GST activities and GSH) in gonads. Both diclofenac and dexamethasone reduced the levels of testosterone, causing impairment to reproduction. Diclofenac reduced HSI at the 0.2 mu g/kg, but not GSI. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and dexamethasone caused oxidative stress and reduced testosterone levels that can have a negative impact in aquatic organisms.

AB The occurrence, bioaccumulation and risk assessment of lipophilic pharmaceutically active compounds (LPhACs), such as antibiotics (roxithromycin, erythromycin and ketoconazole), anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen and diclofenac), beta-blockers (propranolol), antiepileptics (carbamazepine) and steroid hormones (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol), were investigated in the downstream rivers of sewage treatment plants in Nanjing, China. The results indicate that these LPhACs were widely detected in the surface water and fish samples, with the mean concentrations of the total LPhACs (Sigma LPhACs) being in the range of 15.4 and 384.5 ng/L and 3.0 and 128.4 ng/g (wet weight), respectively. The bioaccumulation of the Sigma LPhACs in wild fish tissues was generally in the order the liver > brain > gill > muscle. Among the target LPhACs, however, an interspecies difference in tissue distribution was evident for erythromycin. The bioaccumulation factors of LPhACs in the liver and brain, the two major targeted storage sites for toxicants, exhibited an obvious negative correlation with the aquatic concentrations (P < 0.05). Finally, risk quotients posed by pharmaceuticals were assessed by comprehensive and comparative methods for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish). The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be algae > daphnids > fish. However, the results indicate that diclofenac, ibuprofen and 17a-ethinylestradiol each posed chronic risks for high trophic level organisms (fish). In all of the risk assessments, erythromycin was found to be the most harmful for the most sensitive algae group. In this work, however, the total BAF and toxicological interactions of pharmaceuticals were not performed due to the lack of metabolite information and combined toxicity data, which represents a major hindrance to the effective risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.

AB This study evaluated the potential concentrations of four antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SUF), trimethoprim (TRI) and erythromycin (ERY) throughout the rivers of Europe. This involved reviewing national consumption rates together with assessing excretion and sewage treatment removal rates. From this information, it was possible to construct best, expected and worst case scenarios for the discharge of these antibiotics into rivers. Consumption data showed surprising variations, up to 200-fold in the popularity of different antibiotics across different European nations. Using the water resources model GWAVA which has a spatial resolution of approximately 6 x 9 km, river water concentrations throughout Europe were predicted based on 31-year climate data. The modelled antibiotic concentrations were within the range of measurements reported previously in European effluents and rivers. With the expected scenario, the predicted annual-average antibiotic concentrations ranged between 0 and 10 ng/L for 90% by length of surface waters. In the worst case scenario concentrations could reach between 0.1 and 1 mu g/L at the most exposed locations. As both predicted and observed sewage effluent concentrations were below reported effect levels for the most sensitive aquatic wildlife, no direct toxicity in rivers is expected. Predicted river concentrations for UP and ERY were closest to effect levels in wildlife, followed by SUF which was 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. TRI appeared to be of the least concern with around 6 orders of magnitude difference between predicted and effect levels. However, mixture toxicity may elevate this risk and antibiotic levels of 0.1-11 mu g/L in hotspots may contribute to local environmental antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.

AB In the engineering practice, there are two basic alternatives of physicochemical treatment for the removal of volatile compounds from process wastewaters: stripping with air or stripping with steam. In this work, these alternatives are investigated and compared in the case of a real industrial problem that is typical for the fine chemical industry and general conclusion is drawn. The removal of the organically bound halogens, called adsorbable organically bound halogens, is investigated. The two alternatives, air and steam stripping, are first modeled in the professional software environment of ASPEN Plus(A (R)). The model is validated on the data of an existing air stripper for the removal of organic halogens. Same organic halogens removal is applied for the design of a steam stripper. It is proved that the steam stripping shows better operability and economic performance than the air stripping; moreover, the volatile and/or adsorbable organically bound halogen compounds can be recovered in the distillate and they can be reused improving the sustainability.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the response of the microbial community from CWs microcosms tested for the removal of two veterinary antibiotics, enrofloxacin (ENR) and tetracycline (TET), from livestock industry wastewater. Three treatments were tested (control, ENR or TET (100 mu g L-1)) over 12 weeks in microcosms unplanted and planted with Phragmites australis. CWs removal efficiency was relatively stable along time, with removals higher than 98% for ENR and 94% for TET. In addition, CWs were able to reduce wastewater toxicity, independently of antibiotics presence. Despite no significant differences were observed in terms of microbial abundance, bacterial richness or diversity, analysis of similarities (two-way crossed ANOSIM) showed a significant effect of both time and treatments in bacterial community structure. This study points to CWs applicability for veterinary antibiotics removal from livestock wastewaters, showing that CWs microbial communities were able to adapt without significant changes in their diversity or depuration capacity.

AB This study focused on understanding and characterizing the removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in microbial fuel cells (MFC). 26 TOrCs with broad physicochemical properties were spiked in synthetic wastewater. Single-chamber air-cathode MFC (SMFC) and double-chamber air-cathode MFC (DMFC) were constructed to provide combined or separated oxidation/reduction environments for TOrCs removal. The study showed that TOrCs removal processes involved both sorption and biodegradation. For neutral TOrCs, the removal efficiency was affected primarily by the biodegradability probability and hydrophobicity of the compounds, while electrostatic interactions played an additional role in the MFCs as the removal of positively charged TOrCs was generally higher than negatively charged TOrCs. The presence of TOrCs showed negligible impact on MFC power generation, likewise the operation of MFCs had marginal effect on TOrCs removal, except longer residence time in MFCs improved biological removal performance.

AB An increasing number of organic micropollutants (OMP) is detected in anthropogenically influenced water cycles. Source control and effective natural and technical barriers are essential to maintain a high quality of drinking water resources under these circumstances. Based on the literature and our own research this study proposes a limited number of OMP that can serve as indicator substances for the major sources of OMP, such as wastewater treatment plants, agriculture and surface runoff. Furthermore functional indicators are proposed that allow assessment of the proper function of natural and technical barriers in the aquatic environment, namely conventional municipal wastewater treatment, advanced treatment (ozonation, activated carbon), bank filtration and soil aquifer treatment as well as self-purification in surface water. These indicator substances include the artificial sweetener acesulfame, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole and the herbicide mecoprop among others. The chemical indicator substances are intended to support comparisons between watersheds and technical and natural processes independent of specific water cycles and to reduce efforts and costs of chemical analyses without losing essential information.

AB The majority of current wastewater treatment plants are unable to effectively eliminate micropollutants like pharmaceuticals. This specific type of pollution, which is currently not regulated in today's legislation, goes to a greater or lesser extent into surface streams and then into groundwaters. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in groundwater was addressed by only few studies till now and should be considered by new researches in different localities with different conditions. Monitoring of groundwater quality in the area of the psychiatric hospital at Horni BeA (TM) kovice showed that local groundwater contains a range of pharmaceuticals. The geological environment is able to effectively eliminate many of them (e.g. estrogens) over a relatively short distance, but in the case of other pharmaceuticals the efficacy of elimination of groundwater pollution is significantly lower (e.g. diclofenac). The results of the project disclosed a series of related, yet unresolved issues and unanswered questions. Development of ecological thresholds will enable determination of the danger of pharmaceuticals to the environment and human health from prolonged exposure to low doses of these drugs. The results achieved will have a significant economic impact because new limits of permissible concentrations of these compounds in water will lead to new demands for efficient technologies of wastewater treatment.

AB Sediments from a rural to urban gradient along the Alafia River in Florida, USA, were collected to determine the risk of environmental contamination with legacy (organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)) and new contaminants (pharmaceuticals).
   Bed sediments (0-10 cm) collected from rural and urban sub-basins of the Alafia River were analyzed for OCPs and pharmaceuticals using standard gas chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques.
   Three most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in sediments were carbamazepine (100 % of samples), trimethoprim (89 % of samples), and pseudoephedrine (63 % of samples). While acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, lidocaine, and nicotine were detected in < 30 % of samples. The detection of caffeine in all sediment samples suggests that domestic wastewater from wastewater treatment plants and/or septic systems may be a contributing source at all the sites. Among the OCPs, endosulfan I was most frequently detected (37 % of samples), followed by delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (15 % of samples), gamma-chlordane and endosulfan II (both in 11 % of samples), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and methoxychlor (both in 7 % of samples). The lower concentrations of OCPs (sum 0-16.1 ng g(-1)) than pharmaceuticals (sum 0.5-61.9 ng g(-1)) in sediments are probably due to the historic use of OCPs since these were banned for use in the USA in the 1970s, while pharmaceuticals are still used.
   The variability in detection and concentrations of legacy and new compounds in rural and urban stream sediments is likely due to the different magnitude of input sources, site characteristics, and chemical properties of individual compounds. Significant positive correlations between OCPs and sediment properties (organic matter, silt, and clay) suggest that sediments are a major sink of various contaminants in the Alafia River. We conclude that the concentrations of both pharmaceuticals and OCPs in sediments of this urban river are relatively lower than existing literature; however, these can still be of environmental concern to aquatic organisms.

AB Recently, there is an emergence of endocrine-disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs) as important pollutants to remove from drinking water and reclaimed wastewater. In this work, the efficiency of removing pharmaceuticals (PCs) from model aqueous solutions and raw wastewater with ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), activated carbon adsorption (AC), biological methods (SBR) and oxidation with ClO2 was investigated. Some treatments have also been used as combined processes: UF + NF, UF +AC, SBR + ClO2. Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam were selected as model compounds. In order to evaluate their removal, PC solutions were also considered at several operating conditions (pH, conductivity, concentration, and temperature), and optimal conditions were obtained. Experiments were performed at usual PC concentrations in wastewaters: 1000 ng/L for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, 300 ng/L for Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam. Separation was evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Results indicated that the removal efficiency depends on their Log K-ow, which is intrinsically related to their hydrophobicity and then, to their adsorption onto the surface (UF, NF, and AC). Also, NF, AC, and combined processes (UF + NF, UF +AC) were the most suitable separation techniques to obtain high removal efficiencies for most of the PCs used, except for Acetaminophen (which showed great removal efficacy using SBR). UF presented low removal yields for all PCs tested. ClO2 treatment was more effective at high concentration (50 mg ClO2/L). Furthermore, results also showed that there are significant differences on the performance of the processes applied and which treatment is the most effective for each PC analyzed.

AB Transport of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals in soils and consequent ground-water contamination are influenced by many factors, including compound sorption on soil particles. Here we evaluate the sorption isotherms for 7 pharmaceuticals on 13 soils, described by Freundlich equations, and assess the impact of soil properties on various pharmaceuticals' sorption on soils. Sorption of ionizable pharmaceuticals was, in many cases, highly affected by soil pH. The sorption coefficient of sulfamethoxazole was negatively correlated to soil pH, and thus positively related to hydrolytic acidity and exchangeable acidity. Sorption coefficients for clindamycin and clarithromycin were positively related to soil pH and thus negatively related to hydrolytic acidity and exchangeable acidity, and positively related to base cation saturation. The sorption coefficients for the remaining pharmaceuticals (trimethoprim, metoprolol, atenolol, and carbamazepine) were also positively correlated with the base cation saturation and cation exchange capacity. Positive correlations between sorption coefficients and clay content were found for clindamycin, clarithromycin, atenolol, and metoprolol. Positive correlations between sorption coefficients and organic carbon content were obtained for trimethoprim and carbamazepine. Pedotransfer rules for predicting sorption coefficients of various pharmaceuticals included hydrolytic acidity (sulfamethoxazole), organic carbon content (trimethoprimand carbamazepine), base cation saturation (atenolol and metoprolol), exchangeable acidity and clay content (clindamycin), and soil active pH and clay content (clarithromycin). Pedotransfer rules, predicting the Freundlich sorption coefficients, could be applied for prediction of pharmaceutical mobility in soils with similar soil properties. Predicted sorption coefficients together with pharmaceutical half-lives and other imputes (e.g., soil-hydraulic, geological, hydro-geological, climatic) may be used for assessing potential ground-water contamination.

AB On-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs or septic systems) are designed to treat and dispose effluents on the same property that produces the wastewater. Approximately 25% of the U.S. population is served by such facilities. Nevertheless, studies on the treatment efficiency and discharge of organic contaminants through septic effluents are lacking. This pilot study showed the occurrence of organic contaminants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), perfluoroalkyl surfactants (PFASs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in septic effluents, adjacent lake water samples, household drinking water in homes that use lake water or a well adjacent to the lake as a source of drinking water, and offshore lake water samples. Septic effluent as well as lake and tap water samples were collected from several households with OWTSs around Skaneateles Lake located in central New York. The advanced on-site systems were installed in some households for the purpose of limiting nutrient levels in the effluent to protect the local surface water. Additionally, because many of these systems serve homes with limited land, advanced treatment systems were needed. The median concentrations of ten PPCPs (ranged from 0.45 to 388 ng/L) and eleven PFASs (ranged from 0.20 to 14.6 ng/L) in septic water were significantly higher (p <= 0.01) than in lake water samples. The Median concentrations of PPCPs and PFASs in lake and tap water samples were not significantly different (p >= 0.65). The median concentrations of Sigma PBDEs in septic, lake, and tap water samples were 7.47, 3.49, and 2.22 ng/L, respectively, and those for Sigma PCBs were 33.1, 29.2, and 28.6 ng/L, respectively. The mass flux of PPCPs (i.e. the mass flow of PPCPs per unit area per unit time) through the disposal of treated septic effluent from textile biofilter and aerobic treatments to the dispersal unit ranged from 12 (carbamazepine) to 66900 mu g/m(2)/day (caffeine) whereas that for PFASs ranged from 7.0 (perfluorobutanesulfonate) to 833 mu g/m(2)/day (perfluorooctanoic acid). Based on the ratio of measured concentrations and method detection limit, triclocarban, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctanesulfonate have the potential to be used as chemical tracers of septic water contamination in Skaneateles Lake. The median concentrations of atenolol, a beta-blocker drug, in septic water were significantly (rho = 0.86, p = 0.01) correlated with enterococci counts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine disruption and high occurrences of intersex have been observed in wild fish associated with municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in urbanized reaches of rivers around the globe. These reproductive effects have often been attributed to the presence of estrogen receptor agonists in effluents. However, recent studies have isolated a number of androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens) that may also contribute to the endocrine disruption observed at sites that are influenced by WWTP outfalls. This study aimed to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of anti-androgenic personal care products (triclosan, chlorophene, dichlorophene, oxybenzone, 1-naphthol, and 2-naphthol), along with a herbicide (atrazine) and representative pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, and venlafaxine) in the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario. Surface water sampling of 30 sites associated with six municipal WWTP outfalls was conducted during a summer low flow. Monthly samples were also collected immediately upstream and downstream of a major WWTP from August to November 2012.
   Atrazine was consistently found in all surface water sampling locations. Many of the target pharmaceuticals and triclosan were detected in WWTP effluents, especially those that did not nitrify. Under low flow conditions, the concentrations of triclosan and several pharmaceuticals increased directly downstream of the WWTPs then decreased rapidly with distance downstream. Chlorophene was either found at trace levels or below detection limits in the effluents while dichlorophene, oxybenzone, 1-naphthol, and 2-naphthol were not detected in any samples. Chlorophene was detected in surface water during the low flow summer period and once during the monthly sampling from August to November. However, the primary source of chlorophene did not appear to be associated with WWTP effluent. This study documents the spatial and temporal occurrence of several antiandrogens and pharmaceuticals in a highly impacted Canadian watershed. It supports previous observations that there is a diversity of contaminants in wastewater effluents and other sources that have the potential to alter endocrine function in wild fish.

AB The occurrence of emerging organic contaminants within the aquatic environment in Africa is currently unknown. This study provides early insights by characterising a broad range of emerging organic contaminants (n > 1000) in groundwater sources in Kabwe, Zambia. Groundwater samples were obtained during both the dry and wet seasons from a selection of deep boreholes and shallow wells completed within the bedrock and overlying superficial aquifers, respectively. Groundwater sources were distributed across the city to encompass peri-urban, lower cost housing, higher cost housing, and industrial land uses. The insect repellent DEET was ubiquitous within groundwater at concentrations up to 1.8 mu g/L. Other compounds (n = 26) were detected in less than 15% of the sources and included the bactericide triclosan (up to 0.03 mu g/L), chlorination by-products - tri-halornethanes (up to 50 mu g/L), and the surfactant 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (up to 0.6 mu g/L). Emerging contaminants were most prevalent in shallow wells sited in low cost housing areas. This is attributed to localised vulnerability associated with inadequate well protection, sanitation, and household waste disposal. The five-fold increase in median DEET concentration following the onset of the seasonal rains highlights that more mobile compounds can rapidly migrate from the surface to the aquifer suggesting the aquifer is more vulnerable than previously considered. Furthermore it suggests DEET is potentially useful as a wastewater tracer in Africa. There was a general absence of personal care products, life-style compounds, and pharmaceuticals which are commonly detected in the aquatic environment in the developed world. This perhaps reflects some degree of attenuation within the subsurface, but could also be a result of the current limited use of products containing emerging contaminants by locals due to unaffordability and unavailability. As development and population increases in Africa, it is likely a wider-range of emerging contaminants will be released into the environment. (C) 2014 British Geological Survey o NERC 2014.

AB Aquatic organisms can be affected not only via polluted water but also via their food. In the present study, we examined bioaccumulation of seventy pharmaceuticals in two benthic organisms, Hydropsyche sp. and Erpobdella octoculata in a small stream affected by the effluent from a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Prachatice (South Bohemia region, Czech Republic).
   Furthermore, water samples from similar locations were analyzed for all seventy pharmaceuticals. In water samples from a control locality situated upstream of the STP, ten of the seventy pharmaceuticals were found with average total concentrations of 200 ng L-1. In water samples collected at STP-affected sites (downstream the STP's effluent), twenty-nine, twenty-seven and twenty-nine pharmaceuticals were determined at average total concentrations of 2000, 2100 and 1700 ng L-1, respectively.
   Six of the seventy pharmaceuticals (azithromycin, citalopram, clarithromycin, clotrimazole, sertraline, and verapamil) were found in Hydropsyche. Four pharmaceuticals (clotrimazole, diclofenac, sertraline, and valsartan) were detected in Erpobdella. Using evaluation criterion bioconcentration factor (BCF) is higher than 2000 we can assign azithromycin and sertraline as bioaccumulative pharmaceuticals. Even pharmaceuticals present at low levels in water were found in benthic organisms at relatively high concentrations (up to 85 ng g(-1) w.w. for azithromycin). Consequently, the uptake of pharmaceuticals via the food web could be an important exposure pathway for the wild fish population. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aquatic toxicity of eight preservatives frequently used in personal care products (PCPs) (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, bronopol, diazolidinyl urea, benzalkonium chloride, zinc pyrithione, propylparaben, triclosan and a mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone) was assessed by means of two different approaches: a battery of bioassays composed of single species tests of bacteria (Vibrio fischeri and Pseudomonas putida) and protozoa (Tetrahymena thermophila), and a whole biological community resazurin-based assay using activated sludge. The tested preservatives showed considerable toxicity in the studied bioassays, but with a marked difference in potency. In fact, all biocides except propylparaben and diazolidinyl urea had EC50 values lower than 1 mg L-1 in at least one assay. Risk quotients for zinc pyrithione, benzalkonium chloride, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate and triclosan as well as the mixture of the studied preservatives exceeded 1, indicating a potential risk for the process performance and efficiency of municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). These four single biocides explained more than 95% of the preservative mixture risk in all bioassays. Each individual preservative was also tested in combination with an industrial wastewater (IWW) from a cosmetics manufacturing facility. The toxicity assessment was performed on binary mixtures (preservative + IWW) and carried out using the median-effect principle, which is a special case of the concept of Concentration Addition (CA). Almost 70% of all experiments resulted in EC50 values within a factor of 2 of the values predicted by the median-effect principle (CI values between 0.5 and 2). The rest of the mixtures whose toxicity was mispredicted by CA were assessed with the alternative concept of Independent Action (IA), which showed higher predictive power for the biological community assay. Therefore, the concept used to accurately predict the toxicity of mixtures of a preservative with a complex industrial wastewater depends on degree of biological complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A tertiary treatment step is required in current wastewater treatment plants to remove trace pollutants and thus to prevent their extensive occurrence in the aquatic environment. In this study, natural MnOx ore and natural zeolite were separately used to pack two lab-scale aerated biofilters, which were operated in approximately 1.5 years for the removal of frequently occurring pharmaceuticals, including carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DFC), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), out of synthetic and real secondary effluents. Mn2+ was added in the feeds to promote the growth of iron/manganese oxidizing bacteria which were recently found to be capable of degrading recalcitrant pollutants. An effective removal (80-90%) of DFC and SMX was observed in both biofilters after adaptation while a significant removal of CBZ was not found. Both biofilters also achieved an effective removal of spiked Mn2+, but a limited removal of carbon and nitrogen contents. Additionally, MnOx biofilter removed 50% of UV254 from real secondary effluent, indicating a high potential on the removal of aromatic compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficacy of a fluidized powdered activated carbon (PAC) pilot (CarboPlus (R)) was studied in both nominal (total nitrification + post denitrification) and degraded (partial nitrification + no denitrification) configuration of the Seine Centre WWTP (Colombes, France). In addition to conventional wastewater parameters 54 pharmaceuticals and hormones (PhPHs) and 59 other emerging pollutants were monitored in influents and effluents of the pilot. Thus, the impacts of the WWTP configuration, the process operation and the physico-chemical properties of the studied compounds were assessed in this article.
   Among the 26 PhPHs quantified in nominal WWTP configuration influents, 8 have high dissolved concentrations (>100 ng/L), 11 have an intermediary concentration (10-100 ng/L) and 7 are quantified below 10 nWL. Sulfamethoxazole is predominant (about 30% of the sum of the PhPHs). Overall, 6 PhPHs are poorly to moderately removed (<60%), such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or estrone, while 9 are very well removed (>80%), i.e. beta blockers, carbamazepine or trimethoprim, and 11 are well eliminated (60-80%), i.e. diclofenac, naproxen or sulfamethoxazole.
   In degraded WWTP configuration, higher levels of organic matter and higher concentrations of most pollutants are observed. Consequently, most PhPHs are substantially less removed in percentages but the removed flux is higher. Thus, the PAC dose required to achieve a given removal percentage is higher in degraded WWTP configuration. For the other micropollutants (34 quantified), artificial sweeteners and phthalates are found at particularly high concentrations in degraded WWTP configuration influents, up to mu g/L range. Only pesticides, bisphenol A and parabens are largely eliminated (50-95%), while perfluorinated acids, PAHs, triclosan and sweeteners are not or weakly removed (<50%). The remaining compounds exhibit a very variable fate from campaign to campaign.
   The fresh PAC dose was identified as the most influencing operation parameter and is strongly correlated to performances. Charge and hydrophobicity of compounds have been recognized as crucial for the micropollutant adsorption on PAC, as well as the molecular weight. Finally, a PAC dose of 10 mg/L allows an average removal of 72-80% of the sum of the PhPHs in nominal WWTP configuration. The comparaison of the results with those from the scarce other studies tends to indicate that an extrapolation of them to different PAC processes and to other WWTPs could be possible and relevant, taking into account the differences of water quality from WWTP to WWTP.

AB To preserve environmental and human health, improved treatment processes are needed to reduce nutrients, microbes, and emerging chemical contaminants from domestic wastewater prior to discharge into the environment. Electrocoagulation (EC) treatment is increasingly used to treat industrial wastewater; however, this technology has not yet been thoroughly assessed for its potential to reduce concentrations of nutrients, a variety of microbial surrogates, and personal care products found in domestic wastewater. This investigation's objective was to determine the efficiency of a benchtop EC unit with aluminum sacrificial electrodes to reduce concentrations of the aforementioned biological and chemical pollutants from raw and tertiary-treated domestic wastewater. EC treatment resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.05, alpha = 0.05) in phosphate, all microbial surrogates, and several personal care products from raw and tertiary-treated domestic wastewater. When wastewater was augmented with microbial surrogates representing bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens to measure the extent of reduction, EC treatment resulted in up to 7-log(10) reduction of microbial surrogates. Future pilot and full-scale investigations are needed to optimize EC treatment for the following: reducing nitrogen species, personal care products, and energy consumption; elucidating the mechanisms behind microbial reductions; and performing life cycle analyses to determine the appropriateness of implementation.

AB To date, very few prescriptive studies have been reported in the literature concerning the catalytic removal of pharmaceutical substances in wastewater using H-2 in the presence of O-2 for the in situ formation of H2O2, while the mechanism of the reaction has not been studied in detail yet. Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent used extensively in catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) applications and can be used for the elimination of pharmaceuticals from waste water. In the present work, an attempt has been made to elucidate the actual effects of the in situ production of hydrogen peroxide on the CWAO of pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the effects of the nature of the active phase (Pd, Pt, and Rh), as well as the feed gas composition have been examined toward the reaction at hand. The results showed that 1% Pd/Al2O3 and 1% Rh/Al2O3 are the most effective catalysts for the elimination of paracetamol from the reaction medium using hydrogen-rich streams, having a conversion of up to 70% in 2 h. A maximum conversion of paracetamol of 90% was obtained in just 30 min of reaction over 1 wt.% Rh/Al2O3, when using pure hydrogen in the feed. Total organic carbon measurements performed over the latter catalyst showed that practically no organic carbon is removed from the liquid phase, indicating the conversion of paracetamol to a different organic (probably aromatic) compound, through hydrogenation. Toxicity tests that followed showed a dramatic decrease in the toxicity of the products solution, indicating that paracetamol hydrogenation might be a promising method for the elimination of its toxicity.

AB Denitrification plays a key role in the biological nitrogen removal from the wastewater using granular sludge as the integral part of a high-rate denitrification technology. It is helpful to evaluate the effect of typical organic toxicants on the activity of denitrifying granular sludge for the application of denitrification technology. In this study, four typical organic toxicants, namely, penicillin, chloramphenicol, 2,4-dinitrophenol and polymyxin B sulphate were used to assess the effect of organic toxicants on the activity of denitrifying granular sludge. The results of individual toxicity indicated that penicillin, chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had significant inhibition, whose half-inhibitory concentrations were 0.534, 0.162 and 0.474 g/L with respective inhibitory magnitudes of 90.79%/(g/L), 282.5%/(g/L) and 138.83%/(g/L). Polymyxin B sulphate showed no significant inhibition. The results of combined toxicity indicated that the binary mixture of penicillin and chloramphenicol had an antagonistic effect, both the binary mixture of penicillin and 2,4-dinitrophenol and the binary mixture of chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had additive effects. The ternary mixture of penicillin, chloramphenicol and 2,4-dinitrophenol had a partial additive effect.

AB Effluent organic matter (EfOM), contained in treated municipal wastewater, differs in composition from naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM). The presence of EfOM may thus alter the photochemical production of reactive intermediates in rivers that receive measurable contributions of treated municipal wastewater. Quantum yield coefficients for excited triplet-state OM ((OM)-O-3*) and apparent quantum yields for singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were measured for both whole water samples and OM isolated by solid phase extraction from whole water samples collected upstream and downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges in three rivers receiving differing effluent contributions: Hockanum R., CT (22% (v/v) effluent flow), E. Fork Little Miami R., OH (11%), and Pomperaug R., CT (6%). While only small differences in production of these reactive intermediates were observed between upstream and downstream whole water samples collected from the same river, yields of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) varied by 30-50% between the rivers. Apparent quantum yields of O-1(2) followed similar trends to those of (OM)-O-3*, consistent with (OM)-O-3* as a precursor to O-1(2) formation. Higher (OM)-O-3* reactivity was observed for whole water samples than for OM isolates of the same water, suggesting differential recoveries of photoreactive moieties by solid phase extraction. (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) yields increased with increasing E-2/E-3 ratio (A(254 nm) divided by A(365 nm)) and decreased with increasing electron donating capacities of the samples, thus exhibiting trends also observed for reference hurnic and fulvic acid isolates. Mixing experiments with EfOM and DOM isolates showed evidence of quenching of triplet DOM by EfOM when measured yields were compared to theoretical yields. Together, the results suggest that effluent contributions of up to 25% (v/v) to river systems have a negligible influence on photochemical production of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) apparently because of quenching of triplet DOM by EfOM. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of whole water studies for quantifying in situ photoreactivity, particularly for (OM)-O-3*.

AB Marine clams Ruditapes philippinarum were exposed under laboratory conditions to sediments sampled at five sites affected by wastewater effluents at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain). Contamination and early biological stress were determined. Metabolism and antioxidant system differed according to seasons. Health status diminished in summer. Metabolism of detoxification, and oxidative effect were related to concentration of metals, PAH, secondary alkane sulfonates (SAS) and antibiotics in winter. Antioxidant system and DNA damage were linked to metals and pharmaceutical products. Phase I and antioxidant system were associated to PAH and SAS in summer. Oxidative stress and effects were related to pharmaceuticals. Phase II was linked to metals and pharmaceuticals. Seasonality of sediment contamination by organic compounds and biological responses was determined. Clams were useful bioindicators, since the set of biomarkers applied was validated as potential tools for sediment quality assessment of wastewater discharges areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the innate immunity of goldfish exposed to reuse water, and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, using a real-time flow-through exposure system. The reuse water generated by ultrafiltration of finished wastewater from the municipal wastewater treatment plant was analyzed for the presence of a panel of 20 herbicides/fungicides and 46 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). There was a seasonal variation in the profile and concentrations of xenobiotics in reuse water with lowest levels occurring in the summer. The innate immunity parameters assessed were cytokine (IFN gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF alpha 2), and cytokine receptor (TNFR1, TNFR2, IFNGR1, IFNGR2) gene expression, and phagocytosis of kidney leukocyte subpopulations. Assessment of innate immunity parameters was done after acute (7 days) and sub chronic (30 and 60 days) exposure to reuse water, UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, and activated carbon-treated reuse water (ACT; control), during spring, summer and fall of 2012. Temporal (acute versus sub chronic) as well as seasonal differences in innate immunity of fish exposed to reuse water were observed. The acute exposure of fish to reuse water caused significant down-regulation in cytokine gene expression in different organs of fish (kidney, spleen, liver) and phagocytic ability of different kidney leukocyte subpopulations. The immune gene expression and phagocytosis of kidney leukocytes of fish returned to ACT control levels after sub chronic exposure suggesting that fish have habituated to the reuse water exposure. The changes in gene expression after acute exposure were related to variations in the profile of xenobiotics in reuse water during different seasons. The efficiency of xenobiotic removal using UV/H2O2 ranged between 1.6 and 100% indicating that treatment of reuse water using high dose UV/H2O2 was only partially effective in removing the xenobiotics, as assessed by both chemical analyses and measurement of innate immune responsiveness of the fish. Furthermore, exposure of fish to reuse water and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water generated in the spring and fall caused greater changes in innate immunity after acute exposure, compared to fish exposed to ACT reuse water, indicating that the remediation of reuse water, should be considered in order to protect aquatic and public health.

AB Globally, herbal pharmaceutical industries are among the leading pharmaceutical industries. They generate large volume of wastewater during processing and production, which is highly biodegradable in nature and cannot be discharged into environment as such. Hence efforts are being made to evaluate the toxicity of herbal pharmaceutical effluents using green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda. Physico-chemically treated effluents (PCTEs.) as well as biologically treated effluents (BTEs) were observed after the application of S. quadricauda. Also, S. quadricauda showed higher growth rate after the addition of PCTE and BTE. The highest yield of algae was observed in BTE up to 15 days of incubation by synthesis of chlorophyll and cell metabolites, even with 10-100% dilution of effluents. The present study also discusses the evaluation of biotoxicity and recycling on herbal pharmaceutical wastewater along with heavy metal removal.

TI Capillary Foams: Stabilization and Functionalization of Porous Liquids

AB Liquid foams are two-phase systems in which a large volume of gas is dispersed as bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. These foams are ubiquitous in nature. In addition, they are found in industrial applications, such as pharmaceutical formulation, food processing, wastewater treatment, construction, and cosmetics. Recently, we reported a new type of foam material, capillary foam, which is stabilized by the synergistic action of particles and a small amount of an immiscible secondary liquid. In this study, we explore in more detail the foam preparation routes. To illustrate some of the potential applications, we create vividly colored wet and dried foams, which are difficult to prepare using traditional methods, and load-bearing porous solids. The combined action of particles and immiscible secondary fluid confers exceptional stability to capillary foams and many options for functionalization, suggesting a wide range of possible applications.

AB Ozone has been shown to be effective in the transformation of several chemicals of emerging concern that escape the wastewater treatment process, but there is concern whether toxic transformation products are formed. Two parallel biofilter columns with granular activated carbon (GAC) and filter sand following a pilot-scale ozone unit to treat secondary treated municipal wastewater were studied. Results show reduced wastewater genotoxicity following ozonation and further reduction following biofiltration. The BAC biofilter outperformed the sand biofilter in terms of reduction in both organics and genotoxicity. Biofilter performance correlated with biological indicators (dissolved oxygen reduction and effluent E. coli counts) but not with ATP bioactivity measurements. Limited bacterial (E. coli) regrowth was observed in treated effluent from both biofilters.

AB This study aims to investigate degradation mechanisms and kinetics of phenoxyacetic acid by ozonation in aqueous solution. The optimized operating condition was achieved by phenoxyacetic acid and total organic carbon (TOC) removal based on the studies of the effects of various parameters, such as pH value (4-12), the initial concentration of phenoxyacetic acid (100-2000 mg L-1) and the ozone dosage (16-48 mg min(-1)). A series of intermediates were formed in the ozonation process and detected by GC/MS and HPLC analysis, such as phenyl formate, salicylic acid, phenol, oxalic acid and small molecule acids. A possible degradation pathway of phenoxyacetic acid was proposed. The kinetic analysis showed that phenoxyacetic acid degradation was in slow kinetic regime based on the results of Ha. This paper can provide basic data and theoretical reference for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by ozonation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel visible light driven Ag-Bi2WO6-graphene nanocomposite photocatalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The optimized photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalysts exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with pure Bi2WO6 under simulated solar light. The optimal product, 5 mol% Ag-Bi2WO6-2.5 weight% graphene, showed the highest photocatalytic activity to degrade metoprolol. Metoprolol was 100% eliminated after 2 h simulated solar light irradiation in a solution with photocatalyst amount of 1 mg/mL, suggesting the potential application of this material in wastewater treatment. Eight reaction intermediate products were observed by LC-MS/MS and a tentative pathway of metoprolol degradation was proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sampling and analysis of Water Framework Directive priority chemicals were undertaken in nine urban catchments across the UK. Over 9000 samples were collected from a number of different catchment sources including tap water, domestic waste water, surface water runoff, trade discharges, town centre and light industrial estate wastewaters. Determinands included trace metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), persistent organic pollutants and a number of common pharmaceuticals. Loads of the chemicals from each catchment entering the local wastewater treatment works (WwTW) were estimated and were shown to be relatively consistent between different catchments, after taking population into account. A Monte Carlo mixing model was used to combine the concentrations and flows from the different catchment sources and to predict concentrations and loads entering the WwTW. Based on the model output, the significance of the different sources could be evaluated. The study highlighted the importance of domestic wastewater as a source of contaminants, including metals and trace organic substances (such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), bisphenol A, nonylphenol and tributyl tin (TBT)). Concentrations in trade discharges were important in some locations in the case of nonylphenol, EDTA, TBT, as well as for some metals such as copper, zinc and nickel. Contributions to the total load from town centre and light industrial estate sources were generally less than 10% of the total.

AB The efficiency of wastewater treatment systems in removing pharmaceuticals is often assessed on the basis of the decrease in the concentration of the parent compound. However, what is perceived as "removal" during treatment may not necessarily mean mineralization of the pharmaceutical compound but simply conversion into different transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QToF-MS), we demonstrated conversion of iopromide in wastewater to at least 14 TPs after an advanced oxidation process (AOP) using UV (fluence = 1500 mJ/cm(2)) and H2O2 (10 mg/L). Due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix, the initial experiments were performed using a high concentration (10 mg/L) of iopromide in order to facilitate the identification of TPs. Despite the high concentration of iopromide used, cursory inspection of UV and mass spectra only revealed four TPs in the chromatograms of the post-AOP samples. However, the use of METLIN database and statistics-based profiling tools commonly used in metabolomics proved effective in discriminating between background signals and TPs derived from iopromide. High-resolution mass data allowed one to predict molecular formulas of putative TPs with errors below 5 ppm relative to the observed m/z. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data and isotope pattern comparisons provided necessary information that allowed one to elucidate the structure of iopromide TPs. The presence of the proposed iopromide TPs was determined in unspiked wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, but no iopromide and TPs were detected. Using analogous structural modifications and oxidation that results from the AOP treatment of iopromide, the potential TPs of iopamidol (a structurally similar compound to iopromide) were predicted. The same mass fragmentation pattern observed in iopromide TPs was applied to the predicted iopamidol TPs. LC-QToF-MS revealed the presence of two iopamidol TPs in unspiked AOP-treated wastewater.

AB Long-term irrigation with untreated wastewater can lead to an accumulation of antibiotic substances and antibiotic resistance genes in soil. However, little is known so far about effects of wastewater, applied for decades, on the abundance of IncP-1 plasmids and class 1 integrons which may contribute to the accumulation and spread of resistance genes in the environment, and their correlation with heavy metal concentrations. Therefore, a chronosequence of soils that were irrigated with wastewater from 0 to 100 years was sampled in the Mezquital Valley in Mexico in the dry season. The total community DNA was extracted and the absolute and relative abundance (relative to 16S rRNA genes) of antibiotic resistance genes (tet(W), tet(Q), aadA), class 1 integrons (intl1), quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes (qacE+qacE Delta 1) and IncP-1 plasmids (korB) were quantified by real-time PCR. Except for intll and qacE+qacE Delta 1 the abundances of selected genes were below the detection limit in non-irrigated soil. Confirming the results of a previous study, the absolute abundance of 16S rRNA genes in the samples increased significantly over time (linear regression model, p < 0.05) suggesting an increase in bacterial biomass due to repeated irrigation with wastewater. Correspondingly, all tested antibiotic resistance genes as well as intll and korB significantly increased in abundance over the period of 100 years of irrigation. In parallel, concentrations of the heavy metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr significantly increased. However, no significant positive correlations were observed between the relative abundance of selected genes and years of irrigation, indicating no enrichment in the soil bacterial community due to repeated wastewater irrigation or due to a potential co-selection by increasing concentrations of heavy metals.

AB Comparison of the rejection of trace tetracycline (TC) in the secondary effluent of an anoxic-oxic (AO) system by forward osmosis (FO) was investigated at the mini-lab scale. The effects of different operating conditions including membrane orientation, flow velocity, and draw solution concentration and solute on TC rejection were also explored. The results revealed that TC rejection increased with increasing water flux, but high reverse salt flux may reduce TC rejection through enhanced solution ionic strength. Membranes with a nonwoven structure could reduce TC rejection via increased flow velocity. In the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode, rejection of charged TC was higher than in the FO mode because of enhanced electrostatic repulsion. In addition, the reverse draw solute could hinder the forward diffusion of TC, thus leading to a decline in TC rejection. The cellulose triacetate with embedded polyester screen (CTA-ES) membrane displayed consistently higher TC rejection than that of the cellulose triacetate with a cast nonwoven (CTA-NW) membrane, and the rejection of TC by a thin-film composite with embedded polyester screen (TFC-ES) membrane was relatively lower compared to CTA membranes. These findings provide further insight into TC rejection mechanisms and potentially can be useful for FO process operation in wastewater reclamation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We analyzed 13 psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent and the possibility of their degradation by biological and chemical processes. Tramadol (413-853 ng/L) and methamphetamine (460-682 ng/L) were the most concentrated compounds in the wastewater in winter and summer, respectively. A significant decrease in the concentration of tramadol in wastewater was measured during the summer. The lowest efficiency was observed for tramadol, venlafaxine, citalopram and oxazepam (similar to 10%) and the highest efficiency was observed for amphetamine and THC-COOH (similar to 80%). The efficiency of compound degradation via the Fenton reaction, a modified Fenton reaction and different degradation (by algae, wood-rotting fungi and enzymes at influent versus effluent) was determined. The Fenton reaction and its modification were efficient at eliminating these substances in comparison with the tested biological processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals consumption in Poland is high. One of the most frequently prescribed is cardiovascular drugs. Due to their relatively high hydrophilic properties, they are not completely eliminated during wastewater treatment processes. In contrast to parent compounds, the presence of cardiovascular metabolites is rarely investigated in surface waters.
   The goal of this paper was to develop the methodology for detection of metabolites of selected beta-blockers: metoprolol, bisoprolol and propranolol. These metabolites were obtained by the incubation of parent compounds with S9 rat's liver fraction and used for the development and optimization of the low resolution LC-MS/MS method. Accurate mass spectrometry measurements were applied for validation of this method.
   The incubation of the parent compound with S9 fraction resulted only in propranolol's metabolites generation. However, on the basis of hydroxypropranolol, theoretically transitions for mono- and dihydroxy-metoprolol and bisoprolol derivatives were generated for MRM mode and applied for surface water analysis. The analysis revealed the presence of some of the target metabolites in the Vistula river. This work is the first one proposing the application of biotrasformation in the methodology of low resolution LC-MS-MS analysis of metabolites of cardiovascular drugs in surface water.

AB In this study we analyzed and characterized 29 psychoactive remedies, illicit drugs and their metabolites in single stages of wastewater treatment plants in the capital city of Slovakia. Psychoactive compounds were present within all stages, and tramadol was detected at a very high concentration (706 ng/L). Significant decreases of codeine, THC-COOH, cocaine and buprenorphine concentration were observed in the biological stage. Consequently, we were interested in the possibility of alternative tertiary post-treatment of effluent water with the following aquatic plants: Cabomba caroliniana, Limnophila sessiliflora, Egeria najas and Iris pseudacorus. The most effective plant for tertiary cleansing was I. pseudacorus which demonstrated the best pharmaceutical removal capacity. After 48 h codeine and citalopram was removed with 87% efficiency. After 96 h were all analyzed compounds were eliminated with efficiencies above 58%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nitrifying/denitrifying activated sludge process removes several micropollutants from wastewater by sorption onto sludge and/or biodegradation. The objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate a lab-scale experimental strategy for the determination of partition coefficient and biodegradation constant for micropollutant with an objective of modelling their removal. Four pharmaceutical compounds (ibuprofen, atenolol, diclofenac and fluoxetine) covering a wide hydrophobicity range (log K-ow from 0.16 to 4.51) were chosen. Dissolved and particulate concentrations were monitored for 4 days, inside two reactors working under aerobic and anoxic conditions, and under different substrate feed conditions (biodegradable carbon and nitrogen). We determined the mechanisms responsible for the removal of the target compounds: (i) ibuprofen was biodegraded, mainly under aerobic conditions by cometabolism with biodegradable carbon, whereas anoxic conditions suppressed biodegradation; (ii) atenolol was biodegraded under both aerobic and anoxic conditions (with a higher biodegradation rate under aerobic conditions), and cometabolism with biodegradable carbon was the main mechanism; (iii) diclofenac and fluoxetine were removed by sorption only. Finally, the abilities of our strategy were evaluated by testing the suitability of the parameters for simulating effluent concentrations and removal efficiency at a full-scale plant.

ID PHARMACEUTICALS
AB A risk-based screening exercise was carried out to evaluate the significance of chemicals of emerging concern measured in water and sediment of the Great Lakes Basin. Chemical classes included pesticides, pharmaceuticals, organic wastewater constituents, nonylphenol ethoxylates, perfluorinated surfactants, chlorinated paraffins, synthetic musks and flame retardants. Maximum measured concentrations were compared to benchmarks selected or developed to reflect a conservative no-effect level and/or the lowest-effect level. These benchmarks reflected traditional effect information such as survival, growth and reproduction. From this analysis, several pesticides, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nonylphenol ethoxylates were identified as potential concerns and needs for further work were identified. Five of these chemicals (all pesticides) were identified in waters of both the US and Canada (azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and metolachlor). Chlopyrifos, malathion and metolachlor are still registered for use in both jurisdictions; diazinon is registered for use only in the US and azinphos-methyl is not registered for use in either jurisdiction, reflecting the persistence of these chemicals. The results of this screening exercise also were compared to those of several other studies, revealing some common chemicals. Although there are several uncertainties and data gaps in the benchmarks and monitoring data used in the current screening exercise, the results of this risk-based screening can be used by agencies for priority setting, program development, and to support ongoing collaborative research and monitoring programs.

AB Municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) contains emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that have estrogenic properties. PPCPs are thought to be responsible for feminization of male fish in heavily urbanized areas around the globe. While many observations of feminized male fish have been made, the impact of feminization on reproductive success is not well understood. To address this lack of knowledge of the impacts of feminization, we examined the reproductive fitness of rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum), a fish that is also known to have been feminized in some reaches of the Grand River, Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In order to assess their reproductive health, somatic indices, gonadal steroid production, fecundity, and histological severity of intersex were measured in male rainbow darter collected through an urban gradient. Reproductive fitness was assessed by stripping milt and eggs from wild spawning fish, fertilizing eggs manually, and rearing embryos to hatch. The fertilization success and survival of embryos to hatch were compared among sites. In this study, it was found that rainbow darter collected at sites near a large municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) had decreased gonad size, increased severity of intersex, and decreased androgen production relative to other sites. Fish collected near the largest MWWTP also had lower fertilization success and survival to hatch. In contrast, fish collected near a second MWWTP farther upstream had comparable fertilization success, but lower survival to hatch relative to the upstream rural reference site. Intersex severity was negatively correlated with fertilization success, but not survival to hatch, suggesting that intersex is a good indicator of a population's fertilization success. Further investigation is required in order to determine if feminization will impact the sustainability of wild populations of fish. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sexual disruption in wild fish has been linked to the contamination of river systems with steroid oestrogens, including the pharmaceutical 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, originating from domestic wastewaters. As analytical chemistry has advanced, more compounds derived from the human use of pharmaceuticals have been identified in the environment and questions have arisen as to whether these additional pharmaceuticals may also impact sexual disruption in fish. Indeed, pharmaceutical anti-androgens have been shown to induce such effects under laboratory conditions. These are of particular interest since anti-androgenic biological activity has been identified in the aquatic environment and is potentially implicated in sexual disruption alone and in combination with steroid oestrogens. Consequently, predictive modelling was employed to determine the concentrations of two anti-androgenic human pharmaceuticals, bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate, in UK sewage effluents and river catchments and their combined impacts on sexual disruption were then assessed in two fish models. Crucially, fish were also exposed to the anti-androgens in combination with steroid oestrogens to determine whether they had any additional impact on oestrogen induced feminisation. Modelling predicted that the anti-androgenic pharmaceuticals were likely to be widespread in UK river catchments. However, their concentrations were not sufficient to induce significant responses in plasma vitellogenin concentrations, secondary sexual characteristics or gross indices in male fathead minnow or intersex in Japanese medaka alone or in combination with steroid oestrogens. However, environmentally relevant mixtures of oestrone, 17 beta-oestradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol did induce vitellogenin and intersex, supporting their role in sexual disruption in wild fish populations. Unexpectedly, a male dominated sex ratio (100% in controls) was induced in medaka and the potential cause and implications are briefly discussed, highlighting the potential of non-chemical modes of action on this endpoint.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of triclosan in the tropical rivers where received the effluents from a hospital wastewater treatment plant (HWWTP) in southern Taiwan. Three and ten sampling sites were selected at the Jiaosu River (S0-S2) and Dian-Bao River (S3-S12), respectively. The samples of the HWWTP influent, effluent and receiving river water and sediment were collected and analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Results showed that the triclosan level in surface water of the Jiaosu River and Dian-Bao River ranged from 3 to 68 ng/L and ranged from <2.7 to 51 ng/L, respectively. The hospital did contribute a loading of triclosan to the neighboring river. The mean value of triclosan concentration in the downstream surface water of the Jiaosu River (S1 20.2 ng/L) was approximately three times higher than that of the background level (S0 6.0 ng/L) (p=0.011). The concentrations of triclosan in two surface water samples were over the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 50 ng/L for algae. In addition, significant seasonal differences of triclosan in surface water of Jiaosu River (p=0.020) and the HWWTP effluents (p=0.302) were also observed. The concentrations of triclosan in sediments of these two rivers seemed stable. On average, triclosan was detected in 86 % of the sediment samples with a range from <1.1 to 13 ng/g. Triclosan in surface water and sediments of the tropical rivers might be rapidly photolyzed due to plenty of sunshine. It is worth to further investigate the occurrence and fate of triclosan photoproduct in the aquatic environment of the tropics.

AB Sewage input into a karst aquifer via leaking sewers and cesspits was investigated over five years in an urbanized catchment. Of 66 samples, analyzed for 25 pharmaceuticals, 91% indicated detectable concentrations. The former standard iodinated X-ray contrast medium (ICM) diatrizoic acid was detected most frequently. Remarkably, it was found more frequently in groundwater (79%, median: 54 ng/l) than in wastewater (21%, 120 ng/l), which is supposed to be the only source in this area. In contrast, iopamidol, a possible substitute, spread over the aquifer during the investigation period whereas concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher in wastewater than in groundwater. Knowledge about changing application of pharmaceuticals thus is essential to assess urban impacts on aquifers, especially when applying mass balances. Since correlated concentrations provide conclusive evidence that, for this catchment, nitrate in groundwater rather comes from urban than from rural sources, ICM are considered useful tracers.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation in arid and hot climates where plant transpiration is high may affect plant accumulation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this study, carrot, lettuce, and tomato plants were grown in solution containing 16 PPCP/EDCs in either a cool-humid or a warm-dry environment. Leaf bio-concentration factors (BCF) were positively correlated with transpiration for chemical groups of different ionized states (p <0.05). However, root BCFs were correlated with transpiration only for neutral PPCP/EDCs (p <0.05). Neutral and cationic PPCP/EDCs showed similar accumulation, while anionic PPCP/EDCs had significantly higher accumulation in roots and significantly lower accumulation in leaves (p < 0.05). Results show that plant transpiration may play a significant role in the uptake and translocation of PPCP/EDCs, which may have a pronounced effect in arid and hot climates where irrigation with treated wastewater is common.

AB Three tributaries of the Fuyang River System, North China (Shaocun River-SR, Wangyang River-WR and Xiao River-XR), were selected for a case study evaluating the effect of industrialization on the accumulation of sedimentary trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), as well as the potential ecological risk (PER). This study showed that different pollution sources resulted in varying sedimentary trace metal characteristics and caused tremendously high metal contents. SR had high mean sedimentary Cr (1,588 mg/kg) and Zn (958 mg/kg) contents due to tannery wastewater discharge, while high mean contents of Zn (493 mg/kg) and Pb (481 mg/kg) were observed in the sediments from WR which received pharmaceutical wastewater, and high Cr (822 mg/kg) and Zn (695 mg/kg) contents were attributed to domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater effluent to XR. The highest mean content of Cd (6.69 mg/kg) was observed in XR, Cr (1,588 mg/kg) in SR and Pb (481 mg/kg) in WR. Enrichment factors indicated that Cd in XR, Pb in WR and Cr in SR were enriched largely due to the fast industrialization in the watershed, with the average values of 47.8, 37.0 and 17.6, respectively. The calculation of comprehensive PER indices revealed that there was serious ecological risk in XR due to high Cd contents, whereas moderate risk existed in WR and low risk in SR. Hence, sedimentary trace metal pollution resulting from regional industrialization should be taken into consideration seriously with respect to aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and ambient quality.

AB Recently, a new type of organic pollution derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is gradually on the rise. Wastewater treatment to remove PPCPs was investigated using an aerobic granular sludge sequencing bioreactor (GSBR). After optimization of influent organic load, hydraulic shear stress, sludge settling time, etc., aerobic granular sludge was analyzed for its physiological and biochemical characteristics and tested for its efficacy to remove PPCPs wastewater. The granular sludge effectively removed some but not all of the PPCPs tested; removal correlated with the microbial profiles in the granules, as assessed using Solexa sequencing technology. Sequencing revealed the presence of five phylogenetic groups: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, an unclassified genus, and Zoogloea. The results demonstrated changes in the microbial profiles with time in response to the presence of PPCPs. The effects of PPCPs on microbial communities in granular sludge process are discussed.

AB The aim of this study is to synthesise indigenously the hybrid materials and their efficient use to treat the wastewater contaminated with one of important micro-pollutant diclofenac. The hybrid materials are obtained modifying the commercial bentonite (B) and locally collected clay (LC) with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) as to obtain the organo-modified clay samples (BH and LCH). Moreover, the B and LC clay samples are pillared with aluminium and modified with the HDTMA as to obtain inorgano-organo-modified clay hybrid materials (viz, BAH and LCAH solids). The hybrid materials are characterised by the XRD (X-ray diffraction) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red) analytical methods and the surface morphology is obtained by the FE-SEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) images of these solids. pH(pzc) (Point of Zero Charge) of these solids is obtained by acid base titrations. Further, these materials are assessed in the efficient and effective treatment of aquatic environment contaminated with diclofenac sodium under the batch and fixed-bed column reactor operations. Batch data is obtained for various physico-chemical parametric studies viz., the effect of solution pH (3.8-10.0), sorptive concentrations (1.0-20.0 mg/L), and background electrolyte concentrations (0.0001-0.1 mol/L NaCl). The kinetics of the uptake of diclofenac by these solids is conducted using the pseudo-first, pseudo-second and fractal-like-pseudo-second order non-linear rate equations. The rate constants along with the removal capacity are, therefore, estimated. Further, the fixed-bed column reactor operations are performed to obtain the loading capacity of column for diclofenac under the dynamic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To predict the likely effects of management action on any point source discharge into the coastal ocean, it is essential to understand both the composition of the effluent and the environmental conditions in the receiving waters. We illustrate a broadly-applicable approach to evaluating the comprehensive environmental footprint of a discharge, using regional geochemical budgets and nearfleld monitoring. We take as a case study municipal effluent discharged into the Strait of Georgia (west coast of Canada), where there has been public controversy over the discharge of screened or primary-treated effluent directly into the ocean. Wastewater contributes <= 1% of the nitrogen, organic carbon and oxygen demand in the Strait and is unlikely to cause eutrophication, harmful algal blooms or hypoxia in this region. Metals (Hg, Pb, Cd) are controlled by natural cycles augmented by past mining and urbanization, with 0.3-5% of the flux contributed by wastewater. Wastewater contributes similar to 5% of PCBs but <= 60% of PBDEs and is likely also important for pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Effects of high organic flux on benthos are measurable in the immediate receiving environment The availability of particle-active contaminants to enter the food chain depends on how long those contaminants remain in the sediment surface mixed layer before burial. Secondary treatment, slated for completion in Vancouver in 2030, will reduce fluxes of some contaminants, but will have negligible effect on regional budgets for organic carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, metals and PCBs. Removal of PBDEs from wastewater will affect regional budgets, depending on how the sludge is sequestered. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemically activated and carbonized adsorbents were prepared from Moringa oleifera pod husks (MOP), characterized and evaluated for their ability to remove a common antibiotic - ofloxacin (OFX) from aqueous solution. The pulverized precursor was steeped in a saturated ammonium chloride solution for a day to give the chemically activated adsorbent (AMOP). A portion of AMOP was pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace at 623 K for 30 min to furnish its carbonized analogue (CMOP). The adsorbents showed favorable physicochemical attributes. The effects of operational parameters such as initial OFX solution pH and concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature and contact time on OFX removal were investigated. At equilibrium, optimal removal efficiencies of 90.98% and 99.84% were achieved at solution pH 5 for AMOP and CMOP, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption data fitted into both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(o)), enthalpy change (Delta H-o) and entropy change (Delta S-o) indicated that the adsorption of OFX was feasible, spontaneous, exothermic and occurred via the physisorption mode. Adsorption kinetics obeyed the Blanchard pseudo-second-order model. The results may find applications in the adsorptive removal of micro-contaminants of pharmaceutical origin from wastewater.

AB Clofibric acid (CA) is an active metabolite of the blood lipid lowering agent clofibrate, a pharmaceutical designed to work as agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa). It is the most commonly reported fibrate in aquatic environments with low degradation rate and potential environmental persistence. Previous fish exposures showed that CA may impact spermatogenesis, growth and the expression of fat binding protein genes. However, there are limited data on the effects of chronic multigenerational CA exposures.
   Here, we assessed chronic multigenerational effects of CA exposure using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a teleost model. Zebrafish were exposed through the diet to CA (1 and 10 mg/g) during their whole lifetime. Growth, reproduction-related parameters and embryonic development were assessed in the exposed fish (F1 generation) and their offspring (F2 generation), together with muscle triglyceride content and gonad histology. In order to study the potential underlying mechanisms, the transcription levels of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism pathways were determined.
   The results show that chronic life-cycle exposure to CA induced a significant reduction in growth of F1 generation and lowered triglyceride muscle content (10 mg/g group). Also, an impact in male gonad development was observed together with a decrease in the fecundity (10 mg/g group) and higher frequency of embryo abnormalities in the offspring of fish exposed to the lowest CA dose.
   The profile of the target genes was sex- and tissue-dependent. In F1 an up-regulation of male hepatic pparaa, pparb and acox transcript levels was observed, suggesting an activation of the fatty acid metabolism (provided that transcript level change indicates also a protein level change). Interestingly, the F2 generation, raised with control diet, displayed a response pattern different from that observed in F1, showing an increase in weight in the descendants of CA exposed fish, in comparison with control animals, which points to a multigenerational effect.

AB In spite of the quantities and species of chemicals dramatically increased with rapid economic growth in China in the last decade, the focus of environmental research was mainly on limited number of priority pollutants. Therefore, to elucidate environmental pollution by organic micro-pollutants, this work was conducted as the first systematic survey on the occurrence of 1300 substances in 20 surface water samples of Tianjin, North China, selected as a representative area of China. The results showed the presence of 227 chemicals. The most relevant compounds in terms of frequency of detection and median concentration were bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (100%; 0.26 mu g L-1), siduron (100%; 0.20 mu g L-1), lidocaine (100%; 96 ng L-1), antipyrine (100%; 76 ng L-1), caffeine (95%; 0.28 mu g L-1), cotinine (95%; 0.201 mu g L-1), phenanthrene (95%; 0.17 mu g L-1), metformin (90%; 0.61 mu g L-1), diethyl phthalate (90%; 0.19 mu g L-1), quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (90%; 0.14 mu g L-1), 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole (85%; 0.11 mu g L-1) and anthraquinone (85%; 54 ng L-1). Cluster analysis discriminated three highly polluted sites from others based on data similarity. Principle component analysis identified four factors, corresponding to industrial wastewater, domestic discharge, tire production and atmospheric deposition, accounting for 78% of the total variance in the water monitoring data set. This work provides a wide reconnaissance on broad spectrum of organic micro-contaminants in surface waters in China, which indicates that the aquatic environment in China has been polluted by a large number of chemicals.

AB The distribution and seasonal variation of fifteen antibiotics belonging to three classes (sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines) were investigated in Lake Chaohu, China. The concentrations of the selected antibiotics in the surface water, eight major inflowing rivers and sewage treatment plant (STP) samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin were the predominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 95.6 and 383.4 ng L-1, respectively, in the river samples. In Lake Chaohu, the western inflowing rivers (the Nanfei and Shiwuli Rivers) were the primary import routes for the antibiotics, and the domestic effluent from four STPs were considered the primary source of the antibiotics. The level of antibiotics in Lake Chaohu clearly varied with seasonal changes, and the highest detectable frequencies and mean concentrations were found during the winter. The quality of water downstream of Lake Chaohu was influenced by the lake, and the results of risk assessment of the antibiotics on aquatic organisms suggested that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in the surface water of Lake Chaohu and inflowing rivers might pose a high risk to algae and plants.

AB Adverse effects of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on sediment quality at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain) were evaluated by a battery of acute bioassays and chemical contamination. Five sites directly affected by WWTPs effluents and one control site were chosen. Results evidenced clear deterioration of ecological sediment quality parameters and possible effects on aquatic communities towards WWTPs areas. Acute toxicity and chemical contamination varied significantly across the studied sites and differed between winter and summer seasons. The Bay of Cadiz is contaminated by PAHs, metals, detergents (SAS) and pharmaceutical products. Principal Component Analyses indicated metals, SAS and pharmaceutical products as the major environmental stresses. Sea-urchin embryo-larval and microalgae growth rate were the most sensitive bioassays to evaluate resuspension of contaminants (elutriate) from bulk sediment. Amphipods mortality and Microtox (R) solid phase test bioassays were recommended to evaluate bulk sediment quality. Therefore, the use of multiple-bioassays, sensitive to sediment pollution, may provide complementary information to diagnose environmental factors that can impair aquatic communities. The battery of bioassays is recommended to assess and monitor marine sediments directly affected by a mixture of contaminants released from WWTPs.

AB The performance of electrocoagulation (EC) process, a non-specific electrochemical technology, was investigated for the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, from water. Experiments were carried out in synthetic wastewater in a batch cell. The respective influences of some key process parameters were studied, such as mixing conditions, initial pH, and current on aluminium electrodes. Experimental results showed that a CBZ removal efficiency of 62% was observed under slightly acidic initial conditions (pH 4) with a current density as high as 44 mA cm(-2) (I= 4.5 A) using Al electrode. This clearly indicates that CBZ removal proceeds through an electrochemical mechanism, while the adsorption of CBZ onto the aluminum hydroxide flocs was shown to be negligible. Furthermore, the increase of initial pH to alkaline values was shown to decrease the drug elimination efficiency. Conversely, as expected, an increase of current intensity improved the removal of CBZ. As a result, low initial pH 4 coupled with high current elevates the electrochemical elimination of CBZ: in this case, one metabolite could also be detected.

AB Pharmaceuticals removal from urban wastewater by coupling conventional sand filtration with graphene adsorption reactor (GAR) was investigated. During GAR regime phase, the percentage removal of the four investigated pharmaceuticals, (namely caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) was higher than 95% (98.2, 97.0, 95.5 and 97.0%, respectively). In spite of the high initial concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals (10 mg/L each) and 4 months of experimentation (62 days of adsorption treatment), typical breakthrough adsorption curves were not observed. Graphene adsorption treatment effectively decreased toxicity to Daphnia magna (0-50% immobilization), but only a slight improvement in germination index (phyto-toxicity tests) was observed after GAR treatment. Finally, graphene performances were compared with conventional (granular activated carbon) adsorption process, and the best performance in the removal of pharmaceutical mixture was quite poor (62% in terms of UV absorbance) compared to GAR (96%).

DE Mung bean husk; Ranitidine; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Equilibrium;
   Kinetics; Thermodynamics
AB Pharmaceutical compound possessing eco-toxicological effects in the aqueous system have been a growing concern over the few decades. The present work investigates the use of low cost mung bean husk (MBH), an agriculturalwaste, for the preparation of superheated steam activated carbon towards removal of ranitidine hydrochloride (RH) from synthetic wastewater. The adsorbent was examined as a function of dosage (0.010-1 g), pH (2-12), agitation (40-120 rpm) and temperature (303-318 K) for the optimization of operational parameters. The experimental equilibrium data were evaluated by non linear Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Redlich-Peterson models. The Sips model was found to express high level of agreement with experimental data. The maximum sorption of 100 ppm RH onto MBH derived steam activated carbon (MBH-SAC) was estimated to be 99.16% at 298 K. The kinetic study conducted at four temperatures indicates that the adsorption process follows the fractionary order kinetics. A negative value (-11.307 kJ mol (1)) of enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) suggests that the adsorption process was exothermic. Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees) confirms that the reaction of the adsorption process was spontaneous and feasible in nature. The results suggest that MBH-AC can be used as an efficient and low cost adsorbent for the removal of RH from aqueous solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The merits of the sonophotolysis as a combination of sonolysis (US) and photolysis (UV/H2O2 are investigated in a pilot-scale external loop airlift sonophotoreactor for the treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater (SPWW). In the first part of this study, the multivariate experimental design is carried out using Box-Behnken design (BBD). The effluent is characterized by the total organic carbon (TOC) percent removal as a surrogate parameter. The results indicate that the response of the TOC percent removal is significantly affected by the synergistic effects of the linear term of H2O2 dosage and ultrasound power with the antagonistic effect of quadratic term of H2O2 dosage. The statistical analysis of the results indicates a satisfactory prediction of the system behavior by the developed model. In the second part of this study, a novel rigorous mathematical model for the sonophotolytic process is developed to predict the TOC percent removal as a function of time. The mathematical model is based on extensively accepted sonophotochemical reactions and the rate constants in advanced oxidation processes. A good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data indicates that the proposed model could successfully describe the sonophotolysis of the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging environmental pollutants, which, in addition to direct deposition processes, can find their way into surface soils through the agricultural application of sewage sludge and irrigation practices using contaminated wastewater. Therefore, it is important to assess the extent to which soils are able to retain PPCPs and to prevent their downward migration towards groundwaters.
   To further our understanding in this area, batch sorption experiments and artificial rainwater leaching experiments have been performed using five compounds (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol, diclofenac and triclosan) possessing a range of physicochemical properties in two soils with differing acidities and organic carbon contents.
   The determined K (oc) values for triclosan and diclofenac consistently demonstrated their lower potential mobilities in both soils. The predicted high mobility of chloramphenicol is supported by its efficient leaching potential (89-100 %) in both soils whereas bezafibrate, diclofenac and carbamazepine demonstrate slightly lower affinities for the leachate (61-96 %) for soil A and are strongly retained (> 99 %) by soil B. The amount of PPCP in the leachate, the rate of leaching and the depth of soil penetration are explained in terms of the soil characteristics and the properties of the individual PPCPs (such as solubility and pK(a)) with soil organic content being shown to be a critical factor controlling the ability of a soil to retain a PPCP in the surface layers.
   The findings contribute to the scientific knowledge required by practitioners and regulators as they consider future subsoil contamination by PPCPs and subsequent possible threats to groundwater resources and surface water habitats.

AB Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pollution in animal feeding farms received more public attention recently. Livestock wastewater contains large quantities of antibiotics and ARGs even after traditional lagoon treatment. In this study, the performance of vertical up-flow constructed wetlands (VUF-CWs) on swine wastewater containing tetracycline compounds (TCs) and tet genes was evaluated based on three aspects, TCs and tet genes removal efficiencies, residual TCs and tet genes in soils and plants, and the effect of TCs accumulation on nutrients removal and tet genes development. High removal efficiencies (69.0-99.9%) were achieved for oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC) and chlortetracycline (CTC) with or without OTC spiked in the influent additionally. TCs concentrations in surface soils increased at first two sampling periods and then decreased after plants were harvested. Satisfactory nutrients removal efficiencies were also obtained, but TN and NH4-N removal efficiencies were significantly negative correlated with total concentration of TCs (Sigma TCs) in the soils (p < 0.01). The absolute abundances of all the target genes (tetO, tetM, tetW, tetA, tetX and intI1) were greatly reduced with their log units ranging from 0.26 to 3.3. However, the relative abundances of tetO, tetM and tetX in some effluent samples were significantly higher than those in the influent (p < 0.05). The relative abundances of tet genes except for tetO were significantly correlated with Sigma TCs in the soils (p < 0.05). In summary, the proposed VUF-CWs are effective alternative for the removal of TCs and tet genes. But it is of great importance to prevent large accumulation of TCs in the soils.

AB Many pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products (TPs) are not efficiently removed from wastewater treatment plants and enter into surface waters. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and behavior of metformin, one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide, and its biological transformation product guanylurea, in eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Greece. All WWTPs were equipped with conventional activated sludge treatment and the samples were taken from the influents and the effluents, over the four seasons of one year. The analytical method developed based on SPE followed by LC-UV/Vis-ESI/MS analysis, while positive findings were confirmed also by means of LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. High polarity of both compounds led to the extraction with Oasis HLB and the use of the anionic surfactant SDS. The results showed that metformin dominated in the influents (bql-1167 ng/L), while guanylurea in the effluents (bql-627 ng/L) of the wastewater treatment plants, with Metformin/Guanylurea ratio ranging between 0.88 and 81.3 in the influents and between 0.005 and 0.78 in the effluents. Lack of a clear seasonal tendency in the occurrence and removal or formation was observed. Finally, an ecotoxicological risk assessment of metformin in effluent wastewaters took place by calculating the ratio between the environmental concentrations (MEG) and the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). Despite the fact that metformin presented low risk in all cases, an environmental concern is suspected for guanylurea since it is continuously released into the aquatic environment.

AB A dispersive liquid-liquid micellar microextraction (DLLMME) method coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using Diode Array Detector (DAD) detector was developed for the analysis of five pharmaceutical compounds of different nature in wastewaters. A micellar solution of a surfactant, polidocanol, as extraction solvent (100L) and chloroform as dispersive solvent (200L) were used to extract and preconcentrate the target analytes. Samples were heated above critical temperature and the cloudy solution was centrifuged. After removing the chloroform, the reduced volume of surfactant was then injected in the UHPLC system. In order to obtain high extraction efficiency, the parameters affecting the liquid-phase microextraction, such as time and temperature extraction, ionic strength and surfactant and organic solvent volume, were optimized using an experimental design. Under the optimized conditions, this procedure allows enrichment factors of up to 47-fold. The detection limit of the method ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 mu g/L for the different pharmaceuticals. Relative standard deviations were <26% for all compounds. The procedure was applied to samples from final effluent collected from wastewater treatment plants in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), and two compounds were measured at 67 and 113 mu g/L in one of them.

AB The extraction of endocrine disrupting compound propylpraben (PP) from aqueous solution by emulsion liquid membrane was investigated. The ELM contains trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as extractant, n-hexane as solvent and Span 80 as surfactant. Na2CO3 was used as internal aqueous phase. The effects of operating parameters for the ELM process were examined. It was possible to perfectly remove all of PP molecules from the external feed solution by using the best experimental conditions. ELM treatment process represents an efficient advanced separation technique for the removal of PP even from complex matrices such as natural water, seawater and sewage water effluent.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing drug which is used widely in Europe and North America. In the environment, it is found as a persistent and recalcitrant contaminant, being one of the most prominent hazardous pharmaceuticals and personal care products in effluents of wastewater treatment plants. Phragmites australis is one of the species with both, the highest potential of detoxification and phytoremediation. It has been used successfully in the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater. Recently, the identification of endophytic microorganisms from different plant species growing in contaminated sites has provided a list of candidates which could be used as bio-inoculants for bioremediation of difficult compounds. In this study, Phragmites australis plants were exposed to 5 mg/L of carbamazepine. After 9 days the plants had removed 90% of the initial concentration. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from these plants and further characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the majority of these isolates belong to three groups: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Carbamazepine uptake and plant growth promoting (PGP) traits were analyzed among the isolates. Ninety percent of the isolates produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and all of them possess at least one of the PGP traits tested. One isolate identified as Chryseobacterium taeanense combines good carbamazepine uptake and all of the PGP traits. Rhizobium daejeonense can remove carbamazepine and produces 23 mu g/mL of IAA. Diaphorobacter nitroreducens and Achromobacter mucicolens are suitable for carbamazepine removal while both, Pseudomonas veronii and Pseudomonas lini show high siderophore production and phosphate solubilization. Alone or in combination, these isolates might be applied as inoculates in constructed wetlands in order to enhance the phytoremediation of carbamazepine during wastewater treatment.

TI Occurrence of Halogenated Transformation Products of Selected

AB Final effluent samples from 10 southern California (United States) wastewater treatment facilities, employing four distinct treatment schemes, were surveyed for selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), alkylphenols, and 21 of their halogenated disinfection byproducts. Chlorinated and brominated standards and isotopically labeled internal standards were synthesized and purified to confirm and more accurately quantify selected disinfection byproducts of salicylic acid, bisphenol A, gemfibrozil, naproxen, diclofenac, technical 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of parent compounds ranged from <10 to 3830 ng/L (gemfibrozil), and those of chloro/bromo byproducts ranged from <4 to 370 ng/L (dibromo nonylphenol). The highest concentrations of parent compounds were measured in effluent that was not subjected to tertiary treatment. The chlorinated and brominated byproduct concentration may be affected by the influent concentration of parent compounds, hydraulic retention times, and chlorine contact times. Salicylic acid was readily halogenated, which is evident from the ratio of halogenated to nonhalogenated species. There were no measured chlorinated byproducts of bisphenol A despite occasionally high concentrations of the parent compound. Not surprisingly, higher concentrations of most brominated species were measured in the treatment plant with the highest bromide concentrations. These results demonstrate the occurrence of novel halogenated byproducts of PPCPs that have limited toxicological data and significant uncertainty with regard to their risk to ecological systems.
