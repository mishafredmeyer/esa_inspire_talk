AB A diverse mix of micropollutants. including pesticides, biocides, and pharmaceuticals, reaches the aquatic environment through treated sewage effluents. We sampled 21 final effluents with polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and investigated to what extent chemical analyses of six photosystem II (PS-II) inhibitors and 12 other chemicals explain the toxic burdens quantified with two bioassays Baseline toxicity equivalent concentrations (TEQ) were determined with a bacterial bioluminescence inhibition assay using Vibrio fischeri (baseline-TEQ(bacteria)) and by assessing toxicity on algal growth using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (baseline-TEQ(algae)). Inhibition PS-II was also determined with algae and expressed using chiffon equivalent concentrations (DEQ(bio)) Concentrations of chemicals and toxicities varied appreciably between effluents, typically spanning two orders of magnitude Across 21 independent effluents, a DEQ calculated by concentration addition of PS-II inhibitors (DEQ(chem)) proved a very good predictor of DEQ(bio):DEQ(chem) explained 65% of DEQ(bio) However, baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) correlated poorly with baseline-TEQ(algae,bio), because baseline-TEQ(algae) were strongly influenced by PS-II inhibitors Using data on the 18 quantified compounds, and then estimated toxicities in the bacterial assay, we calculated a baseline-TEQ(bacteria,chem). With one exception, a site with a high load of diclofenac, less than 1% of baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) was explained by the analyzed chemicals. We conclude that for the analyses of final effluents. DEQ(bio) is a robust endpoint and useful screening tool for PS-II inhibitors; in the presence of herbicides, baseline-TEQ(bacteria,bio) proves a more robust measure of baseline toxicity than baseline-TEQ(algae,bio).

(2) treatment in drinking water treatment plants, (3) ecological effects, and (4) health effects and characterized using 7 attributes prevalence, frequency of detection, removal, bioaccumulation, ecotoxicity (for fish, daphnid, and algae aquatic indicator species), pregnancy effects, and health effects. The health effects attribute was characterized using 7 sub-attributes carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, impairment of fertility, central nervous system acting, endocrine effects, immunotoxicity, and developmental effects Rank scores of EOCs were calculated as summations of multiplications of importance weights and utility functions of multiple criteria and were arranged to highlight EOCs needing immediate attention Two different ranking lists of EOCs were developed for U S finished drinking water and stream water/source water and observed to differ with each other, indicating the effect of water type on ranking of EOCs A ranking list of priority EOCs, developed using a particular criterion, was observed to differ with that, developed using multiple criteria. Health effects and treatment criteria were observed to be important criteria influencing overall data gap rank scores and need further data collection The generalized nature of the system could he customized for specific geographical locations (occurrence information and importance weights of different components) The developed database of the EOCRank system is available on http //www egr msu edu/-xagorara/research html) (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB A novel Arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (nAES) assay has been developed for detection of estrogenic activity in various liquid samples such as wastewater, seawater, brackish water and swine urine Two bio-components were engineered to co-express the human estrogen receptor alpha (hER alpha) and an inducible reporter gene: either the non-conventional phytase gene (phyK, derived from Klebsiella sp ASR1) or the non-conventional tannase gene (ATAN1, derived from Am:a) Both reporters were put under the control of an Arxula derived glucoamylase (GM) promoter, which was modified by the insertion of two estrogen-responsive elements (EREs). The Arxula transformation/expression platform Xplor (R) 2, which lacks resistance markers and E. coli elements, was used to select stable mitotic transformants They were then analyzed for robustness and suitability as the bio-component for the nAES assay Two types of the nAES assay based on the reporter proteins phytase and tannase (nAES-P, nAES-T) were used in this work. The nAES-P type is more suitable for the analysis of seawater, brackish water and urine whereas the nAES-T type exhibited higher robustness to NaCl Both assay types have similar characteristics for the determination of estrogen in sewage and urine samples e g 6-25 h assay period with detection and determination limits and EC50 values for 17 beta-estradiol of 2 8 ng L-1, 5 9 ng L-1. 33 2 ng L-1 (nAES-P) and 3 1 ng L-1, 6 7 ng L-1 and 394 ng L-1 (nAES-T) Substrate specificity and analytical measurement range (AMR) for both assay types are also similar These characteristics show that the nAES assay based on non-conventional salt tolerant yeast is applicable for a high throughput estrogen analysis in the environmental and regulatory control sectors (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB The occurrence of nine different types of pharmaceuticals and caffeine were analyzed in various units of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving rivers in Beijing, China. Analyte concentrations were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatograph-tandem quadruple mass spectrometers (UPLC-MS/MS) and multiple-reaction monitoring. The studied pharmaceuticals and caffeine were found in all the WWTPs and receiving rivers. Their concentrations in the WWTP influents varied from 38 ng/L of sulpiride to 89.5 mu g/L of caffeine, and those in the effluents ranged from 27 ng/L of sulpiride to 2.7 mu g/L of erythromycin. Typically, the biological treatment appeared more effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals and caffeine than primary treatment in a WWTP. For an individual compound, the overall removal efficiency varied from one WWTP to the next. Mean values ranged from no removal of carbamazepine to 99.8% removal of caffeine. Most of the compounds in the receiving rivers were present at similar or higher concentrations compared to those in the WWTP effluents. The data set for this study does not include variations in concentrations along receiving waters because there were other point and nonpoint sources discharging to these rivers. The preliminary aquatic environmental risk assessment showed that carbamazepine, erythromycin, and trimethoprim is a potential chronic environmental risk in water bodies in Beijing, China, and is worth further investigation.

AB Many pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are being found in surface and ground waters, indicating their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes for the transformation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid in water are alternatives to traditional water treatment. Therefore the kinetics of oxidation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid by diperiodatoargentate(III) in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.04 mol dm(-3) was studied spectrophotometrically at 25 degrees C. The oxidation products, 2-formyl-5,5-dimethylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and Ag(I), were identified by LC-ESI-MS and IR spectral studies. The reaction between 6-aminopenicillanic acid and diperiodatoargentate(1111) in alkaline medium exhibits I: I stoichiometry. The reaction shows first order with respect to diperiodatoargentate(III) concentration. The order with respect to 6-aminopenicillanic acid and alkali concentrations is less than unity. The rate goes on decreasing with the increase in the concentration of periodate. Monoperiodatoargentate(III) is considered the active species of the diperiodatoargentate(111). A possible mechanism is proposed. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of the mechanisms are determined. The activation parameters with respect to the slow step of the mechanism are calculated and discussed. The thermodynamic quantities are also determined.

AB Pharmaceuticals such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics have been detected in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents, surface and ground waters and even in drinking waters all over the world. These compounds of concern may induce toxic effects in aquatic organisms and disturb the ecological balance on their way from wastewater to drinking water treatment via surface water and bank filtration. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective in removing such pollutants. This paper evaluates the treatment of wastewater containing three NSAIDs (acetaminophen. ketoprofen and naproxen) and three antibiotics (roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) in two MBRs with sludge retention times (SRTs) of 15 (MBR-15) and 30 (MBR-30) days over a period of 4 weeks. It was observed for both MBRs that the NSAIDs were removed with higher efficiency than the antibiotics, and the MBR-30 presented higher removal efficiencies than the MBR-15 for all compounds studied. Biological transformation products of acetaminophen, ketoprofen and naproxen produced by wastewater biocoenosis were identified in permeates from both MBRs. Further research in this field is required to assess the environmental risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products in the environment.

AB Source control or elimination of precursors of NDMA and other nitrosamines in wastewater requires information on their physicochemical properties, which is still limited. Thus we developed a multistep fractionation method based on a combination of consecutive filtration steps to <1 mu m, <0.2 mu m urn, and <2.5 kDa followed by solid-phase extraction on a C18 column and validated it using model NDMA precursors covering a wide polarity range. The membrane filtration to <2.5 kDa was suitable to separate a low-molecular weight precursor fraction but partially removed hydrophobic compounds by sorption. Fractionation on a C18 column allowed distinguishing highly polar precursors (such as dimethylamine) from less polar ones (such as ranitidine or other pharmaceuticals). Application of the fractionation procedure together with the formation potential test revealed that in the influent of one studied wastewater treatment plant about 50% of all precursors were associated with colloids or macromolecules, suggesting that these fractions comprise sorbed hydrophobic precursors. During activated sludge treatment small polar and charged NDMA and other nitrosamines' precursors were removed to about 80%. In contrast, less polar precursors were more recalcitrant. In advanced treatment steps, only small fractions of the precursors were removed by the prechlorination/ultrafiltration step, while reverse osmosis removed >98% of all precursors.

AB For water reuse applications, "tight" nanofiltration (NF) membranes (of polyamide) as an alternative to reverse osmosis (RO) can be an effective barrier against pharmaceuticals, pesticides, endocrine disruptors and other organic contaminants The use of RO in existing water reuse facilities is addressed and questioned, taking into consideration that tight NF can be a more cost-effective and efficient technology to target the problem of organic contaminants. It was concluded that tight NF is an acceptable barrier for organic contaminants because its removal performance approaches that of RO, and because of reduced operation and maintenance (O&M)costs in long-term project implementation Average removal of neutral compounds (including 1,4-dioxane) was about 82% and 85% for NF and RO, respectively, and average removal of ionic compounds was about 97% and 99% for NF and RO, respectively. In addition, "loose" NF after aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR) can be an effective barrier against micropollutants with removals over 90% When there is the presence of difficult to remove organic contaminants such as NDMA and 1,4-dioxane: for 1,4-dioxane, source control or implementation of treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants will be an option, for NDMA, a good strategy is to limit its formation during wastewater treatment, but there is evidence that biodegradation of NDMA can be achieved during ARR.

AB The amount and distribution of six pharmaceutical compounds belonging to distinct therapeutic classes were investigated along the navigation channel of the Douro River estuary. Distinct spatial and temporal trends were considered and a total of 87 water samples were pre-concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an ion trap (IT) analyzer and electrospray ionization (ESI). The maximum concentrations found were 178 ng/L for carbamazepine, 3.65 ng/L for diazepam, 70.3 ng/L for fenofibric acid, 3.18 ng/L for propranolol, 15.7 ng/L for trimethoprim and 53.3 ng/L for sulfamethoxazole. Carbamazepine was the most ubiquitous compound with 100% positive detection frequency followed by propranolol (38%), trimethoprim (34%) and sulfamethoxazole (33%). The pharmaceutical compounds were quantified at higher levels in the lower stretch of the estuary, especially near the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The data proves that pollution of the Douro River estuary by pharmaceuticals is consistent and is occurring in a fairly constant manner in time, covering a wide area and displaying hot-spots. Individually, the concentration levels are not likely to cause acute effects, based on reference experimental data. However, the fact that complex mixtures exist gives cause for concern as regards potentially relevant toxicological risks. The study points out the need for continuous monitoring of contamination levels not only in the Douro River estuary but also in other major estuaries. Finally, the scenario supports the need for experimental studies on toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tenofovir (9-(R)-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-adenine) is an antiretroviral drug widely used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Tenofovir is extensively and rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. In the expectation that tenofovir could potentially reach agricultural lands through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater, and in the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated its persistence in selected agricultural soils. Less than 10% of [adenine-8-14g-tenofovir added to soils varying widely in texture (sand, loam, clay loam) was mineralized in a 2-month incubation under laboratory conditions. Tenofovir was less readily extractable from clay soils than from a loam or a sandy loam soil. Radioactive residues of tenofovir were removed from the soil extractable fraction with DT(50)s ranging from 24 +/- 2 to 67 + 22 days (first order kinetic model) or 44 + 9 to 127 + 55 days (zero order model). No extractable transformation products were detectable by HPLC. Tenofovir mineralization in the loam soil increased with temperature (range 40 degrees C to 30 degrees C), and did not occur in autoclaved soil, suggesting a microbial basis. Mineralization rates increased with soil moisture content, ranging from air-dried to saturated. In summary, tenofovir was relatively persistent in soils, there were no extractable transformation products detected, and the response of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir mineralization to soil temperature and heat sterilization indicated that the molecule was biodegraded by aerobic microorganisms. Sorption isotherms with dewatered biosolids suggested that tenofovir residues could potentially partition into the particulate fraction during sewage treatment.

AB In this study, steel pickling waste liquor was employed to obtain reactive nanoscale zero-valent metal (nZVM) with the purpose of engineering application. The degradation of metronidazole reacted with as-prepared nZVM in water was investigated to explore the feasibility of using the nZVM to treat antibiotics in wastewater. The synthesized nZVM was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The results showed that the nZVM (20-40 nm) with crystalline structure had a BET surface area of 35 m(2)/g. XPS and EDS only detected Fe, C and O on the surface, suggesting Ni and Zn distributed inside the core of nanoscale alloy. Degradation of metronidazole followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the observed reaction rate constant (k(obs)) could be improved with increasing nZVM dosage, as well as with diminishing initial metronidazole concentration and pH. A high reaction rate was observed at reduction potential, indicating that electrons and hydrogen species produced by nZVM were driving forces of reaction. The surface area-normalized rate coefficient (k(SA)) for nZVM (0.254 L min(-1) m(-2)) was 375.2 times larger than that for commercial iron powder (6.67 x 10(-4) L min(-1) m(-2)). Several possible pathways of degradation of metronidazole were proposed according to the results of UV-vis spectra and HPLC chromatograms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and bioaccumulates in wild-caught fish, especially in brain, liver and muscle tissues. Previous studies indicated that FLX is pharmacologically active in fish species exerting anorexigenic effects, but it is not clear whether waterborne FLX has any potential effects on regulating food intake and energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of two doses of FLX, an environmental concentration of 540 ng/L, and 100-times this concentration (54 mu g/L), on feeding and key metabolic parameters in goldfish. Fish were exposed for a period of 28 days and changes in food intake and body mass were assessed. Pair-fed groups were maintained to discern primary FLX-induced effects from secondary metabolic responses induced by the decreased food intake. Additionally, an untreated control group and a fasted group were used to further compare physiological changes in the context of nutritional status of the animals. Significant decreases in food intake and weight gain were recorded in goldfish exposed to 54 mu g/L FLX. Furthermore a significant decrease occurred in circulating glucose levels in the group exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we investigated gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in the neuroendocrine brain of goldfish as well as gene expression and enzymatic activity of glycolytic and gluconeogenetic enzymes in liver and muscle tissues. The results confirm brain gene expression patterns in line with potential anorexigenic effects in the hypothalamus, with increased expression in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and decreased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY). With respect to glucose metabolism, liver gene expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase decreased and muscle hexokinase activity increased in fish exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Overall, this study demonstrated anorectic properties of FLX at a dose of 54 mu g/L FLX and moderate but significant effects on glucose metabolism in goldfish exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Future studies investigating the importance of these changes in fish are warranted. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have investigated the occurrence of controlled drugs in two rivers, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and five hospital effluents in Taipei, Taiwan, and report here the concentrations of controlled drugs used as prescription medication or drugs of abuse. Of the target drugs, morphine, codeine, meth-amphetamines and ketamine were observed in significant quantities in hospital effluents, with maximum concentrations of 1240, 378, 260 and 206 and L-1, respectively. The other six compounds (including metabolites) were found at trace levels or below the method detection limits. In addition, the high occurrence in river waters of methamphetamine, codeine and ketamine (maximum values 405, 57, and 341 ng L-1, respectively) indicated the significant prevalence of these controlled drugs. This study demonstrated that effluents from hospitals and clinics and treated WWTP effluents contribute to the controlled substances that eventually reach natural rivers. We hypothesize that the occurrence of controlled drugs in the environment can be attributed to two main sources: (1) substance abuse by individuals and (2) treatment with prescription medication for acute and chronic pain. The presence of these contaminants in the aquatic environment may pose significant risk to aquatic and human life. Further studies are needed for verification and may contribute to the development of sustainable strategies for environmental remediation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals being extensively and progressively used in human and veterinary medicine are emerging as significant environmental contaminants. Pharmaceuticals are designed to have a specific mode of action and many of them are persistent in the body. These features among others make pharmaceuticals to be evaluated for potential effects on aquatic flora and fauna. Low levels of pharmaceuticals have been detected in many countries in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface waters, groundwater and drinking waters. In contrast, there is a general scarcity of publicly available ecotoxicological data concerning pharmaceuticals. Interspecies toxicity correlations provide a tool for estimating contaminant sensitivity with known levels of uncertainty for a diversity of wildlife species. In this context, we have developed interspecies toxicity correlation between Daphnia magna (zooplankton) and fish (species according to OECD guidelines) assessing the ecotoxicological hazard potential of diverse 77 pharmaceuticals. The developed models are validated and consensus models are presented to predict toxicity of the individual compounds for any one species when the data for the other species are available. Informative illustrations of the contributing structural fragments which are responsible for the greater toxicity of the diverse pharmaceuticals are identified by the developed models. Developed models are also used to predict fish toxicities of 59 pharmaceuticals (for which Daphnia toxicities are present) and Daphnia toxicities of 30 pharmaceuticals (for which fish toxicities are present). This study will allow a better and comprehensive risk assessment of pharmaceuticals for which toxicity data is missing for a particular endpoint. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, two conventional (with and without sand filter) and four additional (moving bed biofilm reactor, ozone, moving bed biofilm reactor combined with ozone and a membrane bio reactor) treatment technologies were operated in small-scale at Hammarby Sjostad sewage treatment plant, Stockholm, Sweden. The effluents were tested with five short-term ( <= 7 days exposure) ecotoxicological tests, and analyzed for a number of target analytes, comprising pharmaceuticals, natural hormones and industrial chemicals. Overall, the tested effluents generated few adverse effects at lower concentrations ( < 50% sewage effluent), and no major differences were observed between any of the treatments. The effluent treated with the moving bed biofilm reactor resulted in the lowest effects in the ecotoxicological tests. The most efficient treatment technology with regard to the pharmaceutical residues was the ozone treatment, which however caused negative effects in some of the ecotoxicological tests.

AB This study focused on the input of hydrophilic biocides into the aquatic environment and on the efficiency of their removal in conventional wastewater treatment by a mass flux analysis. A fully automated method consisting of on-line solid phase extraction coupled to LC-ESI-MS/MS was developed and validated for the simultaneous trace determination of different biocidal compounds (1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one (BIT), 3-lodo-2-propynylbutyl-carbamate (IPBC), irgarol 1051 and 2-N-octyl-4-isothiazolinone (octhilinone, OIT), carbendazim, diazinon, diuron, isoproturon, mecoprop, terbutryn and terbutylazine) and pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole) in wastewater and surface water. In the tertiary effluent, the highest average concentrations were determined for mecoprop (1010 ng/L) which was at comparable levels as the pharmaceuticals diclofenac (690 ng/L) and sulfamethoxazole (140 ng/L) but 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the other biocidal compounds. Average eliminations for all compounds were usually below 50%. During rain events, increased residual amounts of biocidal contaminants are discharged to receiving surface waters.

AB In this study of wastewater treatment plants in three Canadian cities, selected illicit drugs, including cocaine and its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy (i.e. MDMA) were detected in untreated wastewater. Cocaine was the most widely used illicit drug at a median level for the 3 cities of 15.7 doses per day per 1000 people. For the other drugs, the median doses per day per 1000 people were 1.8 for amphetamine, 4.5 for methamphetamine and 0.4 for ecstasy. Methamphetamine use was highest in the largest city and cocaine use was lowest in the smallest city. Removal of the illicit drugs by wastewater treatment was generally >50%, except in a WWTP that uses primary treatment. The community consumption estimate for ecstasy in the present study is far below published estimates of the prevalence of ecstasy use among the Canadian population, which may be due to only occasional use of ecstasy.

AB Antibiotic entry into the water environment has been of growing concern. However, few investigations have been performed to examine the potential for indirect human exposure to environmental antibiotic residues. We evaluated the contribution of drinking water and major food consumption to inadvertent intake of antibiotic residues among general human population in Korea. We estimated daily human intake of six antibiotics, i.e., sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfathiazole (STZ), trimethoprim (TMP), enrofloxacin (EFX), and roxithromycin (RIM), by measuring the concentrations of the antibiotics and their major metabolites in urine from general population in Korea (n=541). In addition, we measured antibiotics from source water of drinking water as well as in tap water samples, and surveyed water consumption rates among the study population. To assess the contribution of dietary factor, we also surveyed consumption pattern for several major foods which are suspected of antibiotics residue. SMZ, Sulfamethazine-N4-acetyl (SMZ-N4), IMP, EFX, ciprofloxacin (CFX), and RIM were detected up to 448, 6210, 11,900, 6970, 32,400, and 151 pg/ml in the urine samples, respectively. Estimates of daily intake of major antibiotics did not appear to be related with consumption of drinking water although antibiotics were frequently detected in source waters (10-67 ng/l). Consumption of several foods correlated significantly with urinary excretion of several antibiotics. Daily intake estimates of EFX and CFX were associated with consumption of beef, pork, and dairy products; those of SMZ and IMP associated with pork and dairy products; and that of IMP related with raw fish. Daily antibiotics intake estimates however did not exceed the acceptable daily intake levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The uptake and metabolism of anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) was studied by exposing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to DCF intraperitoneally, and via water at concentration of 1.7 mu g L-1. The bile was collected and the formed metabolites were identified. The identification was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by an ion trap mass analyzer. The main metabolites found were acyl glucuronides of hydroxylated DCFs. In addition, one ether glucuronide of hydroxylated DCF was found. Also, unmetabolized DCF was detected in the bile. The total bioconcentration factors (BCFtotal-bile for DCF and its metabolites) in rainbow trout bile, varied between individuals and was roughly estimated to range from 320 to 950. These findings suggest that fish living downstream the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and which are chronically exposed to the drug may accumulate the drug and its metabolites in the bile.

AB We applied zebrafish whole genome microarrays to identify molecular effects of diazepam, a neuropharmaceutical encountered in wastewater-contaminated environments, and to elucidate its neurotoxic mode of action. Behavioral studies were performed to analyze for correlations between altered gene expression with effects on the organism level. Male zebrafish and zebrafish eleuthero-embryos were exposed for 14 d or up to 3 d after hatching, respectively, to nominal levels of 273 ng/L and 273 mu g/L (determined water concentrations in the adult experiment 235 ng/L and 291 mu g/L). Among the 51 and 103 altered transcripts at both concentrations, respectively, the expression of genes involved in the circadian rhythm in adult zebrafish and eleuthero-embryos were of particular significance, as revealed both by microarrays and quantitative PCR. The swimming behavior of eleuthero-embryos was significantly altered at 273 mu g/L. The study leads to the conclusion that diazepam-induced alterations of genes involved in circadian rhythm are paralleled by effects in neurobehavior at high, but not at low diazepam concentrations that may occur in polluted environments.

AB An analytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of trace amounts of nine corticosteroids in sewage-treatment-plant (STP) samples. The compounds studied were prednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, prednisolone acetate, hydrocortisone acetate, betamethasone valerate, and betamethasone dipropionate. The method involves concentration and purification of analytes by solid-phase extraction, subsequent separation by liquid chromatography, and detection by mass spectrometry. Quantitative analysis was performed by the standard addition method. Instrument detection limits were in the range 1.6-9.4 pg for the target compounds. Recoveries were 57.2-106.7% in the STP influent sample and 59.1-112.5% in the STP effluent sample with relative standard deviations of 8.7-19.2% and 7.3-17.1%, respectively. This method was used for the determination of these chemicals in STP samples from Takase (Funabashi, Japan); some corticosteroids were determined at levels as low as single nanograms per liter.

AB Landfills have historically remained the most common methods of organized waste disposal and still remain so in many regions of the world. Thus, they may contain wastes resulting from several decades of disposal and decomposition with subsequent release of organic compounds that may have environmental, wildlife and human health consequences. Products containing different types of additives with unique beneficial improvement properties are in daily use. However, when these products are decomposed, additives are release into the environment, some of which have been shown to have negative environmental impacts, resulting in the ban or at least restricted application of some chemicals. New and emerging compounds are continuously discovered in the environment. Herein, we report qualitative and quantitative data on the occurrence of new and emerging compounds with increasing environmental and public health concern in water- and particle phase of landfill leachates. Under normal environmental conditions, several of these chemicals are persistent high-volume products. Identified chemicals in the leachates at nanogram (ng) or microgram (mu g) per liter levels include chlorinated alkylphosphates such as tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), N-butyl benzensulfonamide (NBBS), the insect repellent diethyl toluamide (DEET) and personal care products such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen and polycyclic musk compounds. Among new and emerging contaminants, perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were measured in the water phase at concentrations up to 6231 ng/L. Compared with the other chemicals, PFCs were primarily distributed in water phase. An effective removal method for PFCs and other polar and persistent compounds from landfill leachates has been a major challenge, since commonly used treatment technologies are based on aeration and sedimentation. Thus, the present study has shown that municipal landfill leachates may represent a significant source of concern for legacy, new and emerging chemicals in groundwater. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Thirty-six papers were published in 2009 describing new methods for analysis of veterinary pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic steroid hormones, and their occurrence in agricultural settings. New methods continue to be developed and applied toward understanding the sources and environmental significance of these chemicals. Advances in sample preparation methods and instrumentation provide detection limits into parts per trillion ranges. Analysis of water samples indicates that many of these compounds do occur in the environment.

This review is a subsection of the Treatment Systems section of the annual literature review. The review encompasses modeling, nutrient removal, system design and operation, oxygen transfer and solids separation. Two topics that have seen an increase in activity compared to historical reviews are membrane bioreactors and fate and occurrence of hormones and pharmaceuticals, which are referred to as microconstituents following current WEF terminology. Microconstituents as they relate to suspended growth reactors are covered in this review, while membrane bioreactors are reviewed in another section in this journal. Other subsections from the Treatment Systems section that might also be related to this section include: Wastewater Collection Systems; Biological Fixed Film Systems; and Modeling, Instrumentation, Automation, and Optimization of Wastewater Treatment Facilities. Many of the subsections in the Industrial Wastes, Hazardous Wastes, and Fate and Effects of Pollutants sections could also have some overlap with this section.

AB This review covers selected 2009 peer-reviewed journal articles on the biological, chemical and physical effects of natural and anthropogenic pollutants on marine and estuarine plants and animals. This review covers field and laboratory measurement activities ( concentrations of contaminants, field surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers). Papers focus further on pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphsis was placed on oil spills due to the major ongoing Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. Several toical areas reviewed in the past were dropped this year due to circumstances beyond our control (including work on the Deepwater Horizon incident). There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). As always, readers should only use this as a guide and must consult the original papers before citing them, including double-checking units.

AB Two different technical approaches based on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), solar Fenton homogeneous photocatalysis (hv/Fe2+/H2O2) and heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspensions were studied for the chemical degradation of the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in secondary treated effluents. A bench-scale solar simulator in combination with an appropriate photochemical batch reactor was used to evaluate and select the optimal oxidation conditions of ofloxacin spiked in secondary treated domestic effluents. The concentration profile of the examined substrate during degradation was determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. Mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The concentrations of Fe2+ and H2O2 were the key factors for the solar Fenton process, while the most important parameter of the heterogeneous photocatalysis was proved to be the catalyst loading. Kinetic analyses indicated that the photodegradation of ofloxacin can be described by a pseudo-first-order reaction. The rate constant (k) for the solar Fenton process was determined at different Fe2+ and H2O2 concentrations whereas the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) kinetic expression was used to assess the kinetics of the heterogeneous photocatalytic process. The conversion of ofloxacin depends on several parameters based on the various experimental conditions, which were investigated. A Daphnia magna bioassay was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the parent compound and its photo-oxidation by-products in different stages of oxidation. In the present study solar Fenton has been demonstrated to be more effective than the solar TiO2 process, yielding complete degradation of the examined substrate and DOC reduction of about 50% in 30 min of the photocatalytic treatment.

AB The occurrence of two pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen and diclofenac, in a vulnerable karst groundwater system was investigated. The hydrogeology of the karst system was identified by collecting H-3 samples in groundwater over 27 years and by performing tracer tests. The isotopes and tracer data were interpreted by mathematical modeling to estimate the mean transit time of water and to characterize the hydrogeological flow paths in the groundwater system. By this approach, a mean H-3 transit time of 4.6 years for the fissured-porous karst aquifer was determined, whereas the fast flowing water in the conduit system showed a mean transit time of days.
   Both pharmaceuticals which infiltrated along sinkholes and small streams into the karst system were detected in concentrations of up to approximately 1 mu g/L in effluent water of the wastewater treatment plants. Diclofenac was present in most samples collected from four springs discharging the karst groundwater to the rivers Altmuhl and Anlauter in concentrations between 3.6 and 15.4 ng/L In contrast, ibuprofen was rarely detected in groundwater. The results of this study suggest that both pharmaceuticals move into the fractured system of the karst system and go into storage. Thus dilution processes are the dominant control on the concentrations of both pharmaceuticals in the fractured system, whereas biodegradation is likely less important. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A wide variety of drugs have been found in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, and lakes, including analgesics, antibiotics, and antiepileptics. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are promising technologies to treat low contents of toxic and biorefractory pollutants in water. Anodic oxidation of carbamazepine, the most frequently detected drug in water bodies, was carried out using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes at galvanostatic mode. To optimize the process and study the interaction between the four modified variables (pH, current, concentration of supporting electrolyte Na2SO4, and solution flow rate) a design-of-experiments procedure has been carried out. The influence of these four variables has been evaluated. The influence of current was the greatest in the studied variables, the second one was the salt concentration, and the third one was the flow rate. ANOVA test reported significant for 5 of the 14 involved variables and the response surface methodology technique used to optimize carbamazepine degradation. An optimum carbamazepine degradation of 100% was found at pH 9, flow rate equal to 1.25 cm(3) min(-1), and current density equal to 190 mA cm(-2) using a supporting electrolyte concentration equal to 0.48 mol L-1.

AB Potential exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the aquatic environment is a subject of ongoing concern. We recently published maximum likely exposure rates for several hundred human prescription pharmaceuticals commonly used in the US. These rates were estimated from nationally aggregated marketing data and wastewater production rates. The accuracy of these estimates is unclear, and it is unclear how to use the national-level estimates of exposure to predict local exposure rates. In this study we compare our previous predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), which were based on marketing data, with PECs based on regulatory data. We then use local dispensing rates for 12 APIs along with local wastewater production rates to estimate the distribution of local PECs relative to national averages, in order to identify an 'application factor' suitable for converting national-level PECs into reliable bounds for local concentrations. We compare the national-level PECs and the proposed application factor with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) published in 62 recent peer-reviewed publications. Regulatory data-based national average PECs are uniformly lower than marketing data-based national average PECs, corroborating the intended conservative nature of the marketing data-based PECs. Variability in local API usage and wastewater production rates suggest local PECs may occasionally exceed national averages by about 10-fold. Multiplying national average PECs by an 'application factor' of 10 and comparing the resulting predicted maximum local PECs to published MEC data for 83 APIs corroborates the usefulness of 10-fold adjusted national PECs as a reasonable ceiling for measured environmental concentrations.

AB A carbonaceous (heterotrophic) activated sludge process (ASP), nitrifying ASP and a nitrifying/denitrifying ASP have been studied to examine the role of process type in steroid estrogen removal. Biodegradation efficiencies for total steroid estrogens (Sigma(EST)) of 80 and 91% were recorded for the nitrifying/denitrifying ASP and nitrifying ASP respectively. Total estrogen biodegradation (Sigma(EST)) was only 51% at the carbonaceous ASP, however, the extent of biodegradation in the absence of nitrification clearly indicates the important role of heterotrophs in steroid estrogen removal. The low removal efficiency did not correlate with biomass activity for which the ASP(carbonaceous) recorded 80 mu g kg(-1) biomass d(-1) compared to 61 and 15 mu g kg(-1) biomass d(-1) at the ASP(nitrifying) and ASP(nitrifying/denitrifying) respectively. This finding was explained by a moderate correlation (r(2) = 0.55) between total estrogen loading (Sigma(EST) mg m(-3) d(-1)) and biomass activity (mu g Sigma(EST) degraded kg(-1) d(-1)) and has established the impact of loading on steroid estrogen removal at full-scale. At higher solids retention time (SRT), steroid estrogen biodegradation of >80% was observed, as has previously been reported. It is postulated that hydraulic retention time (HRT) is as important as SRT as this governs both reaction time and loading. This observation is based on the high specific estrogen activity determined at the ASP(carbonaceous) plant, the significance of estrogen loading and the positive linear correlation between SRT and HRT.

AB We investigated the occurrence and fate of the two antiviral drugs oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) the active metabolite of Tamiflu and amantadine (AMT) at three sewage treatment plants (STPs) during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 influenza seasons in Japan. Both compounds were detected in all samples analyzed. The concentrations in raw influents at the STPs ranged from 140 to 460 ng L-1 OC and from 184 to 538 ng L-1 AMT. Primary treatment gave no substantial removal of the drugs (OC, 2-9%; AMT, 7-17%). Biological nutrient-removal-based secondary treatment (anoxic-oxic-anoxic-oxic and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic) removed 20-37% of OC, whereas extended-aeration-based conventional activated sludge treatment removed <20%. STPs using primary plus biological secondary treatment removed <50% of the drugs. The incorporation of tertiary treatment by ozonation removed >90%. Ozonation after secondary treatment in STPs will be necessary during an influenza pandemic to reduce the risks associated with the widespread use of antiviral drugs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In spite of growing scientific concern about pharmaceuticals in the environment, there is still a lack of information especially with regard to their metabolites. The present study investigated ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of three widely used cytostatic agents 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine (CYT) and gemcitabine (GemC) and their major human metabolites, i.e. alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL), uracil-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (AraU) and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), respectively. Effects were studied in acute immobilization and reproduction assays with crustacean Daphnia magna and growth inhibition tests with alga Desmodesmus subspicatus and bacteria Pseudoinonas putida. Genotoxicity was tested with umu-test employing Salmonella choleraesius subsp. chol. Toxicity was relatively high at parent compounds with EC(50) values ranging from 44 mu g L(-1) (5-fluorouracil in the P. putida test) to 200 mg L(-1) (cytarabine in D. magna acute test). In general, the most toxic compound was 5-FU. Studied metabolites showed low or no toxicity: only FBAL (metabolite of 5-FU) showed low toxicity to D. subspicatus and P. putida with EC(50) values 80 and 140 mg L(-1), respectively. All parent cytostatics showed genotoxicity with minimum genotoxic concentrations (MGC) ranging from 40 to 330 mg L(-1). From metabolites, only FBAL was genotoxic in high concentrations. To our knowledge, the present study provides some of the first ecotoxicity data for both cytostatics and their metabolites, which might further serve for serious evaluation of ecological risks. The observed EC(50) values within the mu g L(-1) range were fairly close to concentrations reported in hospital sewage water, which indicates further research needs, especially studies of chronic toxicity.

AB The capacity of the ligninolytic fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade a wide variety of environmentally persistent xenobiotics has been largely reported in the literature. Beside other factors, one barrier to a wider use of this bioremediation fungus is the availability of effective formulations that ensure easy preparation, handling and application In this series of laboratory experiments, we evaluated the efficiency of a granular bloplastic formulation entrapping propagules of P chrysosporium for removal of four selected pharmaceuticals from wastewater samples Addition of inoculated granules to samples of the wastewater treatment plant of Bologna significantly increased the removal of the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and the antibiotics, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazol, and ciprofloxacin. Similar effects were also observed in effluent water. Oseltamivir was the most persistent of the four active substances. After 30d of incubation, approximately two times more oseltamivir was removed in bioremediated wastewater than controls The highest removal efficiency of the bioplastic formulation was observed with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin Microbiological DNA-based analysis showed that the bioplastic matrix supported the growth of P chrysosporium, thus facilitating its adaptation to unusual environment such as wastewater (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present study, a multi-residue method based on a bag-solid phase extraction (bag-SPE) technique was evaluated for determination of 10 pharmaceuticals in surface water close to the effluent of a sewage treatment plant (STP) and along a coastal gradient from a STP effluent.
   The 10 compounds selected were caffeine, atenolol, metoprolol, oxazepam, carbamazepine, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and gemfibrozil. All analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry. The detection limits (LOD) ranged from 1.0 to 13 ng L-1. The method showed linear concentration ranges from 25 to 800 ng L-1 with regression coefficients (R-2) better than 0.9801. The recoveries of the selected analytes ranged from 11 to 65% with relative standard deviations (RSD) of <16% and inter-day variations of less than 18%. Isotopically labeled surrogate standards were used to compensate for sampling losses and matrix effects.
   Four of the selected 10 pharmaceuticals (caffeine, metoprolol, oxazepam and carbamazepine) were quantified, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 210 ng L-1 (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in water bodies. In this study, its concentrations in the STP effluents in 68 countries/regions are predicted with a model based on the sale volume, the water consumption, the disposal rate, the excretion rate, and the removal efficiency by the sewage system. The prediction results demonstrate a global aquatic contamination of CBZ. However, the contamination is unbalanced: most of developed economics have a concentration above 500 ng L-1. The prediction model also provides some implications on the control strategies of pharmaceutical aquatic contamination, including upgrading STPs, urine separation, waste pharmaceuticals collection, environmentally labeling pharmaceuticals, and green pharmacy. Those strategies are discussed in the context of currently available literature information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Significant amounts of pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment through wastewater effluent. Sorption has been shown to be a significant aqueous removal pathway for many of these compounds. Competition between ciprofloxacin (CIP), ofloxacin (OFL) and norfloxacin (NOR) and their sorption to, and desorption from, a surrogate Louisiana wastewater treatment wetland soil were investigated to gain insight into the fate and transport of the pollutants within wastewater treatment wetlands. This study was undertaken in the context of a treatment wetland that continuously receives pharmaceuticals. Therefore it is important to understand the total capacity of this soil to sorb these compounds. Sorption to this treatment wetland soil was found to provide a major and potentially long-term removal pathway for these antibiotics from wastewater. Log K-F values for all three compounds were between 4.09 and 3.90 for sorption and 4.24 and 4.05 mu g(1-1/n) (cm(3))(1/n) g(-1) for desorption. The compounds were sorbed in amounts ranging from 60% to 90% for high and low loading, respectively. The majority of the compounds were sorbed to the soil within the first 20 h, indicating that treatment wetland may not need long retention times (weeks to months) in order to remove these compounds. Sorption K-D values for competition (20 ppm of each compound for 60 ppm of total fluoroquinolones) ranged from 2300 to 3800 cm(3) g(-1) which is between both the 20 (4300-5800 cm(3) g(-1)) and 60 (1300-3000 cm(3) g(-1)) ppm single compound K-D values, indicating that there is competition between these three compound for sorption sites. Sorption and desorption data (single component and mixture) collectively provide the following evidence: (1) NOR and, to a lesser extent, CIP outcompete OFL for sorption sites, (2) OFL sorbes to its share of "quality" sorption sites, and (3) competition only occurs for lesser "quality" binding sites.

AB The report describes the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and LC/MS/MS to investigate the occurrence and distribution of 4 estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and 3 anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) in the Zhangweinanyun River System (China). Relatively higher concentrations were observed for estrone, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and ketoprofen in the Wei Canal than in the Wei River and in the Zhangweixin River. The study suggested that there is a potential ecological risk of male fish feminization from estrogens in the Zhangweinanyun River System.

AB During wastewater treatment, many organic micropollutants undergo microbially mediated reactions resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs). Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides. The results showed that the complementary use of the target and non-target screening methods allowed for a more comprehensive interpretation of the TPs generated than either would have provided individually.

AB This study investigated the sorption behaviour of two endocrine disrupting chemicals; 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 beta-ethinylestradiol and their thermodynamic properties in an activated sludge biomass. The partition coefficient values measured for E2 and EE2 at varying temperatures range from 245 - 604 L/kg (log K-d 2.39 -2.78) and 267 - 631 L/kg (Log K-d 2.43 - 2.80), respectively. The chemisorption K-d values were inversely related to temperature. The average percentages of E2 and EE2 adsorbed to the solid phase at 4.3 % dry solid were 87.2 % and 92.5 %, respectively. Sorption of E2 and EE2 to the activated sludge biomass was found to be spontaneous and entropy retarded with Delta G values in the range of -13 to -16 KJ/mol and Delta S value of -105.2J/mol/K and 96.7 J/mol/k for E2 and EE2, respectively. The enthalpy changes for E2 and EE2 were -45.7KJ/mol and -43.4KJ/mol respectively, demonstrating that the sorption process is exothermic. The values of the enthalpy changes also show that the mechanism of sorption is physisorption with some element of chemisorption.

AB This study aims at evaluating occurrence and treatment efficiency of five estrogenic hormones and ten beta blockers in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The use of consistent sampling procedures, analytical techniques and data processing enabled to achieve an accurate comparison of the performances of the different treatment processes. First, the occurrence of molecules was evaluated in fourteen rural and urban WWTP located in France. Free and total estrogens were analyzed showing that more than 84% of estrogens in the dissolved phase of influent samples are in the free form. In effluent samples, comparable mean values but higher variation are underlined (RSD from 13 to 54% depending on the estrogen, compared to 11-21% for influents). Most of the target molecules are quantified in 30 influent and 31 effluent samples. Similar occurrence frequencies are obtained for influents from rural (6 WWTP) and urban areas (8 WWTP), except for betaxolol which is only quantified in urban wastewaters. Removal efficiencies of 8 biological treatments were studied: suspended growth biomass (activated sludge) and attached growth systems (biofilter, rotating biological contactor, reed-bed filter, trickling filter). Biological treatments are efficient to remove estrogens from the dissolved phase, with removal rate around 90%. For beta blockers, acebutolol and nadolol are efficiently removed (mean removal rate of 80%), whereas sotalol and propranolol are hardly impacted by biological treatments (removal rate below 20%). Finally, 9 tertiary treatment processes were evaluated. Ozonation, reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration prove a high removal efficiency for beta blockers (above 80%). On the contrary, high speed chemical settler, sand filtration, silex filtration, microfiltration and UV present generally removal rates below 30% for all beta blockers. The polishing pond studied presents variable removal performances depending on the molecules (up to 75% for propranolol). The role of the hydraulic retention time on the removal efficiencies is confirmed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Statins are cholesterol-lowering pharmaceuticals and commonly prescribed drugs in European countries. Their discharge into the aquatic environment has increased in the last few years and they are present at detectable levels in most sewage effluents. The aim of the present study was to quantify the cytotoxic effects of acid and lactone forms of two statins. atorvastatin and simvastatin, as well as selected metabolites (ortho- and para-hydroxy atorvastatin acid, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, simvastatin hydroxyl carboxylic acid, and 3 '' hydroxy simvastatin lactone) to hepatocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Hepatocytes were exposed for 24, 48, and 72 h to different concentrations of each test substance (0.4-400 mu M). Cytotoxicity was measured as metabolic inhibition and loss of membrane integrity with the fluorescent probes alamar blue (AB) and 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA-AM), respectively. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone had dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes. Simvastatin was more toxic than atorvastatin and the lactone form more toxic than the acid form. Exposure time affected atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone but not simvastatin toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These groups included the corticosteroids prednisolone and dexamethasone; the beta-blockers sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol, and carvedilol; and the analgesic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs paracetamol, aspirin, metamizole, and ketoprofen. Reversed-phase ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector, different columns, different mobile phases, and gradient elution programmes were used to obtain the best separations within the shortest possible time. Solid-phase extraction was examined as a preconcentration step. The Oasis HLB column, with the highest recoveries (over 90% for most of the drugs), was chosen for the analysis of surface waters. Limits of detection ranged from 0.06 to 0.39 mu g L(-1) for all drugs after optimisation of all analytical steps.

AB BACKGROUND: L(+)-Lactic acid is used in the pharmaceutical, textile and food industries as well as in the synthesis of biodegradable plastics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different medium components added in cassava wastewater for the production of L(+)-lactic acid by Lactobacillus rhamnosus B 103.
   RESULTS: The use of cassava wastewater (50 g L-1 of reducing sugar) with Tween 80 and corn steep liquor, at concentrations (v/v) of 1.27 mL L-1 and 65.4 mL L-1 respectively led to a lactic acid concentration of 41.65 g L-1 after 48 h of fermentation. The maximum lactic acid concentration produced in the reactor after 36 h of fermentation was 39.00 g L-1 using the same medium, but the pH was controlled by addition of 10 mol L-1 NaOH.
   CONCLUSION: The use of cassava wastewater for cultivation of L. rhamnosus is feasible, with a considerable production of lactic acid. Furthermore, it is an innovative proposal, as no references were found in the scientific literature on the use of this substrate for lactic acid production. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pharmaceuticals are constantly dispersed into the environment and little is known of the effects on non-target organisms. This is an issue of growing concern. In this study, Baltic Sea blue mussels, Mytilus edulis trossulus, were exposed to diclofenac, ibuprofen and propranolol, three pharmaceuticals that are produced and sold in large quantities and have a widespread occurrence in aquatic environments. The mussels were exposed to pharmaceuticals in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10,000 mu g l(-1). The pharmaceuticals were added both separately and in combination. Mussels exposed to high concentrations of pharmaceuticals showed a clear response compared to controls. Firstly, they had a significantly lower scope for growth, which indicates that the organisms had a smaller part of their energy available for normal metabolism, and secondly, they had lower byssus strength and lower abundance of byssus threads, resulting in reduced ability to attach to the underlying substrate. Mussels exposed to lower concentrations showed tendencies of the same results. The concentration of diclofenac and propranolol was quantified in the mussels using both liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The measurements showed a significantly higher concentration in the organisms as compared to the water the mussels were exposed to; the uptake reached concentrations two orders of magnitudes higher than found in sewage treatment plant effluents. This study showed that common pharmaceuticals are taken up and negatively affect the physiology of a non-target species at levels of two to three orders of magnitudes higher than found in sewage treatment plant effluents.

AB This study examined the evolution of absorbance spectra of wastewater ozonated using varying initial ozone concentrations or treatment times, concomitant changes of concentrations of trace-level pharmaceuticals were also quantified The absorbance of ozonated wastewater decreased due to the degradation of chromophores in effluent organic matter (EfOM) The relative decrease of absorbance (Delta A/A(0)) ranged from <30% for lambda < 250 nm to >80% for lambda > 320 nm. The removal of atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, naproxen, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and p-chlorobenzoic acid was strongly correlated with Delta A/A(0) values The observed features were hypothesized to correspond to the engagement of kinetically distinct groups of EfOM chromophores Modeling of the evolution of EfOM absorbance and concurrent degradation of trace-level organic species based on this hypothesis confirmed its applicability and utility for practical applications and theoretical exploration

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are commonly found in biosolids and effluents from wastewater treatment plants Land application of these biosolids and the reclamation of treated wastewater can transfer those PPCPs into the terrestrial and aquatic environments, giving rise to potential accumulation in plants. In this work, a greenhouse experiment was used to study the uptake of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and fluoxetine) and two personal care products (triclosan and triclocarban) by an agriculturally important species, soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr) Two treatments simulating biosolids application and wastewater irrigation were investigated After growing for 60 and 110 days, plant tissues and soils were analyzed for target compounds. Carbamazepine, triclosan, and triclocarban were found to be concentrated in root tissues and translocated into above ground parts including beans, whereas accumulation and translocation for diphenhydramine and fluoxetine was limited. The uptake of selected compounds differed by treatment, with biosolids application resulting in higher plant concentrations, likely due to higher loading However, compounds introduced by irrigation appeared to be more available for uptake and translocation Degradation is the main mechanism for the dissipation of selected compounds in biosolids applied soils, and the presence of soybean plants had no significant effect on sorption. Data from two different harvests suggest that the uptake from soil to root and translocation from root to leaf may be rate limited for triclosan and triclocarban and metabolism may occur within the plant for carbamazepine.

TI Sampling for PPCPs in Wastewater Systems: Comparison of Different

DT Article
ID SEWER SYSTEMS; PHARMACEUTICALS; SOLIDS
AB The aim of this study was to assess uncertainties associated with different sampling modes when evaluating loads of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewers and influents to sewage treatment plants (STPs). The study demonstrates that sampling uncertainty can range from "not significant" to "far greater than the uncertainty due to chemical analysis", which is site- and compound-specific and depends on the (in)accuracy of the analytical method Conventional sampling devices operated in common time- or flow-proportional sampling modes, and applying traditional sampling intervals of 30 min or longer can result in the collection of nonrepresentative samples At the influent of a STP, wastewater may appear as a continuous stream, but it is actually composed of a number of intermittently discharged, individual wastewater packets from household appliances, industries, or subcatchments in pressurized sewer systems. The resulting heterogeneity can cause significant short-term variations of pollutant loads We present different experimental results and a modeling approach showing that the magnitude of sampling uncertainty depends mainly on the number of pollutant peaks and the sampling frequency, sampling intervals of 5 min or shorter may be required to properly account for temporal PPCP variations in influents of STPs A representative sample is a prerequisite for providing meaningful analytical results and cannot be compensated with a large number of samples, accurate chemical analysis, or sophisticated statistical evaluation This study highlights that generalizing from one case to another is difficult and hence a careful systems analysis of the catchment under investigation, or precautionary choice for a sophisticated sampling mode, is necessary to prove reproducibility.

AB The ubiquitous occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic environments raises concerns about potential adverse effects on aquatic ecology and human health, including the promotion of increased antibiotic resistance. This study examined the oxidation of three widely detected antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, and trimethoprim) by potassium permanganate [KMnO4; Mn(VII)]. Reaction kinetics were described by second-order rate laws, with apparent second-order rate constants (k(2)) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C in the order of 0 61 +/- 0.02 M-1 s(-1) (ciprofloxacin) < 1 6 +/- 0 1 M-1 s(-1) (trimethoprim) < 36 +/- 0.1 M-1 s(-1) (lincomycin). Arrhenius temperature dependence was observed with apparent activation energies (E-a) ranging from 49 kJ mol(-1) (trimethoprim) to 68 kJ mol(-1) (lincomycin). Rates of lincomycin and trimethoprim oxidation exhibited marked pH dependences, whereas pH had only a small effect on rates of ciprofloxacin oxidation The effects of pH were quantitatively described by considering parallel reactions between KMnO4 and individual acid-base species of the target antibiotics Predictions from a kinetic model that included temperature, KMnO4 dosage, pH, and source water oxidant demand as input parameters agreed reasonably well with measurements of trimethoprim and lincomycin oxidation in six drinking water utility sources Although Mn(VII) reactivity with the antibiotics was lower than that reported for ozone and free chlorine, its high selectivity and stability suggests a promising oxidant for treating sensitive micropollutants in organic-rich matrices (e g, wastewater)

AB Olive oil production generates large amounts of recalcitrant compounds, the olive oil mill wastewater (OMWW), which represent one of the most contaminating effluents among those produced by the agrofood industries. Nowadays, this view has changed to one that recognizes the waste as a low-cost starting material rich in bioactive compounds, particularly biophenols, that can be extracted and applied as natural antioxidants for the food and pharmaceutical industries. The data reported in this paper indicate that the OMWW extracts, besides low molecular weight antioxidant phenolics such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, also contain phenolics with a molecular weight in the range of 600-5000 Da, which exhibit efficient scavenging activities against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. This group of phenolics includes, besides verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and an oxidized form of verbascoside, a number of higher molecular weight phenolics arising from oxidative polymerization of hydroxytyrosol and caffeic acid. Overall, these higher molecular weight phenolics prove to be, in some in vitro tests, more efficient scavengers of hydrophilic hydroxyl radicals than hydroxytyrosol, which could be used for industrial applications as natural nontoxic antioxidants.

AB Aerobic treatment of wastewater under thermophilic conditions has received growing interest in recent years. Because of the high discharge temperature (75 to 85 degrees C) of palm oil mill effluent (POME), it would be more economical if POME were treated thermophilically, as then cooling facilities prior to biological treatment can be eliminated. In the present investigation, the feasibility of thermophilic aerobic biological treatment as a suitable post-treatment system for anaerobically treated POME was examined. Also, the effects of temperature on the treated effluent quality were investigated by using sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) under mesophilic (28 degrees C) and thermophilic (45, 50, and 55 degrees C) conditions. The average total COD (TCOD) removal efficiencies varied from 55 to 98% at organic loading rates (OLR) of 2.6 to 4.5 kg COD/m(3)center dot day, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 2.9-4.5 mg/L, and mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations of 22500-24200 mg/L. The results show that the thermophilic aerobic treatment was capable of achieving promising treatment efficiencies in terms of TCOD and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removals, which exceeded 72% and 76%, respectively, at an OLR of 2.8 0.3 kg COD/m(3)center dot day. The thermophilic sludge also showed good settling characteristics, as reflected by the low sludge volume index (SW) values (<100). Nevertheless, aerobic treatment at mesophilic conditions produced better results as compared to the treatment at thermophilic conditions. The highest effluent quality was obtained under mesophilic conditions (28 degrees C), while the SBR operated at 55 degrees C produced the poorest effluent quality. The effluents treated under the thermophilic conditions were more turbid with the presence of higher total suspended solids (TSS), due to a lower capability to effectively retain the influent particles by the sludge. In the practice of minimum capital and operating costs, the encouraging results from this study propose that the thermophilic aerobic system can be integrated with a thermophilic anaerobic system for the treatment of POME.

AB Pharmaceutical products are released at low concentrations into aquatic environments following domestic wastewater treatment. Such low concentrations have been shown to induce transcriptional responses in microorganisms, which could have consequences on aquatic ecosystem dynamics. In order to test if these transcriptional responses could also be observed in complex river microbial communities, biofilm reactors were inoculated with water from two rivers of differing trophic statuses and subsequently treated with environmentally relevant doses (ng/liter to mu g/liter range) of four pharmaceuticals (erythromycin [ER], gemfibrozil [GM], sulfamethazine [SN], and sulfamethoxazole [SL]). To monitor functional gene expression, we constructed a 9,600-feature anonymous DNA microarray platform onto which cDNA from the biofilms was hybridized. Pharmaceutical treatments induced both positive and negative transcriptional responses from biofilm microorganisms. For instance, ER induced the transcription of several stress, transcription, and replication genes, while GM, a lipid regulator, induced transcriptional responses from several genes involved in lipid metabolism. SN caused shifts in genes involved in energy production and conversion, and SL induced responses from a range of cell membrane and outer envelope genes, which in turn could affect biofilm formation. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that low concentrations of small molecules can induce transcriptional changes in a complex microbial community. The relevance of these results also demonstrates the usefulness of anonymous DNA microarrays for large-scale metatranscriptomic studies of communities from differing aquatic ecosystems.

AB A novel thin-layer photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactor has been developed and successfully applied to the degradation of tetracycline, a typical pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), in bulk wastewater treatment. The reactor is designed with double thin-layer in order to increase the A/V ratio (ratio of electrode area and solution volume) and improve the mass transfer as well as the photonic efficiency of the system. The efficiency of organic degradation by the new reactor is much higher in comparison with conventional PEC process under similar treatment conditions. Using 20-120 mg L-1 model tetracycline wastewater as the target organics, the PEC removal rate of tetracycline in the reactor reached 96.4-54.8% with a single-side illumination, much higher than that of conventional PEC reactor (about 80.4-14.6%) within 1 h. When the reactor was illuminated from double sides, the treatment efficiency of thin-layer reactor was doubled without increasing new electrodes. This novel reactor always keeps high quantum efficiency regardless of the different concentration levels of the organic compounds, especially superior for the treatment of high concentration solutions. Repeated experiments in the treatment of 400 mg L-1 tetracycline solution demonstrated excellent stability and reliability of the TNAs electrode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A full-scale combined biological system is used for the treatment of treated wastewater discharged from a pharmaceutical industrial park. This treated water is rich in NH4+-N (average in 86.4 mg/L), low in COD/NH4+-N (average in 3.4) and low in BOD5/COD ratio (average in 0.24) with pH varying from 7.16 to 7.78. The final effluent of the combined treatment process was stably below 100 mg/L COD and 20 mg/L NH4+-N, separately, with organic loading rate of 4954 kg COD/d and 92.5 kg NH4+-N/d. It is found that the BOD5/COD ratio could be raised from 0.24 to 0.35, and the production of total VFAs account for 9.57% of the total COD via the treatment of hydrolysis/acidification. MBBR and oxidation ditch represent 35.4% and 60.7% of NH4+-N removal, 30.2% and 61.5% of COD removal, separately, of the total treatment process. PCR-DGGE is used for microbial community analysis of MBBR and oxidation ditch. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A Gram-negative strain DT4, capable of growing aerobically on tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. It was identified as Pseudomonas oleovorans by morphological and physiological characteristics as well as Biolog profiling and 16S rDNA sequence. Cells of P. oleovorans DT4 pre-cultured in THF could degrade 5 mM THF completely without lag phase. The generation time of 2.7 h and the maximum degradation rate of 203.9 mg THF/(h g dry weight) were observed, demonstrating that DT4 bears the highest THF-degrading activity in ever described strains. Furthermore, THF concentration as high as 100 mM was tolerated by the culture. Several important compounds including gamma-butyrrolactone and benzene could be directly metabolized, whereas other pollutants (e.g., tetrahydropyrane) could be cometabolized by DT4. THF removal was achieved in a continuous flow system with the maximum specific growth rate 0.113 h(-1) and half-saturation constant 1.224 mg/L, indicating the great potential of THF bioremediation in future full-scale application.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazapine (CBZ) readily persists in sewage-water treatment plant wastewaters and finds its way into receiving water bodies. Our study sought to examine the bioaccumulation and toxicity of CBZ using an experimental aquatic trophic chain composed of the green alga. Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacean, Thamnocephalus platyurus, and the cnidarian. Hydra attenuata. Bioaccumulation of CBZ was estimated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and revealed bioaccumulation factors of 2.2 and 12.6, respectively, in algae and crustaceans. No significant bioaccumulation was observed in H. attenuata. In T. platyurus, a strong stimulation of global heme oxidase (HO) (76%), and glutathione-S-transferase activity (130%) but a drastic inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A-like activity was found which suggests alteration of enzyme activity by CBZ. However, in the hydranth H. attenuata, an increase in both global cytochrome and cytochrome P450 3A-like activity was found, while GST activity was inhibited. Lipid peroxidation was reduced in T. platyurus and H. attenuata suggesting that redox activity of the lipophilic CBZ was at play. This study highlighted the processes of carbamazepine toxicity transfer between trophic levels in aquatic organisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scientific researchers and regulators are focusing attention on trace quantities of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and surface waters, resulting in an increased level of concern regarding the potential environmental impact of these compounds. The current European regulatory guideline requires evaluation of the chronic effects of active pharmaceutical ingredients on Daphnia magna. Based on the life cycle of D. magna, chronic studies to establish survival and reproductive endpoints require a 21 d exposure period. A similar organism, Ceriodaphnia dubia, has a shorter life cycle and therefore survival and reproductive endpoints may be established following 7 d of exposure. No observed effect concentrations and lowest observed effect concentrations for survival and reproduction were obtained for D. magna and C. dubia following exposure to six human pharmaceuticals and two metabolites (i.e. celecoxib, linezolid, varenicline, sunitinib, Compound A, ziprasidone and the M1 and M4 metabolites of torcetrapib). These data were evaluated to determine whether one organism may be considered more sensitive. Survival and reproduction data obtained from the C. dubia study provide similar outcomes to D. magna when determining the predicted environmental concentration/predicted no effect concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratios for surface water. Based on these data, C. dubia may be used as a cost-effective alternative and representative invertebrate species when assessing the potential risk of human pharmaceuticals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen prescribed as a contraceptive, was measured in Shorthead Redhorse Suckers (ShRHSs) (Moxostoma macrolepidotum) collected near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the St. Clair River (Ontario, Canada). We detected EE2 in 50% of the fish samples caught near the WWTP (Stag Island), which averaged 1.6 +/- 0.6 ng/g (wet weight) in males and 1.43 +/- 0.96 ng/g in females. No EE2 was detected in the samples from the reference site (Port Lambton) which was 26 km further downstream of the Stag Island site. Only males from Stag Island had VTG induction, suggesting the Corunna WWTP effluent as a likely source of environmental estrogen. EE2 concentrations were correlated with total body lipid content (R-2 = 0.512, p < 0.01, n = 10). Lipid normalized EE2 concentrations were correlated with delta N-15 (R-2 = 0.436, p < 0.05, n = 10), suggesting higher EE2 exposures in carnivores. Our data support the hypothesis of EE2 bioaccumulation in wild fish. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive study of various psychoactive substances and their metabolites was performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb (780 000 inhabitants) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The estimation of drug abuse for five different illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, marijuana, amphetamine and ecstasy, was made on the basis of their representative excretion rates, which were determined over a period of 8 months. Marijuana (1000 kg/year), heroin (75 kg/year) and cocaine (47 kg/year) were found to be the most frequently consumed illicit drugs, while the consumption of amphetamine-type drugs was much lower (1-3 kg/year). A comparison with other reports indicated that drug abuse profiles in transition countries might be different from those reported for Western Europe, in particular with respect to the comparatively increased consumption of heroin. Enhanced consumption of stimulating drugs (cocaine and ectasy) was systematically detected during weekends. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the treatment of wastewater is hindered by scavenging of the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) by effluent organic matter (EfOM). This scavenging is directly proportional to the second-order reaction rate constant between EfOM and HO center dot (k(EfOM-HO center dot)). To understand the kinetics of this reaction as a function of the subcomponents of EfOM, four wastewater samples were fractionated by ultrafiltration into distinct apparent molecular weight (AMW) fractions (<1, <3, <5, and <10 kDa), and their k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were quantified. In general, the values for k(EfOM-HO center dot) decreased as the AMW increased. The values of k(EfOM-HO center dot) for the bulk waters varied between 6.32 and 14.1 x 10(8) M(C)(-1)s(-1) (units of per molar carbon concentration per second). In the case of the 1 kDa fraction, the values of k(EfOM-HO center dot). varied from 14.3 to 35.0 x 10(8) M(C)(-1)s(-1), or approximately 2.31(+/- 0.24) times that of the corresponding bulk waters. For the <3 kDa, <5 kDa, and <10 kDa fractions, the k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were 1.83(+/- 0.25), 1.32(+/- 0.23), and 1.26(+/- 0.35) times that of the bulk waters, respectively. Based on the obtained results, the variability and general magnitude of the k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were attributed to the production and reactivity of soluble microbial products (SMP), a major component of EfOM. Two samples collected at a wastewater treatment facility with different treatment variables had different k(EfOM-HO center dot) values, indicating that wastewater treatment processes will impact overall HO center dot scavenging by EfOM and should be considered during the implementation of AOPs.

AB Reactions of ozone (O-3) with the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin G (PG) and cephalexin (CP) have previously been found to yield products retaining antibacterial activities. These products are unequivocally identified here as the stereoisomeric (R)-sulfoxides of each parent molecule and characterized by a combination of chemical analysis and an antibacterial activity assay. PG-(R)-sulfoxide, which is similar to 15% as potent as PG itself, is formed in similar to 55% yield, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide, which is similar to 83% as active as CP, is formed with a maximum similar to 34% yield. PG-(R)-sulfoxide is recalcitrant toward further oxidation by O-3, but readily transformed by hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) k(HO center dot)(,app)(N) = 7.4 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1), pH 7), resulting in quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. In contrast CP-(R)-sulfoxide is degraded by both O-3 and HO center dot (k"(O3,app) = 2.6 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) and k"(HO center dot,app) = 7.6 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), pH 7), leading to quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. During ozonation of a secondary municipal wastewater effluent sample (pH 8.1, C-DOC = 4.0 mg/L, [alkalinity] = 3.6 mM as HCO3-) spiked with [PG](0) = 1 mu M, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.15 mu M for O-3 doses up to 100 mu M (4.8 mg/L), but reached 0.47 mu M with 10-mM t-BuOH added as a HO center dot scavenger. In contrast, CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.1 mu M for the same wastewater spiked with [CP](0) = 1,mu M in either the presence or absence of t-BuOH, indicating that CP-(R)-sulfoxide transformation is governed primarily by direct reaction with O-3. These findings suggest that, for a given degree of parent compound transformation, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields would likely be greatest during zonation of wastewaters characterized by low O-3 demands and high HO center dot scavenging rates, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields would be less matrix-dependent In general, complete deactivation of penicillins during wastewater treatment will likely require higher O-3 exposures than necessary for deactivation of cephalosporins.

AB The occurrence and removal of 58 pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pesticides, were assessed in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, as well as in the effluent-receiving water body, the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva. An analytical screening method to simultaneously measure all of the 58 micropollutants was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The selection of pharmaceuticals was primarily based on a prioritization study, which designated them as environmentally relevant for the Lake Geneva region. Except for the endocrine disruptor 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, all substances were detected in 24-h composite samples of wastewater entering the WWTP or in the treated effluent. Of these compounds, 40% were also detected in raw drinking water, pumped from the lake 3 km downstream of the WWTP. The contributions of dilution and degradation to micropollutant elimination between the WWTP outlet and the raw drinking water intake were established in different model scenarios using hypothetical residence times of the wastewater in Vidy Bay of I. 4, or 90 d. Concentration decrease due to processes other than dilution was observed for diclofenac, beta-blockers, several antibiotics, corrosion inhibitors, and pesticides. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of pharmaceuticals were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) determined in the prioritization study and agreed within one order of magnitude, but MECs were typically greater than the corresponding PECs. Predicted no-effect concentrations of the analgesic paracetamol, and the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, were exceeded in raw drinking water samples and therefore present a potential risk to the ecosystem.

AB Caffeine has been associated with wastewater pollution in temperate and subtropical locations, but environmental caffeine concentrations in tropical locations have not been reported. The objectives of this study were to measure caffeine and agricultural pesticide (carbaryl, metalaxyl, and metribuzin) concentrations in environmental waters on the tropical north shore of Kauai (Hawaii, USA) and assess whether patterns in caffeine concentration were consistent with a wastewater caffeine source. Groundwater, river, stream and coastal ocean samples were collected in August 2006 and February 2007. Caffeine was detected in all August 2006 samples and in 33% of February 2007 samples at concentrations up to 88 ng L-1. Metribuzin was detected in five samples collected in February 2007. Carbaryl and metalaxyl were not detected in any sample. Caffeine was not detected in offshore ocean samples or river samples upstream of human development. A positive correlation between caffeine and enterococci suggested a possible wastewater caffeine source. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of 170 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, priority substances according to the 2008/105EU Directive and four metals (Cd, Ni, Hg, Pb) have been investigated at the Llobregat delta, south of Barcelona (Spain). In the area, reclaimed water is destined to satisfy environmental uses, irrigation and the construction of a hydraulic barrier against seawater intrusion in the deep aquifer of the delta. A monitoring survey was undertaken of water samples from a tertiary wastewater treatment plant (Depurbaix), treated waste water with an additional treatment of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection (WWATP, for the hydraulic barrier injection). Groundwater samples from the aquifer receiving recharge were also investigated. The pharmaceutical group of substances was detected in sampled waters at concentrations rarely exceeding a few mu g/L, among the compounds Caffeine. Nicotine and Galaxolide (musk fragrance) were found to be present in more than 60% of the samples. Diuron was the only priority substance detected. The four metals were always present in a variable concentration. After the WWATP treatment the majority of analytes are removed from tertiary treated wastewater or their concentration is reduced below 0.1 mu g/L Monitoring revealed a widespread occurrence of analysed compounds in groundwater. Among them Codeine (analgesic), Ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory), lopamidol, lopromide (contrast agent) and Paraxanthine (metabolite of caffeine) have only been detected in groundwater, and are not present in water currently being injected in the deep aquifer.

AB Cabamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic pharmaceutical compound, is a pollutant of aquatic ecosystems entering via wastewater treatment plants that is considered to be persistent to degradation. An isotope exchange technique was employed using radiolabelled CBZ as a model compound, to determine the amount of isotopic exchangeability of CBZ in river sediment. The amount of isotopically exchangeable CBZ was used as an estimate of the extent of desorption hysteresis in solution from river sediment, including a treatment where the sediment was amended with black carbon. The isotopically exchangeable CBZ was measured by equilibrating (12)C-CBZ with sediment for 0 to 28 days followed by a 24 hour equilibration with (14)C-CBZ at the end of the incubation period. The isotopically exchangeable fraction of CBZ decreased over time in the sediment, particularly following amendment with black carbon. This has important implications for the fate of CBZ, which, apart from being resistant to degradation, is constantly released into aquatic ecosystems from wastewater treatment plants. This study demonstrates the availability of a relatively quick and simple alternative to batch desorption techniques for the assessment of the available fraction of organic compounds in sediments following their release into aquatic ecosystems.

AB The presence of iodinated X-ray contrast media compounds (ICM) in surface and ground waters has been reported. This is likely due to their biological inertness and incomplete removal in wastewater treatment processes. The present study reports partial degradation mechanisms based on elucidating the structures of major reaction by-products using gamma-irradiation and LC-MS. Studies conducted at concentrations higher than observed in natural waters is necessary to elucidate the reaction by-product structures and to develop destruction mechanisms. To support these mechanistic studies, the bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot and e(aq)(-) with one ionic ICM (diatrizoate), four non-ionic ICM (iohexol, iopromide, iopamidol, and iomeprol), and the several analogues of diatrizoate were determined. The absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants for diatrizoate, iohexol, iopromide, iopamidol, and iomeprol with (OH)-O-center dot were (9.58 +/- 0.23)x10(8), (3.20 +/- 0.13)x10(9), (3.34 +/- 0.14)x10(9), (3.42 +/- 0.28)x10(9), and (2.03 +/- 0.13)x10(9) M-1 s(-1), and with e(aq)(-) were (2.13 +/- 0.03)x10(10), (3.35 +/- 0.03)x10(10), (3.25 +/- 0.05)x10(10), (3.37 +/- 0.05)x10(10), and (3.47 +/- 0.02) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Transient spectra for the intermediates formed by the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot were also measured over the time period of 1-100 mu s to better understand the stability of the radicals and for evaluation of reaction rate constants. Degradation efficiencies for the (OH)-O-center dot and e(aq)(-) reactions with the five ICM were determined using steady-state gamma-radiolysis.

AB The present study examines the contribution of combined sewer overflows (CSO) to loads and concentrations of trace contaminants in receiving surface water. A simple method to assess the ratio of CSO to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents was applied to the urban River Spree in Berlin, Germany. The assessment indicated that annual loads are dominated by CSO for substances with removal in WWTP above similar to 95%. Moreover, it showed that substances with high removal in WWTP can lead to concentration peaks in the river during CSO events. The calculated results could be verified based on eight years of monitoring data from the River Spree, collected between 2000 and 2007. Substances that are well removed in WWTP such as NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) were found to occur in significantly increased concentration during CSO, while the concentration of substances that are poorly removable in WWTP such as EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) decreased in CSO-influenced samples due to dilution effects. The overall results indicate the potential importance of the CSO pathway of well-removable sewage-based trace contaminants to rivers. In particular, high concentrations during CSO events may be relevant for aquatic organisms. Given the results, it is suggested to include well-removable, sewage-based trace contaminants, a substance group often neglected in the past, in future studies on urban rivers in case of combined sewer systems. The presented methodology is suggested for a first assessment, since it is based solely on urban drainage data, which is available in most cities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of the pharmaceuticals phenazone and metamizole, two pyrazolone-derivates in widespread use, using biofilms created by natural organisms from the national park Unteres Odertal, Germany, were investigated. An analytical method based on LC-MS/ MS was optimised to determine the substances phenazone and methylaminoantipyrine (MAA), the hydrolysis product of metamizole (also known as dipyrone), as well as their metabolites 1,5-dimethy1-1,2-dehydro-3-pyrazolone (DP), acetaminoantipyrine (AAA), formylaminoantipyrine (FAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA). Performance characteristics of the method were evaluated in terms of recovery, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, method detection limits (MDL) and method quantification limits (MQL). Degradation studies of phenazone and MAA were conducted using a laboratory-scale continuous flow biofilm reactor fed with different nutrient media and with variable hydraulic retention times of 24 and 32 h. MAA was degraded rapidly to FAA and AA, while phenazone was not degraded under the prevailing conditions even after 32 h. By operating the bioreactor in batch mode to study the phenazone degradation potential of the biofilm under limiting nutrient conditions, an elimination rate of 85% phenazone was observed, but because of the slow elimination rate and aerobic conditions, the metabolite DP was not detected. In additional batch experiments using bacterial isolates from the natural biofilm to decompose phenazone, some bacterial strains were able to form DP from phenazone in marginal concentrations over the sampling period of eight weeks. Obviously, the microorganisms need a reasonably long time to adapt their metabolisms to enable the removal of phenazone from water samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing concern regarding the presence of unregulated trace organic chemicals in drinking water supplies that receive discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. In comparison to conventional and advanced drinking water treatment, riverbank filtration represents a low-cost and low-energy alternative that can attenuate total organic carbon (TOC) as well as trace organic chemicals (TOrC). This study examined the role of predominant redox conditions, retention time, biodegradable organic carbon, and temperature to achieve attenuation of TOC and TOrC through monitoring efforts at three full-scale RBF facilities in different geographic areas of the United States. The RBF systems investigated in this study were able to act as a reliable barrier for TOC, nitrogen, and certain TOrC. Temperature (seasonal) variation played an important role for the make-up of the river water quality and performance of the RBF systems. Temperatures of less than 10 C did not affect TOC removal but resulted in diminished attenuation of nitrate and select TOrC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of trace organic contaminants in drinking water supplies, wastewater effluents and the environment is amplifying interest in membrane treatment methods due to the removal of a wide variety of organic solutes. During operation, organic matter present in source water accumulates at a membrane's surface. This fouling layer could potentially influence the degree of removal of dissolved constituents including organic contaminants of concern. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of organic matter fouling on membrane characteristics and the rejection of non-ionic organic solutes.
   Three nanofiltration membranes (NF-90, TFC-S, and NF-270) were fouled with microfiltered secondary-treated wastewater effluent at bench-scale under constant-flux filtration. The membranes were characterized prior-to and after fouling in terms of surface charge, hydrophobicity, effective pore size distribution, and phenomenological model coefficients. Rejection experiments were subsequently conducted with eight non-ionic trace organic contaminants of varying size to determine how membrane fouling affects the rejection of environmentally relevant organic contaminants.
   The effect of membrane fouling was found to be dependent upon the membrane evaluated. Membrane fouling resulted in an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge for the TFC-S and NF-270 membranes, while the hydrophobicity decreased and surface charge increased for the NF-90 membrane. The effective pore size of the NF-90 membrane became slightly smaller with a larger deviation of pore sizes indicating that fouling affected the sieving mechanism of the membrane. However, the calculated effective pore size of the NF-270 membrane increased as characterization compound rejection was generally lower for the fouled membrane, which may be explained by cake-enhanced concentration polarization. The rejection of the non-ionic organic contaminants investigated by the NF-90 membrane was greater than 80% and was relatively unaffected by organic fouling. The NF-270 membrane provided variable rejection of the non-ionic organic contaminants and had markedly lower rejection for acetaminophen, bisphenol-A, and phenacetin after membrane fouling with effluent organic matter. Examination of rejection using the phenomenological model had advantages over examining rejection at a particular permeate flux, particularly, that rejection over a wide range of permeate flux (where rejection is variable) could be characterized by two model parameters.

AB We investigated two commonly used antimicrobial agents triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) in the Pearl River system in China (i.e., Liuxi, Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers) and four sewage effluents during dry and wet seasons. The median values for TCS and TCC were the highest in the surface water and sediments of the Shijing River, followed by the Zhujiang River and Liuxi River. Screening level risk assessment using the risk quotient (RQ) method showed that TCS and TCC in surface water posed median risks in the Zhujiang and Liuxi Rivers (RQs: 0.28-0.62 for TCS, and 0.15-0.80 for TCC) and high risks in the Shijing River (RQs: 5.15-9.55 for TCS, and 3.32-5.83 for TCC). Higher risks (RQs: 3.63-28.47 for TCS, and 3.13-24.54 for TCC) were found in the sediments than in surface water of the Pearl River system. The four sewage effluents and Shijing River as well as other urban streams in Guangzhou metropolitan area were identified as the sources of the two compounds in the main river Zhujiang River. The mass inventories of TCS and TCC in the Pearl River system indicate that the sediments are not only an important sink but also a potential source for the two compounds in surface water.

AB A monitoring study was carried out for the four seasons over 1-year monitoring period (March 2006-March 2007) to investigate the residues of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to various therapeutic categories. The selected areas of the study were the municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Ioannina city, located in Western Greece. The most common pre-treatment technique for pharmaceuticals, solid-phase extraction (SPE), was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target analytes. The samples were screened using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the monitoring study, showed the occurrence of all target compounds in the wastewater samples. Concentrations in the municipal WWTP ranged between 0.3 and 164.4 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 13.9 mu g/L in the effluent. In the hospital WWTP concentrations ranged between 0.6 and 70.1 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 14.6 mu g/L in the effluent. Mean removal efficiencies ranged between 13% and 97% and between 9% and 87% for municipal and hospital WWTPs, respectively. Removal efficiencies were higher in the municipal WWTP than in the hospital WWTP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The disappearance of the compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and the rate constants were 0.075, 0.072 and 0.182 min(-1) for atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively. After 240 min irradiation, the reaction intermediates were completely mineralized to CO2 and the nitrogen was predominantly as NH4+. The influence of initial pH and beta-blocker concentration on the kinetics was also studied. From adsorption studies it appears that the photocatalytic degradation occurred mainly on the surface of TiO2. Further studies indicated that surface reaction with (OH)-O-center dot radical was principally responsible for the degradation of these three beta-blockers. The major degradation intermediates were identified by HPLC/MS analysis. Cleavage of the side chain and the addition of the hydroxyl group to the parent compounds were found to be the two main degradation pathways for all three beta-blockers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aim of this study was to provide an up-to-date assessment of the antibiotics contaminating the aqueous environment in Italy, for a better understanding of risks for the ecosystem and human health. Antibiotics were first listed in order of their theoretical environmental loads, then were measured in wastewater of some sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in rivers in Italy. Macrolides, particularly clarithromycin and spiramycin, and quinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin and L-floxacin/ofloxacin, were the most abundant antibiotics in untreated wastewater. Several of them were not removed in STPs and still remained in the treated wastewater, and a total estimate of 7-14 tons of active principles were discharged annually into the aqueous environment in Italy through this route. Results of the analysis of rivers in northern Italy agreed with these figures, with an average load of 5 kg/day, or about 1.8 tons/year, of antibiotics flowing in the River Po, at sampling sites covering a basin comprising about one-fifth of the Italian population. In conclusion, antibiotics, particularly macrolides and quinolones, are widespread environmental contaminants, and urban STPs are confirmed a major source of the contamination. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

AB The white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor has been studied as a potential agent for the removal of environmental pollutants. For long-time solid-phase bioremediation systems a test is required to monitor the metabolic status of T. versicolor and its degradation capability at different stages. A biodegradation test based on the percentage of degradation of a spiked model pharmaceutical (anti-inflammatory naproxen) in 24h (ND24) is proposed to monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in sewage sludge. ND24 is intended to act as a test complementary to ergosterol quantification as specific fungal biomarker, and laccase activity as extracellular oxidative capacity of T. versicolor. For samples collected over 45 d, ND24 values did not necessarily correlate with ergosterol or laccase amounts but in most cases, they were over 30% degradation, indicating that T. versicolor may be suitable for bioremediation of sewage sludge in the studied period.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have received great attentions from the general and scientific community due to their potential impacts on ecological and human health. We investigated the occurrence of twelve acidic pharmaceuticals and herbicides (salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, diclofenac, meclofenamic acid and indomethacin) in surface waters of the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River in north China during the wet and dry seasons and assessed the potential risks to aquatic organisms posed by these acidic compounds. Seven acidic compounds were detected in the rivers, including five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, mefenamic acid and naproxen), and two blood lipid regulators (clofibric acid and gemfibrozil). The concentrations for acidic pharmaceuticals in the Yellow River and Liao River were in most cases higher in the dry season than in the wet season, but the concentrations of acidic compounds in the Hai River were generally higher in July than in November. High concentrations of these detected compounds in the Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River were found more frequently at those sites located in metropolitan areas, lower reaches or river confluences. Only diclofenac and ibuprofen were found to have medium to high risks in the three rivers based on the calculated risk quotients. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic transport downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge was evaluated along stream reaches on Mud Creek, Spring Creek, and Decatur Branch in northwestern Arkansas, USA. Water and streambed samples were collected during August and September 2006 and analyzed for multiple antibiotics representing five classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones. sulfonamides, and tetracyclines). Antibiotics within the classes macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonamides were detected in the water column at all three stream reaches. Several of these same antibiotics, as well as antibiotics from the class tetracycline, were measured in streambed material at quantities significantly greater than those observed in the water column. Pseudo-partitioning coefficients ranged from 4 to >8000 L kg(-1). Most of the antibiotics studied were significantly retained in the reaches at Mud Creek and Spring Creek and traveled kilometer-scale distances (S-net, 3.3-20.2 km) with low uptake velocities (nu(f-net), 2.9-16.1 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) and rates (U-net 0.01-37.9 x 10(-6) mu g m(-2) s(-1)). Some antibiotics increased in concentration downstream from the effluent discharge at Decatur Branch, suggesting possible release from within the fluvial channel or additional sources along the stream reach. In general, antibiotics traveled kilometer-scale distances before significant dilution occurred through in-stream processes (e.g., advection, dispersion, sorption, uptake and/or degradation) within the fluvial channel of these effluent-dominated streams.

AB Facilities involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are an under-investigated source of pharmaceuticals to the environment Between 2004 and 2009, 35 to 38 effluent samples were collected from each of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in New York and analyzed for seven pharmaceuticals including opioids and muscle relaxants. Two WWTPs (NY2 and NY3) receive substantial flows (>20% of plant flow) from pharmaceutical formulation facilities (PFF) and one (NY1) receives no PFF flow. Samples of effluents from 23 WWTPs across the United States were analyzed once for these pharmaceuticals as part of a national survey. Maximum pharmaceutical effluent concentrations for the national survey and NY1 effluent samples were generally <1 mu g/L. Four pharmaceuticals (methadone, oxycodone, butalbital, and metaxalone) in samples of NY3 effluent had median concentrations ranging from 3.4 to >400 mu g/L. Maximum concentrations of oxycodone (1700 mu g/L) and metaxalone (3800 mu g/L) in samples from NY3 effluent exceeded 1000 mu g/L Three pharmaceuticals (butalbital, carisoprodol, and oxycodone) in samples of NY2 effluent had median concentrations ranging from 2 to 11 mu g/L. These findings suggest that current manufacturing practices at these PFFs can result in pharmaceuticals concentrations from 10 to 1000 times higher than those typically found in WWTP effluents.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are commonly detected in the aquatic environment at concentrations up to the low microgram per liter range. In this study, the biotransformation of selected ICM (diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol, and iopamidol) in aerobic soil-water and river sediment-water batch systems was investigated. In addition, microbial transformation pathways were proposed. Diatrizoate, an ionic ICM, was not biotransformed, while three nonionic ICM were transformed into several biotransformation products (TPs) at neutral pH. Iohexol and iomeprol were biotransformed to eleven TPs and fifteen TPs, respectively, while eight TPs were detected for iopamidol. Since seven of the TPs detected during biotransformation had not been previously identified, mass fragmentation experiments were completed to elucidate the chemical structures. Oxidation of primary alcoholic moieties, cleavage of the N-C bonds (i.e., deacetylation and removal of hydroxylated propanoic acids), and decarboxylation are potential reactions that can explain the formation of the identified TPs. Iohexol and iomeprol had similar biotransformation rates, while iopamidol was biotransformed slower and to a lesser extent. A LC tandem MS method confirmed the presence of ICM TPs in aqueous environmental samples. Fifteen of the ICM TPs were even detected in drinking water with concentrations up to 120 ng/L.

AB The present study evaluates the presence of nine hormones and their conjugates and 20 pharmaceuticals such as anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, and antibiotics among others in sewage sludge from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Tarragona area (Spain) for the period March 2007 until March 2008. Target analytes have been determined using different methods involving pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography (electrospray ionization) tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Most of the pharmaceuticals and hormones were found at low micrograms per kilogram dry weight levels in the sewage sludge samples analyzed. Some compounds were present in all samples, such as acetaminophen. caffeine, carbamazepine, and ibuprofen, among others. Other compounds, such as estriol, were found only in the. STP of Reus. The compounds that showed the highest concentration in both STPs were roxithromycin and tylosin (1,446 and 1,958 mu g/kg dry wt, respectively). The presence of these compounds in sewage sludge demonstrated that they are partially or totally removed from the influent wastewater by sorption into the sewage sludge. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Agricultural and urban activities result in the release of a large number of organic compounds that are suspected of impacting human health and ecosystems, herbicides, insecticides, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic hormones, personal care products, surfactants, plasticizers, fire retardants, and others Sorbed reservoirs of these compounds in soil represent a potentially chronic source of water contamination. This article is an introduction to a series of technical papers stemming from a symposium at the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Sod Science Society of America 2008 Annual Meeting, which was held jointly with The Geological Society of America, The Gulf Coast Association of Geological Scientists, and the Houston Geological Society, tinder one of the Joint Meeting's overarching themes Emerging Time Contaminants in Surface and Ground Water Generated from Mute Water and Solid Waste Application. The symposium emphasized the role of soils as sources, sinks, and reaction catalysts for these contaminants and the occurrence and fine of these contaminants in surface and underground water supplies Topics covered included novel advances in analytical techniques, transport of infectious agents, occurrence and fate of veterinary pharmaceuticals, characterization of sorption mechanism, biotic and abiotic transformation reactions, the role of soil components, occurrence and fate in wastewater treatment systems, transport of engineered nanoparticles, groundwater contamination resulting from urban runoff, and Issues in water reuse. Overviews of the reports, trends, gaps in our knowledge, and topics for further research are presented in this special series of papers The technical papers in this special series reflect current gains in knowledge and simultaneously underscore how poorly we arc able to predict the fate and, hence, the associated risk to ecological and human receptors of these contaminants

AB Triclosan (TCS) and indocarban (TCC), widely used as antibacterial agents, have been frequently detected in biosolids Bios lids land application may introduce pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) such as TCS and TCC into the environment Microcosm studies were conducted to investigate TCS and TCC transformation in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam Both compounds were spiked into the soils with and without biosolids amendment under non-sterilized and sterilized conditions and incubated aerobically at 30 degrees C liar up to 100 d In both sods, transformation of TCS followed second-order reaction kinetics, with estimated reaction rate constants of (5 27 +/- 0 920) x 10(-1) and (9 13 +/- 1 58) x 10(-2) (mg kg(-1))(-1) d(-1) for Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively Transformation of TCC in both sods was slower than that for TCS After 100 d, 53 +/- 1% and 71 +/- 2% of the initially added TCC and only 2 8 +/- 0 35% and 62 +/- 0.80% of initially added TCS remained in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively. The transformation of both compounds were faster in the Marietta fine loam (pH 7 8, 1 8% organic matter) than in the McLaurin coarse loam (pH 4.7, 0 65% organic matter) Our result suggests that biotic processes are more of a controlling factor affecting TCS transformation, whereas abiotic processes may affect TCC transformation more significantly Addition of biosolids to the two soils slowed the transformation of both compounds, indicating interactions between both compounds and biosolids may adversely affect their transformation in sods, an important factor that must be included in models predicting environmental fate of biosolids-associated PPCPs.

AB Groundwater quality effects from septic ranks were investigated in the Woodville Karst Plain, an area that contains numerous sinkholes and a thin veneer of sands and clays overlying the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) Concerns have emerged about elevated nitrate concentrations in the UFA, which is the source of water supply in this area of northern Florida At three sites during dry and wet periods in 2007-2008, water samples were collected from the septic tank, shallow and deep lysimeters, and drainfield and background wells in the UFA and analyzed for in chemical indicators including nutrients. nitrate isotopes, organic wastewater compounds (OWCs), pharmaceutical compounds, and microbiological indicators (bacteria and viruses) Median NO3-N concentration in groundwater beneath the septic tank drainfields was 20 mg L-1 (8 0-26 mg L-1) After adjusting for dilution, about 25 to 40% N loss (from dentrification, ammonium sorption, and ammonia volatilization) occurs as septic tank effluent moves through the unsaturated zone to the water table Nitrogen loading rates to groundwater were highly variable at each site (3 9-12 kg N yr(-1)), as were N and chloride depth profiles in the unsaturated zone Most OWCs and pharmaceutical compounds were highly attenuated beneath the drainfields: however, five OWCs (caffeine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, phenol, galaxolide, and tris(dichloroisotopropyl)phosphare) and two pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole) were detected in groundwater samples Indicator bacteria and human enteric viruses were detected in septic tank effluent samples but only intermittently in soil water and groundwater Contaminant movement to groundwater beneath each septic tank system also was related to water use and differences in lithology at each site.

AB The irrigation of agricultural land with wastewater is increasingly practiced in many parts of the world as a consequence of growing populations and urbanization The risks emerging from pharmaceuticals that are contained in wastewater for soils and groundwater have hardly been investigated We studied leaching and effects of naproxen. ibuprofen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrocil. clarithromycin. trimethoprim, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metoprolol in a soil column experiment simulating an irrigation event with 8 6 cm of wastewater containing 20 mu g L(-1) or 2000 mu g L(-1) of each compound or of erythromycin alone The leached fraction of applied pharmaceuticals ranged from 0 1 +/- 0 1% (clarithromycin, 2000 mu g L(-1)) to 130 +/- 41 % (naproxen, 20 mu g L(-1)) and tended to increase with decreasing K(d) or K(oc). Naproxen transport was similar to that of the tracer chloride Ibuprofen was also hardly retarded (R = 1 20 +/- 0 18). but showed a higher degradation rate of 0 02 +/- 0 004 h(-1) (2000 mu g L(-1)) than naproxen The transport of a pulse of 2000 mu g L(-1) of bezafibrate could be described with a retardation factor of 1 5 and a degradation rate of 0.033 h(-1) The application of erythromycin alone or of a cocktail of all pharmaceuticals significantly Increased soil CO(2) emissions by 50% 1 d after the application Mere is a considerable risk that pharmaceuticals are leached to groundwater during wastewater irrigation

AB The purpose of this work was to analyse the potentialities of an integrated membrane system for the recovery, purification and concentration of polyphenols from olive mill wastewater (OMW). The proposed system included some well-known membrane operations such as microfiltration (MF) and nanofiltration (NF), as well as others not yet investigated for this specific application, such as osmotic distillation (OD) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD).
   The OMW was directly submitted to a MF operation without preliminary centrifugation. This step allowed to achieve a 91% and 26% reduction of suspended solids and total organic carbon (TOC), respectively. Moreover, 78% of the initial content of polyphenols was recovered in the permeate stream.
   The MF permeate was then submitted to a NF treatment. Almost all polyphenols were recovered in the produced permeate solution, while TOC was reduced from 15 g/L to 5.6 g/L. A concentrated solution enriched in polyphenols was obtained by treating the NF permeate by OD. In particular, a solution containing about 0.5 g/L of free low molecular weight polyphenols, with hydroxytyrosol representing 56% of the total, was produced by using a calcium chloride dihydrate solution as brine. The obtained solution is of interest for preparing formulations to be used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. Besides the OD process, VMD was applied as another way for concentrating the NF permeate and the performance of both processes was compared in terms of evaporation fluxes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Natural treatment systems such as bank filtration (BF) and artificial recharge (via an infiltration basin) are a robust barrier for many organic micropollutants (OMPs) and may represent a low-cost alternative compared to advanced drinking water treatment systems. This study analyzes a comprehensive database of OMPs at BF and artificial recharge (AR) sites located near Lake Tegel in Berlin (Germany). The focus of the study was on the derivation of correlations between the removal efficiencies of OMPs and key factors influencing the performance of BF and AR. At the BF site, shallow monitoring wells located close to the Lake Tegel source exhibited oxic conditions followed by prolonged anoxic conditions in deep monitoring wells and a production well. At the AR site, oxic conditions prevailed from the recharge pond along monitoring wells to the production well. Long residence times of up to 4.5 months at the BF site reduced the temperature variation during soil passage between summer and winter. The temperature variations were greater at the AR site as a consequence of shorter residence times. Deep monitoring wells and the production well located at the BF site were under the influence of ambient groundwater and old bank filtrate (up to several years of age). Thus, it is important to account for mixing with native groundwater and other sources (e.g., old bank filtrate) when estimating the performance of BF with respect to removal of OMPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate correlations between OMP removals and hydrogeochemical conditions with spatial and temporal parameters (e.g., well distance, residence time and depth) from both sites. Principal component-1 (PC1) embodied redox conditions (oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen), and principal component-2 (PC2) embodied degradation potential (e.g., total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) with the calcium carbonate dissolution potential (Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-)) for the BF site.

AB Apparent rate constants for the reactions of four selected pharmaceutical compounds (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) with chlorine in ultra-pure (UP) water were determined as a function of the pH. It was found that amoxicillin (in the whole pH range 3-12), and naproxen (in the low pH range 2-4) presented high reaction rates, while naproxen (in the pH range 5-9), and phenacetin and metoprolol (in the pH range 2.5-12 for phenacetin, and 3-10 for metoprolol) followed intermediate and slow reaction rates. A mechanism is proposed for the chlorination reaction, which allowed the evaluation of the intrinsic rate constants for the elementary reactions of the ionized and un-ionized species of each selected pharmaceutical with chlorine. An excellent agreement is obtained between experimental and calculated rate constants by this mechanism.
   The elimination of these substances in several waters (a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and two effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants) was also investigated at neutral pH. The efficiency of the chlorination process with respect to the pharmaceuticals elimination and the formation THMs was also established. It is generally observed that the increasing presence of organic and inorganic matter in the water matrices demand more oxidant agent (chlorine), and therefore, less chlorine is available for the oxidation of these compounds. Finally, half-life times and oxidant exposures (CT) required for the removal of 99% of the four pharmaceuticals are also evaluated. These parameters are useful for the establishment of safety chlorine doses in oxidation or disinfection stages of pharmaceuticals in treatment plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lipases are enzymes used in various industrial sectors such as food, pharmaceutical and chemical synthesis industries. The selection of microorganisms isolated from soil or wastewater is an alternative to the discovery of new species with high enzymes productivity and with different catalytic activities. In this study, the selection of lipolytic fungi was carried out by submerged fermentation. A total of 27 fungi were used, of which 20 were isolated from dairy effluent and 7 from soil contaminated with diesel oil. The largest producers were the fungi Penicillium E-3 with maximum lipolytic activity of 2.81 U, Trichoderma E-19 and Aspergillus O-8 with maximum activities of 2.34 and 2.03 U where U is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 mu mol of fatty acid per min per mL of enzyme extract. The fungi had maximum lipolytic activities on the 4th day of fermentation.

AB Lincosamides are among the most frequently detected antibacterial agents in effluents from wastewater treatment plants and surface runoff at agricultural production systems. Little is known about their transformations in the environment This study revealed that manganese oxide caused rapid and extensive decomposition of clindamycin and lincomycin in aqueous solution. The reactions occurred mainly at the pyranose ring of lincosamides, initially by formation of complexes with Mn and cleavage of the ether linkage, leading to the formation of a variety of degradation products via subsequent hydrolytic and oxidative reactions. The results of LC-MS/MS and FTIR analysis confirm cleavage of the C-O-C bond in the pyranose ring, formation of multiple carbonyl groups, and transformation of the methylthio moiety to sulfur oxide. The overall transformation was controlled by interactions of cationic species of lincosamides with MnO2 surfaces. The presence of electrolytes (i.e., NaCl, CaCl2, and MnCl2) and dissolved organic matter in aqueous solution, and increase of solution pH, diminished lincosamide binding to MnO2 hence reducing the rate and magnitude of the transformations. Results from this study indicate that manganese dioxides in soils and sediments could contribute to the decomposition of lincosamide antibiotics released into the environment.

AB Triclosan, a widely used antimicrobial, is known to undergo phototransformation in aqueous solution to form 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD). Two sediment cores from a wastewater-impacted depositional zone of the Mississippi River were analyzed for triclosan by ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-Q(3)) and for a suite of polychlorinated dioxins and furans by high resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) to provide evidence of this photoreaction in the environment 2,8-DCDD was detected at levels that trended with the historical use of triclosan since its introduction in the 1960s. Three other dioxin congeners, 2,3,7-TCDD, 1,2,8-TriCDD, and 1,2,3,8-TCDD, which are known photoproducts of chlorinated derivatives of triclosan, were also detected with similar trend profiles. These four congeners comprised the majority of di- through tetra-chlorinated dioxins. The trend profile of these specific dioxin congeners did not correlate with the trend profile of the higher-chlorinated dioxin homologues or any chlorinated furan homologues, suggesting a unique source. These results are fully consistent with the phototransformation of triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives that form during wastewater chlorine disinfection as the source of 2,8-DCDD, 2,3,7-TriCDD, 1,2,8-TriCDD, and 1,2,3,8-TCDD in this aquatic environment As the levels of triclosan-derived dioxins increased over time and the total level of chlorinated dioxins decreased, the contribution of triclosan-derived dioxins to the total dioxin pool increased to as high as 31% by mass in recent years, indicating that their contribution to total dioxin toxicity may need consideration.

AB In the past two decades much research effort has focused on the occurrence, effects, and risks of estrogenic compounds. However, increasing emissions of new emerging compounds may also affect the action of hormonal pathways other than the estrogenic hormonal axis. Recently, a suite of novel CALUX bioassays has become available that enables looking further than estrogenic effects only. By employing these bioassays, we recently showed high glucocorticogenic activity in wastewaters collected at various sites in The Netherlands. However, since bioassays provide an integrated biological response, the identity of the responsible biological compounds remained unknown. Therefore, our current objective was to elucidate the chemical composition of the wastewater extracts used in our previous study by means of LC-high-resolution Orbitrap MS/MS and to determine if the compounds quantified could account for the observed glucocorticoid responsive (GR) CALUX bioassay response. The mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of various glucocorticoids in the range of 13-1900 ng/L. In extracts of hospital wastewater collected prior to sewage treatment several glucocorticoids were identified (cortisol 275-301 ng/L, cortisone 381-472 ng/L, prednisone 117-545 ng/L, prednisolone 315-1918 ng/L, and triamcinolone acetonide 14-41 ng/L) which are used to treat a great number of human pathologies. A potency balance calculation based on the instrumental analyses and relative potencies (REPs) of the individual glucocorticoids supports the conclusion that triamcinolone acetonide (REP = 1.3), dexamethasone (REP = 1), and prednisolone (REP = 0.2) are the main contributors to the glucocorticogenic activity in the investigated wastewater extracts. The action of these compounds is concentration additive and the overall glucocorticogenic activity can be explained to a fairly large extent by their contribution.

AB In the present work, the investigations were firstly focused on the effect of microwave on the species distribution of ferric hydrolysates. as well as the effect of hydrolysates speciation on the treatment efficiency of organic compounds in the process of coagulation. A ferron-complexation timed spectrophotometric method was used to classify the Fe(III) speciation under different reaction conditions. Effects of microwave power, initial pH and reaction temperature on species distribution were intensively investigated. When microwave power and initial pH were 300W and 5, respectively, the amount of high polymeric ferric species, so-called Fe(c), reached its maximum. The increment of reaction temperature resulted in an increasing formation of Fe(c), and microwave was able to generate more Fe(c) than that of thermostatic method at the same temperature. Comparing with the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, the results indicated that Fe(c) facilitated the net rolling-sweep action for organic molecules in coagulation process, which enhanced the removal efficiency of entire reaction system.

AB Two-electrode cells with a Pt or boron-doped diamond anode and an air-diffusion cathode for H2O2 electrogeneration, and four-electrode combined cells containing the above pair of electrodes coupled in parallel to a Pt anode and a carbon-felt cathode, have been used to degrade the pharmaceutical beta-blocker atenolol by electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton methods. In these processes, organics are mainly oxidized with hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) formed simultaneously at the anode surface from water oxidation and from Fenton's reaction between added catalytic Fe2+ and electrogenerated H2O2. Aromatic intermediates such as 4-hydroxyphenylacetamide and p-benzoquinone and generated carboxylic acids such as maleic, fumaric, tartaric, tartronic, glycolic, formic, oxalic and oxamic are detected and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared with the single cells, the corresponding novel four-electrode combined systems enhance strongly the mineralization rate of atenolol in electro-Fenton because of the fast Fe2+ regeneration at the carbon-felt cathode favoring: (i) the production of more amounts of (OH)-O-center dot from Fenton's reaction that destroy more rapidly aromatic pollutants and (ii) the formation of Fe(II) complexes with final carboxylic acids such as oxalic and oxamic, which are more quickly oxidized with (OH)-O-center dot. In photoelectro-Fenton, both single and combined cells show a quite similar oxidation power giving almost total mineralization as a result of the parallel quick photolysis of Fe(III) and/or Fe(II) complexes under UVA irradiation. The efficient regeneration of Fe2+ with larger (OH)-O-center dot production in the combined cells causes a quicker atenolol decay, which always follows a pseudo first-order reaction. NH4+ and in smaller proportion NO3- are always released to the medium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The evaluation of treatment costs is one of the aspects which need more attention for the complete introduction of electrochemical reactors as an attractive alternative in the field of advanced oxidation processes. This paper presents the derivation and application of an expression to determine the optimal current density in order to carry out the direct electroxidation process of two pharmaceutical-compound-containing aqueous solutions (50 mg dm(-3)) in a parallel plate divided cell using platinized titanium as the anode. The calculi are based on the classical definition of the total cost of electrolyzers, including the electrode service life and completed by one experimental value (obtaining a semi-empirical equation) related to the relationship between the abatement kinetics and the applied current density. The determined value of the optimal current density resulted to be far from the diffusion-limiting current density, consequently, far from the maximum current efficiency, since the experimental parameter includes all other phenomenologies associated with rising in the electrical field across the cell. The methodology could be useful to compare, in terms of cost, different electrochemical reactors and electrode materials for the treatment of a specific organic pollutant. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

AB The sorption coefficients of four rarely studied zwitterionic pharmaceuticals (benzimidazoles: fenbendazole, albendazole. thiabendazole and flubendazole) and four metabolites of fenbendazole to various dissolved organic matter surrogates (humic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and liposomes made of 1-palmitoy1-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and sewage sludge) were measured to extend the available sorption coefficients and eventually to evaluate their environmental fate in soil and water environment. For the entire range of dissolved organic matters, the more hydrophobic fenbendazole and albendazole had higher sorption coefficients than thiabendazole and flubendazole, indicating that the traditional hypothesis of hydrophobic interaction holds for zwitterionic benzimidazole anthelmintics. However, the sorption coefficients of a given benzimidazole to selected dissolved organic matters (DOMs) varied within an order of magnitude. The measured Km values decreased in the order of fenbendazole, albendazole, thiabendazole and flubendazole for sewage sludge and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin whereas the orders were different for the other DOM surrogates, implying the hydrophilic nature of sewage sludge. This was also supported by the (N + O)/C elemental ratio of the sewage sludge sample used in this study. The correlations between log K-oc, and log K-ow were weak (r(2) = 0.28-0.64) and the magnitude of the sorption coefficients to the hydrophilic organic matters (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and sewage sludge) were similar to or slightly smaller than those for the hydrophobic organic matters (humic acids and liposome). This suggests that specific hydrophilic interactions also play a significant role in the sorption of moderately hydrophobic benzimidazoles to organic matters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The seasonal variations in the occurrence of carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, and acebutolol were studied at seven sites along River Fyris from December 2007 to December 2008. Samples were collected from the effluent of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP), at one upstream site, and five downstream sites of the WWTP). During one occasion in May 2008, water samples were collected at different locations and depths in the recipient lake. All analytes except of acebutolol were present in both the river and the lake at quantifiable amounts at all sampling occasions. Carbamazepine was found in similar concentrations (about 90 ng L(-1)) at all sampling sites and all studied depths (0.5-40 m) in the lake, indicating high environmental persistence of this compound. A clear seasonal pattern was observed for the natural attenuation of the beta-blockers in the river, with the highest attenuation occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. The loss of beta-blockers on a distance of 1320 m reached up to 75% during summer time but was insignificant during winter. The seasonal variations in the loss followed the seasonal variations in water temperature and chlorophyll a mass flow suggesting that biotransformation and adsorption are the main processes responsible for the loss of the studied pharmaceuticals in River Fyris downstream the WWTP.

AB Fifty-six pharmaceuticals of various chemical groups, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and cardiovascular drugs, were detected in four selected river waters receiving sewage effluents in the Community of Madrid (Spain). A promising approach for the degradation of those residues is the application of a photo-Fenton treatment. Several new bioassays using fern spores were employed for the evaluation of acute and chronic toxicity based on mitochondrial activity, DNA and chlorophyll quantifications of as-received river water and photo-Fenton-treated samples. photo-Fenton treatment provided a high degree of total organic carbon mineralization with up to 70% reduction for river water samples. In addition, the elimination of most of the studied pharmaceutical compounds was confirmed. A few compounds, however (salicylic acid, ofloxacin, caffeine, cotinine and nicotine), seemed more resistant, with after-treatment concentrations between 4 and 44 ng L-1. Nicotine showed the most refractory behaviour with concentrations ranging from 29 to 224 ng L-1 for treated samples. Photo-Fenton treatment yielded a significant decrease in acute and chronic toxicity, even though some residual toxicity remained after treatment. This fact seemed to be related to the presence of toxicants in the water matrix, probably of inorganic nature, rather than the toxic effect of the studied pharmaceutical compounds, as revealed by the effective removal of these compounds and high TOC mineralization of photo-Fenton treatments.

AB Wastewater reclamation processes, including membrane bio reactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane, have been built, and those processes were independently operated, under recycling conditions, to compare the performances, with respect to contaminants removal and fouling minimization. The hydrophilic fractions of organic matter were more effectively removed than the hydrophobic fraction through the system due to microbial activities in the MBR, as measured using three dimensional fluorescence excitation and emission spectra. Furthermore, levels of nitrogen compounds, micropollutants, metals, and metalloid were substantially reduced by the applied MBR and NF system. These observations were in good agreements with patterns in molecular weight distributions and fluorescence spectra. The major components of membrane fouling in the system for wastewater reclamation were the hydrophilic fractions; high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, fluorescence and infrared spectra, and XAD 8/4 resins revealed that the hydrophilic fractions (non-humic substances), comprising of protein-like substances and saccharide groups, are responsible for serious membrane fouling in the tested system for wastewater reclamation.

AB The present study measured the occurrence, distribution, and bioaccumulation of fluoxetine in samples of water, polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), sediment, and caged freshwater mussels at stream sites near a municipal wastewater treatment facility effluent discharge. We assessed the relation of the environmental concentrations to reproductive endpoints in mussels in acute laboratory tests. Concentrations of fluoxetine in water and POCIS samples were similar (<20% difference) within each site and were greatest in the effluent channel (104-119 ng/L), and decreased at 50 m and 100 m downstream. Likewise, concentrations of fluoxetine in sediment and mussel (Elliptio complanata) tissue were greatest in the effluent channel (17.4 ng/g wet wt for sediment and 79.1 ng/g wet wt for mussels). In 96-h lab tests, fluoxetine significantly induced parturition of nonviable larvae from female E. complanata exposed to 300 mu g/L (p = 0.0118) and 3,0001 mu g/L (p < 0.0001) compared to controls. Fluoxetine exposure at 300 mu g/L (p= 0.0075) and 3,0001 mu g/L (p= 0.0001) also resulted in stimulation of lure display behavior in female Lampsilis fasciola and Lampsilis cardium, respectively. In male E. complanata, 3,000 mu g fluoxetine/L significantly induced release of spermatozeugmata during a 48-h exposure. These results suggest that fluoxetine accumulates in mussel tissue and has the potential to disrupt several aspects of reproduction in freshwater mussels, a faunal group recognized as one of the most imperiled in the world. Despite the disparity between measured environmental concentrations of fluoxetine and effects concentrations in our short-term tests with these long-lived animals, additional tests are warranted to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations and critical lifestages (e.g., juveniles).

AB Ten nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). two blood lipid regulators (BLRs), and two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were analyzed in the Pearl River system in China (i.e., Liuxi, Zhujiang. and Shijing Rivers) and four sewage effluents during the dry and wet seasons, and the environmental risks they posed were assessed. Eight pharmaceuticals were detected in the rivers and effluents, including five NSAIDs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, and naproxen), two BLRs (clofibric acid and gemfibrozil), and one AED (carbamazepine). The median concentrations for the eight pharmaceuticals ranged from 11.2 to 102 ng/L. Seasonal variations were not obvious for most pharmaceuticals in the three rivers, except for salicylic acid and clolibric acid in the Zhujiting River, and diclofenac in the Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers. However, spatially considerable variations in the concentrations were observed for the eight pharmaceuticals in all three rivers. For most of the pharmaceuticals, the effluents from the four wastewater treatment plants and Shijing River water were found to be the major discharge sources for the Zhujiang River, but with additional discharge sources front some small urban streams in the wet season. Diclofenac in the Shijing River was the only pharmaceutical that had a risk quotient (RQ) >1, indicating a high risk to aquatic organisms in the river. Although higher RQs were calculated for the mixture of the pharmaceuticals in each river, the risk rating remained the same for the three rivers with the RQ being >1 only in Shijing River.

AB The current study investigated the sorption of sulfadimethoxine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TET), and oxytetracycline (OTC) to Na-rich montmorillonite clay in synthetic effluent (SE) and field wastewater effluent (FE). Both SMT and SMX showed a low sorption capacity and are therefore likely to be highly mobile in the environment, while the sorption of TET to clay in environmental pH range (6.5-7.5) showed similarly high adsorption capacity. Differences in sorption capacities of TET and OTC to SE or FE were attributed to the various concentrations of divalent cations in the effluents. In addition, differences in sorption of OTC or TET to SE were attributed to their different molecular structure. Moreover, the adsorption of TET in SE and FE showed linear adsorption isotherms and fitted to Freundlich model. Further experiments showed that addition of humic acid or SE to TET sorbed to clay did not enhance or suppress the sorption of TET to clay.

AB Bioaugmentation was investigated as a method to decrease the recovery period of anaerobic digesters exposed to a transient toxic event. Two sets of laboratory-scale digesters (SRT = 10 days, OLR = 2 g COD/L-day), started with inoculum from a digester stabilizing synthetic municipal wastewater solids (MW) and synthetic industrial wastewater (WW), respectively, were transiently exposed to the model toxicant, oxygen. Bioaugmented digesters received 1.2 g VSS/L-day of an H-2-utilizing culture for which the archaeal community was analyzed. Soon after oxygen exposure, the bioaugmented digesters produced 25-60% more methane than non-bioaugmented controls (p < 0.05). One set of digesters produced lingering high propionate concentrations, and bioaugmentation resulted in significantly shorter recovery periods. The second set of digesters did not display lingering propionate, and bioaugmented digesters recovered at the same time as non-bioaugmented controls. The difference in the effect of bioaugmentation on recovery may be due to differences between microbial communities of the digester inocula originally employed. In conclusion, bioaugmentation with an H2-utilizing culture is a potential tool to decrease the recovery period, decrease propionate concentration, and increase biogas production of some anaerobic digesters after a toxic event. Digesters already containing rapidly adaptable microbial communities may not benefit from bioaugmentation, whereas other digesters with poorly adaptable microbial communities may benefit greatly.

AB Seven mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) of different configurations were operated outdoors for nine months to assess their ability to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewaters. CWs differed in some design parameters, namely the presence of plants, the species chosen (i.e., Typha angustifolia vs Phragmites australis), flow configuration (i.e., surface flow vs subsurface flow) and the presence of a gravel bed. A nearby conventional activated-sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) fed with the same sewage was simultaneously monitored for comparison. The PPCPs ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate were monitored. The presence of plants favoured the removal of some PPCPs. The performance of the mesocosm studied was compound-dependant, soilless CWs showing the highest removal efficiency for ketoprofen, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, while free-water CWs with effluent leaving through the bottom of the tank performed well for the degradation of ketoprofen, salicylic acid, galaxolide and tonalide. Finally, subsurface horizontal flow CWs were efficient for the removal of caffeine. Significant linear correlations were observed between the removal of some PPCPs and temperature or redox potential. Hence, microbiological pathways appear to be the most probable degradation route for PPCPs in the CWs studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. Many pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during wastewater treatment, leading to their presence in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, lakes, and ground water. Here, we developed analytical methods for monitoring ten pharmaceuticals from surface water by LC/ESI-MS/MS. For sample clean-up and extraction, MCX (mixed cation exchange) and HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were used. The limits of detection (LOD) in distilled water and the blank surface water were in the range of 0.006 - 0.65 and 1.66 - 45.05 pg/mL, respectively. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) for the distilled water and the blank surface water were in the range of 0.02 - 2.17 and 5.52 - 150.15 pg/mL, respectively. The absolute recoveries for fortified water samples were between 62.1% and 125.4%. Intra-day precision and accuracy for the blank surface water were 2.9% - 24.1% (R.S.D.) and -16.3% - 16.3% (bias), respectively. In surface wastewater near rivers, chlortetracycline and acetylsalicylic acid were detected frequently in the range of 0.017 - 5.404 and 0.029 - 0.269 ng/mL, respectively. Surface water near rivers had higher levels than surface water of domestic treatment plants.

AB Hydrochlorothiazide (6-chloro-1,1-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide), a thiazidic diuretic very frequently used in the treatment of hypertension, has been oxidized by means of UV radiation, Fenton's reagent and ozone. The influence of some operating variables was established, and the main kinetic parameters were determined. Specifically, for the photodegradation process, quantum yields ranging between 0.028 and 0.048 mol Eins(-1) were obtained depending on the temperature and pH. At the same time, in the ozonation process and by using competition kinetics, the values deduced for the second-order rate constants varied from 91.3 M-1 s(-1) at pH = 3 to 16400 M-1 s(-1) at pH = 9. Similarly, competition kinetics was also used in the Fenton's reagent process for the determination of the rate constants for the reaction of this pharmaceutical with hydroxyl radicals, and the value deduced at 20 degrees C was (5.7 +/- 0.3) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1). The oxidation of this selected pharmaceutical was also followed in some water systems (a surface water from a reservoir SW. and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant SE), by UV radiation and ozone. The influence of the operating conditions on the removal efficiency was established, and specifically for the ozonation process, a kinetic model was proposed for the prediction of the elimination of the selected pharmaceutical in these water systems, which could well reproduce experimental data.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Bioassays are well established in the pharmaceutical industry and single compound analysis, but there is still uncertainty about their usefulness in environmental monitoring. We compared the responses of five bioassays designed to measure estrogenic activity (the yeast estrogen screen, ER-CALUX, MELN, T47D-KBluc, and E-SCREEN assays) and chemical analysis on extracts from four different water sources (groundwater, raw sewage, treated sewage, and river water). All five bioassays displayed similar trends and there was good agreement with analytical chemistry results. The data from the ER-CALUX and E-SCREEN bioassays were robust and predictable, and well-correlated with predictions from chemical analysis. The T47D-KBluc appeared likewise promising, but with a more limited sample size it was less compelling. The YES assay was less sensitive than the other assays by an order of magnitude, which resulted in a larger number of nondetects. The MELN assay was less predictable, although the possibility that this was due to laboratory-specific difficulties cannot be discounted. With standardized bioassay data analysis and consistency of operating protocols, bioanalytical tools are a promising advance in the development of a tiered approach to environmental water quality monitoring.

AB A primary pathway for emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, steroids, and hormones) to enter aquatic ecosystems is effluent from sewage treatment plants (STP), and identifying technologies to minimize the amount of these contaminants released is important. Quantifying the flux of these contaminants through STPs is difficult. This study evaluates the behavior of gadolinium, a rare earth element (REE) utilized as a contrasting agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), through four full-scale metropolitan STPs that utilize several biosolids thickening, conditioning, stabilization, and dewatering processing technologies. The organically complexed Gd from MRIs has been shown to be stable in aquatic systems and has the potential to be utilized as a conservative tracer in STP operations to compare to an emerging contaminant of interest Influent and effluent waters display large enrichments in Gd compared to other REEs. In contrast, most sludge samples from the STPs do not display Gd enrichments, including primary sludges and end-product sludges. The excess Gd appears to remain in the liquid phase throughout the SIP operations, but detailed quantification of the input Gd load and residence times of various SIP operations is needed to utilize Gd as a conservative tracer.

AB Quantitative criteria for selection of tracers for assessment of mixing of wastewater and pristine water are proposed and evaluated for leakage from a wastewater effluent recharge system to nearby pristine water wells and the dilution of the effluents in a reclamation well by pristine water from the surrounding aquifer. Two molecular tracers were compared: carbamazepine, an organic drug whose refractory behavior was evaluated on-site, and chloride, a widely used conservative tracer. The mixing ratios and the corresponding uncertainty levels in their calculation were evaluated using actual field data. Uncertainty level analysis illuminates the effects of the analytical errors in the determination of trace micropollutants on one hand and the high level of chloride in the background on the other. Uncertainty level calculations revealed that chloride is a somewhat better tracer for the estimation of the dilution of wastewater by flow from a pristine aquifer, whereas carbamazepine is a much better tracer for the calculation of wastewater contamination of nearby drinking water wells. Surprisingly, we show that even when carbamazepine degrades to a large and unknown extent, it can still be used to estimate accurately the probability that a site is contaminated by a wastewater stream.

AB In this study the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was subjected to ozone treatment. Solutions of 60 mg/L and 100 mu g/L SMX in pure water and secondary municipal effluent were treated. The removal profile of SMX and its oxidation products was monitored as a function of transferred ozone dose in both matrices. No difference was observed in the ozone dose required for the concentration of SMX to fall below the limit of detection in pure water and wastewater. New peaks with the same retention times were obtained on the HPLC chromatograms for all conditions studied. Solutions with an initial concentration of 60 mg/L required 83 mg/L of ozone to fall below the limit of detection and eight oxidation products were detected. Solutions with an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L required 14 mg/L of ozone and only four oxidation products were detected. The four peaks obtained during experiments at low concentration were observed at the same retention times as four of the peaks obtained in higher concentration samples. In ozonated wastewater these products were identified as: 4-aminobenzene sulfonamide, N-(3-phenylpropyl)-acetamide, 2-methyl-benzoxazole and phenol. In addition, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were identified in the higher concentration samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four UF membranes (denoted GH, GK, PT and PW with MWCO of 1000, 2000, 5000 and 20,000 Da, respectively) and four NF membranes (denoted DL, CK, DK and HL, with an approximate MWCO of 150-300 Da in all cases) were used for the filtration of an effluent generated in a municipal wastewater plant after a secondary treatment. The influence of the most important operating variables (nature and MWCO of the membranes, transmembrane pressure, tangential velocity, and temperature) on the permeate flux was widely discussed, and the resistances to the permeate flux were determined following the resistances in series model. Rejection coefficients for parameters that measure the global pollutant content of the effluent (chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, absorbance at 254 nm, turbidity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were also evaluated, and the results revealed that both UF and NF are feasible options for the treatment of this effluent, yielding a permeate stream that can be reused in several applications. Finally, 28 pharmaceutical compounds were initially detected in this effluent, and their respective rejection coefficients were determined, with eliminations higher than 75% in the case of NF with the HL membrane. Therefore, it is concluded that NF is an excellent option for the removal of toxic pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewaters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among the emerging environmental contaminants, pharmaceutically active compounds have become a growing public concern because of their potential to cause undesirable ecological and human health effects. Donana Park (South of Spain) includes a mosaic of unique ecosystems known around the world which is particularly affected by the quality of the incoming flowing water. This study reports the presence of a number of priority pharmaceuticals in wastewater and surface water samples from Donana watersheds. In general, ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, propranolol, caffeine and gemfibrozil were the compounds most frequently found in all locations, in the range of ng/L to mu g/L. Carbamazepine, with high potential risk to the environment, was also detected, although only in a few water samples. The main results are: (i) pharmaceuticals, as water pollutants, are continually discharged into Donana water bodies and, owing to their biological activity, could lead to adverse effects in this outstanding aquatic ecosystem; (ii) wastewater treatments implemented in the area are insufficient to remove pharmaceuticals; and (iii) therefore, there is a requirement for better wastewater treatments in this natural area to reduce or avoid the presence of organic pollutants in general and pharmaceutical active compounds in particular. To the best of our knowledge, these data constitute the first measurements of pharmaceutical compounds in water not only from the protected area of Donana Park but also from other Natural or National Parks in the world.

AB Carbonyl reductase/20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CR/20 beta-HSD) serves both as a key enzyme in the gonadal synthesis of maturing-inducing hormone in salmonids, and as an enzyme protecting against certain reactive oxygen species. We have previously shown that mRNA of the hepatic CR/20 beta-HSD B isoform is increased in rainbow trout caged downstream from a Swedish sewage treatment plant. Here, we report an increase of both the A as well as B form in fish kept downstream from a second sewage treatment plant. The two mRNAs were also induced in fish hepatoma cells in vitro after exposure to effluent extract. This indicates that the effects observed in vivo could be a direct effect on the liver, i.e. the mRNA induction does not require a signal from any other organ. When fish were exposed in vivo to several effluents treated with more advanced methods (ozone, moving bed biofilm reactor or membrane bioreactor) the expression of hepatic mRNA CR/20 beta-HSD A and B was significantly reduced. Their abundance did not parallel the reduction of estrogen-responsive transcripts, in agreement with our previous observations that ethinylestradiol is not a potent inducer. Treatment with norethisterone, methyltestosterone or hydrocortisone in vivo did not induce the hepatic CR/20 beta-HSD A and B mRNA expression. In contrast, both isoforms were markedly induced by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone as well as by the pro-oxidant herbicide paraquat. We hypothesize that the induction of CR/20 beta-HSD A and B by sewage effluents could be due to anthropogenic contaminants stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and/or causing oxidative stress.

AB A mass balance model was developed to estimate prescription pharmaceutical loadings to municipal wastewater treatment plants via computation of influent concentrations (C (IN)). Model estimates of C (IN) were compared with published data and found to be accurate within an order of magnitude for some 90% of the drugs evaluated. The model was then used to rank prescription drugs on a per-capita mass loading basis for comparison with current research efforts and coupled with two EPISuite ((TM)) programs to generate estimates for environmental exposure. Results showed marked discrepancies between prescription numbers, loadings, exposures, and research conducted, as highlighted by the drug metformin, with the largest projected loading to treatment plants (> 28 g per 1,000 people/day), yet only ranking 12th in terms of prescription numbers and no environmental research articles.

AB Swine wastewater is not easy to dispose of in usual biological wastewater treatment plants One reason is that some antibiotics are not easily degradable in the normal treatment system and suppress or inhibit microorganisms in the treatment system Specifically tetracycline, sulfathiazole. and ampicillin have been widely used as antibiotics in pig feed For treating disposal and spillage of these antibiotics biologically, a special enzyme based method is needed Detoxifying enzymes caused the antibiotics to be bio-converted in this experiment and degraded them in this biological experiment The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) catalyzed the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to a number of hydrophobic electrophilic substrates. In this study. we hypothesized that the microorganisms with GSTs degraded the representative manure antibiotics The initial concentrations of tetracycline. sulfathiazole, and ampicillin were 100 mg/L. 100 mg/L, and 50 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations of antibiotics in pig feed are typical levels Evaluation of the biodegradation feasibility of antibiotics was carried out by three bacteria possessing glutathione S-transferases under the strong concentration of antibiotics (standards for livestock pharmaceuticals in pie feed)

AB The antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has received recent attention due to the potential use as a first-line defense against H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses. Research has shown that oseltamivir is not removed during conventional wastewater treatments, thus having the potential to enter surface water bodies.
   A series of laboratory experiments investigated the fate and the removal of oseltamivir in two surface water ecosystems of Japan and in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Northern Italy. Persistence of oseltamivir in surface water ranged from non-detectable degradation to a half-life of 53 d. After 40 d, <3% of radiolabeled oseltamivir evolved as (CO2)-C-14. The presence of sediments (5%) led to a significant increase of oseltamivir degradation and mineralization rates. A more intense mineralization was observed in samples of the wastewater treatment plant when applying a long incubation period (40 d). More precisely, 76% and 37% of the initial radioactivity applied as C-14-oseltamivir was recovered as (CO2)-C-14 from samples of the biological tank and effluent water, respectively. Two bacterial strains growing on oseltamivir as sole carbon source were isolated and used for its removal from synthetic medium and environmental samples, including surface water and wastewater. Inoculation of water and wastewater samples with the two oseltamivir-degrading strains showed that mineralization of oseltamivir was significantly higher in both inoculated water and wastewater, than in uninoculated controls. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis showed that Tamiflu would not affect the microbial population of surface water and wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The design criteria for wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the sludge retention time, respectively, have a significant impact on micropollutant removal. The upgrade of an Austrian municipal WWTP to nitrogen removal (best available technology, BAT) resulted in increased elimination of most of the analyzed micropollutants. Substances, such as bisphenol-A, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and the antibiotics erythromycin and roxithromycin were only removed after the upgrade of the WWTP. Nevertheless, the BAT was not sufficient to completely eliminate these compounds. Thus, a pilot scale ozonation plant was installed for additional treatment of the effluent. The application of 0.6 g O-3 g DOC-1 increased the removal of most of the micropollutants, especially for compounds that were not degraded in the previous biological process, as for example carbamazepine and diclofenac. These results indicated that the ozonation of WWTP effluent is a promising technology to further decrease emissions of micropollutants from the treatment process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that the concentration of ofloxacin (OFX) in hospital was the highest among all water environments ranged from 1.660 mu g/L to 4.240 mu g/L and norfloxacin (NOR, 0.136-1.620 mu g/L), ciproflaxacin (CIP, ranged from 0.011 mu g/L to 0.136 mu g/L), trimethoprim (IMP, 0.061-0.174 mu g/L) were commonly detected. Removal range of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant was 18-100% and the removal ratio of tylosin, oxytetracycline and tetracycline were 100%. Relatively higher removal efficiencies were observed for tylosin (TYL), oxytetracycline (OXY) and tetracycline (TET)(100%), while lower removal efficiencies were observed for Trimethoprim (IMP, 1%), Epi-iso-chlorotetracycline (EICIC, 18%) and Erythromycin-H2O (ERY-H2O, 24%). Antibiotics were removed more efficiently in primary treatment compared with those in secondary treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We measured 25 pharmaceuticals in ten municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), one hospital WWTP and five rivers in Korea. In the municipal WWTP influents, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine showed relatively high concentrations. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater seems to be influenced by production and consumption of pharmaceuticals. The hospital WWTP influent showed higher total concentrations of pharmaceuticals than the municipal WWTPs, and caffeine, ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen were dominant. In the rivers, caffeine was dominant, and the distribution of pharmaceuticals was related to the inflow of the wastewater. In the municipal WWTPs, the concentrations of acetaminophen, caffeine, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and gemfibrozil decreased by over 99%. The decrease of these pharmaceuticals occurred mainly during the biological processes. In the physico-chemical processes, the decrease of pharmaceuticals was insignificant except for some cases. In the hospital WWTP, ciprofloxacin, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen and carbamazepine showed the decrease rates of over 80%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), widely used in industry as solvents and chemical intermediates in the production of synthetic resins, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, are highly toxic to the environment and public health. Various studies reported that Fenton's oxidation could degrade a variety of chlorinated VOCs in aqueous solutions. In acidic conditions, ferrous ion catalyzes the decomposition of H(2)O(2) to form a powerful (aEuro cent)OH radical. In this study, wastewater from wash of ion-exchange resin containing typical CVOC, 1,2-dichloroethane, was treated using Fenton's oxidation. To reduce environmental load and processing costs of wastewater, Fenton process as a simple and efficient treatment method was applied to degrade 1,2-dichloroethane of wash water.
   The water samples were collected from three different washing stages of ion-exchange resin. The degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane and total organic carbon (TOC) of wash water of ion-exchange resin by Fenton process was studied with response surface method (RSM). Design of the experiments was conducted by central composite face, and factors included in three models were Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses and treatment time. Relevant quadratic and interaction terms of factors were investigated.
   According to ANOVA, the model predicts well 1,2-dichloroethane reduction of all water samples and TOC reduction of samples 2 and 3. The Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses used in the present study were most suitable when 1,2-dichloroethane concentration of the wash water is about 120 mg L(-1). In that case, Fenton's oxidation reduced 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC up to 100% and 87%, respectively, according to the RSM model. With 90-min reaction time and H(2)O(2) dose of 1,200 mg L(-1), the required Fe(2+) doses for 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC were 300 and 900 mg L(-1), respectively. The optimal H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) stoichiometric molar ratio was between 4-6. Then, concentration of Fe(2+) was low enough and the amount of residual sludge can thus be reduced. It seems that most of TOC and part of 1,2-dichloroethane were removed by coagulation.
   Up to a certain extent, increase of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) doses improved the removal of 1,2-dichloroethane and TOC. High Fe(2+) doses increased the formation of ferric-based sludge, and excessive H(2)O(2) doses in sample 2 decreased the degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane. Excess amount of hydrogen peroxide may scavenge hydroxyl radicals, thus leading to loss of oxidative power. Also, the residual hydrogen peroxide of different samples increased with increasing H(2)O(2) dose and H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) molar ratio and decreasing treatment time probably also due to scavenging reactions. Due to the saturated nature of 1,2-dichloroethane, the oxidation mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction before addition of hydroxyl radical, thus leading to lower rate constants than for direct hydroxyl radical attack, which for one increases the treatment time.
   Complete removal of 1,2-dichloroethane was attained with initial concentration < 120 mg L(-1). Also, TOC degraded effectively. Wash water with higher concentration of 1,2-dichloroethane requires longer treatment times and higher concentrations of Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) for sufficient 1,2-dichloroethane removal.
   Due to the results achieved in this study, Fenton's oxidation could be recommended to be used for organic destruction of wash water of ion-exchange resin. Residual sludge, the main disadvantage in Fenton process, can be reduced by optimizing the ferrous dose or by using heterogeneous treatment where most of the reusable iron remains in the solid phase.

AB Background, aim, and scope The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry and as a matter of public concern. Existing data tend to focus on the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous phase, with limited studies on their concentrations in particulate phase such as sediments. Furthermore, current water quality monitoring does not differentiate between soluble and colloidal phases in water samples, hindering our understanding of the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the concentrations and phase association (soluble, colloidal, suspended particulate matter or SPM) of selected pharmaceuticals (propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac, and meclofenamic acid) in river water, effluents from sewage treatment works (STW), and groundwater in the UK.
   Materials and methods The occurrence and phase association of selected pharmaceuticals propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac, and meclofenamic acid in contrasting aquatic environments (river, sewage effluent, and groundwater) were studied. Colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF). Water samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE), while SPM was extracted by microwave. All sample extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring.
   Results and discussion Five compounds propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, indomethacine, and diclofenac were detected in all samples, with carbamazepine showing the highest concentrations in all phases. The highest concentrations of these compounds were detected in STW effluents, confirming STW as a key source of these compounds in the aquatic environments. The calculation of partition coefficients of pharmaceuticals between SPM and filtrate (observed partition coefficients, K-p(obs), K-oc(obs)), between SPM and soluble phase (intrinsic partition coefficients, K-p(int), K-oc(int)), and between colloids and soluble phase (K-coc) showed that intrinsic partition coefficients (K-p(int), K-oc(int)) are between 25% and 96%, and between 18% and 82% higher than relevant observed partition coefficients values, and are much less variable. Secondly, K-coc values are 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than K-oc(int) values, indicating that aquatic colloids are substantially more powerful sorbents for accumulating pharmaceuticals than sediments. Furthermore, mass balance calculations of pharmaceutical concentrations demonstrate that between 23% and 70% of propranolol, 17-62% of sulfamethoxazole, 7-58% of carbamazepine, 19-84% of indomethacine, and 9-74% of diclofenac are present in the colloidal phase.
   Conclusions The results provide direct evidence that sorption to colloids provides an important sink for the pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Such strong pharmaceutical/colloid interactions may provide a long-term storage of pharmaceuticals, hence, increasing their persistence while reducing their bioavailability in the environment.
   Recommendations and perspectives Pharmaceutical compounds have been detected not only in the aqueous phase but also in suspended particles; it is important, therefore, to have a holistic approach in future environmental fate investigation of pharmaceuticals. For example, more research is needed to assess the storage and long-term record of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic sediments by which benthic organisms will be most affected. Aquatic colloids have been shown to account for the accumulation of major fractions of total pharmaceutical concentrations in the aquatic environment, demonstrating unequivocally the importance of aquatic colloids as a sink for such residues in the aquatic systems. As aquatic colloids are abundant, ubiquitous, and highly powerful sorbents, they are expected to influence the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of such chemicals by aquatic organisms. It is therefore critical for colloids to be incorporated into water quality models for prediction and risk assessment purposes.

AB In this study, seasonal variations in the concentration profile of four analgesics and one lipid regulator were monitored on their way from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, along a river, and into a lake.
   From December 2007 to December 2008, water samples were collected monthly (n = 12) from an upstream point, the effluent, four downstream points of the WWTP, and at the point where the river merges with the lake, and the concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and ketoprofen were determined. The analytical methodology involved solid-phase extraction of the target compounds from water samples followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for compound separation and detection.
   The studied pharmaceuticals were found in the effluent at concentrations ranging from 31 to 1,852 ng l(-1) depending on the season. In the river and lake, the concentrations were much lower (6-400 ng l(-1)) mainly due to dilution but also to a season-dependent contribution from natural transformation processes. The mean mass flow of all analgesics was highest during winter while the highest mean mass flow of the lipid regulator bezafibrate was observed in spring.
   The WWTP is the main source of the target compounds in the aquatic environment. The observed winter accumulation signifies the importance of natural transformation processes, which can only be estimated based on mass flow data, on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants widely used in everyday urban activities which can be detected in surface, ground, and drinking waters. Their presence is derived from consumption of medicines, disposal of expired medications, release of treated and untreated urban effluents, and from the pharmaceutical industry. Their growing use has become an alarming environmental problem which potentially will become dangerous in the future. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about long-term effects in non-target organisms as well as for human health. Toxicity testing has indicated a relatively low acute toxicity to fish species, but no information is available on possible sublethal effects. This study provides data on the physiological pathways involved in the exposure of Atlantic salmon as representative test species to three pharmaceutical compounds found in ground, surface, and drinking waters based on the evaluation of the xenobiotic-induced impairment resulting in the activation and silencing of specific genes.
   Individuals of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr were exposed during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of three representative pharmaceutical compounds with high consumption rates: the analgesic acetaminophen (54.77 +/- 34.67 A mu g L-1), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (7.85 A +/- 0.13 A mu g L-1), and the beta-blocker atenolol (11.08 A +/- 7.98 A mu g L-1). Five immature males were selected for transcriptome analysis in brain tissues by means of a 17k salmon cDNA microarray. For this purpose, mRNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA which was labeled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized against a common pool to the arrays. Lists of significantly up- and down-regulated candidate genes were submitted to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) in order to analyze for induced pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of this method in cases of not completely annotated test organisms.
   Exposure during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of the selected pharmaceutical compounds acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol produced differences in the expression of 659, 700, and 480 candidate genes, respectively. KEGG annotation numbers (KO annotations) were obtained for between 26.57% and 33.33% of these differently expressed genes per treatment in comparison to non-exposure conditions. Pathways that showed to be induced did not always follow previously reported targets or metabolic routes for the employed treatments; however, several other pathways have been found (four or more features) to be significantly induced.
   Energy-related pathways have been altered under exposure in all the selected treatments, indicating a possible energy budget leakage due to additional processes resulting from the exposure to environmental contaminants. Observed induction of pathways may indicate additional processes involved in the mode of action of the selected pharmaceuticals which may not have been detected with conventional methods like quantitative PCR in which only suspected features are analyzed punctually for effects. The employment of novel high-throughput screening techniques in combination with global pathway analysis methods, even if the organism is not completely annotated, allows the examination of a much broader range of candidates for potential effects of exposure at the gene level.
   The continuously growing number of annotations of representative species relevant for environmental quality testing is facilitating pathway analysis processes for not completely annotated organisms. KEGG has shown to be a useful tool for the analysis of induced pathways from data generated by microarray techniques with the selected pharmaceutical contaminants acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol, but further studies have to be carried out in order to determine if a similar expression pattern in terms of fold change quantity and pathways is observed after long-term exposure. Together with the information obtained in this study, it will then be possible to evaluate the potential risk that the continuous release of these compounds may have on the environment and ecosystem functioning.

AB The space-resolved solid-phase microextraction (SR-SPME) technique was employed to study the tissue-specific bioconcentration of pharmaceuticals in live fish. The segmented design of the SPME fibers allowed for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceutical residues in fish dorsal-epaxial muscle and adipose tissue with a single SPME fiber. The miniaturized fiber endowed the technique with high spatial resolution allowing for quantification of analytes within adjacent, relatively small tissues of immature rainbow trout The pre-equilibrium sampling and kinetic calibration approach yielded efficient and accurate quantitation of pharmaceuticals in fish tissue, The ability of the SPME method to repeatedly sample the same fish circumvents problems arising from interanimal variation, thus improving the precision of generated bioconcentration kinetic profiles. In vivo monitoring with SR-SPME was validated with in vitro liquid extraction of tissue samples using methanol. Of the nine compounds evaluated, five (atrazine, gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and fluoxetine) bioconcentrated in adipose and muscle tissue over the eight exposure days. Although the accumulation of analytes in both tissues was positively correlated, each compound partitioned with differing affinities as modified by their hydrophobicity and unique molecular structure. Water samples analyzed using the SPME technique yielded results similar to those determined by solid-phase extraction (SPE); however, SPME was more rapid and operationally much simpler. This study illustrates the application conditions for in situ SR-SPME while demonstrating the potential of these miniaturized SPME fibers for simultaneous in vivo repeated sampling of multiple tissues.

AB Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. In this work, biologically produced manganese oxides (BioMnOx) were investigated to remove diclofenac. At neutral pH, the diclofenac oxidation with BioMnOx was 10-fold faster than with chemically produced MnO2. The main advantage of BioMnOx over chemical MnO2 is the ability of the bacteria to reoxidize the formed Mn2+, which inhibits the oxidation of diclofenac. Diclofenac-2,5-iminoquinone was identified as a major transformation product accounting for 5-10% of the transformed diclofenac. Except for 5-hydroxydiclofenac, which was identified as an intermediate, no other oxidation products were detected. Diclofenac oxidation was proportional to the amount of BioMnOx dosed, and the pseudo first order rate constant k was 6-fold higher when pH was decreased from 6.8 to 6.2. The Mn2+ levels remained below the drinking water limit (0.05 mg L-1), thus indicating the efficient in situ microbiological regeneration of the oxidant. These results combined with previous studies suggest the potential of BioMnOx for STP effluent polishing.

AB Polycyclic musk compounds (PMC) are used as fragrances in cosmetics and detergents and enter rivers via domestic wastewater and sewage treatment plants. Soils can be contaminated by PMC through application of sewage sludge. Accumulation of PMC occurs in sediments and biota due to their persistence and lipophilicity. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of special relevance for their transport and behavior in the environment as it acts as solubilizer and carrier in aquatic and terrestrial systems. With the distribution coefficient K-DOC, one can predict their affinity to DOM. Different approaches exist to determine K-DOC, resulting in a range of coefficients for a number of organic pollutants. The objective of this study was to determine K-DOC values for PMC using solid-phase microextraction (SPME).
   A method to determine K-DOC was customized and applied to five PMC. Sorption was analyzed using different concentrations of humic acid (HA) solutions and headspace SPME coupled with GC/MS/MS. HA represented DOM. Regarding sorption in soils, sediments, and sewage sludge, a large concentration range of HA solutions up to 660 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was chosen. Simultaneous determination of all components in a mixture was compared to experiments with single compounds. The method was matched using pyrene.
   Determined log K-DOC values were between 3.32 and 3.67. Compared to experiments with single compounds, determination of the components in a mixture showed no significant difference. Verification experiments with pyrene revealed a close match between K-DOC determined in the current study and K-DOC literature data. K-DOC values of most economical and environmental important PMC 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyrane (HHCB) and 1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-ethanone (AHTN) are comparable to but slightly lower than K-OC values recently published. The greater K-DOC for AHTN compared to the one of HHCB corresponds to greater amounts found in sediments. The large range in HA concentrations, allows for an assessment of PMC partitioning behavior in sewage treatment plants and soils contaminated with PMC.
   This method is applicable for semi-volatile substances. Since compounds have varying characteristics, this method has to be verified regarding specific parameters particularly kinetics. Suitability of this method should be tested for relevant PMC metabolites and to determine K-DOC with natural organic matter from soils, rivers, sediments, and sewage sludge. This adapted method can be used to establish K-DOC values for a variety of substances in a short amount of time and is applicable to environmental fate modeling and registration of chemicals.

AB 1-(2-chlorophenyl) ethanol (CPE) is of health and environmental concern due to its toxicity and its use as an intermediate in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The current work deals with the catalytic reductive dechlorination and detoxification of CPE by Pd/Fe bimetal. CPE was effectively dechlorinated to 1-phenyl ethanol (PE) accompanied by the equivalent release of chloride. The extent of CPE dechlorination increased with temperature, Fe dosage and Pd loading. A decrease in solution pH increased CPE dechlorination, resulting presumably from an increase in hydrogen production. Under the specific conditions of 20 g/L Pd/Fe, 0.10% Pd (w/w) and initial pH 5-6, the CPE dechlorination was completed within 145 min. The dechlorination followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 56.7 kJ/mol. The results of toxicity testing showed that CPE was very toxic to Chlorella, whereas PE showed little toxicity. The toxicity of the reaction solution declined gradually and the promoting effects on Chlorella intensified consequently with the dechlorination process. Thus, the reductive dechlorination of CPE to PE by Pd/Fe was a detoxification process. It may be used to effectively reduce the toxicological effects of CPE-contaminated wastewater, thereby enhancing the performance of subsequent biological processes in wastewater treatment.

AB Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) are surfactants often used in applications that result in their disposal and treatment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, three municipal activated sludge WWTPs, receiving primarily residential wastewater, were monitored, with their receiving waters, to determine the occurrence of NPEs and their biodegradation metabolites, including nonylphenol (NP), low-mole and higher-mole nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2-8, and NPE >= 9), and nonylphenol ether carboxylates (NPECs). The facilities were moderately sized and operating normally when influent and effluent samples were taken. Treatment efficiencies, taking into account concentrations of the parent ethoxylate and metabolites, ranged from 97.2 to 99.8%. Samples of receiving stream water, sediment, and pore water were collected upstream, downstream at the end of the mixing zones, and farther downstream from the WWTP discharges, to determine the occurrence of NPE and their metabolites and to assess the potential effect on the receiving stream ecosystems. Concentrations of nonylphenol or total nonylphenol equivalents measured upstream (<0.02 to 1.29 mu g/L), at the end of the mixing zone (0.2 to 3.15 mu g/L), and farther downstream (<0.02 to 1.84 mu g/L) were compared with the recently established national ambient water quality chronic criteria of 6.6 mu g/L. On the basis of this analysis, the likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic species within the three receiving streams is low. Water Environ. Res., 82, 447 ( 2010).

AB This work investigates the application of the electro-oxidation technology provided with boron doped diamond (BDD), an electrode material which has shown outstanding properties in oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds, for the treatment of reverse osmosis (RO) concentrates generated in tertiary wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and several anions were measured during the electro-oxidation process, and the influence of the applied current density (20-200 A/m(2)) was analysed on process kinetics. Analytical assessment showed that several emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, stimulants, etc.) were presented both in the effluent of the secondary WWTP as well as in the RO concentrate. For this reason, a group of 10 emerging pollutants, those found with higher concentrations, was selected in order to test whether electro-oxidation can be also applied for their mitigation. In the removal of emerging pollutants the electrical current density in the range 20-100 A/m(2) did not show influence likely due to the mass transfer resistance developed in the process when the oxidized solutes are present in such low concentrations. Their removal rates were fitted to first order expressions, and the apparent kinetic constants for the anodic oxidation of each compound were calculated. Finally, the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) has been checked; concluding that after selecting the appropriate operational conditions the attained concentration is lower than the standards for drinking water established in European and EPA regulations.

AB This study investigates the occurrence of all priority substances (n = 41) listed in the Water Framework Directive and additional substances (n = 47) in raw sewage, as well as the removal performance of lamella clarification and biofiltration techniques. Once the efficiency of both types of techniques has been assessed for typical wastewater parameters, the differences in each technique's ability to remove pollutants becomes obvious; nevertheless, pollutant removal in quantitative terms still depends on the physicochemical properties of the compounds used and operating conditions within the selected facility. For lamella clarification, the removal of organic chemicals was found to be primarily correlated with their sorption potential and, hence, strongly dependent upon log K-ow of the compound under study. Compounds with a strong hydrophobic character (log K-ow > 4.5) are removed to a significant extent (approx. 85%), while hydrophilic compounds (log K-ow < 3.5) are poorly removed (<20%). For biofiltration, the removal of chemicals appears to be compound-dependent, although this outcome involves several mechanisms, namely: i) physical filtration of total suspended solids, ii) volatilisation, iii) sorption, and iv) biotransformation of substances. Even if the complex processes within a biofilter system do not yield an accurate prediction of pollutant removal, two groups of chemicals can still be clearly identified: i) hydrophobic or volatile compounds, for which moderate to high removal rates are observed (from 50% to over 80%); and ii) hydrophilic, non-volatile and refractory compounds for which a low removal rate would be expected (<20%).

AB The contribution of volatilization, sorption and transformation to the removal of 16 Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in two lab-scale conventional activated sludge reactors, working under nitrifying (aerobic) and denitrifying (anoxic) conditions for more than 1.5 years, have been assessed. Pseudo-first order biological degradation rate constants (k(biol)) were calculated for the selected compounds in both reactors. Faster degradation kinetics were measured in the nitrifying reactor compared to the denitrifying system for the majority of PPCPs. Compounds could be classified according to their k(biol) into very highly (k(biol) > 5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)), highly (1 < k(biol) < 5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)), moderately (0.5 < k(biol) < 1 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)) and hardly (k(biol) < 0.5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)) biodegradable.
   Results indicated that fluoxetine (FLX), natural estrogens (E1 + E2) and musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN and ADBI) were transformed to a large extent under aerobic (>75%) and anoxic (>65%) conditions, whereas naproxen (NPX), ethinylestradiol (EE2), roxithromycin (ROX) and erythromycin (ERY) were only significantly transformed in the aerobic reactor (>80%). The anti-depressant citalopram (CTL) was moderately biotransformed under both, aerobic and anoxic conditions (>60% and >40%, respectively). Some compounds, as carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), manifested high resistance to biological transformation.
   Solids Retention Time (SRTaerobic >50 d and <50 d; SRTanoxic >20 d and <20 d) had a slightly positive effect on the removal of FLX, NPX, CTL, EE2 and natural estrogens (increase in removal efficiencies <10%). Removal of diclofenac (DCF) in the aerobic reactor was positively affected by the development of nitrifying biomass and increased from 0% up to 74%. Similarly, efficient anoxic transformation of ibuprofen (75%) was observed after an adaptation period of 340 d. Temperature (16-26 degrees C) only had a slight effect on the removal of CTL which increased in 4%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural application of sewage sludge has been emotionally discussed in the last decades, because the latter contains organic micropollutants with unknown fate and risk potential. In this work, the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. More specifically, the potential impacts of emerging micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, present in the sludge have been quantified. Four scenarios were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (mesophilic or thermophilic) and the sludge retention time (20 or 10 d), and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge.
   From an environmental point of view, the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative, except for global warming due to the dominance (65-85%) of the indirect emissions associated to the electricity use. Nutrient-related direct emissions dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenarios (>71.4%), although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertilisers production is also quantified (up to 6.7%). In terms of human and terrestrial toxicity, the direct emissions of heavy metals to soil dominate these two impact categories (>70%), and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal. Moreover, only six (Galaxolide, Tonalide, Diazepam, Ibuprofen, Sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol) out of the 13 substances considered are really significant since they account for more than 95% of the overall micropollutants impact.

AB First, the effect of ferrioxalate or iron nitrate on the photo-Fenton degradation efficiency of the pharmaceuticals lincomycin (LCM) and diazepam (DZP) was evaluated. The degradation of both pharmaceuticals was improved in the presence of ferrioxalate in relation to Fe(NO3), either under black-light or solar irradiation. The degradation of the pharmaceuticals was then evaluated when present in an effluent from sewage treatment plant (STP) under black-light irradiation. Pharmaceuticals oxidation was not influenced by the matrix, since very similar results were obtained when compared to the experiments carried out in distilled water. However, DOC removal was slightly affected by the matrix, due probably to the generation of recalcitrant intermediates during effluent photodegradation and to the high content of inorganic carbon of STP effluent. Even so, high DOC removal percentages were achieved, 65% for lincomycin and 80% for diazepam after 60 min irradiation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photoactive layer of TiO2 was deposited on glass spheres using the sol-gel dip-coating technique. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Degradation of 15 emerging contaminants (ECs), each with an initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-UV) and mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar of Almeria. Five cycles of photocatalysis were studied for photocatalyst durability and activity. It was demonstrated that after five cycles, although photoactivity of the catalyst slowly decreases, it continues degrading contaminants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While substantial knowledge on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is available, their behavior and fate in surface waters is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze the short-term dynamics of selected pharmaceuticals along a 13.6 km long river stretch downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and to quantify their attenuation by a mass balance approach. Four acidic pharmaceuticals (bezafibrate, clofibric acid, diclofenac, naproxen) with different attenuation properties were measured over a period of three weeks at high temporal resolution, and in situ photolysis experiments were carried out The average concentrations of pharmaceuticals were between 9 4 and 339 +/- 133 ng L-1, corresponding to loads between 1.9 +/- 1.2 and 63 +/- 37 g d(-1) (n = 134). The temporal dynamics of pharmaceuticals was closely related to discharge of the WWTP and precipitation, and highest concentrations were observed at the beginning of a discharge event During a dry period, naproxen was eliminated along the river stretch with a dissipation time (DT50) of 3.6 +/- 2.1 days while the other compounds did not exhibit significant attenuation. As photolysis and other abiotic processes were of limited quantitative relevance, the attenuation of naproxen can most likely be attributed to biotransformation.

AB In this study the interactions between toxicity removals and Kemicetine, COD removals, intermediate products of Kemicetine and COD components (CODs originating from slowly degradable organics, readily degradable organics, inert microbial products and from the inert compounds) were investigated in a sequential anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR)/aerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system with a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The total COD and Kemicetine removal efficiencies were 98% and 100%, respectively, in the sequential ABR/CSTR systems. 2-Amino-1 (p-nitrophenil)-1,3 propanediol, 1-p-amino phenyl, p-amino phenol and phenol were detected in the ABR as the main readily degradable inter-metabolites. In the anaerobic ABR reactor, the Kemicetin was converted to corresponding inter-metabolites and a substantial part of the COD was removed. In the aerobic CSTR reactor the intermetabolites produced in the anaerobic reactor were completely removed and the COD remaining from the anerobic reactor was biodegraded. It was found that the COD originating from the readily degradable organics did not limit the anaerobic degradation process, while the CODs originating from the slowly degradable organics and from the inert microbial products significantly decreased the anaerobic ABR reactor performance. The acute toxicity test results indicated that the toxicity decreased from the influent to the effluent of the aerobic CSTR reactor. The ANOVA test statistics showed that there was a strong linear correlation between acute toxicity, CODs originating from the slowly degradable organics and inert microbial products. A weak correlation between acute toxicity and CODs originating from the inert compounds was detected. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of clofibric acid (CA) in UV254/H2O2 process under three temperature ranges, i.e. T1 (9.0-11.5 degrees C), T2 (19.0-21.0 degrees C) and T3 (29.0-30.0 degrees C) was investigated. The effects of solution constituents including NO3- and HCO3- anions, and humic acid (HA) on CA degradation were evaluated in Milli-Q waters. CA degradation behaviors were simulated with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the apparent rate constant (k(ap)) and half-life time (t(1/2)) were calculated. The results showed that higher temperature would favor CA degradation, and CA degradation was taken place mostly by indirect oxidation through the formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals in UV254/H2O2 process. In addition, the effects of both NO3- and HCO3- anions at two selected concentrations (1.0 x 10(-3) and 0.1 mol L-1) and HA (20 mg L-1) on CA degradation were investigated. The results showed that HA had negative effect on CA degradation, and this effect was much more apparent under low temperature condition. On the other hand, the inhibitive effect on CA degradation at both lower and higher concentrations of bicarbonate was observed, and this inhibitive effect was much more apparent at higher bicarbonate concentration and lower temperature condition. While, at higher nitrate concentration the inhibitive effect on CA degradation under three temperature ranges was observed, and with the temperature increase this negative effect was apparently weakened. However, at lower nitrate concentration a slightly positive effect on CA degradation was found under T2 and T3 conditions. Moreover, when using a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent spiked with CA over 99% of CA removal could be achieved under 30 degrees C within only 15 min compared with 40 and 80 min under 20 and 10 degrees C respectively, suggesting a significant promotion in CA degradation under higher temperature condition. Therefore, it can be concluded that temperature plays an important role in CA degradation in UV/H2O2 process. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac were frequently detected in water bodies. In this study, crude lignin peroxidase, produced from a white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was studied on its in vitro degradation of both drugs. The influencing parameters were studied, including pH, the hydrogen peroxide concentration, veratryl alcohol and the temperature. It was found that UP completely degraded diclofenac at pH 3.0-4.5 and 3-24 ppm H2O2 while the degradation efficiency of carbamazepine was mostly below 10%. The addition of veratryl alcohol and the increased temperature did not enhance the degradation of carbamazepine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cyclooxygenase (COX) plays an important role in eicosanoid metabolism. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) function as COX inhibitors and are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Here, we measured the in vitro COX-inhibiting activity of the surface water and domestic wastewater in the Tone Canal, Japan. The concentrations of several NSAIDs in the some samples were also determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for confirming the validity of the assay. The target compounds were extracted from the samples using a solid-phase extraction cartridge. A dose-response relationship between the inhibiting activity and sample volume were observed in the wastewater sample. The higher COX-inhibiting activities were observed in the wastewater sample, as compared with the samples of the surface water in the canal. These inhibiting activities reflected the trends of NSAIDs distribution in the canal. However, the inhibiting activities of the water samples could not be entirely explained by the NSAIDs that were selected for instrumental analysis in this study. Other compounds that were not measured by instrumental analysis in this study might contribute to the inhibiting activities. Therefore, the COX-inhibiting assay would be effective for evaluating inclusive ecotoxicity in the aquatic environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals and domestic-use chemicals (PDCs) are classes of emerging chemical contaminants thought to enter the aquatic environment primarily through wastewater treatment plant (WTP) discharges. The intent of this study was to quantify loadings of PDCs in an urban watershed. The watershed has two major branches but with wastewater discharge occurring in only one of the two major branches. Surface water from the Anacostia River (Washington, DC) was collected in base-flow and storm-flow regimes. Surface water was filtered to separate water and particles, and the PDCs were extracted from water with Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges and extracted from sediments using microwave-assisted extraction. The PDCs in the extracts were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the form of the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. The most frequently detected PDC with the highest concentration was bisphenol-A in both branches of the Anacostia River watershed and the least frequently detected PDC was diclofenac. The overall median concentrations for all measured PDCs in surface water ranged from nondetectable to 54.9 ng/l. Alternatively, in the collected WTPs samples, naproxen was observed, with the highest concentration and the median concentrations in WTP effluent ranging from nondetectable to 276 ng/l. Estimates of PDC loadings for February 2006 from WTP effluent showed that < 2% of the downstream load in the NE Branch was derived from WTP discharge. PDC sources other than WTP effluent appear to influence surface water concentrations in the urban Anacostia River watershed.

AB Effects of municipal biosolids on microbial N-2-fixation in agricultural soil were assessed in a 3-month laboratory study which included analysis of metals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. Reference agricultural soil was amended with organic manure or municipal biosolids from a southern Ontario wastewater plant, with a biosolids-only treatment included to evaluate metabolic activity in this inoculum. Microbial N-2-fixation in reference and manure-amended soils were similar (p = 0.144) over 3 months and lower than in biosolids-amended soil (p = 0.001); however, differences among soil treatments decreased over time, with no significant difference at test termination. In general, one-time application of biosolids caused short-term stimulation of N-2-fixing activity with a return to reference conditions within 3 months. Although no residual effects were detected, biosolids introduced elevated levels of metals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products (particularly analgesics), and viable bacteria; long-term effects caused by repeat applications (as commonly practiced) requires further investigation.

AB The fate of three endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), namely 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), triclosan (TCS) and bisphenol A (BPA), was studied in activated sludge process. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) on their sorption and biodegradation was also investigated. Three continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used, operating at SRT of 3, 10 and 20 days, respectively. Batch experiments with biomass originated from the aforementioned systems showed that 4-n-NP and TCS are significantly sorbed on the suspended solids, while BPA to a lesser extent. The sorption affinity of target compounds did not seem to be affected by SRT, with the exception of 4-n-NP for which higher values of sorption coefficients were calculated at SRT of 3 days. The operation of continuous-flow systems in the presence of 10-40 mu g L-1 of EDCs indicated that more than 90%, 94% and 97% of BPA, TCS and 4-n-NP, respectively, can be removed during the activated sludge process in systems operating at SRT of 3-20 days. Determination of EDCs in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of their mass flux revealed that biodegradation was the principal removal mechanism of EDCs. For SRT values used in this study, this parameter does not seem to affect significantly percentage biodegradation of BPA. On the other hand, biodegradation of 4-n-NP and TCS was enhanced at SRT of 20 days. Calculation of biotransformation rates showed that the highest values for all EDCs were calculated at SRT of 3 days. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biodegradability of different wastewater samples originated from the industrial production of three pharmaceuticals (naproxen, acyclovir, and nalidixic acid) was performed through the standard Zahn-Wellens test. Moreover, the wastewater composition before and during the test was evaluated in terms of parent compounds and main metabolites by LC/MS, and the biodegradability of the parent compounds was also assessed by performing extra Zahn-Wellens tests on synthetic solutions. The results, besides showing the relatively good biodegradability of acyclovir and naproxen, evidenced the masking role of the organic matrices, especially in the case of nalidixic acid. The latter compound showed to be recalcitrant and persistent, despite the apparently good performance of the Zahn-Wellens test. Deeper evaluation evidenced that the biodegradation of high concentrations of organic solvents and other biodegradable compound tended to "hide" the lack of removal of the target compound.

AB Fouling and scaling are common phenomena that accompany membrane filtration and are caused by the presence of organic and inorganic matter in water, which may affect the removal of low-molecular mass organic micropollutants. Comparative filtration of deionized water containing selected phytoestrogens (biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol) was carried out using one new membrane and one contaminated with organic or inorganic matter. Two commercial Osmonics DS membranes were selected for the research, reverse osmosis DS3SE and nanofiltration DS5DK. Filtration was carried out in the dead-end mode. Higher removal of phytoestrogens was caused by reverse osmosis and retention depended on the molar mass of the compound. The decrease in membrane efficiency associated with fouling or scaling brings about an increase in the retention coefficient of phytoestrogens during both reverse osmosis and nanofiltration. The highest increase in phytoestrogen retention was found for the nanofiltraton membrane which was more susceptible to fouling than the osmotic one. This confirms the effect of membrane porosity on the phenomenon studied. The increase in micropollutants removal observed after fouling or scaling was caused by the modification of the membrane surface, hindered diffusion of the compound, and intensified or limited adsorption of micropollutants on the membrane surface.

AB In the present study the mechanisms of solar photodegradation of H(2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine (RNTD) were studied in a well-defined system of a pilot plant scale Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) reactor. Two types of heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments were performed: catalysed by titanium-dioxide (TiO(2)) semiconductor and by Fenton reagent (Fe(2+)/H(2)O(2)). each one with distilled water and synthetic wastewater effluent matrix. Complete disappearance of the parent compounds and discreet mineralization were attained in all experiments. Furthermore, kinetic parameters, main intermediate products, release of heteroatoms and formation of carboxylic acids are discussed. The main intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of RNTD have been structurally elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS(2)) experiments performed at quadrupole-time of flight (QqToF) mass analyzer coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC). RNTD displayed high reactivity towards OH radicals, although a product of conduction band electrons reduction was also present in the experiment with TiO(2). In the absence of standards, quantification of intermediates was not possible and only qualitative profiles of their evolution could be determined. The proposed TiO(2) and photo-Fenton degradation routes of RNTD are reported for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methods were modified and tested to monitor the occurrence of 20 pharmaceuticals and consumer product chemicals in raw wastewater and septic tank effluent (STE) from six single-family homes (two each located in Florida, Colorado, and Minnesota) each utilizing an onsite wastewater treatment system. Ten compounds were detected, including the stimulant caffeine, the metal-chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, the surfactant metabolite 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxylate, and the antimicrobial triclosan, which were present in all wastewater samples. Pharmaceutical occurrence and levels were more variable than consumer product chemicals; nonprescription anti-inflammatory drugs were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals. Concentrations ranged from <1 mu g/L to > 1,000 mu g/L and varied by compound, site, and sampling event. No clear relationship between raw wastewater and STE composition existed. Raw wastewater composition, which previously has not been reported, reflected the per-capita water consumption and chemical-consuming activities at the source during the 24 h of sample collection. STE composition was likely affected by all consumptive activities during the tank hydraulic residence time (similar to 1 to 2 weeks) as well as differences in conditions between sites and at a single site over time (e. g., residence time, temperature, and load of organic compounds). Knowledge of source activities regarding the types, frequencies, and levels of pharmaceuticals and consumer product chemicals present in onsite wastewaters can aid in efforts to minimize potential risk to ecological and human health.

AB The combined polyferric sulfate (PT-S) coagulation with Fenton-like was investigated for treating nondegradable antibiotic fermentation wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 62.2% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 66.7% of color were removed, under the optimum conditions of coagulant dosage 200 mg/L, stirring time 12 min, and settling time 1 h. From the PFS characterization by means of Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope, it was believed that PFS coagulation was a mechanism including adsorption, neutralization of charged particles, and bridging between colloid particles. In addition, optimal conditions of Fenton-like process were determined to be H(2)O(2) dosage of 150 mg/L and oxalic acid of 45 mg/L. With effluents of Fenton-like being controlled atpH 7.0, the pollutants could be coagulated further. The hydroxyl radicals measurement by means of electron paramagnetic resonance showed that Fenton-like system could produce more HO(center dot) than did photo-Fenton system. The total removal efficiencies of COD and color could reach 93.5 and 96.7%, respectively. (C) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 29: 42-51, 2010

AB The ubiquity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) in surface waters urges insights into their fate in the aqueous euphotic zone. In this study, eight FQs (ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, levofloxacin, sarafloxacin, difloxacin, enrofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and balofloxacin) were exposed to simulated sunlight, and their photodegradation was observed to follow apparent first-order kinetics. Based on the determined photolytic quantum yields, solar photodegradation half-lives for the FQs in pure water and at 45 degrees N latitude were calculated to range from 1.25 min for enrofloxacin to 58.0 min for balofloxacin, suggesting that FQs would intrinsically photodegrade fast in sunlit surface waters. However, we found freshwater and seawater constituents inhibited their photodegradation. The inhibition was further explored by a central composite design using sarafloxacin and gatifloxacin as representatives. Humic acids (HA), Fe(III), NO3-, and HA-Cl- interaction inhibited the photodegradation, as they mainly acted as radiation filters and/or scavengers for reactive oxygen species. The photodegradation product identification and ROS scavenging experiments indicated that the FQs underwent both direct photolysis and self-sensitized photo-oxidation via center dot OH and O-1(2). Piperazinyl N-4-dealkylation was primary for N-4-alkylated FQs, whereas decarboxylation and defluorination were comparatively important for the other FQs. These results are of importance toward the goal of assessing the persistence of FQs in surface waters.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in surface waters worldwide, raising concerns about effects on aquatic organisms. Analyses of pharmaceuticals in blood plasma of fish could provide means to assess risk for pharmacological effects, as these concentrations could be compared with available human therapeutic plasma levels. In this study we investigated if fish exposed to sewage effluents have plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals that are approaching human therapeutic levels. We also evaluated how well the bioconcentration of pharmaceuticals into fish blood plasma can be predicted based on lipophilicity. Rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage effluents at three sites in Sweden for 14 days. Levels of 25 pharmaceuticals in blood plasma and effluents were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. The progestin pharmaceutical levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations (8.5-12 ng mL(-1)), exceeding the human therapeutic plasma level. In total 16 pharmaceuticals were detected in fish plasma at concentrations higher than 1/1000 of the human therapeutic plasma concentration. Twenty-one pharmaceuticals were detected in either plasma or effluent, and 14 were detected in both compartments, allowing plasma bioconcentration factors to be determined. For 11 of these, theoretically calculated and experimentally measured values were in reasonably good agreement. However a few drugs, including levonorgestrel, did not bioconcentrate according to the screening model used. This study shows that rainbow trout exposed to sewage effluents have blood plasma levels of pharmaceuticals similar to human therapeutic concentrations, suggesting a risk for pharmacological effects in the fish. There is a particular concern about effects of progestin pharmaceuticals. For levonorgestrel, the measured effluent level (1 ng/L) was higher than water levels shown to reduce the fertility of fish.

AB The passive polar organic chemical integrative sampler in the pharmaceutical configuration (i.e., pharmaceutical-POCIS) was calibrated for sampling at water temperatures of 5, 15 and 25 degrees C to determine the influence of temperature on chemical-specific sampling rates (R-S), thus providing more robust estimates of the time-weighted average concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine-disrupting substances (EDS) in surface water. The effect of water temperature and flow on the R-S of these analytes was evaluated in the laboratory with a static system. The loss of the test compounds from water by uptake into POCIS was linear over an 8-d period, and these experimental data yielded R-S values in the range of 0.07 to 2.46 L/d across the temperature range for the 30 compounds tested. Water temperature and flow influenced POCIS uptake rates, but these effects were relatively small, which is consistent with the theory for uptake into POCIS samplers. Therefore, under a narrow range of water temperatures and flows, it may not be necessary to adjust the R-S for POCIS. Except for acidic drugs and sulfonamide antibiotics, R-S values were positively correlated with octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-OW) of the test compounds. A linear relationship was also observed between R-S and chromatographic retention times on a C18 reversed-phase column. These observations may provide a rapid method for estimating the R-S of additional chemicals in the POCIS. The application of the R-S to POCIS deployed for one month in Lake Ontario, Canada, during the summers of 2006 and 2008 yielded estimates of PPCP and EDS concentrations that are consistent with conventional concentration measurements of these compounds in Lake Ontario surface water.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in soils resulting from application of municipal wastewater or biosolids may migrate through soils intact or be transformed and reach groundwater. In the present study, the leaching potential of four NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium) in three U.S. cropland soils was evaluated, and the effect of CaCl2 solution (as an index of salinity), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and polyacrylamide (PAM) amendment was investigated. The soils were spiked with selected NSAIDs, incubated for 24h followed by 7-d storage in glass flasks, and then packed into stainless steel columns and leached with deionized water (DIW), 10 mM CaCl2, DOM (DOC 34 mg/L), and PAM solution (1.0 mg/L) by gravity. Initial concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen; ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium in the three packed soils were 1.93 to 2.07. 1.74 to 2.27, 1.79 to 2.16, and 1.99 to 2.13 mg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations of the above NSAIDs in column effluents were 1.23, 0.92, 0.69, and 1.12 mg/L. respectively, when the soil was leached with 10 pore volumes of water, which occupied 17.4, 11.1, 9.6, and 15.2% of the total chemicals in each soil column. Dissolved organic matter or PAM solution did not facilitate the NSAIDs release from soils. The CaCl2 solution, however, reduced the amounts of NSAIDs leached from all three soils. Leaching of NSAIDs differed among the three tested soils. The results suggest that the leaching of NSAIDs through soil to water is significant, and the mobility of NSAIDs in soil is related to their chemicals' characteristics (such as pK(a) values) and soil properties (such as soil organic matter and clay content). Amending soil with DOM or PAM does not significantly affect the leaching behavior of NSAIDs in soil, whereas increasing the salinity of the irrigation water may decrease the extent of contamination of groundwater posed by NSAIDs.

AB Research examined the anaerobic degradation of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, metoprolol tartrate, and progesterone by methanogenic bacteria. Using direct sample analysis and respirometric testing, anaerobic degradation was examined with (a) each compound as the sole organic carbon source and (b) each compound at a lower concentration (250 mu g/L) and cellulose serving as the primary organic carbon source. The change in pharmaceutical concentration was determined following 7, 28, 56, and 112 days of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Only acetylsalicylic acid demonstrated significant degradation; the remaining compounds showed a mixture of degradation and abiotic removal mechanisms. Experimental results were compared with BIOWIN, an anaerobic degradation prediction model of the US Environmental Protection Agency. The BIOWIN model predicted anaerobic biodegradability of the compounds in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > ibuprofen > acetaminophen > 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol > progesterone. This corresponded well with the experimental findings which found degradability in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > acetaminophen > ibuprofen. Published by Elsevier BM.

AB Ozone (O-3)-based processes (O-3, O-3/H2O2, and O-3/UV) were investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals in real wastewater using a bench-scale experimental setup. An ozone dose of 6 mg/L (contact time = 10 minutes) was found to reduce the concentration of most pharmaceuticals detected in secondary effluent. Caffeine, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and cyclophosphamide were removed with efficiencies of 84, 89, and 46%, respectively, even with a contact time of 15 minutes (O-3 dose = 6 mg/L). In the case of the ozone process alone, the concentration of bromate ion in the effluent increased with longer contact time. On the other hand, it was found that the O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV processes can be used as alternative processes for effective removal of pharmaceuticals, while leaving a low residual concentration of dissolved ozone in the system, thereby preventing bromate formation.

AB In recent years ever-increasing amounts of pharmaceuticals are being detected in the aquatic environment and in some cases, they have even been discovered in drinking water. Their presence is attributed mainly to the inability of sewage treatment plants to adequately remove these compounds from the sewage influent. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, kinetics and efficiency of using liquid-core microcapsules as a novel methodology, termed capsular perstraction, to remove seven pharmaceuticals commonly found in the environment, from water. The process involves the envelopment of pre-selected organic solvents within a porous hydrogel membrane to form liquid-core microcapsules, which can be used to extract a large range of compounds. Results indicate that this novel approach is capable of extracting the seven chosen compounds rapidly and with a variable efficiency. The simultaneous use of both dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid liquid-core microcapsules at a liquid volume ratio of only 4% (v/v) resulted in the following extractions within 50 mm of capsule addition to contaminated water: furosemide 15%; clofibric acid 19%; sulfamethoxazole 22%; carbamazepine 54%; warfarin 80%; metoprolol 90% and diclofenac 100%. The effects of different agitation rates, microcapsule size and membrane thickness on the rate of mass transfer of warfarin into the liquid-core (dibutyl sebacate) of microcapsules was also examined. Results showed that the main rate-limiting step to mass transfer was due to the stagnant organic film (microcapsule size) within the core of the microcapsules. A volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 2.28 x 10(-6) m/s was obtained for the smallest microcapsules, which was nearly 4-fold higher compared to the value (0.6 x 10(-6) m/s) obtained for the largest microcapsules used in this study. Even with this resistance liquid-core microcapsules are still capable of the rapid extraction of the tested compounds and may provide a platform for the safe disposal of the pharmaceuticals after removal.

AB Wastewater treatment plants do not eliminate micropollutants completely and are thus important point sources for these substances. Ozonation and activated carbon treatment might be beneficial for ecosystem health as these techniques provide effective barriers to organic contaminants. However, a toxicity evaluation is required to investigate toxicity reduction and to assess the potential formation of toxic oxidation byproducts during ozonation.
   Therefore a comparative toxicity evaluation of different treated wastewater effluents was performed on site at a half scale treatment plant equipped with an ozonation step and an activated carbon treatment step in parallel subsequent to conventional activated sludge treatment. For this purpose four invertebrate and one higher plant toxicity test were selected to assess potential biological effects on whole organisms.
   The reproduction test with the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum exhibited a decreased reproductive output after advanced treatment compared to conventional treatment. This indicates an effective estrogenicity removal by ozonation and activated carbon treatment and is confirmed by results of the yeast estrogen screen with a reduction of in vitro estrogenic activity by >75%. The Lumbriculus variegatus test revealed a significantly enhanced toxicity after ozonation compared to conventional treatment whereas this effect was reduced following subsequent sand filtration. When ozonation was applied, a significantly increased genotoxicity was observed, detected with the comet assay using haemolymph of the zebra mussel. Again, this effect was removed by subsequent sand filtration to the level of conventional treatment. Activated carbon treatment even resulted in a significant reduction of genotoxicity.
   Adverse effects after the ozone reactor are possibly a result of the formation of toxic oxidation byproducts. Biologically active sand filtration obviously is an effective barrier to such compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals are widely prescribed in the United States; release of municipal wastewater effluent is a primary route introducing them to aquatic environments, where little is known about their distribution and fate. Water, bed sediment, and brain tissue from native white suckers (Catostomus commersoni)were collected upstream and at points progressively downstream from outfalls discharging to two effluent-impacted streams, Boulder Creek (Colorado) and Fourmile Creek (Iowa). A liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was used to quantify antidepressants, including fluoxetine, norfluoxetine (degradate), sertraline, norsertraline (degradate), paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion in all three sample matrices. Antidepressants were not present above the limit of quantitation in water samples upstream from the effluent outfalls but were present at points downstream at ng/L concentrations, even at the farthest downstream sampling site 8.4 km downstream from the outfall. The antidepressants with the highest measured concentrations in both streams were venlafaxine, bupropion, and citalopram and typically were observed at concentrations of at least an order of magnitude greater than the more commonly investigated antidepressants fluoxetine and sertraline. Concentrations of antidepressants in bed sediment were measured at ng/g levels; venlafaxine and fluoxetine were the predominant chemicals observed. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and their degradates were the principal antidepressants observed in fish brain tissue, typically at low ng/g concentrations. A qualitatively different antidepressant profile was observed in brain tissue compared to streamwater samples. This study documents that wastewater effluent can be a point source of antidepressants to stream ecosystems and that the qualitative composition of antidepressants in brain tissue from exposed fish differs substantially from the compositions observed in streamwater and sediment, suggesting selective uptake.

AB Water and wastewater effluents contain a vast range of chemicals in mixtures that have different chemical structures and characteristics. This study presents a treatment technology for the removal of mixtures of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), oxtetracycline (OTC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP)) from contaminated water. The treatment combines pH modification of the water to an optimal value, followed by a photolytic treatment using direct polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) irradiation by medium pressure UV lamp. The pH adjustment of the treated water leads to structural modifications of the pollutant's molecule thus may enhance direct photolysis by UV light. Results showed that an increase of water pH from 5 to 7 leads to a decrease in degradation rate of SMX and an increase in degradation rate of OTC and CIP, when studied separately and not in a mixture. Thus, the optimal pH values for UV photodegradation in a mixture, involve initial photolysis at pH 5 and then gradually changing the pH from 5 to 7 during the UV exposure. For example, this resulted in 99% degradation of SMX at pH 5 and enhanced degradation of OTC and CIP from 54% and 26% to 91% and 96% respectively when pH was increased from 5 to 7. Thus the pH induced photolytic treatment has a potential in improving treatment of antibiotics in mixtures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an assessment of the dynamics in the influent concentration of hormones (estrone, estriol) and antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin) in the liquid phase including the efficiency of biological municipal wastewater treatment. The concentration of estradiol, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, chlortetracycline, cefuroxime, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide were below the limit of detection in all of the sewage samples collected within this study. Two different types of diurnal variation pattern were identified in the influent mass loads of selected antibiotics and hormones that effectively correlate with daily drug administration patterns and with the expected maximum human hormone release, respectively. The occurrence of natural hormones and antimicrobials, administered every 12 hours, shows a daily trend of decreasing contaminant mass load, having the maximum values in the morning hours. The occurrence of antibiotics, typically administered every 8 hours, indicates a daily peak value in samples collected under the highest hydraulic loading. The efficiency of biological removal of both hormones and antibiotics is shown to be limited. Compared to the values obtained in the influent samples, increased concentrations are observed in the biologically treated effluent for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, mainly as a result of deconjugation processes. Ciprofloxacin is shown as the predominant antimicrobial compound in the effluent, and it is present at quantities approximately 10 fold greater than the total mass of the other of the compounds due to poor removal efficiency and alternating solid-liquid partitioning behaviour. Our results suggest that, to increase the micro-pollutant removal and the chemical dosing efficiency in enhanced tertiary treatment, significant benefits can be derived from the optimisation of reactor design and the development of control schemes that accounts for diurnal secondary effluent micro-pollutant and hydraulic loading patterns.

AB Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are manmade or natural chemicals that have the ability to interfere with the endocrine system of animals. They have not been monitored systematically in the Czech Republic. The goal of the present study was the characterization of aquatic environmental pollution from the Brno (Czech Republic) city agglomeration focusing on EDC. Passive sampling devices, as well as semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), were used for the pilot assessment of EDC. They were deployed for 21- to 28-d periods at nine locations in the Svratka and Svitava Rivers, Brno, Czech Republic, including at the inlet and outlet of Brno's wastewater treatment plant. The SPMDs were used to monitor nonpolar compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorinated pesticides (OCP). The POCIS were used to monitor polar compounds such as pesticides and their metabolites, perfluoro-organic compounds (PFOC), and pharmaceuticals. The passive samplers allowed very low detection limits for soluble (bioavailable) fractions of pollutants. The contribution of PAH, PCB, and HCB in sewage water to pollution of the Svratka River was low. The Brno wastewater treatment plant was identified as the main source of pharmaceuticals, triclosan, methyl triclosan, and some polar pesticides. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29: 550-555.

AB Land application of biosolids is a common practice throughout the world. However, concerns continue to be raised about the safety of this practice, because biosolids may contain trace levels of organic contaminants. The present study evaluated the levels of triclocarban (TCC), triclosan (TCS), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in biosolids from 16 wastewater treatment plants and in soils from field plots receiving annual applications of biosolids for 33 years. All of the four contaminants evaluated were detected in most of the biosolids at concentrations ranging from hundreds of mu g/kg to over 1,000 mg/kg (dry wt basis). They were detected at mu g/kg levels in the biosolids-amended soil, but their concentrations decreased sharply with increasing soil depth for 4-NP, PBDEs, and TCC, indicating limited soil leaching of those compounds. However, potential leaching of TCS in the biosolids-amended soils was observed. The levels of all four compounds in the surface soil increased with increasing biosolids application rate. Compared with the estimated 33-year cumulative input to the soil during the 33-year consecutive biosolids application, most of the PBDEs and a small percentage of 4-NP, TCC, and TCS remained in the top 120-cm soil layer. These observations suggest slow degradation of PBDEs but rapid transformation of 4-NP, TCC, and TCS in the biosolids-amended soils. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29: 597-605. (C) 2009 SETAC

AB Since conventional treatment technologies may fail in removing many micro-pollutants, there is currently a focus on the potential of additional treatment technologies for improved sewage treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate six different effluents from Henriksdal Sewage Treatment Plant in Stockholm, Sweden. The effluents were; conventionally treated effluent (chemical phosphorous removal in combination with an activated sludge process, including biological nitrogen removal and a sand filter), with additional treatments individually added to the conventional treatment; active carbon filtration, ozonation at 5 mg l(-1), ozonation at 15 mg l(-1), ozonation at 5 mg l(-1) + moving bed biofilm reactor and irradiation with ultraviolet radiation + hydrogen peroxide. The evaluation was done by characterizing and comparing the effluents using a Lefkovitch matrix model based on a life cycle test with the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes, combined with analysis of juvenile development and survival over time.
   The conventionally treated effluent resulted in the most negative effects, leading to the conclusion that all additional treatments in the present study created effluents with less negative impacts on the copepod populations. The ozone treatments with the low dose treatment in particular, resulted in the overall least negative effects. Moving bed biofilm reactor combined with ozone did not improve the quality of the effluent in the sense that slightly more negative effects on the population abundance were seen for this treatment technology compared to ozonation alone. The active carbon treatment had more negative effects than the ozone treatments, most of which could possibly be explained by removal of essential metal ions. The effluent which was treated with ultraviolet radiation + hydrogen peroxide resulted in few developmental and survival effects over time, but still showed negative effects on the population level. Matrix population modeling proved a useful tool for biologically characterizing and comparing the effluents. Basing the assessment either on the individual level data (development and survival over time or total reproductive output) or the population level data (lambda values and projected population abundances) would not have resulted in the same conclusions as combining both analyses. The juvenile development and survival over time allowed for closer monitoring of the important molting process, whereas the population modeling provided an integrated measure of potential effects at the population level. If the dilution of the effluent in the recipient is considered, the biological effects recorded in the present study were not of substantial significance for the copepod populations, regardless of treatment technology.

AB Pharmaceuticals discharged in municipal wastewater are of emerging concern because of their potential for inducing biological effects in aquatic organisms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat chronic depression, have been detected in receiving and wastewaters. Fluoxetine is a highly prescribed model SSRI used to assess impacts of antidepressants on aquatic organisms. In this study, in vitro hepatic fluoxetine metabolism was determined in several model fish species: rainbow trout, goldfish, zebrafish and killifish. Incubation of fluoxetine with hepatic microsomes from trout pre-treated with carbamazepine showed a time-dependant loss of fluoxetine, concomitant with an increase in norfluoxetine, the major mammalian demethylated metabolite. However, fluoxetine was not well metabolized in reactions with hepatic microsomes from untreated fish. Fluoxetine loss was greater than norfluoxetine production, indicating that norfluoxetine is not the predominant fluoxetine biotransformation product in fish. Furthermore, norfluoxetine was often undetected, possibly indicating that fluoxetine demethylation is a minor metabolic pathway in fish. Inter-species differences in fluoxetine metabolism were not evident because of high intra-species variability, although killifish appeared to have the highest hepatic metabolic capacity for fluoxetine. Fluoxetine metabolism in mammals is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Trout were exposed to known CYP inducers, carbamazepine and 3-methylcholanthrene, to assess potential induction of hepatic fluoxetine metabolism. Microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene treated fish did not induce detectable changes in fluoxetine concentrations in vitro, indicating that fish CYP1s are not involved in fluoxetine metabolism; the CYPs involved are still unclear. Identification of metabolites other than norfluoxetine warrants further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously discharged into the environment, resulting in the chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to these compounds. In this multigenerational study, we examined the influence of four pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DIC), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and metoprolol (MET)) as single substances and as a drug mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history and morphological parameters over six generations of the cladoceran Daphnia magna.
   Detectable effects of the used pharmaceuticals occured in the first observed generation, followed by an acclimation period and a recurrence of drug effects in later generations: daphnids exposed to MET were affected by the pharmaceutical, resulting in a decreased body length at first reproduction in the generations F0, F3 and F4 and in a reduced number of offspring in the generations F0 and F4. Similar effects were observed in daphnids exposed to EE2. DIC delayed age at first reproduction in the F0 and F2 generations and increased the body length of neonates in the generations F1 and F5. Daphnids exposed to CBZ showed a delay in the age at first reproduction for the F0 generation only. The drug mixture reduced the age at first reproduction of daphnids in the F0 and F2 generation and increased the body length at first reproduction in the generations F0 and F3.
   Neither the single drugs nor the pharmaceutical mixture influenced the successive generations of D. magna in a steady way. Thus, multigenerational studies are necessary to prevent insufficient assessments on the impact of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitroglycerin (NC), a nitrate ester, is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as an explosive in dynamite and as propellant. Currently NC is considered as a key environmental contaminant due to the discharge of wastewater tainted with the chemical from the military and pharmaceutical industry. The present study describes hydrolytic degradation of NC (200 mu M) at pH 9 using either conventional or microwave-assisted heating at 50 degrees C. We found that hydrolytic degradation of NC inside the microwave chamber was much higher than its degradation using conventional heating. Products distributions in both heating systems were closely related and included nitrite, nitrate, formic acid, and the novel intermediates 2-hydroxypropanedial (O=CHCH(OH)HC=O) and glycolic acid (CH(2)(OH)COOH). Two other intermediates glycolaldehyde (CH(2)(OH)CHO) and glyoxylic acid (CHOCOOH) were only detected in the microwave treated samples. The molar ratio of nitrite to nitrate in the presence and absence of microwave heating was 2.5 and 2.8, respectively. In both microwave assisted and conventional heating a nitrogen mass balance of 96% and 98% and a carbon mass balance of 58% and 78%, respectively, were obtained. The lower C mass recovery might be attributed to further unknown reactions, e.g., polymerization of the aldehydes CH(2)(OH)CHO. CHOCOOH and O=CHCH(OH)HC=O. A hydrolytic degradation pathway for NC was proposed involving denitration (loss of 2 NO(2)(-)) from the two primary carbons and the loss of one nitrate from the secondary carbon to produce 2-hydroxypropanedial.

AB Increasing research has suggested that biosolids generated from municipal wastewater treatment can be a major sink for many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their land application potentially introduces these contaminants into the terrestrial and aquatic environments. In this study, methods were developed for the analysis of 14 PPCPs in biosolids and soils using pressurized liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass, spectrometry. Recoveries were over 50% for all analytes except diphenhydramine (similar to 30%) in soils. Soil properties or type of biosolids showed minor effects on method recoveries. Estimated method limits of quantification (LOQ) range from 0.1-15 ng g(-1) for soil and 0.3-27 ng g(-1) for biosolids. A field study utilizing the methods revealed that other than carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, all targeted compounds were detected in biosolids. Diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, triclosan and triclocarban were detected up to the mu g g(-1) range with the highest concentration of 23 mu g g(-1) for triclocarban. Seven of the PCCPs found in biosolids were also detected in agricultural soils amended with these biosolids and several (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and triclocarban) appeared to be persistent in soils. Triclocarban was also found most abundant in soils with the highest average concentration of 0.2 mu g g(-1) while the rest of compounds were in the lower ng g(-1) range. Generally, the concentrations found on the fields were 2-3 degrees of magnitude lower than in the biosolids, which is likely to be due to dilution, degradation and leaching processes.

AB A wide range of pharmaceutical compounds have been identified in the environment, and their existence is a topic of growing concern, both for human and ecological health. The work described here has investigated the photolytic properties of L(+)-alpha-phenylglycine (L-alpha-PG-H) in aqueous solution as it can be degraded by photo-catalysis. In 266 nm laser flash photolysis of aqueous solution of L-alpha-PG-H saturated with nitrogen, two transient absorption bands are observed at 280-330 nm and 450-800 nm, respectively, due to L-alpha-PG-H radical cation and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)). Then e(aq)(-) reacts with L-alpha-PG-H to form the L-alpha-PG-H radical anion. Decaying rate constants of e(aq)(-) observed at 720 nm is to be 8.9 x 10(8) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). The rate constant for oxidation of L-alpha-PG-H by SO4- is calculated as 4.5 x 10(8) and 4.3 x 10(8) s(-1) mol(-1) dm(3), respectively. The dissociation constants (pKa) of L-alpha-PG-H is 3. Excited triplet of L-alpha-PG-H in solution is formed by laser flash photolysis. The quench rate constant of L-alpha-PG-H excited triplet (k(s)) is determined to be 1.3 x 10(7) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) and k(0) is equal to 1.7 x 10(5) s(-1).

AB BACKCROUND: Detection of estrogens in the environment has raised concerns in recent years because of their potential to affect both wildlife and humans.
   OBJECTIVES: We compared exposures to prescribed and naturally occurring estrogens in drinking water to exposures to naturally occurring background levels of estrogens in the diet of chaildren and adults and to four independently derived acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) to determine whether drinking water intakes are larger or smaller than dietary intake or ADIs.
   METHODS: We used the Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation (PhATE) model to predict concentrations of estrogens potentially present in drinking water. Predicted drinking water concentrations were combined with default water intake rates to estimate drinking water exposures. Predicted drinking water intakes were compared to dietary intakes and also to ADIs. We present comparisons for individual estrogens as well as combined estrogens.
   RESULTS: In the analysis we estimated that a child's exposures to individual prescribed estrogens in drinking water are 730-480,000 times lower (depending upon estrogen type) than exposure to background levels of naturally occurring estrogens in milk. A child's exposure to total estrogens in drinking water (prescribed and naturally occurring) is about 150 times lower than exposure from milk. Adult margins of exposure (MOEs) based on total dietary exposure are about 2 times smaller than those for children. Margins of safety (MOSs) for an adult's exposure to total prescribed estrogens in drinking water vary from about 135 to > 17,000, depending on ADI. MOSs for exposure to total estrogens in drinking water are about 2 times lower than MOSs for prescribed estrogens. Depending on the ADI that is used, MOSs for young children range from 28 to 5,120 for total estrogens (including both prescribed and naturally occurring sources) in drinking water.
   CONCLUSIONS: The consistently large MOEs and MOSs strongly suggest that prescribed and total estrogens that may potentially be present in drinking water in the United States are not causing adverse effects in U.S. residents, including sensitive subpopulations.

AB An analytical method was developed for the determination of nine antiviral drugs (acyclovir, abacavir, lamivudine, nevirapine oseltamivir, penciclovir, ribavirin, stavudine, zidovudine) and one active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) in raw and treated wastewater as well as in surface water using LC/ESI tandem MS detection. Relative recoveries exceeded 80% and limits of quantification ranged between 0.2 and 10 ng L-1. Matrix effects were compensated by the use of stable isotope labeled surrogate standards and optimized chromatographic separation on a Hydro-RP column. All antiviral drugs, except ribavirin, were detected in raw wastewater. A significant reduction in concentrations was observed for acyclovir, lamivudine, and abacavir in treated wastewater indicating a substantial removal, while nevirapine, zidovudine and oseltamivir were found in similar concentrations in raw and treated wastewater. Concentrations in river waters were in the lower ng L-1-range, with a maximum of 190 and 170 ng L-1 for acyclovir and zidovudine, respectively in the Hessian Ried. Estimated total compound loads in the Ruhr river ranged between <0.1 and 16.5 g d(-1) while for the Rhine river values between 370 and 1800 g d(-1) were determined. The ratios of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate were approximately a factor of 10 higher for the Rhine than for the otherrivers and streams indicating a significant contribution from other sources such as discharges from manufacturing facilities.

AB This work focuses on the treatment of real effluents from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (RE) with solar photo-Fenton (5 mg and 20 mg L-1 Fe, pH similar to 3 and 50 mg L-1 initial H2O2 concentration) at pilot plant scale. In some experiments RE was spiked with 15 different (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan) emerging contaminants (ECs) at 100 and 5 mu g L-1 each which were added directly into RE prior to treatment. All experiments showed successful degradation of ECs in real effluents from different municipal wastewater treatment plants at low iron concentration (5 mg L-I). Although the most degradation took place during the Fenton process, photo-Fenton was necessary to degrade all ECs below their limit of detection (LOD). In the case of the RE containing 52 ECs (determined by HPLC-QTRAP-MS), four of them could not be degraded to their LOD and were still present, although at extremely low concentrations (nicotine 47 ng L-1, cotinine 11 ng L-1, chlorfenvinphos 99 ng L-1, and caffeine 8 ng L-1). ECs were easily degraded by (OH)-O-center dot without substantial competition with the organic content of the RE.

AB Widespread detection of pharmaceutical compounds in water environment has been a serious concern recently, while conventional sewage treatments are ineffective for their elimination. But, advanced oxidation techniques are very promising to remove varieties of organic contaminants in water. This research aims to elucidate oxidation potentials of sixteen commonly used pharmaceutical compounds in mixed solutions by seven advanced oxidation techniques in laboratory batch experiments. The removal profiles exhibited four distinct patterns: a) easily degradable by all seven techniques, b) not easily degradable by all seven techniques, c) easily degradable by ozone-based techniques, but not by ultraviolet radiation-based techniques and d) easily degradable by ultraviolet radiation-based techniques, but not by ozone-based techniques. Ozone-based techniques rather than ultraviolet radiation-based techniques were very powerful for simultaneous removal of the compounds efficiently. Moreover, ozonation combined with ultraviolet radiation was the most appropriate technique for simultaneous removal of the tested compounds efficiently. Increased ozone dissolution and decomposition with ozone-based techniques did not always enhance the compounds' removal. Physicochemical properties of the compounds and solution pH also presumably played an important role on the removal which merits further attention.

AB The concentrations of some widely used pharmaceuticals, namely fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin C17H18FN3O3, norfloxacin C16H18FN3O3 and ofloxacin C18H20FN3O4) and sulfonamides (sulfadimethoxine C12H14N4O4S and sulfamethoxazole C10H11N3O3S) were determined in urban sewage sludge utilized for making compost. The levels of degradation of these pharmaceuticals resulting from sludge treatment were assessed. The concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals sufficiently varied both in sewage sludge and in compost and due to this phenomenon the possible danger resulting from the presence of pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge, used for composting, can not be ignored. The concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals were lower in compost, if compared to the relevant concentrations in sewage sludge. The highest pharmaceutical concentration in sewage sludge - 426 mu g/kg - was detected in the case of ciprofloxacin. The highest concentrations present in compost were 22 mu g/kg of norfloxacin and 20 mu g/kg of ciprofloxacin. Results show that before using the sewage sludge for making compost or before using the compost a fertilizer for food plants, they should be carefully tested against the content of commonly used pharmaceuticals.

AB Degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol by ozonation in aqueous solution was studied in a semi batch reactor under constant ozone dosage and variable pH conditions. The effectiveness of the process was estimated based on the degree of conversion of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol. It was observed that ozonation is more effective at alkaline reaction of medium than other conditions. The degree of conversion achieved (at the first 5 minutes of the process) at pH 9 was 99.64% compared to 99.03% and 77.35% at pH 7 and 3, respectively. Another parameter used to quantify the 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol during ozonation was the pseudo first order rate constant k [min(-1)]. Results showed that the rate constant of the process was approximately much higher at the alkaline pH compared to acidic ones. A considerable improvement in chemical oxygen demand removal was observed at pH above 7. At pH 9, the reduction in chemical oxygen demand at the end of the process reached 56.9 %. The degree of organically bounded nitrogen conversion to nitrate was higher at pH 3. Of the total organic carbon reduction, 15.89 % was observed at pH 9. The 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol degradation intermediate products were analyzed by mass-spectrometry. The main intermediate product was chlorophenol.

AB The sorption kinetics and equilibrium endpoints of two widely prescribed anionic lipid-regulating pharmaceuticals-atorvastatin and simvastatin acid-were evaluated for wastewater-treatment plant primary clarifier biosolids, a peat soil, a sandy soil, and a stream sediment. All equilibrium isotherms were linear over an aqueous concentration range of 0.01 mu g/L to greater than 100 mu g/L. Log K-oc values for statin sorption to biosolids were 2.91 and 2.96 for atorvastatin and simvastatin acids, respectively. Comparative isotherm experiments with the peat soil, sandy soil, and stream sediment found log K-oc values for atorvastatin of 2.96, 2.70, and 3.20, respectively, and values of 2.89, 2.81, and 3.33 for simvastatin acid, respectively. Sorption was noncompetitive between the two statin drugs. Temperature changes did not affect sorption of either statin over the range of 5-32 degrees C, indicating that heats of sorption were near zero. Taken together, these observations suggest that despite its anionic structure, statin sorption occurs via partition (solubilization) of the hydrophobic part of the molecule into the sorbent organic matter. Results from kinetic experiments show that statin sorption to biosolids reaches equilibrium much more rapidly compared to the soils and sediment, as the mass-transfer-rate coefficient, alpha, for the two-site equilibrium/kinetic model is approximately one-order-of magnitude higher for the biosolids. Presentation of these sorption data provides a requisite first step for future studies of statin fate and transport in wastewater-treatment plants and the environment.

AB Trinitroglycerin (TNG), a nitrate ester, is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for the treatment of angina pectoris (chest pain) And by the military for the manufacturing of dynamite and propellants. Currently, TNG is considered as a key environmental contaminant due to the discharge of wastewater tainted with the chemical from various military and pharmaceutical industries. The present study describes the use of a nanostructured silica material (Mobil Composite Material no. 48 [MCM-48]) prepared by mixing tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to remove TNG from water. The sorption of TNG onto MCM-48 rapidly reached equilibrium within I It. Sorption kinetics were best described using a pseudo-second order model, whereas sorption isotherms were best interpreted using the Langmuir model. The latter gave a maximum sorption capacity of 55.2 mg g(-1) at 40 degrees C. The enthalpy and entropy of TNG sorption onto MCM-48 were 1.89 kJ mol(-1) and 79.0 J mol(-1). K-1, indicating the endothermic nature of the TNG sorption onto MCM-48. When MCM-48 was heated at 540 degrees C for 5 It, the resulting calcined material (absence of the surfactant) did not sorb TNG, suggesting that the surfactant component of the nanomaterial was responsible for TNG sorption. Finally, we found that MCM-48 lost approximately 30% of its original sorption capacity after five sorption-desorption cycles. In conclusion, the nanostructured silica based sorbent, with high sorption capacity and remarkable reusability, should constitute the basis for the development of an effective technology for the removal of TNG from contaminated water.

AB Elimination of recalcitrant chemicals during wastewater treatment is a difficult problem for both developing and industrialized countries. The biological elimination of very persistent xenobiotics such as endocrine disrupting chemicals from municipal and industrial sewage treatment plants is an ambitious challenge as existing physico-chemical methods, such as advanced oxidation processes, are energy-intensive and consume high amounts of chemicals. Through the entry into force of strict legislative measures, such as the Water Framework Directives (EU WFD in Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the Community action in the field of water policy, 2000) and REACH (REACH EU in European Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe use (EC 1907/2006), 2007), the market for wastewater treatment is exploding. For instance the European market potential for the membrane bioreactor technology is estimated to 57 M(sic) per year. Based on recent progresses in nanotechnology, new developments in catalysis and environmental applications can be foreseen for the near future. Indeed, because of high surface area-to-volume ratio in nanosystems, heterogeneous enzymatic or catalytic reactions can be greatly enhanced. In the LANCE project a nanoparticle (NP)-based technology is under development. Cheap and resistant oxidative enzymes, i.e. laccases are immobilized onto the surface of the particles in order to produce systems possessing a broad substrate spectrum for the degradation of cocktails of recalcitrant pollutants. One of the objectives is to produce NPs that are compatible with wastewater treatment and can be synthesised in a cost-effective and large-scale fashion, e.g. silicabased NPs using flame spray pyrolysis and emulsion-based techniques. The modified particles are applied in bioreactors where they are retained, i.e. membrane bioreactors or perfusion basket reactors to eliminate pollutants from the wastewater. Such reactors allow multi-cycle use of the NPs coated with active enzymes and thus contribute to decrease the treatment costs. The two-year activities of the LANCE project encompass the synthesis of various NP systems, the immobilization of selected low cost industrial laccases on the latter, and the technical and scientific proof of the "depollution'' concept.

AB Six polycyclic musks (PCMs) and five nitro musks (NMs) were analyzed in dewatered sludge samples from 13 municipal, 4 livestock and 1 pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South Korea. 1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-(g)-2-benzopyran (HHCB; Galaxolide (R), Abbalide (R)), and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethy1-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN; Tonalide (R), Fixolide (R)) were the two predominant PCMs in the sludge samples, at concentrations ranging from 0.52 to 82.0 mg/kg dry weight (dw) and 0.12 to 28.8 mg/kg (dw), respectively, suggesting the extensive use of these two PCMs in South Korea. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed the different usage patterns of PCMs between livestock cultivating farm and household. The levels of HHCB and AHTN in the effluent discharged from the WWTPs were lower than the threshold effect levels derived for fish, suggesting low potential risks to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the calculated discharge of synthetic musks (SMs) from sludge in each target WWTP ranged from 36 to 10,961 g/d. These results indicate the necessity of conducting monitoring studies in marine ecosystems due to ocean disposal of sludge, particularly focused on the two prevailing PCMs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The three hybrid systems consisted of several different subsystems (ponds, surface flow constructed wetlands and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands) connected in series, and their PPCP degradation efficiency was monitored. In addition, the enantiomeric behaviour of ibuprofen was studied in all the subsystems. The hybrid systems were at least as efficient in PPCP removal as the WWTP, removal efficiencies mainly exceeding 70%. Moreover, enantiomeric analysis indicates that ibuprofen removal followed a predominantly aerobic and microbiological pathway. Constructed wetlands and ponds are therefore successful technologies for removing PPCPs from wastewater and the most significant removal process in these systems is biologically mediated.

AB Advanced oxidation treatment using low pressure UV light coupled with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) was evaluated for the oxidation of six pharmaceuticals in three wastewater effluents. The removal of these six pharmaceuticals (meprobamate, carbamazepine, dilantin, atenolol, primidone and trimethoprim) varied between no observed removal and >90%. The role of the water quality (i.e., alkalinity, nitrite, and specifically effluent organic matter (EfOM)) on hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) exposure was evaluated and used to explain the differences in pharmaceutical removal between the three wastewaters. Results indicated that the efficacy of UV/H2O2 treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater was a function of not only the concentration of EfOM but also its inherent reactivity towards (OH)-O-center dot. The removal of pharmaceuticals also correlated with reductions in ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), which offers utilities a surrogate to assess pharmaceutical removal efficiency during UV/H2O2 treatment.

AB The conversion of the antibiotic ofloxacin and the beta-blocker atenolol by means of TiO2 photocatalysis was investigated. Irradiation was provided by a UVA lamp at 3.37 x 10(-6) einstein/s photon flux, while emphasis was given on the effect of catalyst type and loading (50-1500 mg/L), initial substrate concentration (5-20 mg/L), initial pH (3-10) and the effect of H2O2 (0.07-1.4 mM) as an additional oxidant on substrate conversion and mineralization in various matrices (i.e. pure water, groundwater and treated municipal effluent). Conversion was assessed measuring sample absorbance at 288 and 224 nm for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while mineralization measuring the dissolved organic carbon. Degussa P25 TiO2 was found to be more active than other TiO2 samples for either substrate degradation, with ofloxacin being more reactive than atenolol. Conversion generally increased with increasing catalyst loading, decreasing initial substrate concentration and adding H2O2, while the effect of solution pH was substrate-specific. Reaction rates, following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression, were maximized at a catalyst to substrate concentration ratio (w/w) of 50 and 15 for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while higher ratios led to reduced efficiency. Likewise, high concentrations of H2O2 had an adverse effect on reaction, presumably due to excessive oxidant scavenging radicals and other reactive species. The ecotoxicity of ofloxacin and atenolol to freshwater species Daphnia mayna was found to increase with increasing substrate concentration (1-10 mg/L) and exposure time (2448 h), with atenolol being more toxic than ofloxacin. Photocatalytic treatment eliminated nearly completely toxicity and this was more pronounced for atenolol. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tamiflu (R) (oseltamivir ethylester) is an antiviral agent for the treatment of influenza A and B. The prodrug Tamiflu (R) is converted in the human body to the pharmacologically active metabolite, oseltamivir acid, with a yield of 75%. Oseltamivir acid is indirectly photodegradable and slowly biodegradable in sewage works and sediment/water systems. A previous environmental risk assessment has concluded that there is no bioaccumulation potential of either of the compounds. However, little was known about the ecotoxicity of the metabolite. Ester hydrolysis typically reduces the hydrophobicity and thus the toxicity of a compound. In this case, a zwitterionic, but overall neutral species is formed from the charged parent compound. If the speciation and predicted partitioning into biological membranes is considered, the metabolite may have a relevant contribution to the overall toxicity. These theoretical considerations triggered a study to investigate the toxicity of oseltamivir acid (OA), alone and in binary mixtures with its parent compound oseltamivir ethylester (OE). OE and OA were found to be baseline toxicants in the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri. Their mixture effect lay between predictions for concentration addition and independent action for the mixture ratio excreted in urine and nine additional mixture ratios of OE and OA. In contrast, OE was an order of magnitude more toxic than OA towards algae, with a more pronounced effect when the direct inhibition of photosystem II was used as toxicity endpoint opposed to the 24 h growth rate endpoint. The binary mixtures in this assay yielded experimental mixture effects that agreed with predictions for independent action. This is consistent with the finding that OE exhibits slightly enhanced toxicity, while OA acts as baseline toxicant. Therefore, with respect to mixture classification, the two compounds can be considered as acting according to different modes of toxic action, although there are indications that the difference is a toxicokinetic effect, not a true difference of mechanism of toxicity. The general mixture results illustrate the need to consider the role of metabolites in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. However, in the concentration ratio of parent to metabolite excreted by humans, the experimental results confirm that the active metabolite does not significantly contribute to the risk quotient of the mixture.

AB Among increasingly used pharmaceutical products, beta-blockers have been commonly reported at low concentrations in rivers and littoral waters of Europe and North America. Little is known about the toxicity of these chemicals in freshwater ecosystems while their presence may lead to chronic pollution. Hence, in this study the acute toxicity of 3 beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol on fluvial biofilms was assessed by using several biomarkers. Some were indicative of potential alterations in biofilm algae (photosynthetic efficiency), and others in biofilm bacteria (peptidase activity, bacterial mortality). Propranolol was the most toxic beta-blocker, mostly affecting the algal photosynthetic process. The exposure to 531 mu g/L of propranolol caused 85% of inhibition of photosynthesis after 24 h. Metoprolol was particularly toxic for bacteria. Though estimated No-Effect Concentrations (NEC) were similar to environmental concentrations, higher concentrations of the toxic (503 mu g/L metoprolol) caused an increase of 50% in bacterial mortality. Atenolol was the least toxic of the three tested beta-blockers. Effects superior to 50% were only observed at very high concentration (707 mg/L). Higher toxicity of metoprolol and propranolol might be due to better absorption within biofilms of these two chemicals. Since beta-blockers are mainly found in mixtures in rivers, their differential toxicity could have potential relevant consequences on the interactions between algae and bacteria within river biofilms.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarbon (TCC) are bactericides used in various consumer and personal-care products. Recent studies have revealed considerable levels of these bactericides in wastewater, aquatic wildlife, and human samples. Consequently, in this study we measured TCS and TCC in influent and effluent, sludge, and pond water/sediment samples from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and three major rivers in Savannah, Georgia (USA). Among these treatment plants, the Wilshire plant showed elevated concentrations of TCS (influent, 86,161; effluent, 5370 ng/L), whereas TCC was greater in the Georgetown plant (influent, 36,221) and the Wilshire plant effluent (3045 ng/L). Clearance of TCS and TCC were 95 and 92%, respectively, in the President Street plant, 94 and 85%, respectively, in the Wilshire plant, 99 and 80%, respectively, in the Travis Field plant, and 99 and 99%, respectively, in the Georgetown plant. Based on the mass flow estimate, 138 g/day of TCS and 214 g/day TCC are released into the Savannah River from the President Street, Travis Field, and Wilshire plants and 1.60 g/day TCS and 1.64 g/day TCC are released to the Ogeechee River from the Georgetown plant. Based on the sludge data, the loading estimate can be calculated that 32 and 0.004 g/day TCS and 53 and 0.01 g/day TCC (nonincinerated and incinerated, respectively) are deposited in landfill from the President Street plant alone, whereas 4.6, 26, and 6.8 g/day TCS and 3.8, 23, and 5.9 g/day TCC (wet sludge) were produced and dumped in landfill from the rest of the WWTPs. Incineration of wet sludge can eliminate 99.99% of TCS and TCC. Concentrations of TCS and TCC in water and sediment were greater in the Vernon River, followed by the Savannah River and the Ogeechee River.

AB The prevalence of organic wastewater compounds in surface waters of the United States has been reported in a number of recent studies. In karstic areas, surface contaminants might be transported to groundwater and, ultimately, cave ecosystems, where they might impact resident biota. In this study, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCISs) and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed in six caves and two surface-water sites located within the Ozark Plateau of northeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas in order to detect potential chemical contaminants in these systems. All caves sampled were known to contain populations of the threatened Ozark cavefish (Amblyopsis rosae). The surface-water site in Oklahoma was downstream from the outfall of a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a previous study indicated a hydrologic link between this stream and one of the caves. A total of 83 chemicals were detected in the POCIS and SPMD extracts from the surface-water and cave sites. Of these, 55 chemicals were detected in the caves. Regardless of the sampler used, more compounds were detected in the Oklahoma surface-water site than in the Arkansas site or the caves. The organic wastewater chemicals with the greatest mass measured in the sampler extracts included sterols (cholesterol and beta-sitosterol), plasticizers [diethylhexylphthalate and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate], the herbicide bromacil, and the fragrance indole. Sampler extracts from most of the cave sites did not contain many wastewater contaminants, although extracts from samplers in the Oklahoma surface-water site and the cave hydrologically linked to it had similar levels of diethylhexyphthalate and common detections of carbamazapine, sulfamethoxazole, benzophenone, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), and octophenol monoethoxylate. Further evaluation of this system is warranted due to potential ongoing transport of wastewater-associated chemicals into the cave. Halogenated organics found in caves and surface-water sites included brominated flame retardants, organochlorine pesticides (chlordane and nonachlor), and polychlorinated biphenyls. The placement of samplers in the caves (near the cave mouth compared to farther in the system) might have influenced the number of halogenated organics detected due to possible aerial transport of residues. Guano from cave-dwelling bats also might have been a source of some of these chlorinated organics. Seven-day survival and growth bioassays with fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to samples of cave water indicated initial toxicity in water from two of the caves, but these effects were transient, with no toxicity observed in follow-up tests.

AB Microcosm constructed wetlands systems established with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and planted with Typha spp. were used to evaluate their ability to remove pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid from wastewaters. Seasonal variability of these systems' performances was also evaluated. Overall, removal efficiencies of 96%, 97% and 75% for ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid, respectively, were achieved under summer conditions after a retention time of 7 days. In winter, a maximum loss of 26% in removal efficiency was observed for clofibric acid. Removal kinetics was characterized by a fast initial step (>50% removal within 6 h) mainly due to adsorption on LECA but, on a larger timescale, plants also contributed significantly to the system's performance. Despite the fact that further tests using larger-scale systems are required, this study points to the possible application of these low-cost wastewater treatment systems for dealing with pharmaceuticals contaminated wastewater.

ID 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOL
AB The enhanced removal of organic compounds from a pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the production of an anti-viral drug (acyclovir) was obtained by employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and an ozonation system. Art integrated MBR-ozonation system was set-up by placing the ozonation reactor in the recirculation stream of the MBR effluent. A conventional treatment set-up (ozonation as polishing step after MBR) was also used as a reference. The biological treatment alone reached an average COD removal of 99%, which remained unvaried when the ozonation step was introduced. An acyclovir removal of 99% was also obtained with the MBR step and the ozonation allowed to further remove 99% of the residual concentration in the MBR effluent. For several of the 28 organics identified in the wastewater the efficiency of the MBR treatment improved from 20% to 60% as soon as the ozonation was placed in the recirculation stream. The benefit of the integrated system, with respect to the conventional treatment set-up was evident for the removal of a specific ozonation by-product. The latter was efficiently removed in the integrated system, being its abundance in the final effluent 20-fold lower than what obtained when ozonation was used as a polishing step. In addition, if the conventional treatment configuration is employed, the same performance of the integrated system in terms of by-product removal can only be obtained when the ozonation is operated for longer than 60 min. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the integrated system compared to the conventional polishing configuration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ozonation of ciprofloxacin was studied in hospital wastewater treatment plant effluent with focus on parent compound degradation, degradation product identification and residual antibacterial activity. Before ozonation, ciprofloxacin sorption on suspended solids was tested as a function of temperature (110.0-27.5 degrees C and pH (3, 7 and 10). Temperature did not significantly affect ciprofloxacin sorption while sorption was highest at pH 7 (log K-d = 4.7) compared to pH 3 (log K-d = 4.3) and 10 (log K-d = 3.9) (n = 3). Ozonation was slowest at pH 7 with ciprofloxacin half life times of 29 min, compared to 19 and 27 min at pH 10 and 3, respectively. Addition of 10-1000 mu M H2O2 increased ciprofloxacin half life times up to 38 min, probably influenced by competition with H2O2 for ozone as well as radical species. Ciprofloxacin ozonation products were identical as previously detected during ciprofloxacin ozonation in deionized water and revealed strong pH dependence. Residual antibacterial activity was measured by agar diffusion tests. For Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli, reduction of antibacterial activity was related to the parent compound degradation, while degradation products indicated to be the main compounds with respect to the antibacterial activity against Bacillus coagulans.

AB Advanced treatment of a complex pharmaceutical wastewater by Desal-5 DK nanofiltration (NF) membrane was carried out. The membrane fouling and chemical cleaning in this application were investigated. It was found that at the initial stage of NF process, the deposition of sulfate and carbonate of calcium was the main cause of membrane fouling. At the later fouling stage, besides calcium salts, complex organic foulants containing carboxyl acid, amide, and alkyl halide functional groups also deposited onto membrane surface and gradually formed a densely packed fouling layer. Accordingly, in cleaning process, the efficiency of a cleaning agent depended on its ability to break down the integrity of the compact fouling layer by reacting with the foulants. The results showed that the cleaning efficiencies of the agents increased in the sequence of NaOH (pH 11) < HCl (pH 2) < citric acid (pH 2) < EDTA (10 mM). After cleaning with EDTA for 60 min, the membrane flux recovery ratio reached 99.0%. The SEM image and element content of the membrane cleaned by EDTA were quite similar to those of the virgin membrane. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The common occurrence of human derived contaminants like pharmaceuticals, steroids and hormones in surface waters has raised the awareness of the role played by the release of treated or untreated sewage in the water quality along sensitive coastal ecosystems. South Florida is home of many important protected environments ranging from wetlands to coral reefs which are in close proximity to large metropolitan cities. Because, large portions of South Florida and most of the Florida Keys population are not served by modern sewage treatment plants and rely heavily on the use of septic systems, a comprehensive survey of selected human waste contamination markers was conducted in three areas to assess water quality with respect to non-traditional micro-constituents. This study documents the occurrence and distribution of fifteen hormones and steroids and five commonly detected pharmaceuticals in surface water samples collected from different near shore environments along South Florida between 2004 and 2006. The compounds most frequently detected were: cholesterol, caffeine, estrone, DEET, coprostanol, biphenol-A, beta-estradiol, and triclosan. The concentration detected for estrone and beta-estradiol were up to 5.2 and 1.8 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations of caffeine (5.5-68 ng/L) and DEET (4.8-49 ng/L) were generally higher and more prevalent than were the steroids. Distribution of microconstituents was site specific likely reflecting a diversity of sources. In addition to chemical analysis, the yeast estrogen screen assay was used to screen the samples for estrogen equivalency. Overall, the results show that water collected from inland canals and restricted circulation water bodies adjacent to heavily populated areas had high concentrations of multiple steroids, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products while open bay waters were largely devoid of the target analytes.

AB Continuous input of pharmaceuticals into rivers, through wastewater treatment systems, may cause adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems of the receiving waterbodies, due to the intrinsic biological activity of these compounds. To investigate this issue, we have carried out an Environmental Risk Assessment in the lower part of the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). The survey was carried out along three campaigns in 7 sampling points, located in the main river and in one of its tributaries (Anoia River). In each sample, 29 commonly used pharmaceuticals, belonging to different therapeutical classes (analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), lipid regulators, psychiatric drugs, anti-histamines, anti-ulcer agents, antibiotics and beta-blockers) have been determined. Simultaneously, the macro invertebrate community status of the same points has been also studied.
   Hazard quotient indexes have been estimated for the most representative compounds as the ratio between concentrations and EC50 reported values, for three bioassays commonly used in environmental toxicology, namely, fish, Daphnia and algae.
   Hazard indexes are obtained for each sample by summing up the hazard quotients of all the compounds present, and taking its average along the three sampling campaigns. In general. hazard quotients tend to increase when going downstream. Only those points located most upstream of the two rivers can be qualified under low risk for the three bioassays. The most sensitive bioassay seems to be algae, followed by Daphnia and fish.
   Log-transformed hazard indexes show fairly good inverse correlations (r = -0.58 to -0.93, p < 0.05) with Shannon diversity indexes of macroinvertebrates, determined from both densities and biomasses. Best correlations are obtained for Daphnia based hazard indexes, as expected from its taxonomical proximity to macroinvertebrates. The abnormal correlation behaviour found in one point located in the Anoia River is explained by the presence of other previously reported pollutants of industrial origin. generated by the nearby existing industry.

AB There are a number of reports in the literature which describe the occurrence of so-called emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, in surface water. Few of these studies have reported values fro m large cities in relatively and areas, such as in Spain. The persistence of some pharmaceuticals to usual wastewater treatments allows their discharge into surface waters. It is increasingly evident that mental health problems are of special concern for public health since psychiatric drugs are used in large amounts. Compared to other countries, Spain has a high pharmaceutical consumption rate, and Madrid metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of different psychoactive pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the main rivers of Madrid metropolitan area: Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tajo. Sampling was done downstream of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into these rivers. Control points upstream of STPs discharge points were also sampled. Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites for analysis were selected according to human consumption and prescription rates in Madrid, and the availability of valid techniques for detection. We observed residues of the antidepressants fluoxetine (80% of the sampling sites), citalopram (60%) and venlafaxine (100%). the anxiolytics nordiazepam (90%). oxazepam (80%) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (10%) and the anticonvulsant carabamazepine (70%). Measured concentrations equalled or exceeded those reported for other geographical areas, although there is a pronounced lack of information for the anxiolytics and venlafaxine. This is of special concern given that Wyeth-Ayerst's venlafaxine, Effexor, was the 10th greatest selling pharmaceutical worldwide in 2006. We conclude that the origin of pharmaceutical pollution in the rivers of Madrid is mainly the discharge of sewage treatment plants in Madrid's metropolitan area and a comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented.

AB Anti-tumour agents and their metabolites are largely excreted into effluent, along with other pharmaceuticals. In the past, investigations have focused on the input and analysis of pharmaceuticals in surface and ground water. The two oxazaphosphorine compounds, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are important cytostatic drugs used in the chemotherapy of cancer and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Their mechanism of action, involving metabolic activation and unspecific alkylation of nucleophilic compounds, accounts for genotoxic and carcinogenic effects described in the literature and is reason for environmental concern. The anti-tumour agents cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) were not biodegraded in biodegradation tests. They were not eliminated in municipal sewage treatment plants. Degradation by photochemically formed HO radicals may be of some relevance only in shallow, clear, and nitrate-rich water bodies but could be further exploited for elimination of these compounds by advanced oxidation processes, i.e. in a treatment of hospital waste water. Therefore, CP and IF are assumed to persist in the aquatic environment and to enter drinking water via surface water. The risk to humans from input of CP and IF into surface water is not known.
   The local and regional, i.e. nationwide predicted environmental concentration (PEC(local), PEC(regional)) of CP and IF was calculated for German surface water. Both compounds were measured in hospital effluents, and in the influent and effluent of a municipal treatment plant. Additionally, published concentrations in the effluent of sewage treatment plants and surface water were used for risk assessment. Excretion rates were taken into account. For a worst-case scenario, maximum possible ingestion of CP or IF by drinking 2 L a day of unprocessed surface water over a life span of 70 years was calculated for adults. Elimination in drinking water processing was neglected, as no data is available. This intake was compared with intake during anti-cancer treatment.
   Intake of CP and IF for anti-cancer treatment is typically 10 g within a few months. Under such conditions, a relative risk of 1.5 for the carcinogenic compounds CP and IF is reported in the literature. In the worst case, the maximum possible intake by drinking water is less than 10(-3) (IF) and 10(-5) (CP) of this amount, based on highest measured local concentrations. On a nationwide average, the factor is approx. 10(-6) or less.
   The additional intake of CP and IF due to their emission into surface water and its use without further treatment as drinking water is low compared to intake within a therapy. This approach has shortcomings. It illustrates the current lack of methodology and knowledge for the specific risk assessment of carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. IF and CP are directly reacting with the DNA. Therefore, with respect to health effects a safe threshold concentration for these compounds cannot be given. The resulting risk is higher for newborns and children than for adults. Due to the lack of data the risk for newborns and children cannot be assessed fully. The data presented here show that according to present knowledge the additional risk of cancer cannot be fully excluded, especially with respect to children. Due to the shortage of data for effects of CP and IF in low doses during a whole lifespan, possible effects were assessed using data of high doses of CP and IF within short-term ingestion, i.e. therapy. This remains an unresolved issue. Anyway, the risk assessment performed here could give a rough measure of the risks on the one hand and the methodological shortcomings on the other hand which are connected to the assessment of the input of genotoxic and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals such as CP and IF into the aquatic environment. Therefore, we recommend to take measures to reduce the input of CP and IF and other carcinogenic pharmaceuticals. We hope that our manuscript further stimulates the discussion about the human risk assessment for carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.
   CP and IF are carcinogens. With respect to newborn and children, reduction of the emission of CP and IF into effluent and surface water is recommended at least as a precautionary measure. The collection of unused and outdated drugs is a suitable measure. Collection of patients' excreta as a measure of input reduction is not recommended. Data suitable for the assessment of the risk for newborn and children should be collected in order to perform a risk assessment for these groups. This can stimulate discussion and give new insights into risk assessment for pharmaceuticals in the environment. Our study showed that in the long term, effective risk management for the reduction of the input of CP and IF are recommendable.

AB The fate of beta blockers (atenolol, acebutolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, and sotalol) was studied in surface water-sediment systems. A new analytical method was developed to determine the beta blockers; in sediments by LC-ESI-tandem MS detection. The relative recoveries in sediments ranged from 89 +/- 7% (acebutolol) to 102 +/- 3% (nadolol) using deuterated surrogate standards. Beta blockers were present with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in the sediments of small German streams containing an elevated percentage of treated wastewater. Biotransformation studies and sorption isotherms of the beta blockers; were performed with two natural river sediments ("Burgen", "Dausenau") differing in organic carbon content and particle size distribution. Biotransformation of beta blockers in the surface water-sediment systems exhibited a low to high persistence with 90% disappearance (DT90) ranging from 0.4-10 d (pindolol, atenolol) to > 100 d (sotalol, propranolol or celiprolol). For sorption studies neither NaN3 addition nor autoclavation led to a complete mass balance of the beta blockers, probably due to biotransformation. Isotherms at 6 h (apparent equilibrium, measuring aqueous and sediment phase) fitted by the Freundlich equation show that sorption of all beta blockers to the Burgen sediment were linear or close to it (i.e., n-values between 0.93 and 1.13), while in the Dausenau sediment the sorptions were slightly non linear (i.e., n-values 0.77-0.91). In river water the sorbed fraction is negligible in comparison to the dissolved fraction. Nevertheless, beta blockers can be detected with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in sediments of small streams containing more than 50% treated wastewater.

AB Using monoclonal antibodies labeled with EU3+ chelates, time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) methods were developed for the determination of trace sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and sulfadiazine (SDZ) in environmental waters. Under the optimized conditions, the developed methods offered (i) low detection limits (9.8 ng/L SMZ, 6.1 ng/L SMX, and 5.4 ng/L SDZ, based on 90% inhibition) which were about I order of magnitude lower than that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), (ii) high selectivity with no cross-reactivity (<0.05%) to similarly structured sulfonamides; (iii) high tolerance to variation of the sample pH (6.0-9.0) and salinity (0-100 mM), as well as the presence of humic acid (0-100 mg/L DOC) and heavy metals (0-1 mg/L concentration each of Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and As(V)) in the samples, and (iv) direct determination with low cost high sample throughput, and low sample consumption (50-100 mu L). The proposed TRFIA procedures were applied to determine sulfonamides in a variety of surface water and wastewater samples without sample pretreatment other than filtration. The satisfactory recoveries (64-127%) and reproducibilities (CV = 0.2-16%) achieved, as well as the good agreement with those given by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and ELISA methods, demonstrated the applicability of the proposed TRFIA methods for routine screening/quantification of sulfonamides in environmental waters.

AB During onsite wastewater treatment, trace organic compounds are often present in the effluents applied to subsurface soils for advanced treatment during vadose zone percolation and groundwater recharge. The fate of the endocrine-disrupting surfactant metabolites 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxylate (NP1EO), and 4-nonylphenolmonoethoxycarboxylate (NP1EC), metal-chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilotri acetic acid (NTA), antimicrobial agent triclosan, stimulant caffeine, and antibiotic sulfamethoxazole during transport through an unsaturated sandy loam soil was studied at a field-scale test site. To assess the effects of effluent quality and hydraulic loading rate (HLR) on compound fate in the soil profile, two effluents (septic tank or textile biofilter) were applied at two design HLRs (2 or 8 cm/d). Chemical concentrations were determined in the two effluents and soil pore water at 60, 120, and 240 cm below the soil infiltrative surface. Concentrations of trace organic compounds in septic tank effluent were reduced by more than 90% during transport through 240 cm (often within 60 cm) of soil, likely due to sorption and biotransformation. However, the concentration of NP increased with depth in the shallow soil profile. Additional treatment of anaerobic septic tank effluent with an aerobic textile biofilter reduced effluent concentrations of many compounds, but generally did not affect any changes in pore water concentrations. The soil profile receiving septic tank effluent (vs. textile biofilter effluent) generally had greater percent removal efficiencies. EDTA, NP, NP I EC, and sulfamethoxazole were measured in soil pore water, indicating the ability of some trace organic compounds to reach shallow groundwater. Risk is highly dependent on the degree of further treatment in the saturated zone and the types and proximity of uses for the receiving groundwater environment. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Plant growth and productivity under abiotic stresses such as water shortage or pollution are major problems which currently worry scientists in the field of food production and plant health. Since the intensification of livestock production with its associated increased demand for fodder has encouraged farmers to rely more heavily on chemical fertilizers, very often, municipal waste and wastewater sludge is considered a possible source of plant nutrients, although it might carry a significant amount of anthropogeneous pollutants. The extent to which plants react to drought, as well as how pollutants are taken up or how they act on plants, might depend on rhizosphere processes such as mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, it seemed timely to investigate plant defense reactions in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) toward a possible dangerous sewage sludge pollutant under the influence of drought.
   This study was done with mycorrhizal plants (+AMF) and non-mycorrhizal plants (-AMF) under conditions of water shortage and certain supplements of pharmaceutics. Plant water relations, activity of plant detoxification enzymes, and phylogeny of root mycorrhization were surveyed to investigate beneficial aspects of AMF symbiosis. Plants were exposed to certain drought phases and watered with tap water containing the pharmaceutical paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a model xenobiotic with environmental relevance. Enzymes of interest for the present study were catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Assays followed published methods. GST spectrophotometric assays included model substrates 1-chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzoyl-chloride.
   Our observations indicate H2O2 accumulation in roots of AMF plants and concomitant increases of catalase activities. Enzyme activities were lower in AMF plants even after exposure to both drought stress and paracetamol. AMF symbiosis seems a strategy to influence plant water tolerance and stress enzymes. Catalase activity seemed to be exhausted at the end of 56 days of drought treatment and pharmaceutics incubation, as indicated by high H2O2 levels at the end of the experiment. GST reactions differed between drought or paracetamol-stressed plants. A combination of both stressors resulted in lowered GST activities. Both catalase and GST activities decreased in the presence of paracetamol in the AMF roots after drought treatment. When soil water contents declined, AMF symbiosis supported leaf water content and production of biomass. During dry cycles, AMF roots achieved lower activities of cytosolic GST than that as compared to non-mycorrhizal roots. However, under drought and pharmaceutics supplements, water relations of mycorrhizal plants were more balanced than in non-mycorrhizal plants. In addition, roots showed an enhanced mycorrhization rate in those circumstances.
   We propose that the adjustment of CAT and GST activities in mycorrhizal roots under drought and xenobiotics might be caused by a decreased oxidative damage to rhizosphere because AMF plants had consistently better plant water relations and biomass production. Additional drought avoidance mechanisms indicated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis might also contribute to the lower oxidative stress in mycorrhizal plants. Since the role of mycorrhiza in the fate of organic pollutants has not yet been understood, further ecotoxicological studies in mycorrhizosphere needs to be achieved as cooperation between plant-microbe specialists and ecotoxicologists.

AB The residue levels of selected fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides and tetracyclines in 143 animal dung samples collected in 2007 from large-scale livestock and poultry feedlots in 8 provinces were determined by using ultrasonic extraction and liquid chromatography. Recoveries from spiked pig dung samples (spike level = 1 mg/kg) ranged from 73.9 to 102.0% for fluoroquinolones, from 81.6 to 923% for sulfonamides. and from 57.2 to 72.6% for tetracyclines. Relative standard deviations of the recoveries were less than 10% within the same day. Method quantification limits were measured from 0.031 to 0.150 mg/kg for fluoroquinolones, from 0.023 to 0.082 mg/kg for sulfonamides, and 0.091 to 0.182 mg/kg for tetracyclines in spiked pig manure samples. Analysis of 61 pig, 54 chicken and 28 cow dung samples collected in China revealed that in pig and cow dung, up to 33.98 and 29.59 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, 33.26 and 46.70 mg/kg enrofloxacin, 59.06 and 59.59 mg/kg oxytetracycline, and 21.06 and 27.59 mg/kg chlortetracycline could be detected, respectively. A maximum concentration of 99.43 mg/kg fleroxacin, 225.45 mg/kg norfloxacin, 45.59 mg/kg ciprofloxacin and 1420.76 mg/kg enrofloxacin could be detected in chicken dung. No appreciable sulfonamide antibiotic concentrations (less than 10 mg/kg) were found in any animal dung, and only sulfadimidine was observed, at a maximum concentration of 6.04 mg/kg, in chicken dung. Both enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline were detected with a very high occurrence in three animal manure samples. The residue levels for most antibiotics showed significant statistical differences among the sampling districts and the animal species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this work was to investigate the occurrence of emerging contaminants in drinking water of the city of Campinas, Brazil. Tap water samples were analyzed using SPE-GC-MS for 11 contaminants of recent environmental concern. Six emerging contaminants (stigmasterol, cholesterol, bisphenol A, caffeine, estrone, and 17 beta-estradiol) were found in the samples. The latter two were detected only during the dry season, with concentrations below quantification limits. Stigmasterol showed the highest average concentration (0.34 +/- 0.13 A mu g L-1), followed by cholesterol (0.27 A +/- 0.07 A mu g L-1), caffeine (0.22 A +/- 0.06 A mu g L-1), and bisphenol A (0.16 A +/- 0.03 A mu g L-1). In Campinas, where surface drinking water supplies receive large amounts of raw sewage inputs, the emerging contaminants levels in drinking waters were higher than median values compiled for drinking and finished water samples around the world.

AB Exposure to micropollutants can pose a serious risk to both the environment and human health. Although sewage treatment works (STWs) aim to reduce levels of pollutants in municipal wastewater discharges, they have become a significant point source of dangerous substances to the aquatic environment. With increasing regulation on pollution prevention, it has become essential to assess STW source inputs in order to control pollutant discharge into the environment. This paper has therefore focussed on developing calculations to estimate micropollutant levels in STW influents. The analysis was carried out using information from published literature, the Water Industry, and monitored influent data. Results demonstrated that, where monitoring data were available for metals and organic pollutants, STW influent could be adequately estimated and validated, with accuracy between 77% and 100%. In addition, based on these calculations and using data for over 600 STWs in England, our analysis showed that compounds such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, lead and linear alkylbenzenesulfonate could reach influent levels that could be challenging for conventional wastewater treatment removal.

AB This study focused on the occurrence and fate of four beta-blockers (atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol) in wastewater and surface water. Measured concentrations were compared with predicted concentrations using an implementation of the geo-referenced model GREAT-ER for the Glatt Valley Watershed (Switzerland). Particularly, the question was addressed how measured and simulated data could complement each other for the exposure assessment of human pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants entering surface water through wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).
   Concentrations in the Glatt River ranged from < LOQ to 83 ng L-1 with the highest concentrations found for atenolol. Higher loads were measured on days with combined sewer over-flow events during high flow conditions.
   GREAT-ER was able to predict spatially resolved river concentrations based, on average consumption and excretion data, removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and dissipation and degradation processes in surface water within a factor of 2. These results indicate that modelling might be sufficient to estimate daily average exposure concentrations for compounds that are either recalcitrant or whose degradation and sorption behaviour can be predicted with confidence based on laboratory experiments. Chemical measurements, in contrast, should be reserved for assessing point sources, investigating mechanisms which lead to short-term temporal fluctuations in compound loads, and deter-mining in-situ degradation rates in conjunction with modelling.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are co-introduced into the environment by irrigation with reclaimed wastewater and/or application of biosolids. In this study, we evaluate the role and mechanism of interaction of the pharmaceuticals naproxen and carbamazepine with structural fractions of biosolids-derived DOM. Sorption interactions were estimated from dialysis-bag experiments at different pHs.
   Sorption of naproxen and carbamazepine by the hydrophobic acid fraction exhibited strong pH-dependence. With both pharmaceuticals, the highest sorption coefficients (K-DOC) were at pH 4. With the hydrophobic neutral fraction, pH affected only naproxen sorption (decreasing with increasing pH). Among the hydrophilic DOM fractions, the hydrophilic acid fraction exhibited the highest K-DOC value for carbamazepine, probably due to their bipolar character. In the hydrophilic acid fraction-naproxen system, significant anionic repulsion was observed with increasing pH. The hydrophilic base fraction contains positively charged functional groups. Therefore with increasing ionization of naproxen (with increasing pH), K-DOC to this fraction increased. The hydrophilic neutral fraction exhibited the lowest K-DOC with both studied pharmaceuticals.
   The K-DOC value of carbamazepine with the bulk DOM sample was higher than the calculated K-DOC value based on sorption by the individual isolated fractions. The opposite trend was observed with naproxen at pH 8: the calculated K-DOC value was higher than the value obtained for the bulk DOM. These results demonstrate that DOM fractions interact with each other and do not act as separate sorption domains. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most conventional wastewater treatment plants hardly remove micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. Here the ability of a submerged nanofiltration flat sheet module to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater is analyzed. The nanofiltration membrane was used at the relatively low pressure of only 0.7 bar; at such low pressure, the membrane does not retain salts to a great extent. This is advantageous in wastewater treatment because no salt concentrate is produced. Carbamazepine was retained only slightly by the nanofiltration membranes, whereas diclofenac was retained by approximately 65%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) nowadays attract serious attention for the treatment of municipal wastewater, due to recent technical innovations and drastic cost reductions of the employed membranes. Especially the high biomass concentrations and long sludge retention times are favorable for the biodegradation of organic pollutants, resulting in high rate treatment systems. These characteristic features of MBR technology are not merely advantageous for organic matter removal, but also likely promote a higher biodegradation efficiency of refractory organic pollutants. The increasing concern about the potential accumulation of micro-pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the aquatic environment triggered many investigations into their biological degradation or fate in wastewater treatment systems. in this work a short overview is presented on the current knowledge of removal of pharmaceuticals in MBRs compared to their removal in conventional activated sludge treatment system. In general, for slowly degradable pharmaceuticals the removal in MBRs is better due to the relatively long sludge ages, which leads to the development of distinct microbial communities in MBRs compared to activated sludge plants. Nevertheless, from the literature results it could not be concluded that pharmaceutical removal in MBR reactors is better as many other factors have been indicated that may affect biodegradation rates, which are not directly related to the reactor configuration.

ID REUSE
AB Treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a real challenge for wastewater engineers. In this study, a pilot-scale system including an external loop airlift membrane bioreactor (ELAMBR) was applied for treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater. The performance of this system was evaluated in removal of acetaminophen as the main pollutant of a pharmaceutical wastewater. A conventional activated sludge (CAS process) laboratory system was used in parallel with this system to compare both systems in regard to their ability for acetaminophen removal. The performance of the ELAMBR system was monitored for approximately one month to investigate the long-term operational stability of the system and possible effects of solids retention time on the efficiency of removal of acetaminophen. The removal efficiency was significantly higher in the ELAMBR system than the CAS process. 100% of the acetaminophen was removed after 2 days in this system. The results also showed that initial concentration of acetaminophen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) are the most effective parameters in removal of a pollutant such as acetaminophen. This study demonstrates the usefulness of ELAMBR system for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with the advantages such as: (i) simple operation and maintenance, (ii) efficient removal of pharmaceutical pollutant and COD and (iii) low-energy consumption.

AB We present a process model that predicts the removal of the antibiotic micropollutants, sulfa methoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TCY), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), in an activated sludge treatment system. A novel method was developed to solve the inverse problem of inferring process rate, sorption, and correction factor parameter values from batch experimental results obtained under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Instead of spiking the batch reactors with reference substances, measurements were made using the xenobiotic organic micropollutant content of preclarified municipal sewage. Parent compound formation and removal were observed, and the model developed using the simulation software West showed limited efficiency to describe the selected micropollutants profiles, when growth substrate removal occurs. The model structure was optimized by accounting for competitive inhibition by readily biodegradable substrates on the cometabolic micropollutant biotransformation processes. Our results suggest that underanoxic conditions, hydrophobicity-independent mechanisms can significantly impact solid-liquid partitioning that our model takes into account by using the sorption coefficient as a lumped parameter. Forward dynamic simulations were carried out to evaluate the developed model and to confirm it for SMX using data obtained in a full-scale treatment plant. Evaluation of measured and simulation results suggest that, robust model prediction can be achieved by approximating the influent load of chemicals biodegrading via a given parent compound, e.g., human conjugates, as an antibiotic mass that is proportional to the parent compound load.

AB Pharmaceuticals are "emerging contaminants" in the environment, which have received increasing attention in recent years, in part, because these compounds are constantly being emitted into the environment in quantities similar to other organic contaminants, and thus may be candidates for future regulation. This paper reviews recently published data with respect to sample-preparation techniques for determining pharmaceutical traces in various different environmental matrices using liquid chromatography. An overview of multi-residue analytical methods, covering sample extraction and purification as well as chromatographic separation and various different detection methods is provided to illustrate common trends and method variability. Additionally, recent developments and advances in this field are presented.

AB Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been detected in the environment in the range of ng L-1-mu g L-1 due to its low degradability in some wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the use of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor to effectively degrade ketoprofen in a defined liquid medium was assessed. The fungus eliminated ketoprofen to nondetectable levels in 24 h when it was added at 10 mg L-1 whereas at low concentration of 40 mu g L-1 it was almost completely removed (95%) after 5 h. Low extracellular laccase activity was detected in the T. versicolor cultures but the addition of the laccase-mediator system did not lead to ketoprofen oxidation. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole reduced ketoprofen oxidation. These data suggest that the first oxidation step is cytochrome P450 mediated. During time-course degradation experiments, three intermediates were structurally elucidated and quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS and NMR: 2-[3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid, 2-[(3-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid, and 2-(3-benzoyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid. The latter was reported for the first time in biological systems. After 7 d of incubation, only small amounts of 2-[(3-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid (0.08 mg) remained in the liquid medium in comparison with the initial ketoprofen dose (1.0 mg), suggesting possible mineralization of ketoprofen.

AB Extensive and intense human activity has altered the balance of ecosystems to the detriment of the natural environment. Human migration has occurred throughout history. The movement of people, capital, goods, and services has caused different ecosystem changes, including deforestation. Coastal urbanization is a challenge for conservation, as people moving away from rural and protected areas has increased per capita demand for energy, goods, and services. Nowadays, most people migrate either temporarily or permanently to tropical coastal tourist areas. In the Yucatan Peninsula, migration has been taking place since the 1970s, with differing environmental impacts. The tourists are increasing every year, which demanding ecotourism facilities and industrial development increases to support population and business activities. Coastal water quality is also affected by increasing tourism development. Environmental awareness is lagging as efficient waste treatment systems are lacking. The water quality of the aquifer and the coast are threatened. This area has no rivers because of its karst geomorphology, the coastal freshwater comes from springs or seeps, and aquifers are the only freshwater source. Domestic garbage and wastewater are the main sources of pollution. The Yucatan Peninsula coast is undoubtedly an important economic resource for Mexico, which requires the implementation of integrated coastal management, keeping in mind that continental human activities have a direct impact into coastal environment. It is unquestionable that successful coastal management of ecotourism must be implemented on the basis of efficient waste treatment, which requires more in-depth knowledge of the area. There should be permanent water quality monitoring programs, as well as long-term studies on the oceanographic and biogeochemical processes that control water quality dynamics, which are probably driven by stochastic events and by probable climate change. These factors will also complicate both conservation and migration flows. Also, this will involve fostering agreements among people, industrialists, and government to execute preventive and corrective actions. Water quality conservation is important for two reasons: first, for the preservation of coastal water quality and the beautiful scenery for ecotourism; and second, for freshwater quality protection. Taking action will contribute to the sustainable development of this region of Mexico.

AB In a long term study, which covered 4 sampling periods over three years, a total number of 84 samples, specifically 28 influent, effluent, from seven WWTP located in the main cities along the Ebro river Basin (North East of Spain), as well as receiving river waters, were analyzed to assess the occurrence of 73 pharmaceuticals covering several medicinal classes. Results indicated that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in the aquatic environmental. Linking the calculation of removal rates with half-lives, assuming that compound degradation followed pseudo-first order kinetics, suggested that conventional wastewater treatments applied at the seven WWTP were unable to completely remove most of the pharmaceuticals under study. The evaluation of compound degradability, in terms of half-lives, is an important task to discuss integrated solutions for mitigation of pollutants entry into the water cycle. High half-lives observed for the majority of pharmaceuticals in WWTP suggest that, in order to enhance compound degradation, higher hydraulic retention times should be required. The wide spectrum of substances detected in receiving river waters indicates that WWTP outlets are major contributors of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. However, municipal wastewater treatment represents an obligatory and final treatment step prior to their release into the aquatic media, since load of pharmaceuticals in outlets were considerably reduced after treatment.
   Finally, hazard posed by pharmaceuticals in both surface and effluent wastewaters Was assessed toward different aquatic organisms, (algae, daphnids and fish). The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be algae > daphnia > fish. Results indicate that no significant risks could be associated to the presence of pharmaceuticals in those matrices, indicating that reduction of compound concentration after wastewater treatment as well as dilution factor once pharmaceuticals are discharged in receiving river water efficiently mitigate possible environmental hazards.

AB Drugs of abuse and their metabolites have been recently recognized as environmental emerging organic contaminants. Assessment of their concentration in different environmental compartments is essential to evaluate their potential ecotoxicological effects. It also constitutes an indirect tool to estimate drug abuse by the population at the community level. The present work reports for the first time the occurrence of drugs of abuse and metabolites residues along the Ebro River basin (NE Spain) and also evaluates the contribution of sewage treatment plants (STPs) effluents to the presence of these chemicals in natural surface waters. Concentrations measured in influent sewage waters were used to back calculate drug usage at the community level in the main urban areas of the investigated river basin.
   The most ubiquitous and abundant compounds in the studied aqueous matrices were cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ephedrine and ecstasy. Lysergic compounds, heroin, its metabolite 6-monoacetyl morphine, and Delta(9)-tetradhydrocannabinol were the substances less frequently detected. Overall, total levels of the studied illicit drugs and metabolites observed in surface water (in the low ng/L range) were one and two orders of magnitude lower than those determined in effluent (in the ng/L range) and influent sewage water (mu g/L range), respectively. The investigated STPs showed overall removal efficiencies between 45 and 95%. Some compounds, such as cocaine and amphetamine, were very efficiently eliminated (> 90%) whereas others, such as ecstasy, methamphetamine, nor-LSD, and THC-COOH where occasionally not eliminated at all. Drug consumption estimates pointed out cocaine as the most abused drug, followed by cannabis, amphetamine, heroin, ecstasy and methamphetamine, which slightly differs from national official estimates (cannabis, followed by cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamine and heroin). Extrapolation of the consumption data obtained for the studied area to Spain points out a total annual consumption of drugs of abuse of the order of 36 tonnes, which would translate into 1100 million Euros in the black market.

The method developed will serve as a model for screening for the presence of other non-steroidal pharmaceutical compounds and their Phase II metabolites in wastewater. Acetaminophen glucuronide was not present in the wastewater influent tested to verify the analytical protocol, whereas concentrations of acetaminophen and acetaminophen sulfate in the influent were reproducible over time. A Phase I metabolite, p-aminophenol, was also determined to occur in the wastewater influent. Concentrations of the analytes-of-interest, detected in effluent samples collected after secondary treatment, but before UV treatment, were highly variable and were undetectable after UV treatment before release to surface water.

AB BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP; Tamiflu) is a prodrug of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and has been developed for the treatment and prevention of both A and B strains of influenza. The recent increase in OP resistance in influenza A virus (H1N1; commonlly called "swine flu") has raised questions about the widespread use of Tamiflu in seasonal epidemics and the potential ecotoxicologic risk associated with its use in the event of a pandemic.
   OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to develop an analytical method for quantitative determination of OC in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and receiving river water, and to investigate the occurrence of OC in STP effluent and river water in Japan during a seasonal flu outbreak.
   METHODS: We developed an analytical method based on solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using this method, we analyzed samples from three sampling campaigns conducted during the 2008-2009 flu season in Kyoto City, Japan.
   RESULTS: The highest concentration of OC detected in STP discharge was 293.3 ng/L from a conventional activated-sludge-based STP; however, we detected only 37.9 ng/L from an advanced STP with ozonation as a tertiary treatment. In the receiving river water samples, we detected 6.6-190.2 ng/L OC, during the peak of the flu season.
   CONCLUSION: OC is present in STP effluent and river water only during the flu season. Ozonation as tertiary treatment in STP will substantially reduce the OC load in STP effluent during an influenza epidemic or pandemic.

AB The high consumption of blood lipid regulators is leading to frequent reports of the occurrence of fibrates in natural streams and wastewater effluents. This paper describes a study undertaken to evaluate the acute toxicity of bezafibrate, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, and fenofibric acid, a metabolite of fenofibrate whose ecotoxicity has not been previously reported.
   The bioassays used were based on Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna, and Anabaena CPB4337 tests. Anabaena CPB4337 is a novel bioassay based on Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 strain CPB4337 bearing in the chromosome a Tn5 derivative with luxCDABE from the luminescent terrestrial bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.
   The higher toxicity corresponded to fenofibric acid, with EC50 as low as 1.72 mg/l for V. fischeri. Gemfibrozil was also toxic for Anabaena sp. with EC50 of 4.42 mg/l. The study reports the results from toxicity tests using fortified real wastewater samples taken from the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater itself was found to be very toxic to Anabaena CPB4337 (84% of bioluminescence inhibition) whereas it did not have any negative effect on D. magna or V. fischeri. On the contrary, V. fischeri luminescence exhibited a stimulatory effect in wastewater.
   Except for fenofibric acid, the Anabaena bioassay was more sensitive than the D. magna and V. fischeri bioassays to bezafibrate, clofibric acid, and gemfibrozil. For the three toxicity tests, fortification resulted in lower measured toxicity for the four compounds, probably indicating a reduced bioavailability due to the interaction with other chemicals in the wastewater or with particulate matter. The observed decrease in toxicity associated to the use of a wastewater matrix was higher for the more hydrophobic compounds reaching one order of magnitude for bezafibrate and gemfibrozil.
   The Anabaena CPB4337 bioassay revealed a certain risk associated with the three less toxic compounds tested. Based on V. fischeri and D. magna bioassays, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil would have been considered non-toxic and harmful, respectively. The use of EC50 data measured in wastewater increases the risk estimation.
   Cyanobacteria, as primary producers with a key role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, are a substantial component of the microbial food webs. Any detrimental effect on this group may have a negative impact in nutrient availability to organisms of higher trophic levels and should be considered in ecotoxicity assessment tests.

ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; METABOLITES; WATER; DEGRADATION
AB The European Medicines Agency guideline for the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products provides a step-by-step phased approach to evaluate the potential risks of new medicines to the environment Phase I ("prescreen") estimates the initial exposure of the new medicine in the environment. Phase II A ("screen") estimates the fate and effects in the environment The fate screen determines the inherent properties of the new medicinal active ingredient to sorb to sludge, soil, and sediment matrices and its potential to degrade in a sewage treatment plant and in the subsequent water-sediment compartment Current ERA Guidance (2006) recommends the OECD 301B Ready Biodegradation Test for Phase II Tier A testing without a clear recommendation for Phase II Tier B testing when further refinement may be needed. With the recent approval of the OECD 314B method for activated sludge, there is now an alternative test method that may be better suited for Phase II Tier A testing and to the data needs of the ERA. As a batch test, it fits the needs of a Tier A screen. It is not designed to simulate the operational steps of a sewage treatment plant such as the OECD 303 tests, and yet provides the following without considerable costs or resources of OECD 303: (1) useful kinetic information in a test that reflects the conditions of the sewage-treatment environment i.e., realistic biomass solids concentrations and low level test material concentrations to simulate first-order (nongrowth) kinetics, (2) mass balance analysis for CO(2) evolution and for residues found in mixed liquor, (3) use of an abiotic control to assess losses other than those attributed to biotic biodegradation, and (4) biotransformation profile of degradants. This paper presents the results of OECD 301B with that of OECD 314B for activated sludge biodegradation for five Pfizer drug substances. The use of this new method as an alternative to OECD 301B would strengthen the fate testing screen in Phase II Tier A of the EMEA ERA. It would provide a characterization of a substance's potential for biotransformation and mineralization during sewage treatment and provide a means for revising predicted environmental concentration of surface water for amount removed during sewage treatment.

AB The photolysis of the antibiotic sulphamethoxazole (SMX) using a low pressure ultraviolet (UV) lamp with emission of monochromatic wavelength at 254 nm was evaluated in Milli-Q water and the effluent from a real sewage treatment plant (STP). The effects of various parameters including initial SMX concentration, solution pH, a variety of inorganic anions (Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), NO(3)(-) and HCO(3)(-)) and humic acid (HA) have been assessed. The results showed that 10 mg L(-1) of SMX was removed within 30 min of irradiation in Milli-Q water. The removal of SMX fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model with the rate constants in the range of 0.170 to 0.932 min(-1) for initial SMX concentrations of 1.0 to 10 mg L(-1). Solution pHs of 2.0-5.5 were more favourable for SMX degradation, compared with caustic conditions. On the other hand, slight improvements in SMX degradation in water matrixes with Cl(-), SO(4)(2-) and NO(3)(-) anions at 1.0 mM concentration and HA (when used at 5 mg L(-1)) were observed. However, HCO(3)(-) (used at 1.0 mM) and HA (when used at concentrations of 20, 50 and 100 mg L(-1)) slowed down the degradation rate. The complete degradation of SMX was almost achieved in STP effluent spiked with 10 mg L(-1) of SMX after 60 min of irradiation, and the rate constants showed that the turbidity in STP effluent had no significant adverse effect on SMX removal. Total organic carbon was hardly changed even after 8 h of irradiation, showing negligible mineralization of its intermediates under UV(254) irradiation.

AB Molybdenum-doped TiO2 organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles were synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions by in situ surface modification using n-butylamine. This was carried out at 150 degrees C at autogeneous pressure over 18 h. n-Butylamine was selected as a surfactant since it produced nanoparticles of the desired size and shape. The products were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, dynamic light-scattering spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Chemical oxygen demand was estimated in order to determine the photodegradation efficiency of the molybdenum-doped TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles in the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents. It was found that molybdenum-doped TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles showed higher photocatalytic efficiency than untreated TiO2 nanoparticles.

AB Antidepressants are a widely prescribed group of pharmaceuticals that can be biotransformed in humans to biologically active metabolites. In the present study, the distribution of six antidepressants (venlafaxine, bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and paroxetine) and five of their metabolites was determined in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and at sites downstream of two WWTPs in the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) caged in the Grand River downstream of a WWTP were also evaluated for accumulated antidepressants. Finally, drinking water was analyzed from a treatment plant that takes its water from the Grand River 17 km downstream of a WWTP. In municipal wastewater, the antidepressant compounds present in the highest concentrations (i.e., > 0.5 mu g/L) were venlafaxine and its two demethylation products, O- and N-desmethyl venlafaxine. Removal rates of the target analytes in a WWTP were approximately 40%. These compounds persisted in river water samples collected at sites up to several kilometers downstream of discharges from WWTPs. Venlafaxine, citalopram, and sertraline, and demethylated metabolites were detected in fathead minnows caged 10 m below the discharge from a WWTP, but concentrations were all <7 mu g/kg wet weight. Venlafaxine and bupropion were detected at very low (<0.005 mu g/L) concentrations in untreated drinking water, but these compounds were not detected in treated drinking water. The present study illustrates that data are needed on the distribution in the aquatic environment of both the parent compound and the biologically active metabolites of pharmaceuticals. Environ.

AB Inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE) has been widely used as an environmental biomarker of exposure to organophosphates (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides. However, other chemical compounds, considered to be widespread anthropogenic contaminants, can exert toxic effects through the inhibition of this enzyme's activity. The present work intended to assess the acute effects caused by several pharmaceutical drugs (diazepam, clofibrate and clofibric acid) and two detergents (sodium dodecylsulphate, and benzalkonium chloride) on the soluble ChE activity present in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) total head homogenates. These results showed that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was not responsive to the tested compounds, under the testing conditions. SDS and benzalkonium chloride were not responsible for in vivo inhibition of the enzyme's activity, although contrary results have been published for other models and under distinct circumstances. This fact leads to an evaluation of this enzyme's role in modern bio-monitoring schemes for the assessment of anthropogenic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and detergents.

AB A multi-residue HPLC/UV/Fluorescence method was developed for a screening of the most consumed pharmaceuticals (methotrexate, caffeine, diclofenac, glimepiride, ibuprofen) in Jordan. The analytes were identified (mu g/L concentrations) in wastewater, and identification was confirmed using spiked samples. The separation was done on a RP-C-8 column at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min using H2O/ acetonitrile (1/1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent. Aliquots (200 ml of each sample) were extracted and cleaned-up using C18 cartridges (500 mg). Wastewater samples were gathered from three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Amman/Jordan and two hospital outer drains, and maximum concentrations for methotrexate, caffeine, glimepiride, ibuprofen and diclofenac were found to be 699, 1187, 90, 66 and 65 mu g/L.
   There are differences in the efficiency of removing the studied pharmaceuticals from STPs. This could be referred to the different treatment systems, the nature and the concentration of the drugs in wastewater. In this work, the % removal efficiency of the studied drugs was found to range between 25-100%.

AB This chapter describes the development and use of a geographic information system (GIS) in an environmental health investigation of the application of Class B biosolids (sewage sludge) on agricultural fields. The research project is broad-based including field observations and modeling to investigate the presence of microorganisms, metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in biosolids applied agricultural fields and the associated runoff. These data has been linked with remote sensing imagery and added to GIS layers for Wood, Lucas and Greene Counties in Ohio. Specifically, this project describes the way in which a GIS was developed and utilized with a mailed, epidemiological health survey to investigate the potential impact of biosolids application to agricultural fields in relation to self-reported human health symptoms, acute diseases and chronic diseases among groups of individuals living specified distances from fields where biosolids were permitted and applied. For Wood County, of the 24 symptoms in the survey, six were statistically higher near biosolids permitted fields and of the 29 diseases in the survey, five were statistically higher near biosolids permitted fields. The Lucas and Greene County surveys are still being analyzed. Our future work includes refinement of the spatial analysis and health survey to include the application of biosolids and the constituents of the biosolids to fields, distances to any farm field and to other potential relationships to health effects.

AB Nano-functionalized products such as UV protective paints additives, antimicrobial food packaging, and fuel additives offering reduced CO2 emissions have the potential to secure a significant Irish market share in the near future. This scoping study gives a first estimation of nanomaterial surface water concentrations and population ingestional exposure through drinking water resulting from these products. As nanomaterial behavior in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs) is currently unclear, bridging data relating to potentially relevant materials (pharmaceuticals and metal removal efficiencies in WWTPs; pathogen removal efficiencies in WTPs) are employed in this study. Mean nanomaterial removal efficiencies of 59.8% and 70.2% were predicted for Irish WWTPs, between 96.95% and 0% for Irish WTPs. Predicted nano-scale TiO2 concentrations in surface waters (resulting from exterior paints) were 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of Ag (resulting from food packaging) and CeO2 (resulting from fuel additives), respectively. Predicted surface and drinking water concentrations were unlikely to pose any ecotoxicological or human health risk, although nano-scale TiO2 and Ag may warrant monitoring as part of standard surface water monitoring schemes. Future research should be directed toward characterizing the behavior of different categories of nanomaterials within WWTP processes.

AB Many human pharmaceuticals, with many modes of action, are present in the aquatic environment. It is very difficult to know which of these might pose a threat to aquatic organisms, and which are of no environmental concern. Hence, it is difficult to design a research strategy that most effectively maximizes the possibility of identifying those pharmaceuticals that do pose the greatest risk. We consider that steroidal pharmaceuticals, and drugs that inhibit the actions of endogenous steroids, merit more research than they have yet received so far. We analyzed a comprehensive U.K. database covering all prescriptions of pharmaceuticals to determine the annual usage of all steroid and anti-steroid pharmaceuticals. We found that both progestogens and glucocorticoids are used in much greater amounts than estrogens, whereas androgens are used in similar amounts to estrogens. There is also very significant use of anti-estrogens, anti-androgens, and anti-mineralocorticoids. All these pharmaceuticals are likely to be constantly entering the aquatic environment in effluents from sewage treatment works. River concentrations of these pharmaceuticals will be very low; probably in the ng or sub-ng/l range. However, such low concentrations mat still pose a threat to aquatic organisms, especially fish.

AB An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of the four most detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in wastewater, namely ibuprofen (IBF), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DFC) and ketoprofen (KFN), was developed based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Extraction from wastewater samples was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges, while meclofenamic acid (MFC) was used as surrogate. The optimisation of SPE procedure included the type of the extraction solvent used for the elution and the pH of the loading solution (acidic or neutral). The developed extraction procedure resulted in good repeatability and reproducibility with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 10% for all the compounds. Moreover, satisfactory recoveries (>98%) were obtained. Chromatographic analysis was achieved after derivatisation with bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1% trimethyl chlorosilane (TMCS) in the presence of pyridine, a derivatisation mixture used for the first time for these compounds. The limits of detection (LODs) of the method varied from 0.37 (KFN) to 3.1 ng L-1 (NPX). The analytical method was successfully applied for the determination of these compounds in the raw and treated wastewater of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of the city of Mytilene in Lesvos, Greece. The maximum concentrations were detected in raw wastewater originated from a hospital and they were 574 ng L-1 and 704 ngL(-1) for IBF and KFN, respectively.

AB Over the past decades there has been significant progress in the treatment of sewage and industrial wastewaters in order to minimise discharges of urban effluents with lots of contaminants. Nowadays, the status of contamination of bodies of water continues to be a key task for further environmental management actions. This paper reports the presence of 88 contaminants belonging to several chemical groups (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, disinfectants and pesticides), in river waters of the region of Madrid, one of the more densely populated areas of Spain. Three different monitoring campaigns were performed over a period of seven months. For quality assessment of river water analyses, an analytical protocol was developed employing a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method, followed by two methods based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (two LC-MS systems with ion trap and time-of-flight analysers) in order to carried out the unequivocal detection and quantification of the target contaminants. The method detection limits achieved were in range 0.1-60 ng L-1. Recovery values were higher to 70% for the most of the compounds and only two analytes (amoxicillin and tamoxifen) were not recovered with the SPE method applied. The results obtained during the monitoring campaign were classified in turn into two categories: contaminants in general called 'emergents', and priority substances or candidate pollutants from domestic and industrial activities. This classification allows us to evaluate the impact of both contributions, typically domestic and industrial, on the river waters. At the same time it enables us to get a first idea about the effectiveness of the urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that release the effluents to those rivers in eliminating or removing contaminants. The concentration ranges detected were between 110 and 9942 ng L-1 for emerging contaminants and 1 and 652 ng L-1 for priority or candidate pollutants.

AB In this study, a practicable and effective analytical method based on solid-phase-extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (SPE-LC-FLD) was developed and partially validated for routine analysis of eight FQs in wastewater at the trace level. Different SPE materials, pH conditions and eluents were modified to find an economic and effective SPE conditions. In our work, it is the first time that well-known commercially available SPE sorbent are compared to 'generic' cheap SPE sorbent. Aqueous samples (pH 2-3) were extracted using Anpel MEP cartridges where they were subsequently eluted by 6 mL of 2% formic acid in MeOH. The aqueous extracts were analysed by gradient elution LC-FLD, whose initial mobile phase was composed of ACN and 10 mmol L-1 tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (4/96, v/v, pH 3). The LODs and LOQs of the wastewater were as low as 0.32-2.12 ng L-1 and 1.07-7.07 ng L-1, respectively. The precisions of the overall method (RSD, n = 3) using wastewater were below 10%. The method was used to quantify FQs in influents and effluents of several typical sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Shanghai. The extraction recoveries of 100 mL influent, 500 mL effluent and 500 mL of river water samples were between 88.6 and 102.6%, 79.2 and 109.2%, 80.0 and 105.5% and 87.4 and 99.4%, respectively. FQs of interest except sarafloxacin were identified in the influents, effluents and river waters with concentrations varying from 0.012-1.163 mu g L-1, 0.003-0.291 mu g L-1, and 0.002-0.040 mu g L-1, respectively. The method can serve as a tool to obtain detailed information on occurrence, behaviour and fate of FQs in the aquatic environment. Occurrence of FQs detected in summer is higher than in spring at STPs, and those detected in the suburban area are less than those in the urban area. Complete removal of FQs is not achieved from the STPs, indicating domestic wastewater and STP discharge is the source of FQs in the surface water.

AB Phytoremediation of selected pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen) using Armoracia rusticana and Linum usitatissimum cell cultures and by hydroponically cultivated Lupinus albus, Hordeum vulgaris, and Phragmites australis plants in laboratory conditions is described. During in vitro experiments, the best results for acetaminophen were achieved using Armoracia rusticana hairy root cultures, where 100% of the starting amount was removed from the media during eight days. Total removal of ibuprofen and diclofenac was achieved using a Linum usitatissimum suspension culture after one and six days, respectively. In the hydroponic arrangement, the best results were achieved for Lupinus, where acetaminophen was totally removed from media during two or four days in concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 mM, respectively. The best effectiveness of ibuprofen removal (50% of starting amount) was found in case of Phragmites. Effectiveness of all tested plants for diclofenac removal was low. The best removal was achieved using Phragmites in the case of 0.2 mM concentration67% of the starting amount and Hordeum for 0.1 mM starting concentration, 56%.

AB Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are compounds which interfere with the hormone system and may adversely affect the health and reproduction of man and animals. These compounds comprise heavy metals and organic chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, plasticizers, surfactants, pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic estrogens as well as phyto- and mycoestrogens. In this review, an overview of most frequently asked questions is presented. These questions are: What are the sources of endocrine disruptors we find in the environment? What concentrations do we have in our wastewater? What happens in the wastewater treatment plant? Do we have EDs in other water bodies also? Is drinking water at risk? Why is it so difficult to prove whether EDs are harmful? Could sperm decline and fertility disturbance in man be due to EDs? Could breast cancer be due to exposure to EDs? What are alterations in wildlife and fish? What can be done?.

AB Quantification of organic and microbial pollutant loading is expensive and labor-intensive because collection and analysis of grab samples are needed. Instruments are available, however, for in situ analysis of basic water quality parameters at high temporal resolution. Throughout the late summer and fall of 2008 a two-node water quality monitoring network was deployed to measure turbidity, specific conductance, pH, depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate at high frequencies in two urban streams in the Minneapolis, MN metropolitan area. Grab samples also were collected at 2 h intervals for 22 h during two dry periods and five rain events and analyzed for organic and microbial pollutants. This study investigated the viability of using in situ near real-time sensors to predict fecal coliforms, prometon (a residential herbicide), atrazine (an agricultural herbicide), and caffeine (it wastewater indicator) concentrations. Such Pollutants can be used as indicators of sources that contribute to what is often termed "urban stream syndrome." At one stream, linear correlations were observed between nitrate and caffeine (R-2 = 0.66), turbidity and prometon (R-2 = 0.91), and discharge and prometon (R-2 = 0.92). At another location, caffeine linearly correlated with specific conductance (R-2 = 0.64). A lack of correlation with sensed water quality parameters was also observed with some of the pollutants. When one considers that error is estimated to be as high as 200% when using monthly grab samples to estimate pollutant loading in streams, even moderate correlations, such as the ones found in this study, can provide better loading estimates if frequently sensed parameters can be used for load estimation. Therefore, such site-specific relationships can be used to estimate the loading of specific pollutants in near real-time until robust low-cost technologies to analyze these pollutants in situ become available.

AB Contamination of natural aquatic environments with human-use pharmaceuticals poses a significant potential threat to local ecosystems. However studies of the risk assessment of this contamination are limited, in part because Currently the environmental concentration prediction is logistically and technically difficult to perform. In this study, 1) a strategic method to determine occurrence and risk of pharmaceutical compounds in an aquatic environment is proposed, and 2) this method is applied to study ten human-use pharmaceuticals in Taiwan's Sindian river, which traverses and supplies drinking water for Taipei, a major metropolitan center. In river-water samples collected over a three-week period, concentrations of NSAIDs (acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen), steroids (estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol), the anti-hypertensive agent propranolol, and the lipid regulator gemfibrozil were found at ng/L to mu g/L levels; night-time concentrations were often doubled or even greater, compared to day-time levels. With the exception of the estrogens, predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of the target pharmaceuticals agreed well with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). Conclusions: In the Sindian river, which is impacted by both regional and hospital discharges, the pattern of pharmaceutical Occurrences and concentrations observed here is due to variations in source release rather than to natural attenuation phenomena. In addition, the environmental risk posed by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and the estrogens was observed to be imminent, while risk from the other drugs targeted was found to be lower, even when maximum MECs were considered.

AB Micropollutants occur in natural waters from a range of sources. Estrogenic compounds are naturally excreted by humans and hence stein predominantly from wastewater effluents. Due to their small molecular weight and concentration their effective control is a challenge. In this study magnetic ion exchange(MIEX (R)), which was developed to remove natural organic matter (NOM) from surface water, was investigated for such a micropollutant, estrone. The interaction of estrone with the resin occurs as a side effect when NOM is removed. This interaction results in some degree of removal. However, the accumulation of those hazardous materials on the resin, which can be associated with accidental release, as well Lis the concentration in the regeneration brine of the process, is environmentally more significant. For this reason a thorough investigation of interaction phenomena was undertaken. Estrone and polymeric materials (such as ion exchange resins or membranes) interact through a number of mechanisms including specific and non-specific interactions. Sorption and desorption of estrone were studied as a function of pH, temperature, natural organic matter concentration, sulfate concentration and ionic strength to elucidate possible mechanisms. The results demonstrated that the resin removed around 70% estrone at high pH conditions (>10.4) when estrone was predominantly negatively charged. However, below pH 10.4, when estrone was neutral, approximately 40% of estrone still sorbed due to hydrogen bonding. The optimum temperature for estrone sorption was observed to be in the 15 to 35 degrees C range, while the presence of other anions, including natural organic matter reduced estrone removal due to competition for anion exchange sites. Desorption of estrone was most effective with 2 M NaCl regeneration brine concentration when estrone was negatively charged (98% desorption). However, when estrone was neutral there was no significant difference between 1 M and 2 M NaCl. The results presented in this Study indicate that polar non-ionic micropollutants were removed by magnetic ion exchange resin due to sorption to the resin polymer. This has implications for treatment, however, the accumulation of micropollutants on polymeric materials in water treatment as well as the abundance of such micropollutants in the regeneration brine are risks that warrant monitoring.

AB Accurate quantification of organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) is essential for assessing their removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and for calculating discharge rates into effluent-receiving surface waters. In this study, we undertook a theoretical evaluation of the effect of sorption and sample filtration on data quality. Filtration of samples, while commonly practiced, may preclude a potentially significant fraction of chemical mass from both chemical measurements and mass flow analyses for WWTPs. Sorption theory dictates that analyte losses from sample filtration are notable for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) featuring a pH-dependent logarithmically transformed organic carbon-water distribution coefficient (log D-OC) of >= 3.0. Among a total of 33 organic wastewater compounds considered, the extent of sorption to filterable materials ranged from 22% for bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) to 99% for di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). Sample filtration also was demonstrated to have a profound impact on the outcome of chemical fate and behavior studies. When the chemical mass residing on filterable particulates was considered, the concentration spread ( range) doubled between maximum and minimum concentrations reported for raw wastewater. Furthermore, removal efficiencies of WWTPs calculated for HOCs increased by as much as 62% just by changing the method of accounting. We conclude that some of the data spread reported in the literature concerning chemical mass loadings, contaminant concentrations in raw sewage, and removal efficiencies of similarly designed WWTPs is driven not by actual differences in sewage composition, geographic locations and treatment units but by sample processing protocols and the method of mass accounting.

AB Upon partial degradation of polar organic micropollutants during activated sludge treatment, transformation products (TPs) may be formed that enter the aquatic environment in the treated effluent. However, TPs are rarely considered in prospective environmental risk assessments of wastewater-relevant compound classes such as pharmaceuticals and biocides. Here, we suggest and evaluate a tiered procedure, which includes a fast initial screening step based on high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) and a subsequent confirmatory quantitative analysis, that should facilitate consideration of TPs formed during activated sludge treatment in the exposure assessment of micropollutants. At the first tier, potential biotransformation product structures of seven pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, metoprolol, ranitidine, valsartan, and venlafaxine) and one biocide (carbendazim) were assembled using computer-based biotransformation pathway prediction and known human metabolites. These target structures were screened for in sludge-seeded batch reactors using HR-MS/MS. The 12 TPs found to form in the batch experiments were then searched for in the effluents of two full-scale, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to confirm the environmental representativeness of this first tier. At the second tier, experiments with the same sludge-seeded batch reactors were carried out to acquire kinetic data for major TPs that were then used as input parameters into a cascaded steady-state completely-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model for predicting TP effluent concentrations. Predicted effluent concentrations of four parent compounds and their three major TPs were corroborated by comparison to 3-day average influent and secondary effluent mass flows from one municipal WWTP. CSTR model-predicted secondary effluent mass flows agreed within a factor of two with measured mass flows and confidence intervals of predicted and measured mass flows overlapped in all cases. The observed agreement suggests that the combination of batch-determined transformation kinetics with a simple WWTP model may be suitable for estimating aquatic exposure to TPs formed during activated sludge treatment. Overall, we recommend the tiered procedure as a realistic and cost-effective approach to include consideration of TPs of wastewater-relevant compounds into exposure assessment in the context of prospective chemical risk assessment.

AB Healthcare facilities are an under-characterized source of pharmaceuticals to municipal wastewaters. In this study, the composition and magnitude of sixteen cardiovascular active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and two cardiovascular API metabolites in wastewater effluents from a hospital, nursing care, assisted living, and independent living facility are presented. Each cardiovascular API was detected in at least one facility's wastewater. The hospital's wastewater had the most detected cardiovascular APIs with thirteen of the eighteen measured compounds positively confirmed and quantified. Maximum mean analyte concentrations within each healthcare facility's wastewater were: 11.3 mu g L-1 atenolol for the independent living facility; 8.7 mu g L-1 valsartan for the assisted living facility; 2.7 mu g L-1 diltiazem for the nursing home facility; and 14.6 mu g L-1 valsartan for hospital facility. Daily wastewater flow was combined with individual concentrations to estimate the cardiovascular API mass loadings leaving each facility through wastewater discharges to the municipal sewer system. The estimated daily mass loading of all measured cardiovascular APIs ranged from 0.87 g per day at the assisted living facility to 12.5 g per day at the hospital. The combined loading for all four facilities was 16.2 g per day. This presented research informs the risk management process by providing source characterization data for healthcare facility wastewaters containing commonly prescribed cardiovascular APIs.

AB A lack of knowledge of the health and environmental risks associated with chemicals of concern (COCs) and also of their removal by advanced treatment processes, such as micro-filtration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO), have been major barriers preventing establishment of large water recycling schemes. As part of a larger project monitoring over 300 COCs, iodinated X-ray contrast media compounds (ICM) were analysed in treated secondary wastewater intended for drinking purposes. ICM are the most widely administered intravascular pharmaceuticals and are known to persist in the aquatic environment. A direct injection liquid chromatography tandemmass spectrometry (DI-LC-MS/MS) method was used tomonitor secondary treated wastewater from three major wastewater treatment plants in Perth, Western Australia. In addition, tertiary water treated with MF and RO was analysed from a pilot plant that has been built as a first step in trialling the aquifer recharge. Results collected during 2007 demonstrate that MF/RO treatment is capable of removing ICM to below the analytical limits of detection, with average RO rejection calculated to be greater than 92%. A screening health risk assessment indicated negligible human risk at the concentrations observed in wastewater.

AB Potential health risks derived from wastewater reuse in agriculture have been evaluated with Risk Assessment modelling techniques, in a case study involving the effluents of two Spanish wastewater treatment plants. One of the plants applies primary and secondary treatment, and the other one applies an additional tertiary treatment. Health risks were assessed on the basis of ingesting contaminated food, due to exposure to: (i) 22 chemical pollutants, namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and priority pollutants included in the European Framework Directive, and (ii) microorganisms, namely enterovirus. Chemical Risk Assessment has been carried out following the European Commission's technical guidelines, while risks from exposure to viruses have been evaluated by means of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, assuming a virus to coliform ratio of 1:105. The results of the chemical assessment show that there is a margin of safety above 100 for all substances, with the exception of gemfibrozil, for which the mean margin of safety (MOS) is above 100, but the lower bound of MOS with a 95 % confidence interval lies in the 3-4 range. A MOS under 100 was also found for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in one of the effluents. The assessment of risks from viruses shows a very low probability of infection. The overall results show that risks are lower for the plant applying tertiary treatment, especially concerning microbiological parameters.

AB A multiresidue analytical method was developed for the determination of 9 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 19 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including acidic and neutral pharmaceuticals in water and soil samples using rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS). Solid phase extraction (SPE), and ultrasonic extraction combined with silica gel purification were applied as pretreatment methods for water and soil samples, respectively. The extracts of the EDCs and PPCPs in water and soil samples were then analyzed by RRLC-MS/MS in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode in three independent runs. The chromatographic mobile phases consisted of Milli-Q water and acetonitrile for EDCs and neutral pharmaceuticals, and Milli-Q water containing 0.01% acetic acid (v/v) and acetonitrile: methanol (1: 1, v/v) for acidic pharmaceuticals at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Most of the target compounds exhibited signal suppression due to matrix effects. Measures taken to reduce matrix effects included use of isotope-labeled internal standards, and application of matrix-match calibration curves in the RRLC-MS/MS analyses. The limits of quantitation ranged between 0.15 and 14.08 ng/L for water samples and between 0.06 and 10.64 ng/g for solid samples. The recoveries for the target analytes ranged from 62 to 208% in water samples and 43 to 177% in solid samples, with majority of the target compounds having recoveries ranging between 70-120%. Precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was obtained less than 7.6 and 20.5% for repeatability and reproducibility, respectively. The established method was successfully applied to the water and soil samples from four irrigated plots in Guangzhou. Six compounds namely bisphenol-A, 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, triclocarban, salicylic acid and clofibric acid were detected in the soils.

AB Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to optimize the process parameters for the extraction of chromium from aqueous solution of waste sodium dichromate recovered from the pharmaceutical industry wastewater using emulsion liquid membrane technique. The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, SPAN-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent and trioctylamine as carrier. The process parameters namely, feed concentration, pH, internal reagent concentration and surfactant concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium (VI) were: feed concentration (224.04 ppm), pH (2.76), internal reagent concentration (0.71 N) and surfactant concentration (1.92%, w/w). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 92.50%. (C) 2009 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment results in the chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to complex drug mixtures. We examined the influence of a mixture of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DIC), metoprolol (MET) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)) at environmentally relevant ('env') and artificially high ('high') concentrations on Gammarus fossarum. Different sublethal responses such as moulting, reproduction and the content of the energy-storage component glycogen were analysed. The drug mixture influenced the moulting behaviour of gammarids at both the 'env' and 'high' concentration levels, leading to a discontinuous increase of body length in successive moults, compared with the constant increase of body length in the control treatment. Moreover, the time between successive moults of animals exposed to the 'env' and 'high' pharmaceutical concentrations was decreased because of shortened intermoult periods. We observed no significant impact of the pharmaceuticals on reproduction. In addition, the content of glycogen was not significantly affected by the drug mixture. Permanent exposure of G. fossarum to a wider range of pharmaceuticals in natural aquatic systems may influence moulting behaviour and accompanied life-history parameters, followed by severe ecological consequences as gammarids play an important role in many freshwater ecosystems of the northern hemisphere.

   Contaminants; Water Reuse; Indirect Potable Reuse
AB Ozone is a strong oxidant used to treat a variety of constituents in potable water, wastewater, water reuse, and industrial water treatment applications. Ozone is effective at oxidizing a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds and disinfection. Well-known in potable water treatment, with about 400 US installations and 3,000 worldwide, ozone has limited application at wastewater treatments, with less than 10 operating facilities in the US. The ability of ozone to significantly reduce low level concentrations of trace organic compounds, including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other emerging contaminants have increased interest in applying ozone in potable water and wastewater treatment. Treating at the point source discharge rather than the water supply intake may be more effective. A recent American Water Works Research Foundation (AwwaRF) report indicated high removals of many EDCs and PPCPs at typical disinfection doses. Several wastewater utilities have installed or are in the process of installing ozone to treat secondary effluent. These utilities are using ozone in a variety of ways: as a primary disinfectant, for treatment of microconstituents, and in combination with other processes (e.g. membranes and UV) to produce high-quality water for indirect potable reuse (IPR). The different applications, treatment goals and basis of process selection are compared and contrasted. Secondary benefits of ozone treatment of secondary effluent, including the use of off-gas in biological treatment is also discussed.

AB This work deals with the biodegradability and toxicity of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) treated by ozonation. The results show that the total removal of 200 mg L-1 of diclofenac and 100 mg L-1 of naproxen is possible using an ozone dose of 0.20 and 0.04 g L-1, respectively. For 200 mg L-1 of ibuprofen, 90% removal is achieved using an ozone dose of 2.3 g L-1. The BOD5/COD ratio, the Zahn-Wallens test and EC50 toxicity test (Microtox) are chosen as biological and toxicity indicators of NSAID intermediates. The evolution of BOD5/COD ratio during 1 hour of treatment is evaluated and the results show that ozonation improves the biodegradability for the three NSAID treated solution. The Zahn-Wellens test for diclofenac and ibuprofen solutions shows that biological mineralization, after 28 days, is higher for diclofenac than for ibuprofen solution. According to the Microtox test, the treatment with ozone removes the toxicity of the naproxen solution. Taking into account the results obtained with the biocompatibility tests it could be assumed that ozonation is an adequate treatment for removal NSAID in aquatic medium, and the ozonated effluents could be post-treated in a biological wastewater facility.

AB Removal potential of many EDCs by conventional WWTPs is recognized. Nevertheless, in order to reach very low concentrations, further treatment (e.g., chemical oxidation) might be required. In this work, two estrogen-like substances were considered: nonylphenol (NP) (and its parent compounds) and bisphenol A (BPA). The experimental work was conducted at Verona (Northern Italy) WWTP (370,000 p.e.): the effluent was submitted to ozonation in a pilot scale plant. Beside chemical and microbiological analyses, estrogenic activity measurements were also carried out by means of breast cancer MCF-7 cells transfected with the luminescence luciferase gene. Economic feasibility of tertiary ozonation is finally discussed.

AB Effluent from the Pasakoy Wastewater Treatment Plant was oxidized by using O3 and O3/H2O2. DOC, COD, UV254, total coliform, dissolved ozone and some endocrine disrupting compounds were monitored during oxidation. Results showed that O3 provided superior disinfection, however, lower reductions in DOC, COD and endocrine disrupting compounds were exhibited compared to O3/H2O2. The highest removal efficiency of DOC, COD and endocrine disrupting compounds were achieved at 0.5 molar ratio of O3/H2O2. The benefit of H2O2 addition for advanced oxidation reduced significantly when the mole ratio was increased to 2. Therefore, the mole ratio of H2O2 to O3 is a critical parameter for the design of wastewater oxidation by O3/H2O2.

AB The current study focuses on the occurrence of selected endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products in Lake Huron Water and their removal using ozone/hydrogen peroxide based pre-coagulation, advanced oxidation process (AOP). Raw Lake Huron water spiked with nine target compounds was treated in a dual train pilot scale treatment plant. None of the target chemicals showed any significant removals following conventional treatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration). Five of the nine target pollutants plummeted to concentrations below the method detection limits following AOP. For all the target compounds AOP treatment provided higher removal compared to conventional treatment.

AB The ozonation of two pharmaceutical compounds: the drug diclofenac (DCF) and the synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethynylstradiol (EST), has been studied in laboratory prepared water and domestic wastewater in the presence of perovskite catalysts. In ultrapure water, catalysts do not lead to any improvement on the ozonation rates of DCF and EST which supports the fact that both compounds are removed by direct ozonation. TOC removal, on the other hand, is significantly increased in the presence of perovskite catalysts, especially when copper perovskite is used, with TOC removals in the order of 90% after 120 minutes of reaction. In domestic wastewater the results are similar regarding the mechanism of initial pharmaceutical compounds removal, which are due to direct reactions with ozone that, in this case, develop during longer reaction times likely due to the presence of other contaminants. Then, regarding TOC removal in domestic wastewater, negligible differences between non-catalytic and catalytic ozonation are observed during the first approximately 25 minutes of reaction. For higher reaction time, TOC removal is improved only in the case copper perovskite catalyst is used although percentages of TOC removal are comparatively lower than those reached in ultrapure water (they hardly reach 50% TOC removal). Finally, a kinetic study has been carried out and apparent rate constants of the heterogeneous reaction between ozone and TOC on the catalyst surface have been determined.

Although biological treatment by conventional and membrane bioreactor failed, the advanced oxidation methods using ozone (O3), O3/UV or hydrogen peroxide in combination with UV (H2O2/UV), successfully achieved their complete elimination. Target compounds could be confirmed as permanently present pollutants in Aachen-Soers wastewater in concentrations between 0.006 and 1.9 g L-1 prior to AOP treatment resulting in a complete elimination.

Ozone uptake and ozone steady states along a bubble column have been determined. A modeling procedure has been developed that allows us to describe this behavior and to simulate the degradation of micropollutants. For fast (diclofenac) and moderately fast (bezafibrate) reacting micropollutants this model describes their measured elimination well.

AB The Henares-Jarama-Tajo river system is the largest drainage basin in the Province of Madrid, Spain. This area is characterized by the presence of intensive urban and industrial activities influenced by a continental Mediterranean climate with rainfalls presenting substantial fluctuations along the different seasons. This research aimed to monitor seasonal variations in concentrations of 22 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in this river system and to establish the potential risk of sublethal effects on aquatic organisms. A total of 10 sampling sites were selected along the river system with samples collected in each of the four seasons during a year-round schedule. Most of the PhACs detected were present in sampling sites downstream in the vicinity of the most populated cities (i.e. Madrid, Guadalajara and Alcala de Henares). Only two PhACs, fluoxetine and paraxantine, were detected in all sites regardless of the season, and showed median (+/- interquartile range) concentrations of 21.4 (+/- 31.2) ng L-1 and 8.5 (+/- 5.3) ng L-1, respectively. Other PhACs were detected with a frequency >80% and included, caffeine, diphenylhydantoin, hydrochlorotiazide, ibuprofen, ketoprofen. diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, naproxen, carbamazepine and propanolol. Seasonal variations were observed with the highest concentrations in December and the lowest in September. By combining measured environmental concentrations with toxicity data (either publicly available or obtained experimentally in our laboratory), and by calculating an Maximum Risk Index (MaxRI) that each combination of PhACs should have for non exceeding the risk threshold, a high potential for long-term risk (MaxRI < 10) was estimated for most of the sampling sites and sampling dates. This research allowed the characterization of the potential risk for each of the PhACs to exert sublethal effects on aquatic organisms using acute screening methods, justifying the need for chronic data in order to refine the risk of these compounds to aquatic organisms.

AB The occurrence of 31 selected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in Korean surface waters was investigated. The area was selected since there is a lack of information in the Seoul area on the suspected contamination of rivers by micropollutants, although over 99% of drinking water is produced from surface waters in this area that has a population of approximately 15 million inhabitants. Samples were collected from upstream/downstream and effluent-dominated creeks along the Han River, Seoul (South Korea) and analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). Most target compounds were detected in both the Han River samples (63%) and the effluent-dominated creek samples (79%). lopromide, atenolol, TCPP, TECP, musk ketone, naproxen, DEET, carbamazepine, caffeine, and benzophenone were frequently detected in both river and creek samples, although the mean concentrations in effluent-dominated creek samples (102 ng/L-3745 ng/L) were significantly higher than those in river samples (56 ng/L-1013 ng/L). However, the steroid hormones 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. were not detected (<1 ng/L) in both the river and creek samples. Numerous target compounds (15) were found to be positively correlated (over 0.8) to the conventional water quality parameters (chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, and ultraviolet absorbance). Results of this study provide increasing evidence that certain EDCs and PPCPs commonly occur in the Han River as the result of wastewater outfalls. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Emphasis was given on the effect of various operating conditions such as catalyst type (six commercially available titanium oxide samples were tested) and concentration (50-3000 mg/L), initial drug concentration (5-20 mg/L), solution pH (3-10), the addition of hydrogen peroxide (0.07-1.4 mM), and the matrix (pure water and treated domestic wastewater) on degradation and mineralization. The former was assessed monitoring sample absorbance at each drug's characteristic wavelength, while the latter measuring dissolved organic carbon. The best performance was achieved at lower drug concentrations irradiated by UV-A in the presence of Degussa P25 catalyst and hydrogen peroxide in pure water.

AB The 20 kHz ultrasound-induced degradation of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) was investigated. Several operating conditions, such as power density (25-100 W/L), substrate concentration (2.5-80 mg/L), initial solution pH (3.5-11), liquid bulk temperature and the type of sparging gas (air, oxygen, argon), were tested concerning their effect on DCF degradation (as assessed measuring absorbance at 276 nm) and hydroxyl radicals generation (as assessed measuring H2O2 concentration). Sample mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), aerobic biodegradability (as assessed by the BOD5/COD ratio) and ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna and Artemia salina were followed too.
   DCF conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities and liquid bulk temperatures, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air or oxygen. The reaction rate increases with increasing DCF concentration in the range 2.5-5 mg/L but it remains constant in the range 40-80 mg/L, indicating different kinetic regimes (i.e. first and zero order, respectively). H2O2 production rates in pure water are higher than those in DCF solutions, implying that decomposition basically proceeds through hydroxyl radical reactions. Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than DCF to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable. Toxicity to D. magna increases during the early stages of the reaction and then decreases progressively upon degradation of reaction by-products; nevertheless, complete toxicity elimination cannot be achieved at the conditions in question. Neither the original nor the treated DCF samples are toxic to A. salina. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A finite element model was set-up to determine degradation rate constants for p-TSA during rapid sand filtration (RSF). Data used for the model originated from a column experiment carried out in the filter hall of a drinking water treatment plant in Berlin (Germany). Aerated abstracted groundwater was passed through a 1.6 m long column-shaped experimental sand filter applying infiltration rates from 2 to 6 in h(-1). Model results were fitted to measured profiles and breakthrough curves of p-TSA for different infiltration rates using both first-order reaction kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Both approaches showed that degradation rates varied both in space and time. Higher degradation rates were observed in the upper part of the column, probably related to higher microbial activity in this zone. Measured and simulated breakthrough curves revealed an adaption phase with lower degradation rates after infiltration rates were changed, followed by an adapted phase with more elevated degradation rates. Irrespective of the mathematical approach and the infiltration rate, degradation rates were very high, probably owing to the fact that filter sands have been in operation for decades, receiving high p-TSA concentrations with the raw water.

AB Synthetic musk compounds (SMCs) occur widely in water environments. The aims of this paper were to investigate the occurrence and fate of SMCs in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and surface waters. Total SMC concentrations ranged from 3.69 to 7.33 mu g/L (influent) and from 0.96 to 2.69 mu g/L (effluent) in 10 STPs. The SMC concentrations varied with the input source and treatment volume of each STP. Biological treatment processes had a greater SMCs removal effect than chemical treatment, filtration and disinfection processes. The SMC concentrations in surface waters ranged from 0.15 to 16.72 mu g/L and exhibited similar SMCs occurrence patterns generally. The fate of SMCs in water environments depends on their physical-chemical properties and their concentrations can be predicted from other SMC concentrations due to their similar fates.

AB The degradation of seven acidic drugs and two metabolites during chlorination was investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A triple-quadrupole (QqQ) system was used to follow the time course of the pharmaceuticals and by-products, while a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) system was also used for the identification of the by-products. Under strong chlorination conditions (10 mg/L Cl-2, 24 h), only four of the target compounds were significantly degraded: salicylic acid, naproxen, diclofenac and indomethacine. The degradation kinetics of these four compounds were investigated at different concentrations of chlorine, bromide and pH by means of a Box-Behnken experimental design. Depending on these factors, measured pseudo-first order half-lives were in the ranges: 23-573 h for salicylic acid, 13-446 min for naproxen, 5-328 min for diclofenac and 0.4-13.4 min for indomethacine. Also, it was observed that chlorine concentration was the overall most significant factor, followed by the bromide concentration (except for indomethacine), resulting in increased degradation kinetics as they are increased. The degradation path of salicylic acid, naproxen and diclofenac consisted of aromatic substitution of one or two hydrogens by chlorine and/or bromide. Moreover, for diclofenac, two other by-products corresponding to a decarboxylation/hydroxylation pathway from the monohalogenated products were also identified. On the other hand, indomethacine degradation did not lead to halogenation products but to oxidation ones. The investigation of these by-products in real samples by LC-MS/MS (QqQ) showed that the halogenated derivates of salicylic acid occurred in all the drinking water and wastewater samples analysed.

AB The occurrence and removal of 13 pharmaceuticals and 2 consumer products, including antibiotic, antilipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anticonvulsant, stimulant, insect repellent and antipsychotic, were investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Beijing, China. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) Most of the target compounds were detected, with the concentrations of 4 4 ng L-1-6 6 mu g L-1 and 2 2-320 ng L-1 in the influents and secondary effluents, respectively These concentrations were consistent with their consumptions in China, and much lower than those reported in the USA and Europe Most compounds were hardly removed in the primary treatment, while their removal rates ranging from -12% to 100% were achieved during the secondary treatment in the tertiary treatment, different processes showed discrepant performances The target compounds could not be eliminated by sand filtration, but the ozonation and microfiltration/reverse osmosis (MF/RO) processes employed in two WWTPs were very effective to remove them, showing their main contributions to the removal of such micro-pollutants in wastewater treatment (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment do not appear singly and usually occur as complex mixtures, whose combined effect may exhibit toxicity to the aquatic biota. We report an environmental application of the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation, a method widely used in pharmacology to study drug interactions, to determine the nature of toxicological interactions of three fibrates toward two aquatic bioluminescent organisms, Vibrio fischeri and the self-luminescent cyanobacterial recombinant strain Anabaena CPB4337 The combination index-isobologram equation method allows computerized quantitation of synergism, additive effect and antagonism In the Vibrio test, the fibrate combinations showed antagonism at low effect levels that turned into an additive effect or synergism at higher effect levels, by contrast, in the Anabaena test, the fibrate combinations showed a strong synergism at the lowest effect levels and a very strong antagonism at high effect levels We also evaluated the nature of the interactions of the three fibrates with a real wastewater sample in the cyanobacterial test We propose that the combination index-isobologram equation method can serve as a useful tool in ecotoxicological assessment (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

However, the application of this method carries the inherent danger to produce toxic oxidation by products For an ecotoxicological assessment conventionally treated wastewater, wastewater after ozonation and ozonated wastewater after sand filtration were evaluated in parallel at an operating treatment plant via the fish early life stage toxicity test (FELST) using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
   The FELST revealed a considerable developmental retardation of test organisms exposed to ozonated WW This was accompanied by a significant decrease in body weight and length compared to reference water, to the conventionally treated WW and to the ozonated water after sand filtration Hence sand filtration obviously prevents from adverse ecotoxicological effects of ozonation
   An additional test with yolk-sac larvae resulted in a significant reduction of vitellogenin levels in fish exposed to ozonated wastewater compared to fish reared in conventionally treated wastewater This demonstrates the effective removal of estrogenic activity by ozonation
   Adverse ozonation effects may have been a result of the conversion of chemicals into more toxic metabolites However, sand filtration reduced toxication effects indicating that these oxidation by products are readily degradable or adsorbable The results indicate that in any case ozonation should not be applied without subsequent post treatment appropriate for oxidation by products removal (e g sand filtration).

AB This study explored the effect of different bulk organic carbon matrices on the fate of trace organic chemicals (TOrC) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR) infiltration through porous media was simulated in biologically active column experiments under aerobic and anoxic recharge conditions. Wastewater effluent derived organic carbon types, differing in hydrophobicity and biodegradability (i e, hydrophobic acids, hydrophilic carbon, organic colloids), were used as feed substrates in the column experiments. These carbon substrates while fed at the same concentration differed in their ability to support soil biomass growth during porous media infiltration Removal of degradable TOrC (with the exception of diclofenac and propyphenazone) was equal or better under aerobic versus anoxic porous media infiltration conditions During the initial phase of infiltration, the presence of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) enhanced the decay of degradable TOrC by promoting soil biomass growth, suggesting that BDOC served as a co-substrate in a co-metabolic transformation of these contaminants However, unexpected high removal efficiencies were observed for all degradable TOrC in the presence of low BDOC concentrations under well adopted oligotrophic conditions It is hypothesized that removal under these conditions is caused by a specialized microbial community growing on refractory carbon substrates such as hydrophobic acids Findings of this study reveal that the concentration and character of bulk organic carbon present in effluents affect the degradation efficiency for TOrC during recharge operation Specifically aerobic, oligotrophic microbiological soil environments present favorable conditions for the transformation of TOrC, including rather recalcitrant compounds such as chlorinated flame retardants (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study evaluated a pilot-scale nonthermal plasma (NTP) advanced oxidation process (AOP) for the degradation of trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) The degradation of seven indicator compounds was monitored in tertiary-treated wastewater and spiked surface water to evaluate the effects of differing water qualities on process efficiency The tests were also conducted in batch and single-pass modes to examine contaminant degradation rates and the remediation cap abilities of the technology, respectively. values for electrical energy per order (EEO) of magnitude degradation ranged from <0 3 kWh/m(3)-log for easily degraded compounds (e g, carbamazepine) in surface water to 14 kWh/m(3)-log for more recalcitrant compounds (e g., meprobamate) in wastewater Changes in the bulk organic matter based on UV(254) absorbance and excitation-emission matrices (EEM) were also monitored and correlated to contaminant degradation These results indicate that NTP may be a viable alternative to more common AOPs due to its comparable energy requirements for contaminant degradation and its ability to operate without any additional feed chemicals (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB A comparison of time-weighted average pharmaceutical concentrations, loadings and enantiomer fractions (EFs) was made among treated wastewater from one rural aerated lagoon and from two urban tertiary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Alberta, Canada Passive samplers were deployed directly in treated effluent for nearly continuous monitoring of temporal trends between July 2007 and April 2008. In aerated lagoon effluent, concentrations of some drugs changed over time, with some higher concentrations in winter likely due to reduced attenuation from lower temperatures (e g, less microbially mediated biotransformation) and reduced photolysis from ice cover over lagoons, however, concentrations of some drugs (e.g antibiotics) may also be influenced by changing use patterns over the year Winter loadings to receiving waters for the sum of all drugs were 700 and 400 g/day from the two urban plants, compared with 4 g/day from the rural plant Per capita loadings were similar amongst all plants This result indicates that measured loadings, weighted by population served by WWTPs, are a good predictor of other effluent concentrations, even among different treatment types Temporal changes in chiral drug EFs were observed in the effluent of aerated lagoons, and some differences in EF were found among WWTPs. This result suggests that there may be some variation of microbial biotransformation of drugs in WWTPs among plants and treatment types, and that the latter may be a good predictor of EF for some, but not all drugs (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Chemical oxidation processes have been widely applied to water treatment and may serve as a tool to minimize the release of micropollutants (e g pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors) from municipal wastewater effluents into the aquatic environment The potential of several oxidants for the transformation of selected micropollutants such as atenolol, carbamazepine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was assessed and compared The oxidants include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ferrate(VI), and ozone as selective oxidants versus hydroxyl radicals as non-selective oxidant. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reaction of each oxidant show that the selective oxidants react only with some electron-rich organic moieties (ERMs), such as phenols, anilines, olefins, and deprotonated-amines in contrast, hydroxyl radicals show a nearly diffusion-controlled reactivity with almost all organic moieties (k > 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) Due to a competition for oxidants between a target micropollutant and wastewater matrix (i e effluent organic matter, EfOM), a higher reaction rate with a target micropollutant does not necessarily translate into more efficient transformation For example, transformation efficiencies of EE2, a phenolic micropollutant, in a selected wastewater effluent at pH 8 varied only within a factor of 7 among the selective oxidants, even though the corresponding k for the reaction of each selective oxidant with EE2 varied over four orders of magnitude in addition, for the selective oxidants, the competition disappears rapidly after the ERMs present in EfOM are consumed In contrast, for hydroxyl radicals, the competition remains practically the same during the entire oxidation Therefore, for a given oxidant dose, the selective oxidants were more efficient than hydroxyl radicals for transforming ERMs-containing micropollutants, while hydroxyl radicals are capable of transforming micropollutants even without ERMs Besides EfOM, ammonia, nitrite, and bromide were found to affect the micropollutant transformation efficiency during chlorine or ozone treatment.

AB This work reports a systematic survey of over seventy individual pollutants in a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) receiving urban wastewater The compounds include mainly pharmaceuticals and personal care products, as well as some metabolites The quantification in the ng/L range was performed by Liquid Chromatography-QTRAP-Mass Spectrometry and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. The results showed that paraxanthine, caffeine and acetaminophen were the main individual pollutants usually found in concentrations over 20 ppb N-formyl-4-amino-antipiryne and galaxolide were also detected in the ppb level A group of compounds including the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol, the lipid regulators bezafibrate and fenofibric acid, the antibiotics erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, the antiinflammatories diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen and mefenamic acid, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antiacid omeprazole exhibited removal efficiencies below 20% in the STP treatment Ozonation with doses lower than 90 mu M allowed the removal of many individual pollutants including some of those more refractory to biological treatment A kinetic model allowed the determination of second order kinetic constants for the ozonation of bezafibrate, cotinine, diuron and metronidazole. The results show that the hydroxyl radical reaction was the major pathway for the oxidative transformation of these compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Pharmaceutical residues in water are frequently analysed and discussed in connection with sewage treatment, ecotoxicity and, natural and drinking water quality Among different localities hospitals are suspected, or implied, to be a major and highly variable source of pharmaceuticals that substantially contribute to the total wastewater load In this study, the contribution of pharmaceuticals from a hospital to a sewage treatment plant (STP) serving around 45,000 inhabitants was evaluated Approximately 200 hospital beds result in a hospital bed density of 4 4 beds per 1000 inhabitants, which is a typical value for developed world countries Prior to sampling, a sound systems analysis was performed, and a sophisticated continuous flow-proportional sampling regime was applied Hence, overall experimental uncertainty was reduced to a minimum, and measurements provide clear evidence that, for 28 of 59 investigated substances, over 85% of the pharmaceutical residue loads do not originate from the hospital when applying a conservative error estimation Only for 2 substances, trimethoprim, (18%) and roxithromycin (56%), was the maximum observed contribution of the hospital >15% On average, the contribution of the hospital for the compounds detected in both, hospital effluent and sewage treatment plant influent was small and fairly constant Five compounds were only detected in hospital wastewater, and 24 neither in the hospital wastewater nor in the total wastewater at the influent of the STP For these compounds no experimental contribution could be calculated For the compounds where audit data for both the national consumption and the specific hospital under investigation were available, a prediction of the fraction of pharmaceuticals originating from the hospital was performed Three quarters of the compounds, classified with the existing audit data, were in the same "hospital contribution category" as determined by measurements For most of the other compounds, plausible reasons could be identified to explain the observed deviations (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are found in secondary treated effluents up to mu g L(-1) levels and therefore discharged into surface waters Since the long term effects of these compounds on the environment and human health are, to date, largely unknown, implementation of advanced treatment of wastewaters is envisaged to reduce their discharge This is of particular relevance where surface waters are used as drinking water sources and when considering indirect potable reuse. This study aimed at assessing the removal of organic micropollutants and the concurrent reduction of their biological activity in a full scale reclamation plant treating secondary effluent The treatment consists of 6 stages denitrification, pre-ozonation, coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation and filtration (DAFF), main ozonation, activated carbon filtration and final ozonation for disinfection. For that purpose, representative 24-hour composite samples were collected after each stage The occurrence of 85 compounds was monitored by LC/MS-MS A battery of 6 bioassays was also used as a complementary tool to evaluate non-specific toxicity and 5 specific toxic modes of action. Results show that, among the 54 micropollutants; quantified in the influent water, 50 were removed to below their limit of quantification representing more than 90% of concentration reduction Biological activity was reduced, depending on the specific response that was assessed, from a minimum of 62% (AhR response) to more than 99% (estrogenicity) The key processes responsible for the plant's performances were the coagulation/flocculation/DAFF, main ozonation and activated carbon filtration The effect of these 3 processes varied from one compound or bioassay to another but their combination was almost totally responsible for the overall observed reduction Bioassays yielded complementary information, e g estrogenic compounds were not detected in the secondary effluent by chemical analysis, but the samples had an estrogenic effect. The main ozonation formed oxidation by-products of the organic micropollutants but decreased the level of non-specific toxicity and other specific toxic modes of action, demonstrating that the mixture of oxidation by-products was less potent than the mixture of the parent compounds for the considered effects (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB The rejection of steroid hormone estrone by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes in treated sewage effluent was investigated Four NF/RO membranes with different materials and interfacial characteristics were utilized To better understand hormone removal mechanisms in treated effluent, effluent organic matters (EfOM) were fractionated using column chromatographic method with resins XAD-8, AG MP-50 and IRA-96 The results indicate that the presence of EfOM in feed solution could enhance estrone rejection significantly Hydrophobic acid (HpoA) organic fraction made a crucial contribution to this "enhancement effect" Hydrophobic base (HpoB) could also improve estrone rejection while hydrophobic neutral (HpoN) and hydrophilic acid (HpoA) with low aromaticity had little effects. The increment in estrone rejection was predominantly attributed to the binding of estrone by EfOM in feed solutions, which led to an increase in molecular weight and appearance of negative charge (for the HpoA case) and thus an increased level of estrone rejection However, the improvement of estrone rejection by HpoA decreased with increasing calcium ion concentration The important conclusion of this study is, first, hydrophobic acid macromolecules are recommended to be added into feed water to improve the rejection of trace hormone during NF/RO membrane process, and, second, removal of calcium ions via pretreatment and application of membrane with more negative charge at its interface can greatly intensify this "enhancement effect" (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Concentrations of six pharmaceutical antimycotics were determined in the sewage water, final effluent and sludge of five Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) by solid phase extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry The antimycotics were quantified by internal standard calibration The results were used to estimate national flows that were compared to predictions based on sales figures Fluconazole was the only one of the six investigated antimycotics that was detected (at concentrations ranging from 90 to 140 ng L(-1)) in both raw sewage water and final effluent. Negligible amounts of this substance were removed from the aqueous phase, and its levels were below the limit of quantification in all of the analyzed sludge samples In contrast, clotrimazole, ketoconazole and econazole were present in all of the sludge samples, at concentrations ranging between 200 and 1000 mu g kg(-1), dry weight There were close correlations between the national measured and predicted antimycotic mass flows Antimycotic fate analysis, based on sales figures, indicated that 53% of the total amount of fluconazole sold appeared in the final effluents of the STPs, while 1, 155, 35, 209 and 41% of the terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, econazole and miconazole sold appeared in the digested dewatered sludge (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB In response to the U.S. National Academies' call for a better assessment of chemical pollutants contained in the approximately 7 million dry tons of digested municipal sludge produced annually in the United States, the mean concentration of 72 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) were determined in 110 biosolids samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its 2001 National Sewage Sludge Survey Composite samples of archived biosolids, collected at 94 U.S. wastewater treatment plants from 32 states and the District of Columbia, were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using EPA Method 1694 Thirty-eight (54%) of the 72 analytes were detected in at least one composite sample at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 48 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Triclocarban and triclosan were the most abundant analytes with mean concentrations of 36 +/- 8 and 12.6 +/- 3.8 mg kg(-1) (n = 5), respectively, accounting for 65% of the total PPCP mass found The loading to U.S. soils from nationwide biosolids recycling was estimated at 210-250 metric tons per year for the sum of the 72 PPCPs investigated The results of this nationwide reconnaissance of PPCPs in archived U.S biosolids mirror in contaminant occurrences, frequencies and concentrations, those reported by the U.S. EPA for samples collected in 2006/2007 This demonstrates that PPCP releases in U.S. biosolids have been ongoing for many years and the most abundant PPCPs appear to show limited fluctuations in mass over time when assessed on a nationwide basis The here demonstrated use of five mega composite samples holds promise for conducting cost-effective, routine monitoring on a regional and national basis (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Occurrence of emerging contaminants in environmental waters is directly related to their removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the flow rate of the receiving waters. Mediterranean rivers are characterized by important fluctuations in the flow rates and heavy contamination pressures from extensive urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. This translates in contamination levels most often higher than in other European basins. This paper reviews the data regarding the levels of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs detected in wastewaters and gives an overview of their removal by conventional treatment technologies applying activated sludge. Pharmaceutically active compounds and illicit drugs are selected as two important groups of emerging environmental contaminants that have raised an increasing interest in the scientific community. Their removal in WWTP, the influence of hydrological conditions in the receiving rivers, and dilution factors are described and examples are provided for selected WWTP and rivers in Catalonia (NE Spain).

AB This study aims at coupling coal cinder filter with biological process to improve pharmaceutical wastewater quality and reduce the disposal cost. In the coal cinder filter, the removal efficiencies of COD, BOD(5), SS and color were 90 +/- 2%, 72 +/- 2%, 95 +/- 2% and 80 +/- 2%, respectively. The results attribute to the big specific surface area and strong adsorption ability. Coal cinder filter removes a large portion of the pollutants in the influent wastewater, which would strongly stable the effluent waste water quality, and reduce the load of follow-up biological treatment process. The average removal efficiencies for COD, BOD5, SS and color of the combined process were about 99.7 +/- 3%, 98.2 +/- 4%, 98.5 +/- 3% and 96.3 +/- 2%, respectively, with the average effluent quality of COD 16 +/- 1 mg/L, BOD(5) 11 +/- 1 mg/L, SS 10 +/- 0.6 mg/L and color 22 +/- 1 (multiple), which are consistent with the national requirements of the waste pollutants for pharmaceutical industry of chinese traditional medicine discharge standard (GB 21906-2008). The results indicated that the combined procedure could offer an attractive solution for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with considerable low cost.

AB A waste load allocation method was developed for industrial wastewater management based on unfairness factors, an industrial allocation factor and pollution reduction discounts. Three unfairness factors were defined to assess the relative efficiencies of energy consumption, pollution discharge and waste treatment costs for different industries. The overall effect of these factors was described by an industrial allocation factor. Based on the values of these factors, industries were classified into three types, after which waste load allocation proportions among different industries were determined using different pollution reduction discounts. This waste load allocation method was then applied in the Zhangweinan Watershed, which is one of the most seriously polluted watersheds in northern China. The results revealed that extractive, mechanical and food industries comprise the type I industries, which had the lowest pollution reduction discounts of 0, 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. The metallurgical industry and other industries were characterized as type II and discounts of 0.5 and 0.6 were given to their primary reductions. Textile, pharmaceutical, oil and pyrogenic, chemical and paper industries were classified as type III industries and had a waste load reduction of more than 80% of the pollution discharge in 2004.

AB The present study shows that ozonation of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is likely to be a future treatment solution to remove estrogens and xeno-estrogens. The required ozone dose and electrical energy for producing the ozone were determined in two WWTP effluents for removal of 17 estrogenic chemicals. The estrogenic compounds included parabens, industrial phenols, sunscreen chemicals, and steroid estrogens. The obtained values of Electrical Energy per Order (EEOs) for the treatment of the estrogens were in the range 0.14-1.1 kWh/m(3) corresponding to 1.7-14 g O(3)/m(3). It is furthermore suggested that UV-absorbance is a useful parameter for online control of the ozone dose in a full scale application since the absorbance of the WWTP effluents and the remaining concentration of the estrogens and xeno-estrogens correlated well with the applied ozone dose.

AB Xenobiotics in urban receiving waters are an emerging problem. A sound knowledge of xenobiotic input, distribution and fate in the aquatic environment is a prerequisite for risk assessments. Methods to assess the impact of xenobiotics on urban receiving waters should address the diverse characteristics of the target compounds and the spatiotemporal variability of concentrations. Here, we present results from a one-year-monitoring program concerning concentrations of pharmaceuticals, additives from personal care products and industrial chemicals in an urban drainage catchment in untreated and treated wastewater, surface water and groundwater. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were applied to characterize the xenobiotic concentrations. Correlation and principal component analysis revealed a pronounced pattern of xenobiotics in the surface water samples. The concentrations of several xenobiotics were characterized by a negative proportionality to the water temperature. Therefore, seasonal attenuation is assumed to be a major process influencing the measured concentrations. Moreover, dilution of xenobiotics the surface water was found to significantly influence the concentrations. These two processes control more the xenobiotic occurrence in the surface water than the less pronounced concentration pattern in the wastewater sources. For the groundwater samples, we assume that foremost attenuation processes lead to the found differentiation of xenobiotics.

AB Lab-scale batch experiments with biosolids collected from a full-scale activated sludge system (AS) and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of elimination of 5 acidic pharmaceuticals and 2 neutral pharmaceuticals. Batch elimination experiments were conducted under the conditions of pH of 6 and 7, and a great impact of pH on elimination of pharmaceuticals was shown by the significant differences in elimination rates under different pH conditions: elimination of pharmaceuticals was enhanced under the condition of lower pH regardless of the type of biosolid. Degree of mineralization of ibuprofen was also investigated in this study by using (14)C-labeled compounds. Although ibuprofen has been considered to be a readily biodegradable pharmaceutical in previous studies, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the degree of mineralization of ibuprofen would be limited in biological wastewater treatment including MBRs. The results obtained in this study imply that a large portion of pharmaceuticals that have been considered "biodegradable", such as ibuprofen, entering into wastewater treatment plants will eventually be discharged into natural water bodies as intermediates, although concentrations of them may look reduced on the basis of common analytical methods (i.e. GC/MS or LC/MS/MS).

AB This work reports the occurrence and the removal of a wide spectrum of pesticides in municipal wastewaters from the Agrinio region, Greece. Analytical determination was carried out by means of solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatography equipped with flame thermionic and mass spectrometric detection. The herbicides atrazine, alachlor, isoproturon, and s-metolachlor and the insecticides diazinon, methidathion, fenthion and chlorpyriphos, were more frequently detected in influent and effluent samples while they were also detected in river samples. Isoproturon and diazinon showed the highest concentrations in influent samples that reached concentrations up to 2,328 and 1,486 ng L(-1), respectively. Secondary treatment and cumulative removal rates for herbicides and insecticides ranged between 23-91%, 21- > 99% and 36- > 99%, 38- > 99%, respectively. The data demonstrate that there are significant levels of pesticides entering river waterways.

AB Isotherms were determined for the adsorption of five pharmaceutical residues, primidone, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac, to Calgon Filtrasorb 300 powdered activated carbon (PAC). The sorption behavior was examined in ultra-pure and wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) matrices, where more sorption was observed in the ultra-pure water for PAC doses greater than 10 mg/L suggesting the presence of EfOM hinders the sorption of the pharmaceuticals to the PAC. Adsorption behaviors were described by the Freundlich isotherm model. Quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) in the form of polyparameter linear solvation energy relationships were developed for simulating the Freundlich adsorption capacity in both ultra-pure and EfOM matrices. The significant 3D-based descriptors for the QSPRs were the molar volume, polarizability and hydrogen-bond donor parameters.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) constitute a class of chemicals of emerging concern due to the potential risks they pose to organisms and the environment, even at low concentrations (ng/L). Recent studies have found that PPCPs are not efficiently removed in secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study has: (1) simultaneously investigated the occurrence of sixty-one PPCPs using solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, (2) evaluated removal efficiencies of target PPCPs in six WWTPs that discharge effluents into major Taiwanese rivers, and lastly (3) examined matrix interference during analysis of target PPCPs in water samples. The twenty target PPCPs were chosen for their high detection frequencies, high influent concentrations, and stability during wastewater treatment processes. Caffeine and acetaminophen were detected at the highest concentrations (as high as 24,467 and 33,400 ng/L) and were effectively removed (both >96%); other PPCPs were detected in the high ng/L range but were not effectively removed. Matrix interference (by ion suppression or enhancement) during the analysis resulted in underestimation of the removal efficiencies of erythromycin-H2O, cefazolin, clarithromycin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, clofibric acid and gemfibrozil.

AB Cyprus is currently the leading country in antibiotic consumption among all European Union member countries and is likely to have a high consumption of pharmaceuticals overall. This reconnaissance type of project sought to investigate the occurrence of 16 pharmaceuticals, six known or suspected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), two flame retardants, one insect repellant, and one fragrance for the first time in water supplies of Cyprus. Groundwater samples from sites that were located beneath farms scattered around Cyprus, wastewater influent and tertiary-treated effluent, raw and finished surface water, and household potable water samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Most of the tested compounds were, minimum reporting limit, except for ibuprofen (mean of 1.4 ng L-1) and bisphenol A (mean of 50 ng L-1), which were detected in more than one out of the five groundwater sampling sites. Certain compounds were found in large concentrations in the wastewater influent (caffeine 82,000 ng L-1, sulfamethoxazole 240 ng L-1, ibuprofen 4,300 ng L-1, and triclosan 480 ng L-1). However, several pharmaceuticals and EDCs were detected in the tertiary-treated effluent (recycled water). For the raw and finished surface water, and potable water samples, ibuprofen was detected, whereas, bisphenol-A was measured in only potable water. Overall, with a few notable exceptions, source, finished and potable water had rare detection or low concentration of target compounds, but further research is needed to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the detected emerging contaminants along with the characterization of the related public health risk.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are becoming increasingly recognised as important micropollutants to be monitored in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), since WWTP effluents represent an important point source to natural aquatic systems. In this study, the abundance of 65 PPCPs was analysed in 5 Portuguese WWTPs during the spring and autumn. Due to the fact that analytical approaches normally used to quantify the abundance of these compounds are labour intensive and require various specific procedures, this study proposes a set of simplified analytical methods for the quantification of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and polycyclic musks in liquid and sludge samples. The analytical methods were validated using influent wastewater matrices, showing comparable limits of detection and quantification as literature values for most PPCPs, with the exception of the estrogenic compounds. The PhAC concentrations detected in the WWTP survey were in the range of 0.050-100 mu g L-1 in the influent and up to 50 mu g L-1 in the effluent, where the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most abundant and frequently detected group. Some musks were detected up to 11.5 mu g L-1 in the influent and 0.9 mu g L-1 in the effluent, and adsorbed in the sludge up to 22.6 mu g g(-1).

AB A study has been carried out in three French hospitals in order to assess and model the pharmaceutical load in hospital wastewater and its impact in WWTP. This study, called Mediflux, consisted of three successive steps: first, an original prioritization procedure developed in our laboratory enabled us to select a list of relevant molecules from different Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes containing pharmaceuticals for specific hospital use such as anesthetics or antineoplastic agents and pharmaceuticals dispensed in the community. Then, analytical quantification procedures were developed and validated according to 2002/657/EC European directive. Sampling campaigns were performed in three different hospitals, two located in the Paris area and one in a medium-sized city 150 km from Paris. Sampling was also carried out in wastewater treatment plants. At the same time, in order to model the pharmaceutical loads from hospitals, predicted concentrations were calculated as a first approach assuming it would be a single-box model, i.e. hospitals have no effect on drug loads and only human metabolism is taken into account to evaluate the fraction of drugs eliminated in hospital effluent. In the last step, the comparison of measured and calculated concentrations showed a satisfactory correlation for some pharmaceuticals, mainly those with short elimination half-lifes and weak human metabolism. For others, it appeared that modeling should take into account various factors such as out patient use, pharmacokinetic data and molecule stability in wastewater.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micropollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to reduce the discharge for priority substances and to meet the environmental quality standards set by the European Water Framework Directive. The present work assessed the occurrence of 60 organic substances (priority substances and other relevant pollutants) in municipal wastewater and sludge. Their fate in the treatment processes and their removal efficiencies Were quantified. Thorough on-site mass balances were carried out at 8 municipal wastewater treatment plants chosen among conventional and advanced secondary processes. It was found that 70% of the substances were quantified in raw wastewater and 50% in effluent, with a transfer without a limited degradation for most of them. Low loaded activated sludge (AS) process reduced the emission of more than half of micropollutants. At low sludge retention time (AS under high load), lower removal efficiencies were measured compared to low loaded AS. No influence of temperature of the biological reactor was shown. The membrane bioreactor process increased the removal efficiencies for one third of the substances that were partially removed with AS. Still, five substances were measured at concentrations exceeding the environmental quality standards at the outlet of the studied plants. In addition to efforts for source-reduction, complementary treatments need to be set-up.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment raises many questions about risk to the environment and risk to human health. Researchers have attributed adverse ecological effect effects to the presence of these compounds, particularly EDCs, though there is no consensus on what risk, if any, these compounds pose to human health. The scientific community is in the process of developing a better understanding of the occurrence, fate, and transport of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in the environment, including a better characterization of human exposure via drinking water. This paper provides a brief review of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in drinking water, as well as uses examples from Lake Mead, Nevada, USA, to highlight the issues associated with their fate and transport. Lastly, the effects of natural or anthropogenically driven processes, like natural seasonal flow or climate-change/prolonged drought are discussed as they are factors which can drastically alter environmental concentrations of these compounds. Without question, the propensity for the contamination of fresh water will rise as (1) human population continues to grow or (2) patterns of natural surface water slow and wastewater becomes a larger fraction of flow further highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental behavior.

AB A suite of benzothiazoles and benzotriazoles was analysed by comprehensive multi-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry in four different wastewater treatment systems. The selected wastewater treatment systems include one conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and for the first time, two constructed wetlands. Although benzothiazole (BT), 2-(methylthio) benzothiazole (MTBT), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OHBT) and benzotriazole (BTri) occurred in all the raw wastewater samples, 4- and 5-methylbenzotriazoles (4- and 5-TTri) were only detected in the industrially impacted wastewater. Concentrations of benzothiazoles and benzotriazoles in raw wastewater ranged from 0.2 to 2.2 mu gL(-1) and from 0.06 to 36.2 mu gL(-1), respectively. The benzothiazoles removal efficiencies ranged from zero to up to 80% in the conventional WWTP and from 83 to 90% in constructed wetlands. For BTri, removal efficiencies ranged from 65 to 70% and from 89 to 93% in conventional WWTP and constructed wetlands, respectively. The higher performance of CWs in the removal of these compounds might be attributed to the contribution of biodegradation, photodegradation and plant uptake.

AB This article discusses a combined treatment system comprising electrocoagulation (EC) as a pre-treatment followed by anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor (AFFBR) for treatment of high strength pharmaceutical wastewater. The effect of various operating parameters such as pH, current density and electrolysis duration on COD, BOD and colour removal was studied. The maximum removals for COD, BOD and colour under optimal operating conditions i.e. pH 7.2, current density (CD) of 80 A/m(2) and electrolysis time of 25 minutes were 24%, 35% and 70.25% respectively. Increase in current density has resulted in decrease in electrolysis duration with marginal improvement in treatment efficiency. The efficiency of removal is discussed in terms of kgCOD(r)A(-1) m(-2) h(-1) and energy consumption as Wh kg(-1) COD(r). The effluents obtained after EC were treated by AFFBR at various organic loading rates (OLRs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results indicated removals in the range of 80-90% for COD and 86-94% for BOD respectively, at OLRs between 0.6 to 4.0 Kg COD/m(3) d at an HRT of 2 days. The total gas quantity increased with increase in both HRT and OLR up to a loading of 6 Kg COD/m(3)/d but it did not commensurate with organic load. The results indicated that the combined treatment option is competitive and can be used effectively for high strength wastewaters.

AB Different advanced oxidation processes (AOP) were developed for the treatment of highly loaded wastewater streams. Optimisation of removal and improvement of efficiency were carried out on a laboratory, semiworks and pilot plant scale. The persistent cytostatic drug cyclophosphamide was selected as a reference substance regarding elimination and evaluation of the various oxidation processes because of its low degradability rate. The investigated processes are cost-efficient and suitable regarding the treatment of wastewater streams since they lead to efficient elimination of antibiotics and antineoplastics. A total reduction of toxicity was proven by means of the umuC-test. However, in order to reduce pharmaceuticals from the water cycle, it must be considered that the input of more than 80% of the pharmaceuticals entering wastewater treatment systems results from private households. Therefore, advanced technologies should also be installed at wastewater treatment plants.

AB The concentrations of some important endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals after various stages of wastewater treatment were investigated. The endocrine disrupting chemicals included natural and synthetic estrogenic and androgenic steroids. The pharmaceuticals included a series of sulfonamide antibiotics and trimethoprim. The removal efficiency of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated and compared with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that the MBR and CAS systems effectively removed steroidal estrogens and androgens, but only partially eliminated the target antibiotics from wastewater. The MBR was shown to be more effective than the CAS system which was possibly attributed to the high solid retention time and concentration of biosolids in the MBR. The results highlight the potential wider application of MBRs for the removal of trace chemical contaminants in wastewater and their potential for use as decentralised wastewater treatment systems.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of nanofiltration (NF) and ozonation for indirect potable reuse in terms of pharmaceutical residuals. To simultaneously obtain a reasonable retentate volume for further treatment, the tests were performed at a high volume reduction factor (VRF) of 60. The feed to the pilot plant was the effluent from a BNR plant with a final process step of chemical precipitation and rapid sand filtration. Two tests were performed 1) nanofiltration of treated wastewater followed by ozonation and 2) ozonated treated wastewater as feed to NF. Of the 95 pharmaceuticals analysed, three were not removed to the quantification limit, oxazepam in the first test and glibenclamide and ketoprofen in the second. The water quality after the two processes was similar, with an overall removal of pharmaceutical residuals of 99%. There are two advantages of ozonated water as feed to NF-a higher specific flux of 35% and a potential removal of ozonation by-products. The retention of some pharmaceuticals by NF was lower than anticipated, the major removal occurring in the ozonation. A tighter NF or RO is required in order to achieve higher pharmaceutical retention for further treatment of the retentate.

AB Municipal sewage and WWTP effluents are considered to be a major source of pollution, regarding the occurrence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment. Although removal potential of many EDCs by conventional WWTPs is recognised, literature data are not easily comparable. Besides, in order to reach very low concentrations, a further treatment might be sometimes required. Positive results can be achieved by tertiary chemical oxidation; nevertheless, technical-economic suitability is still to be fully demonstrated. In this work, two estrogen-like susbstances were considered: nonylphenol (NP) (and its parent compounds) and bisphenol A (BPA). The experimental work was conducted at Verona (Northern Italy) WWTP (370,000 p. e.): after a 15 days sampling campaign, which was carried out in order to calculate mass balance of target compounds, chemical oxidation tests were performed on effluent by means of UV/H(2)O(2) process and ozonation. Technical-economic feasibility of these solutions is discussed.

AB Considerable concern exists regarding the appearance and effects of trace and ultra trace pollutants in the aquatic environment. In this context, it is necessary to identify relevant hot spot wastewater - such as hospital wastewater - and to implement specific wastewater treatment solutions. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology seems to be a suitable pre-treatment approach for the subsequent advanced treatment by high pressure membrane systems such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). This paper is based upon investigations on the first full scale MBR for separate treatment of hospital wastewater in Germany. In this study an NF as well as an RO module for further treatment of the MBR filtrate were tested. The removal efficiencies were assessed using the following target compounds: bezafibrate, bisoprolol, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, telmisartan and tramadol. In summary, the results of this study confirmed that MBR technology followed by an advanced treatment for trace pollutant removal is an adequate approach for specific treatment of hot spot wastewater such as hospital wastewater. In particular, it was shown that - comparing the tested NF and RO - only (a two stage) RO is appropriate to remove pharmaceutical residues from hospital wastewater entirely. The recommended yield of the 2-stage RO is 70% which results in a retentate sidestream of 9%. Our investigations proved that RO is a very efficient treatment approach for elimination of trace pollutants.

AB The behavior of antibacterial triclosan, insect-repellent diethyltoluamide (DEET), anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and antipruritic crotamiton was investigated at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) to clarify their complete mass balance. Twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite samples were collected from the influent and effluent of primary and final sedimentation tanks, a biofiltration tank and disinfection tanks. Sludge samples (i.e., activated and excess sludge) and samples of the return flow from the sludge treatment process were collected in the same manner. The analytes in both the dissolved and particulate phases were individually determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with mass spectrometer. Triclosan was dominantly detected in the particulate phase especially in the early stage of treatment (up to 83%) and was efficiently removed (over 90%) in STPs, mainly by sorption to sewage sludge. Limited removal was observed for DEET (55 +/- 24%), while no significant removal was demonstrated for crotamiton or carbamazepine. The solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d, n = 4) for triclosan (log K-d: 3.7-5.1), DEET (1.3-1.9) and crotamiton (1.1-1.6) in the sludge samples are also determined in this study. These findings indicate the limitations of current sewage treatment techniques for the removal of these water-soluble drugs (i.e. DEET, carbamazepine, and crotamiton).

AB There are current concerns about the presence of persistent chemicals in recharge water used in soil aquifer treatment systems. Triclocarban (TCC) has been reported as a persistent, high production volume chemical with the potential to bioaccumulate in the environment. It is also known to have adverse effects such as toxicity and suspected endocrine disruption. This study was carried out to study the fate of TCC in soil aquifer treatment (SAT) through laboratory simulations in a soil column. The system performance was evaluated with regards to TCC influent concentration, sand (column) depth, and residence time. Results obtained confirmed the ability of SAT to reduce TCC concentrations in wastewater. Sorption and biodegradation were responsible for TCC removal, the latter mechanism however being unsustainable. The removal efficiency was found to be dependent on concentration and decreased over time and increased with column depth. Within the duration of the experimental run, TCC negatively impacted on treatment performance through a reduction in COD removals observed in the column.

AB The viability of treating high-concentration antibiotic wastewater by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was studied using submerged flat sheet membrane. The major problems for these modules are concentration polarization and subsequent fouling. By using gas-liquid two-phase flow, these problems can be ameliorated. A case study has been identified and the current issues in one of the major pharmaceutical industry (manufacturing cephalosporin drugs) located in Chennai, India, has been discussed for the possible removal of anaerobically transformed intermediates of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time on the removal of cephalosporin derivative, viz., cephalexin (C16H17N3O4S center dot H2O) and the intermediates [7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and acyl group (Phenyl acetic acid)] in the MBR with enhanced biodegradation using bioaugmentation technique. Based on the critical examination of results, the industry is looking for the alternatives of either direct disposal of 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid or for further degradation and disposal, which will essentially require additional cost and maintenance. The present regulatory standard implemented at a global level, (meaning the intermediates which are transformed during its course of travel within the industry and in the treatments plants, i.e., in the present study it is, 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid are not allowed to discharge on water bodies), does not envisage such disposal alternatives and hence the present study was aimed at the complete removal of intermediates (7-ADCA) and phenyl acetic acid prior to discharge.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical wastewater possesses high chemical oxygen demand (COD) (21,960-26,000 mg/l) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (11,200-15,660 mg/l) and suspended solids (SS) (5,460-7,370 mg/l). It cannot be directly discharged into surface water bodies, due to its highly biodegradable nature. Herbal pharmaceutical wastewater has been treated by using vermifilter, which is an ecosystem consisting of biosoil with bacteria and earthworms producing vermicastings. In the present studies a cost-effective, eco-friendly and sustainable method has been applied for the treatment of herbal pharmaceutical wastewater using earthworms. Studies were carried out at different organic loadings, ranging between 0.8 and 3.2 kg COD/m(3)day at three different hydraulic loadings of 1, 2 and 4 days. Vermifilters packed with 1:1:1 ratio of soil, sand and vermicast as media matrix along with the twenty adult earthworms in each reactor was used for the experiments. Treated effluent was colour and odour free. Efficient COD/BOD removals in the range of 85.44%-94.48% and 89.77%-96.26% were obtained respectively at 2 days hydraulic retention time (HRT). Heavy metal removals were also observed and no sludge production problem was encountered, only nutrient rich vermicast from the filters were removed and analysed after the experiments. It showed higher manurial value than control in terms of available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) and were in the range of 178.75-278.75 Kg/hectare available nitrogen, 16.128-50.4 kg/hectare of available phosphorus and 19.3-28.6 kg/hectare of available potassium at maximum HRT and at different organic loadings. This paper discusses in detail the feasibility of vermifilters in herbal pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at different organic and hydraulic loadings.

AB Hospitals are the main source of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) released into the environment. Generally, their discharges are co-treated with domestic wastewaters, resulting in a decrement of the recalcitrant compound concentrations in the final effluent due to water dilution. However, as many PhCs resist normal treatments, pollutant load does not change. This paper compares the chemical characteristics of hospital and domestic wastewaters on the basis of an experimental investigation for macro-pollutants and literature data for PhCs. A membrane biological reactor pilot plant fed by a hospital effluent is tested in order to evaluate the feasibility of treating these kinds of wastewaters with membrane systems. The paper then presents the possible scenarios in the management of the effluent of a large hospital situated in a small town. In particular, it reports on a case study of designing a (new) treatment plant for the effluent of the 900 bed hospital in Ferrara, Northern Italy, located on the outskirts of the town. Finally, costs for the intervention are given.

Among them, illicit drugs have been described as a new unexpected group of water contaminants with potent psychoactive properties and unknown effects to the aquatic environment.
   The presence of these drugs in water resources is of rising concern and several studies are being conducted all over the world estimating discharged levels of drugs of abuse. In this chapter, a summary of the last works studying and reporting the occurrence of illicit drugs in water resources is performed. Up to now, drugs of abuse have been already detected in wastewaters and surface waters in the USA, Italy, Germany, the UK and Spain. These drugs reach wastewater treatment plants either unaltered or in their main metabolite form. Depending on the removal efficiencies, they can persist through wastewater treatment and be detected in receiving waters, which in some cases are used for drinking water production. The presence of these compounds in raw waters and their elimination through the drinking water treatment must be considered as an issue with regard to the quality of water supplies.

AB The environment is contaminated by a number of micropollutants and their degradation products, many of which still remain undetected. Nowadays, several European regulations require the inclusion of transformation products in environmental risk assessment and monitoring. In the last decade, intense efforts have been taken to recognize the identity, quantity, and toxicity of unknown transformation products. Liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry has become a key technique for environmental analysis, now allowing the development of screening, identification, confirmatory and quantitative methods for the trace analysis of polar compounds in complex environmental matrices. The combination of modern technologies comprising high resolution, high mass accuracy and mass fragmentation enables the identification of compounds without having the authentic standards or even the detection of unknown analytes. However, a reliable confirmation of proposed structures using NMR spectroscopy or available standards is still desirable. This chapter presents new analytical strategies to identify and quantify transformation products generated by human metabolism, microbial degradation, or other environmental breakdown processes. Various hyphenated mass spectrometric techniques used for structure elucidation, such as liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, quadrupole-time-of-flight and linear ion trap-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometry are presented on three case studies of pharmaceutical and pesticide transformation products in environmental matrices, such as wastewater and groundwater.

AB This chapter on urban water in large population centres like Halle/Saale and Leipzig (Germany) focuses on the source, distribution and transport behaviour of xenobiotics as indicator substances for anthropogenic impacts on urban water systems.
   The xenobiotics reported here are micropollutants including pharmaceuticals, personal care products (collectively known as PPCPs) and industrial chemicals, which show low concentrations in urban waters. Such chemicals can be endocrine disrupters or are otherwise eco-toxic. The concepts presented herein required a new methodology for assessing the impact of human activities on the urban water system and processes in urban watersheds. To this end, we used different approaches in relation to the hydrogeological and hydrodynamic settings of the cities of Halle and Leipzig. For the Halle urban area, a conceptual flow and transport model was developed based on interaction between the river Saale and groundwater, and mass fluxes were computed, based on water balance calculations. For Leipzig, as a first approach, we established a monitoring program that involved various urban land use types and investigated their influence on the urban water system. Multivariate statistics and integral pumping tests were applied to account for the spatially highly heterogeneous conditions and time-varying concentrations. At both sites, we demonstrated the use of indicators consisting of physico-chemical parameters, ions, isotopes and compound-specific patterns of xenobiotics. The chosen indicators of pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, redox conditions, nitrate, sulphate, chloride, boron, the isotopes of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and boron, as well as bisphenol A, carbamazepine, technical 4-nonylphenol (t-nonylphenol), galaxolide, tonalide, and gadolinium, helped to balance urban substance fluxes and assess urban effects on surface water quality. From our current quantification, it is clear that predicting contaminant behaviour in urban areas demands a detailed process understanding which cannot be derived from laboratory experiments or phenomenological analyses at the catchment scale. Through an installation of measuring equipment at the interfaces between the unsaturated and saturated zone as well as between ground- and surface water, in situ contaminant transport and rate can be quantified from the cm- up to the m-range.

AB Urban water cycles are threatened in many ways by human activities, including the discharge of chemicals by industrial and household effluents. Since more than a decade it has been recognised that the active ingredients of, human pharmaceuticals contribute to the chemical contamination of urban surface waters and may pose a serious risk to the environment. Pharmaceuticals reach the aquatic environment due to their everyday use, excretion by humans and incomplete degradation in sewage treatment works. Their environmental concentrations are generally low. Due to their biologic activity, however, pharmaceuticals are considered as candidate compounds for low-level and chronic effects. Indeed, some pharmaceuticals, such as compounds interfering with reproductive hormones. provoke long-term effects on aquatic vertebrates in the ng/L range. Therefore, appropriate regulations for the environmental risk assessment as part of the approval of new medicines have been established. It was criticised, however, that these guidelines would not have been able to detect or predict the effects of Some Compounds with already known environmental impact. Thus, approaches for amending existing guidelines have been suggested. In this review, we give a brief-overview on Current and novel approaches for the prospective environmental risk assessment Of human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. In particular, we compare different strategies to identify potential ecotoxic effects and the possible applications within a regulatory framework. We indicate a number of tools that Could improve the detection of compounds with potential low-level effects or hitherto unknown but relevant alternative mode of actions with implications for long-term effects.

AB This work addresses the problem of micropollutants removal in sewage treatment plants trying to identify the main factors influencing their fate and behaviour. Firstly the most significant groups of substances that are continuously emitted into the environment are presented and the physico-chemical properties and biodegradability of representative compounds are discussed. This information is crucial to understand the main removal mechanisms occurring in sewage treatment plants, such as sorption, biodegradation and chemical transformation, as well as the distribution pathways of micropollutants once released into the environment. Selected case studies are discussed to identify some key operational factors which influence the removal of these compounds. including the use of additives, temperature, biomass concentration and characteristics (microbial diversity, structure, etc.), as well as hydraulic and sludge retention time. A discussion focused on comparison of data corresponding to several configurations of activated sludge systems and membrane biological reactors is presented. So far, it is not clear how the type of technology affects micropollutants removal. A number of conclusions trying to explain the influence of different factors and some guidelines useful to enhance the removal of micropollutants in sewage treatment plants are presented.
   Organic micropollutants refer to a wide group of carbon containing chemical compounds, mainly of xenobiotic nature, created by industrial processes either intentionally or as by-products, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, plasticizers, perfluorinated compounds, etc. Some of these substances are being considered for inclusion in the list of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), i.e. compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through biological, chemical or photochemical processes, thus capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulation in human and animal tissue, biomagnification in food chains, and exerting potential significant impacts on human health and the environment (Katsoyiannis and Samara 2007; Clarke et al. 2008; Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 2009). Moreover, a significant number of these substances, those defined as Endocrine Disrupting compounds (EDCs), may exert estrogenic activity on various higher organisms (Kester et al. 2000).
   During the last decade, the focus of environmental research has been extended from the more "classic" POPs such as organochlorine pesticides or Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) to the so called "emerging contaminants" such as Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). Recent advances in analytical techniques, mainly related to the increasing use of Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled with Mass Spectrometry (MS), have enabled the possibility of determining a wide variety of micropollutants which, although denoted as "emerging" because information about Occurrence is fairly recent, have been discharged into the environment along decades, mainly in water bodies (Ternes 2007). That is the case of PPCPs or the most recently reported Perfluorinated Alkylated substances (PFAs), a large group of chemicals widely used to create inert surfaces for different industrial and consumer products since the 1950s, but recently detected in waste dumps or sewage (Clara et al. 2008). Although these compounds are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, either as sole compounds or also when present as components of complex mixtures.
   The objective of this chapter is to present the main removal mechanisms that take place throughout Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), since municipal wastewaters represent a significant emission source of micropollutants (Neumann et al. 2002; Joss et al. 2005). Most of the existing units operate with variations of the well known Activated Sludge (AS) process. However, one innovative technology that is nowadays gaining Popularity is the Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR). Postreatment Methods. Such as activated carbon or through ozone or advanced oxidation technologies, although very interesting as a polishing step leading to almost complete removal of these substances, can be considered as an "externality" of the common primary-secondary treatment, and are not discussed in this chapter.

AB The presence of antibiotics in water resources has been disturbing news for the stakeholders who are responsible for public health and the drinking water supply. In many cases, biological wastewater treatment plants are the final opportunity in the water cycle to trap these substances. The sensitivity of activated sludge bacteria to erythromycin, a macrolide widely used in human medicine was investigated in batch toxicity tests using a concentration range of 1-300 mg L-1. Erythromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, has been found to significantly inhibit ammonification, nitritation and nitratation at concentrations higher than 20 mg L-1. The degree of inhibition increased with greater concentrations of the antibiotic. Exposure to erythromycin also clearly affected heterotrophs, particularly filamentous bacteria, causing floc disintegration and breakage of filaments. Cell lysis was observed with the concomitant release of organic nitrogen (intracellular proteins) and soluble COD. Although erythromycin exhibits properties of a surfactant, this characteristic alone cannot explain the damage to heterotrophs: the effects from erythromycin were greater than those of Tween 80, a commonly used surfactant. Floc disruption can lead to the release of isolated bacteria, and possibly antibiotic resistance genes, into the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of an aqueous solution of clofibric acid was investigated during catalytic and noncatalytic ozonation. The catalyst, TiO2, enhanced the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone and raised the fraction or clofibric acid degraded by hydroxyl radicals. The rate constant for the reaction of clofibric acid and hydroxyl radicals was not affected by the presence of the catalyst. The toxicity of the oxidation products obtained during the reaction was assessed by means of Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna tests in order to evaluate the potential formation of toxic by-products. The results showed that the ozonation was enhanced by the presence of TiO2. the clofibric acid being removed completely after 15 min at pH 5. The evolution of dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm and the concentration of carboxylic acids monitored the degradation process. The formation of 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid and three non-aromatic compounds identified as a product of the ring-opening reaction was assessed by exact mass measurements performed by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). The bioassays showed a significant increase in toxicity during the initial stages of ozonation following a toxicity pattern closely related to the formation of ring-opening by-products.

AB The prevalence and persistence of perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in environmental and biological systems has been well documented, and a rising number of reports suggest that certain PFCs can result in adverse health effects in mammals. As traditional water sources become increasingly impacted by waste discharge and the demand for planned potable reuse grows, there is recent interest in determining PFC occurrence in drinking water supplies. Here we report monitoring results from drinking water treatment facility samples collected across the United States, and from associated surface, ground, and wastewater sources. Using automated solid phase extraction (SPE) and isotope-dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), samples were screened for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA). Method reporting limits (MRLs) were established at 1.0 ng/L for all monitored PFCs except PFOA, for which the MRL was set at 5.0 ng/L given elevated procedural and instrumental background levels. PFOS was the only investigated PFC detected in minimally impacted surface waters, with individual site averages of 2.0 ng/L and lower. Conversely, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and other highly impacted waters had almost 100% detection frequency for all PFCs except PFUdA and PFDoA, which were not detected above MRL in any samples. Of the investigated PFCs, PFOA averaged the highest overall concentration at any site at 115 ng/L Substantial impacts from treated wastewater generally caused increased summed PFC concentrations at downstream drinking water facilities, although levels and distribution suggest geographical variability. No discernible differences between influent and effluent PFC levels were observed for drinking water facilities. Removal of PFCs, however, was observed at an indirect potable reuse facility using microfiltration and reverse osmosis for wastewater treatment in which case all PFC levels in effluents were below the MRL.

AB In order to explore the effect of hypersaline aniline-containing pharmaceutical wastewater on the structure of activated sludge-derived bacterial community, RAPD-PCR and PCR-DGGE techniques were used to analyze the change of bacterial community diversity and structure during the acclimation to different concentrations of two types of wastewater. Different bacterial community structures and significant shift in the bacterial community diversity were observed during the acclimation of wastewater. The number of bacterial species and the abundance of bacteria acclimated to different concentration of wastewater decreased when the concentration increased. The trends of bacterial community diversity indices revealed by RAPD or DGGE profiles were different. The change of bacterial community diversity might be due to the adaptation and mutation under selection issues in the acclimation of wastewater. The relationship between diversity indices and the content of chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, salinity and aniline based on RAPD and DGGE data indicated that the change of the bacterial community diversity might not be due to a single factor but might be due to the integrated effects of all the contaminants in the wastewater. Phylogenic trees based on RAPD and DGGE fingerprints were different, indicating that the effect of wastewaters A and B on the bacterial community structure was different, which might be due to the characteristics of wastewater.

AB A new analytical method utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been developed to determine 16 pharmaceuticals from 8 therapeutic classes in wastewater: bezafibrate, clofibric acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, chloramphenicol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, indomethacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, metoprolol, nalidixic acid, N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide, propranolol, sulpiride and trimethoprim. Key parameters of MS/MS, UPLC and solid phase extraction (SPE) were optimized. In general, recovery of target pharmaceuticals was over 70% for the wastewater effluent samples and 50% for the influent samples. The effects of matrix suppression, loss during the pretreatment as well as instrument variability were successfully pcorrected by two internal standards, and acceptable relative recovery was obtained. Target compounds were quantitatively analyzed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and the detection limits ranged from 0.3 to 20 ng/L. A detailed study, matrix effect in effluent wastewater was also present. The method was applied to detecting pharmaceuticals in the wastewater from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Beijing, China and the results demonstrated that most target compounds were detectable in both the influent and effluent, with the mean concentrations ranging from 20.5 to 5775.6 ng/L and 4.6 to 418.6 ng/L, respectively.

AB Little information is available on the environmental occurrence and ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceutical gestagens released in the aquatic environment. Since eighteen different gestagens were found to be used in France, preliminary exposure and hazard assessment were done. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) suggest that if parent gestagens are expected to be found in the ng l(-1) range, some active metabolites could be present at higher concentrations, although limited data on metabolism and environmental fate limit the relevance of PECs. The biological effects are not expected to be restricted to progestagenic activity. Both anti-androgenic activity (mainly for cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate and their metabolites) and estrogenic activity (mainly for reduced metabolites of levonorgestrel and norethisterone) should also occur. All these molecules are likely to have a cumulative effect among themselves or with other xenoestrogens. Studies on occurrence, toxicity and degradation time are therefore needed for several of these compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low levels of pharmaceuticals are detected in surface, ground, and drinking water worldwide. Usage and incorrect disposal have been considered the major environmental sources of these microcontaminants. Recent publications, however, suggest that wastewater from drug production can potentially be a source of much higher concentrations in certain locations. The present study investigated the environmental fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a major production area for the global bulk drug market. Water samples were taken from a common effluent treatment plant near Hyderabad, India, which receives process water from approximately 90 bulk drug manufacturers. Surface water was analyzed from the recipient stream and from two lakes that are not contaminated by the treatment plant. Water samples were also taken from wells in six nearby villages. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All wells were determined to be contaminated with drugs. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, cetirizine, terbinafine, and citalopram were detected at more than 1 mu g/L in several wells. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (14 mg/L) and cetirizine (2.1 mg/L) were found in the effluent of the treatment plant, together with high concentrations of seven additional pharmaceuticals. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (up to 6.5 mg/L), cetirizine (up to 1.2 mg/L), norfloxacin (up to 0.52 mg/L), and enoxacin (up to 0.16 mg/L) were also detected in the two lakes, which clearly shows that the investigated area has additional environmental sources of insufficiently treated industrial waste. Thus, insufficient wastewater management in one of the world's largest centers for bulk drug production leads to unprecedented drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water. This raises serious concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance, and it creates a major challenge for producers and regulatory agencies to improve the situation.

AB Hydrophilic, persistent markers are useful to detect, locate, and quantify contamination of natural waters with domestic wastewater. The present study focused on occurrence and fate of seven marker candidates including carbamazepine (CBZ), 10, 11-dihydro-10, 11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), primidone (PMD), crotamiton (CTMT), N-acetyl-4-aminoantipyrine (AAA), N-formyl-4-aminoantipyrine (FAA), and benzotriazole (BTri) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), lakes, and groundwater. In WWTPs, concentrations from 0.14 mg/L to several micrograms per liter were observed for all substances, except CTMT, which was detected at lower concentrations. Loads determined in untreated and treated wastewater indicated that removal of the potential markers in WWTPs is negligible; only BTri was partly eliminated (average 33%). In lakes, five compounds, CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, FAA, AAA, and BTri, were consistently detected in concentrations of 2 to 70 ng/L, 3 to 150 ng/L, less than the limit of quantification to 30 ng/L, 2 to 80 ng/L, and 11 to 920 ng/L, respectively. Mean per capita loads in the outflows of the lakes suggested possible dissipation in surface waters, especially of AAA and FAA. Nevertheless, concentrations of CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, and BTri correlated with the actual anthropogenic burden of the lakes by domestic wastewater, indicating that these compounds are suitable for quantification of wastewater contamination in lakes. Marker candidates were also detected in a number of groundwater samples. Carbamazepine concentrations up to 42 ng/L were observed in aquifers with significant infiltration of river water, receiving considerable wastewater discharges from WWTPs. Concentration ratios between compounds indicated some elimination of BTri and DiOH-CBZ during subsurface passage or in groundwater, while CBZ and PMD appeared to be more stable and thus are promising wastewater markers for groundwater. The wastewater burden in groundwater, estimated with the markers CBZ and PMD, reached up to 6%.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) was assessed for the removal of estrogens, androgens, and a selection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The biomass and aqueous components of the MBR were investigated to determine whether removal was by biodegradation or by adsorption to the biomass. Removal was monitored using chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as well as biological analysis using estrogenic and androgenic yeast assays. Results showed that the MBR was effective in removing the compounds of concern from raw influent with removal rates between 78 and 99%. Removal efficiencies were comparable or better than those reported for conventional activated sludge systems, which was attributed to the relatively high sludge retention time of the MBR. The biomass component showed significant concentrations of salicylic acid, triclosan, and 4-tert-octylphenol. Estrogenic and androgenic activity was also measured in the biomass. Estrone was identified as the main compound responsible for the estrogenic activity. It was concluded that the main removal pathway was biodegradation, but sorption to biomass may also be important, particularly for triclosan and 4-tert-octylphenol.

AB Pharmaceuticals may be released to the soil environment through the application of biosolidsbiosolids. To understand those factors affecting the persistence of pharmaceuticals in the soil environment, the present study was performed to assess the effects of soil type, the presence of biosolids, and the impact of chemical mixture interactions on the degradation of three pharmaceuticals: naproxen, carbamazepine, and fluoxetine. Single-compound studies showed that naproxen degraded in a range of soils with half-lives ranging from 3.1 to 6.9 d and in biosolids with a half-life of 10.2 d. No relationships were observed between degradation rate and soil physicochemical properties and soil bioactivity. For naproxen, addition of biosolids to soils reduced the degradation rate observed in the soil-only studies, with half-lives in the soil-biosolid systems ranging from 3.9 to 15.1 d. Carbamazepine and fluoxetine were found to be persistent in soils, biosolids, and soil-biosolid mixtures. When degradation was assessed using a mixture of the three study compounds and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine, the degradation behavior of fluoxetine and carbamazepine was similar to that observed in the single compound studies (i.e., no degradation). However, the degradation rate of naproxen in soils, biosolids, and soil-biosolid systems spiked with the mixture was significantly slower than in the single-compound studies. As degradation studies for risk assessment purposes are performed using single substances in soil-only studies, it is possible that current risk assessment procedures will underestimate environmental impacts. Further work is therefore warranted on a larger range of substances, soils, biosolid types, and chemical mixtures to better understand the fate of pharmaceuticals in terrestrial systems.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are being increasingly reported in a variety of biological matrices, including fish tissue; however, screening studies have presently not encompassed broad geographical areas. A national pilot study was initiated in the United States to assess the accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in fish sampled from five effluent-dominated rivers that receive direct discharge from wastewater treatment facilities in Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA. Fish were also collected from the Gila River, New Mexico, USA, as a reference condition expected to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic influence. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of pharmaceuticals revealed the presence of norfluoxetine, sertraline, diphenhydramine, diltiazem, and carbamazepine at nanogram-per-gram concentrations in fillet composites from effluent-dominated sampling locations; the additional presence of fluoxetine and gemfibrozil was confirmed in liver tissue. Sertraline was detected at concentrations as high as 19 and 545 ng/g in fillet and liver tissue, respectively. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of personal care products in fillet composites revealed the presence of galaxolide and tonalide at maximum concentrations of 2,100 and 290 ng/g, respectively, and trace levels of triclosan. In general, more pharmaceuticals were detected at higher concentrations and with greater frequency in liver than in fillet tissues. Higher lipid content in liver tissue could not account for this discrepancy as no significant positive correlations were found between accumulated pharmaceutical concentrations and lipid content for either tissue type from any sampling site. In contrast, accumulation of the personal care products galaxolide and tonalide was significantly related to lipid content. Results suggest that the detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products was dependent on the degree of wastewater treatment employed.

AB Transformation products of pharmaceuticals formed by human metabolism within sewage treatment plant or receiving waters are predicted, in most cases, to be less toxic than the parent compound to common aquatic species. However, there is little available data to demonstrate whether this is generally the case. In the present study, a framework was developed to guide testing of transformation products using phototransformation of the beta-blocker propranolol to test the hypothesis for this particular transformation route. Phototransformation is an important depletion mechanism of some pharmaceuticals in surface waters with fast reaction rate constants at environmentally relevant conditions. Samples of propranolol in deionized water (DIW) and river water (RW) were exposed to a solar simulator (lambda:295-800 nm) and comparative toxicity of propranolol and its degraded mixtures measured using algal (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) screening tests. Results suggested a reduction of toxicity in photodegraded mixtures compared to the parent active pharmaceutical ingredient in all samples tested. Chemical analysis of effect test solutions supported the hypothesis that propranolol was transformed into compounds that appear to be less toxic to the organisms tested under the study conditions. Although the reactions were much faster in RW than in DIW, profiles of transformation products were similar in both matrices at two starting concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L). Results for propranolol implied that the reduction of toxicity using algal and rotifer screening tests was probably due to the production of more hydrophilic and more polar transformation products. Such results will provide useful insights into the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals by taking into account their transformation products.

AB Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India, is a major production site for the global bulk drug market. Approximately 90 manufacturers send their wastewater to a common treatment plant in Patancheru. Extraordinary high levels of a wide range of pharmaceuticals have recently been demonstrated in the treated effluent. As little as 0.2% of this effluent can strongly reduce the growth rate of tadpoles, but the underlying mechanisms of toxicity are not known. To begin addressing how the effluent affects aquatic vertebrates, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to 0.2% effluent for 5 d. Several physiological endpoints, together with effects on global hepatic gene expression patterns, were analyzed. The exposed fish showed both an induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) gene expression, as well as enzyme activity. Clinical blood chemistry analyses revealed an increase in plasma phosphate levels, which in humans indicates impaired kidney function. Several oxidative stress-related genes were induced in the livers; however, no significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities or in the hepatic glutathione levels were found. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes were slightly up-regulated following exposure, and moderate levels of estriol were detected in the effluent. The present study identifies changes in gene expression triggered by exposure to a high dilution of the effluent, supporting the hypothesis that these fish are responding to chemical exposure. The pattern of regulated genes may contribute to the identification of mechanisms of sublethal toxicity, as well as illuminate possible causative agents.

AB Very high levels of a range of pharmaceuticals have been reported recently in the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant near Hyderabad, India. The plant serves approximately 90 manufacturers of bulk drugs that primarily are exported to the world market. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were found at levels that are highly toxic to various microorganisms. Even though milligram- perliter levels of drugs targeting human proteins also have been found, it is difficult to conclude whether these levels are sufficiently high to adversely affect fish or amphibians due to the lack of relevant chronic toxicity data for most human pharmaceuticals. To assess potential effects on aquatic vertebrates, tadpoles of Xenopus tropicalis were exposed to three dilutions of effluent (0.2, 0.6, and 2%) over 14 d, starting at developmental stage 51. Additionally, newly fertilized zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to diluted effluent in 96-well plates for up to 144 h postfertilization (hpf). The tadpoles' body lengths, weights, and developmental stages were recorded, whereas a larger number of sublethal and lethal endpoints were studied in the zebrafish. A 40% reduced growth of the exposed tadpoles was demonstrated at the lowest tested effluent concentration (0.2%), indicating potent constituents in the effluent that can adversely affect aquatic vertebrates. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for zebrafish at 144 hpf was between 2.7 and 8.1% in different experiments. Reduced spontaneous movements, pigmentation, and heart rate were recorded within 48 hpf at 8 and 16% effluent concentrations. Treated effluent from a plant that serves as an important link in the global supply chain for bulk drugs is thus shown to cause adverse effects to aquatic vertebrates even at very high dilutions.

AB A Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed drugs that are present in sewage effluents and surface waters. The objective of the present study was to determine whether low environmentally relevant concentrations of the SSRIs fluoxetine and sertraline could impair growth and development in tadpoles of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and to evaluate if such effects may be caused by a disruption of the neuroendocrine system. Tadpoles were exposed to SSRIs at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L for 70 d throughout metamorphosis. No effects on deformities were observed. Tadpoles exposed to fluoxetine (10 mu g/L) and sertraline (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L) exhibited reduced growth at metamorphosis. Tadpoles exposed to sertraline (0.1 and 1 mu g/L) exhibited an acceleration of development as indicated by an increase in the time to tail resorption. The effects of SSRIs on growth and development in tadpoles were likely driven by reduced food intake. Reduced feeding rates were observed in SSRI-exposed tadpoles, and nutritional status can influence growth and development in amphibians via effects on the neuroendocrine system. Only sertraline was capable of causing developmental toxicity in tadpoles at environmentally relevant concentrations. These data warrant additional research to characterize the risks to human health and wildlife from pharmaceutical exposures.

AB A wide range of human pharmaceuticals are present at low concentrations in freshwater systems, particularly in sections of polluted river. These compounds show high biological activity, often associated with a high stability. These characteristics imply a potential impact of these substances on aquatic biota even when present at low environmental concentrations. Low flow conditions in Mediterranean rivers, most of which flow through densely populated areas and are subjected to intensive water use, increase the environmental risk of these emergent compounds. Here, we studied whether pharmaceuticals in river water affect the local benthic community structure (diatoms and invertebrates). For this purpose, we analyzed the occurrence of pharmaceuticals along the Llobregat River and examined the benthic community structure (diatoms and invertebrates) of this system. Some pharmaceutical products in the Llobregat River registered concentrations greater than those cited in the literature. Multivariate analyses revealed a potential causal association between the concentrations of some anti-inflammatories and beta-blockers and the abundance and biomass of several benthic invertebrates (Chironomus spp. and Tubifex tubifex). Further interpretation in terms of cause-and-effect relationships is discussed; however, it must be always taken with caution because other pollutants also may have significant contributions. Combined with further community experiments in the laboratory, our approach could be a desirable way to proceed in future risk management decisions.

AB An evaluation of measured and predicted concentrations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in surface waters of the United States and Europe was conducted to develop expected long-term exposure concentrations for this compound. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) in surface waters were identified from the literature. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were generated for European and U.S. watersheds using the GREAT-ER and PhATE (TM) models, respectively. The majority of MECs are nondetect and generally consistent with model PECs and conservative mass balance calculations. However, the highest MECs are not consistent with concentrations derived from conservative (worst-case) mass balance estimates or model PECs. A review of analytical methods suggests that tandem or high-resolution mass spectrometry methods with extract cleanup result in lower detection limits and lower reported concentrations consistent with model predictions and bounding estimates. Based on model results using PhATE and GREAT-ER, the 90th-percentile low-flow PECs in surface water are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 ng/L for the United States and Europe, respectively. These levels represent conservative estimates of long-term exposure that can be used for risk assessment purposes. Our analysis also indicates that average concentrations are one to two orders of magnitude lower than these 90th-percentile estimates. Higher reported concentrations (e.g., greater than the 99th-percentile PEC of similar to 1 ng/L) could result from methodological problems or unusual environmental circumstances; however, such concentrations are not representative of levels generally found in the environment, warrant special scrutiny, and are not appropriate for use in risk assessments of long-term exposures.

AB Cytotoxic, also known as antineoplastic, drugs remain an important weapon in the fight against cancer. This study considers the water quality implications for the Thames catchment (United Kingdom) arising from the routine discharge of these drugs after use, down the drain and into the river. The review focuses on 13 different cytotoxic drugs from the alkylating agent, antimetabolite, and anthracycline antibiotic families. A geographic-information-system-based water quality model was used in the present study. The model was informed by literature values on consumption, excretion, and fate data to predict raw drinking water concentrations at the River Thames abstraction points at Farmoor, near Oxford, and Walton, in West London. To discover the highest plausible values, upper boundary values for consumption and excretion together with lower removal values for sewage treatment were used. The raw drinking water cytotoxic drug maximum concentrations at Walton (the higher of the two) representative of mean and low flow conditions were predicted to be 11 and 20 ng/L for the five combined alkylating agents, 2 and 4 ng/L for the three combined antimetabolites, and 0.05 and 0.10 ng/L the for two combined anthracycline antibiotics, respectively. If they were to escape into tap water, then the highest predicted concentrations would still be a factor of between 25 and 40 below the current recommended daily doses of concern. Although the risks may be negligible for healthy adults, more concern may be associated with special subgroup populations, such as pregnant women, their fetuses, and breast-feeding infants, due to their developmental vulnerability.

AB Parabens are common antimicrobial agents found in thousands of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Parabens are introduced into aquatic ecosystems from wastewater treatment plant effluents and have been detected in surface waters in the low microgram per liter range. Although these compounds display low toxicity in mammals, paraben toxicity to aquatic organisms has not been investigated. Standardized acute and subchronic endpoints in larval fish (Pimephales promelas) and cladoceran (Daphnia magna) models were examined for seven different parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, propyl-, isobutyl-, butyl-, benzylparaben), which encompassed a range of log P values. Paraben 48 h median lethal concentration values (LC50) ranged from 4.0 to 24.6 mg/L in D. magna and 3.3 to > 160.0 mg/L in fathead minnow. Growth and reproduction in D. magna had lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOECs) ranging from 0.12 to 9.0 mg/L and 1.5 to 6.0 mg/L, respectively. Fathead minnow growth was adversely affected at levels ranging from 1.0 to 25.0 mg/L. Aquatic toxicity of the parabens was inversely related to lipophilicity, suggesting that responses using standardized endpoints resulted from narcosis. Utilizing toxicity benchmark concentrations (e.g., LC50s, LOECs) for each compound, chemical toxicity distributions, a probabilistic hazard assessment technique, were developed to assess the probabilities of detecting parabens that elicit a response at or below a given concentration. For the responses assessed in the present study, the 5th centile values (the concentration at which 5% of parabens elicit a response) ranged from 15 mu g/L to 2.43 mg/L, with D. magna growth eliciting the lowest 5th centile value and acute D. magna mortality eliciting the highest. The distributions demonstrated that at environmentally relevant concentrations in developed countries there is limited acute or subchronic aquatic hazard of parabens to the organisms and responses examined.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfadiazine (SD), a widely used antibiotic chemical, has been detected in contaminated water and soils. Manganese dioxides are common minerals with a high redox potential and can act as active oxidants for SD degradation in wastewater treatment.
   RESULTS: alpha-MnO2 was used to promote SD oxidative degradation. At pH 4.6 and 25 degrees C, 92.7% of SD (0.02 mmol L-1) was degraded by 1.0 g L-1 alpha-MnO2. SO42- was detected as the inorganic end product from the mineralization of SD. The ecological toxicity index of average well color development (AWCD) in SD solution was 2.01 after the solution was degraded by alpha-MnO2 for 2 h, while the AWCD was 0.48 for the solution without alpha-MnO2 treatment. The degradation rate of SD can be improved by increasing the dosages of alpha-MnO2 and the reaction temperature, but the rate was limited by increased initial SD concentration and reaction pH.
   CONCLUSION: SD can be effectively degraded and mineralized with alpha-MnO2. These results are helpful for removing antibiotics by manganese dioxides in the environment, and also for exploring new technology for wastewater treatment. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry

ID LIGNIN; PHARMACEUTICALS; OXIDATION; CANCER
AB An isolation and quantification technique is presented for the analysis of semi-volatile spices and scents in aquatic waters including thymol, eugenol, limonene, carvacrol, vanillin, and cinnamaldehyde. Compounds are isolated from natural waters by solid phase extraction onto Waters Oasis HLB columns and eluted into ethyl acetate. Recovery efficiencies are >70% for most target compounds. Comparison with liquid-liquid extraction and C-18 solid phase extraction indicates that HLB cartridges are more robust and provide equal or better recoveries for target compounds relative to other approaches. Because the compounds are semi-volatile and prone to losses during solvent evaporation, we do not dry the samples completely before quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Compounds are analyzed using selected ion monitoring with a sensitivity similar to 1 pg compound per injection. This equates to a sensitivity of about 2-200 ng L-1 in natural waters, or part-per-billion levels. Column loading and matrix effects are minimal and are accounted for by careful monitoring of volumes and by standard additions during GC analysis. Environmental samples (treated sewage, lake, stream, and fjord samples) show a wide range of compounds and quantities, most in the 10-10,000 ng L-1 range. The artificial spice ethylvanillin, which is commonly used as an internal standard in analysis of woody lignin samples, is found in some natural waters. This is likely a result of the industrial-scale production of this compound for culinary and pharmaceutical use.

AB A Mackay-type level II fugacity model has been used to predict the behaviour and final concentrations of cocaine (COC) and its main metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) in a regional environmental system defined according to the European guidelines on Risk Assessment. The model takes into account the initial COC intake, partial degradation of the parent compound to BE, treatment of wastewater and environmental fate of these substances. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) lie in the ng L(-1) level, with the exception of the air compartment, where the concentrations are negligible. PECs in the water phase are in accordance with measured experimental concentrations in different European rivers. This case study shows that a simple level II fugacity model is suitable enough for modelling the environmental fate of high water soluble and low volatile organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products.

AB A progressive freeze concentration process, unidirectional downward freezing (UDF), was investigated for removal of five commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, acetylsalicylic acid, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole) in water. The feed water with the pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) at concentrations from ng/L to mg/L range was frozen at -7 and -15 degrees C. The separation efficiency of PhACs in the single stage and two-stage UDF was examined. By freezing only 80% (volume) of the feed water and without washing of the ice, about 84-92% reduction of the drug content in ice was achieved in the single stage UDF and about 99% reduction in the two-stage UDF. The partitioning behavior of the PhACs in the ice and liquid phases seems different from the solutes in glucose solutions or liquid foods reported in the literature. A strong linear relationship between the PhACs concentration and their TOC concentration was established, suggesting that TOC, a parameter commonly used to measure WWTP effluent quality might be used to monitor the level of PhACs in WWTP effluent.

AB Olive mill waste water (OMWW) is a major environmental issue in the Mediterranean. We address this problem by investigating the wastes for the presence of biologically active compounds already detected in both olive oil and pomace. Two initial OMWW samples were filtered using two microporous filtering media: (a) clayey diatomite and (b) zeolitic volcanic tuffs, obtaining three filtered samples from each. All initial and filtrated samples were tested for their activity on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced aggregation. The results showed that the initial samples contain biologically active compounds (PAF inhibitors) and that in their respective last-eluted filtered samples these compounds are purified. These eluted samples, along with their corresponding initial OMWW, were further separated with HPLC and the purified fractions responsible for the aforementioned biological activity, were further studied using chemical determinations and MS analysis. It was confirmed that the PAF inhibitor present in these fractions resembles the one isolated from olive oil. These results offer a new approach on the OMWW handling by offering an alternative use of this waste as starting material for nutritional and/or pharmaceutical purposes in the future.

AB Leaky sewers affect urban groundwater by the exfiltration of untreated wastewater. However, the impact of sewer exfiltration on the groundwater is poorly understood. Most studies on sewer exfiltration focus on water exfiltration, but not on the impact on groundwater quality. In this paper we present a new monitoring approach to estimate mass flow rates M-ex of different wastewater indicators (WWIs) from leaky sewers by applying integral pumping tests (IPTs). The problem of detecting and assessing heterogeneous concentrations in the vicinity of leaky sewers can be overcome with the IPT approach by the investigation of large groundwater volumes up- and downstream of leaky sewers. The increase in concentrations downstream of a leaky sewer section can be used to calculate M-ex with a numerical groundwater model. The new monitoring approach was first applied using four IPT wells in Leipzig (Germany). Over a pumping period of five days we sampled five inorganic WWIs: B, Cl-, K+, NO3-, NH4+ and three xenobiotics: bisphenol-a, caffeine and tonalide. The resulting concentration-time series indicated an influence of wastewater at one IPT well downstream of the leaky sewer. We defined ranges of M-ex by implementing the uncertainty of chemical analyses. The results showed a M-ex of 0-10.9 g m(-1) d(-1). The combination Of M-ex with wastewater concentrations from the target sewer yielded an exfiltration rate Q(ex) of 28.0-63.9 Lm(-1) d(-1) for the conservative ion Cl-. Most non-conservative WWIs showed reduced mass flow rates in the groundwater downstream of the leaky sewer that indicate a mass depletion during their passage from the sewer to the pumping well. Application of the IPT methodology at other field sites is possible. The IPT monitoring approach provides reliable M-ex values that can help to assess the impact of leaky sewers on groundwater.

AB The ubiquitous presence of trace pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is a significant concern. While the implications of these compounds on ecosystems and human health are being determined, there has been increasing interest in their treatment such as by tertiary processes at sources and wastewater treatment facilities to arrest further release to the environment. We have examined the degradation of sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics in a spiked water and a pharmaceutical wastewater by ozonation under varied conditions such as concentration, contact time, pH, and H2O2/O-3 mole ratio. The results show faster removal kinetics for sulfonamides containing the aromatic ring than for macrolides built of mostly saturated hydrocarbon structure, and that complete removal of all is achieved within 20 min of ozonation at the application rate of 0.17 g O-3/min. Degradation of contaminants containing unsaturated C-C bonds occurs faster at low pH, consistent with O-3 being the predominant oxidant and its aqueous concentration being higher at low pH. Degradation of erythromycin having a fully saturated structure is slower and more effective at higher pH or with added H2O2, both consistent with the enhanced production of OH radical under such conditions that contributes to removal of the saturated compound. Low pH favors degradation via molecular O-3 while high pH via OH radical; the optimal pH thus depends on target compounds being treated, and buffered pH at 7 facilitates removal of all tested compounds. The addition of H2O2 to ozonation abets contaminant removal, and at mole ratio of H2O2/O-3 = 5 it attains the highest degradation speed for all contaminants. However, a large excess of added H2O2 results in reduced or no benefits relative to O-3 alone. Thus, only a small dose of H2O2 is desirable when widely disparate compounds are treated by ozonation.

AB Fouling of sodium alginate, calcium and alum coagulant in dead-end nanofiltration membranes was systematically investigated in this study. Alginate was used as a model component of polysaccharide, one of the most ubiquitous components of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the secondary wastewater effluent. Fouling mechanism and specific cake resistances were determined using the membrane fouling index (MFI) equation, and the compressibility of cake layer in each system was analyzed. We have found that calcium improved permeate flux and reduced the resistances, in contrary to previous researches. The dominant fouling mechanism in the presence of alginate and/or calcium was cake formation without compression, whereas when alum was present there might exist more than one fouling mechanisms. It is further observed that calcium and alum had synergistic effects in lowering the resistances and changing the characteristics of the cake into more compressible. Based on our findings, a schematic model of fouling mechanisms in these systems was proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB In arid regions of the southwestern United States, municipal wastewater treatment plants commonly discharge treated effluent directly into streams that would otherwise be dry most of the year. A better understanding is needed of how effluent-dependent waters (EDWs) differ from more natural aquatic ecosystems and the ecological effect of low levels of environmentally persistent organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) with distance from the pollutant source. In a controlled experiment, we found 26 compounds common to municipal effluent in treatment raceways all at concentrations <1.0 mu g/L Male bonytail chub (Gila elegans) in tanks containing municipal effluent had significantly lower levels of 11-ketotestosterone (p=0.021) yet higher levels of 17 beta-estradiol (p = 0.002) and vitellogenin (p = 0.036) compared to control male fish. Female bonytail chub in treatment tanks had significantly lower concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol than control females (p = 0.001). The normally inverse relationship between primary male and female sex hormones, expected in un-impaired fish, was greatly decreased in treatment (r = 0.00) versus control (r = -0.66) female fish. We found a similar, but not as significant, trend between treatment (r = -0.45) and control (r = -0.82) male fish. Measures of fish condition showed no significant differences between male or female fish housed in effluent or clean water. Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish. The population-level impacts of these findings are uncertain. Studies examining the long-term, generational and behavioral effects to aquatic organisms chronically exposed to low levels of OWC mixtures are needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital effluents have been usually known by the microbiological pollution they cause, but only recently they have been considered a significant source of aquatic environmental pollution due to the presence of medicines in these effluents. In this context, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is presented for the most used intravenous antibiotics in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a hospital in Curitiba (Brazil). The amount of antibiotics used in the ICU was evaluated during 18 months (June 2006 until November 2007), in order to calculate the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC1). Antibiotic excretion data (on its original form) and the removal of the selected drugs in the sewage treatment plants based on the activated sludge system were used to calculate. respectively, PEC2 and PEC2r. The Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) of pharmaceuticals was also considered to assess the environmental risk by calculating the PEC/PNEC ratios. All PECs were >= 1 ng L-1. The worst-case PEC estimations (PEC1 and PEC2) were observed for sodic ceftriaxone, sodic cefazolin, meropenem, ampicillin, cefepime and sodic piperacillin. PEC/PNEC ratios showed that, given the present pattern of usage, high aquatic environmental risk is expected for these antibiotics. Further studies should be carried out to elucidate their contribution to increasing antimicrobial multi-drug-resistant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the biodegradation potential of three wastewater micropollutants (triclosan, bisphenol A, and ibuprofen) by Nitrosomonas europoea and mixed ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in nitrifying activated sludge. N. europaea could degrade triclosan and bisphenol A, but not ibuprofen. The degradation was observed only in the absence of allylthiourea (an inhibitor for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO)), suggesting that AMO might be responsible for triclosan and bisphenol A degradation. Competitive inhibition among ammonia, triclosan, and bisphenol A was observed. Inactivation of N. europaea was observed after degrading a mixture of triclosan and bisphenol A. The inactivation might be due to product toxicity and/or antimicrobial effect of triclosan: however, the causes of the inactivation were not determined.
   Regardless of the presence of the AMO inhibitor, three micropollutants were degraded by two different nitrified activated sludge samples. The results suggested that both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms in the activated sludge can degrade triclosan and bisphenol A. On the other hand, ibuprofen was more likely degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms in the activated sludge. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of ATO, RST and its metabolite rosuvastatin lactone (RSTL) in sewage and surface water samples has been developed. In the influent and effluent samples collected from 11 sewage treatment plants located in Ontario, Canada, ATO, RST, and RSTL were detected in all samples with median concentrations of 166 ng L(-1) (influent) and 77 ng L(-1) (effluent) for ATO, 448 ng L(-1) (influent) and 324 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RST, as well as 158 ng L(-1) (influent) and 41 ng L(-1) (effluent) for RSTL. Due to the inter-conversion between RST and RSTL, the total concentration of RST and RSTL in a sewage sample should be reported. The median removal rate by wastewater treatment was 66% for ATO and 22% for RST and RSTL combined. These statins were quite persistent in sewage. After a storage period of 21 and 62 days, there was only a slight decrease in ATO concentration and no change in the total RST concentrations. These three compounds were also detected in a number of surface water samples at low ng L(-1) concentrations. This is the first reported occurrence and fate of RST and RSTL in the Canadian aquatic environment. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants in the environment, which have drawn popular concerns recently. Most studies on the environmental fate of PPCPs have focused on their behaviors during wastewater treatment processes, in aquatic environments, and in the sludge, however, little is known about their behavior in agricultural soils. In this study, adsorption and degradation of six selected PPCPs, including clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, diclofenac and bisphenol A have been investigated in the laboratory using four US agricultural soils associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse. Adsorption test using a batch equilibrium method demonstrated that adsorption of all tested chemicals in soils could be well described with Freundlich equation, and their adsorption affinity on soil followed the order of triclosan > bisphenol A > clofibric acid > naproxen > diclofenac > ibuprofen. Retardation factor (RF) suggested that ibuprofen had potential to move downward with percolating water, while triclosan and bisphenol A were readily retarded in soils. Degradation of selected PPCPs in soils generally followed first-order exponential decay kinetics, with half-lives ranging from 0.81 to 20.44 d. Degradation of PPCPs in soils appeared to be influenced by the soil organic matter and clay contents. Sterilization generally decreased the degradation rates, indicating microbial activity played a significant role in the degradation in soils. The degradation rate constant decreased with increasing initial chemical concentrations in soil, implying that the microbial activity was inhibited with high chemical loading levels.

AB This article describes the development of a short pre-treatment method that allows the simultaneous analysis of free estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and their sulphate and glucuronide conjugated forms. For a range of matrices, from sewage effluent to river water, the developed methodology based on solid-phase extraction and fractionation technique with ultra-performance liquid chromatography system showed effective separation of the targeted estrogens. The detection limits of this method ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 ng L-1 for river water. The recoveries for river water and sewage effluent varied from 63% to 127%. The problems of matrix effects and ion suppression or enhancement were allowed quantitatively for in the analysis using standard addition. The developed method was used successfully to detect estrogens and their conjugates in both raw and treated wastewater, and river water at a location in Japan. High concentrations of the free estrogens estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and estriol were found in the influent (22.6, 77.2, 64.6 ng L-1, respectively) but only E1 was still present at a high concentration in the effluent which was reflected in the downstream river concentration. Estrone-3-sulphate was detected up to 18.0 ng L-1 in influent water sample and 1.1 ng L-1 in downstream water. For the sulphate conjugates, removal efficiencies varied from 35 to 88%. Glucuronide conjugates were detected only once in the sewage influent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current knowledge shows that residues of human medicinal products at trace quantities are widespread in aquatic systems. The sewage treatment plants are pointed out as the major source discharge of these compounds on the environment. In this context, it has been worldwide recognised that the environmental impact of medicinal products have to be evaluated, according to recent EU legislation and regulatory guidance. The strategy of the global risk assessment includes primarily a pre-screening based on the estimation of exposure concentrations of drugs in the wastewater. The present paper addresses the decision-maker frontier of the ecologically relevant endpoints. Risk management recommendation and reasonable and prudent alternatives are discussed to minimise the possible environmental impact.

AB Based on a monitoring program over the course of a year, we characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of selected micropollutants in an urban watershed within the city of Leipzig, Germany. Micropollutants; revealed a ubiquitous presence in untreated and treated wastewater, surface water and groundwater. The loads of 4-nonylphenol in the effluents of the municipal wastewater treatment plant followed a seasonal trend, whereas the loads of all other micropollutants were highly variable and not correlated to seasons. In the surface water, load seasonality of caffeine, galaxolide and tonalide resulted from a rapid removal with increased water temperature. The loads of 4-nonylphenol and of caffeine in the colder months increased when rainfall occurred. In the groundwater, complex spatial and temporal patterns were apparent and were related to varying input, retardation and removal processes. As a consequence, an assessment of micropollutants in urban waters should consider different micropollutants' temporal and spatial variability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The compounds were measured in water, waste sludge, and air throughout the plant. HHCB and AHTN were detected in 100% of the samples and at the highest concentrations. A mass balance on HHCB and AHTN was performed under warm and cold weather conditions. The total removal efficiency for HHCB and AHTN, which averaged between 67-89%, is dominated by adsorption to water softener sludge and its consequent removal by sludge wasting and media filtration. Volatilization, chlorine disinfection, and the disposal of backwash water play a minor role in the removal of both compounds. As a result of inefficient overall removal, HHCB and AHTN are a constant presence at low levels in finished drinking water.

AB Sewage and sewage sludge is known to contain pharmaceuticals, and since sewage sludge is often used as fertilizer within agriculture, the reduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Citalopram, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine and Fluoxetine during composting has been investigated. Sewage sludge was spiked with the SSRIs before the composting experiment started, and the concentration of the SSRIs in the sludge during a 21 day composting period was measured by liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All the SSRIs had a significant decrease in concentration during the composting process. The highest reduction rates were measured for Fluoxetine and Paroxetine and the lowest for Citalopram. In addition three out of four known SSRI metabolites were found in all the samples, and two of them showed a significant increase in concentration during the composting period. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We developed an original analytical method for monitoring five estrogens, nine androgens, nine progestogens, six glucocorticoids, and one mineralocorticoid in one water sample using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and then 45 river, 13 discharging sites, and 4 composite effluent samples were analyzed to reveal their occurrence and sources in urban rivers. Of the 45 river samples, androgens were the dominant steroids detected (total concentrations up to 480 ng/L), followed by glucocorticoids (up to 52 ng/L), progestogens (up to 50 ng/L), and estrogens up to 9.8 ng/L. The summed concentration for each class of detected hormones in 13 discharging site samples was higher than that in river samples, up to 1887 ng/L for androgens, 390 ng/L for glucocorticoids, 75 ng/L for progestogens, and 25 ng/L for estrogens, A principal component analyses with multiple linear regression based on the profiles of all target compounds was applied to identify the source apportionment and to predict the contribution from different sources, It was found that 62.7% of the mean summed hormones were contributed by freshly discharged untreated sewage, 29.4% by treated sewage and/or naturally attenuated untreated sewage, and 7.9% by an unknown source, possibly pharmaceutical manufacturing plants.

AB The removal efficiency for 220 micropollutants was studied at the scale of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) upgraded with post-ozonation followed by sand filtration. During post-ozonation, compounds with activated aromatic moieties, amino functions, or double bonds such as sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, or carbamazepine with second-order rate constants for the reaction with ozone >10(4) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 (fastreacting) were eliminated to concentrations below the detection limit for an ozone dose of 0.47 g O(3) g(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Compounds more resistant to oxidation by ozone such as atenolol and benzotriazole were increasingly eliminated with increasing ozone doses, resulting in >85% removal for a medium ozone dose (similar to 0.6 g O(3) g(-1) DOC). Only a few micropollutants such as some X-ray contrast media and triazine herbicides with second-order rate constants <10(2) M(-1) s(-1) (slowly reacting) persisted to a large extent. With a medium ozone dose, only 11 micropollutants of 55 detected in the secondary effluent were found at > 100 ng L(-1). The combination of reaction kinetics and reactor hydraulics, based on laboratory and full-scale date, enabled a quantification of the results by model calculations. This conceptual approach allows a direct upscaling from laboratory- to full-scale systems and can be applied to other similar systems. The carcinogenic by-products N-nitrosodimethylamine (NOMA),(<= 14 ng L(-1)) and bromate (<10 mu g L(-1)) were produced during ozonation, however their concentrations were below or in the range of the drinking water standards. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that biological sand filtration is an efficient additional barrier for the elimination of biodegradable compounds formed during ozonation such as NOMA. The energy requirement for the additional post-ozonation step is about 0.035 kWh m(-3), which corresponds to 12% of a typical medium-sized nutrient removal plant (5 g DOC m(-3)).

AB The objective of the present study was to analyse the behaviour of activated carbon with different chemical and textural properties in nitroimidazole adsorption, also assessing the combined use of microorganisms and activated carbon in the removal of these compounds from waters and the influence of the chemical nature of the solution (pH and ionic strength) on the adsorption process. Results indicate that the adsorption of nitroimidazoles is largely determined by activated carbon chemical properties. Application of the Langmuir equation to the adsorption isotherms showed an elevated adsorption capacity (X-m = 1.04-2.04 mmol/g) for all contaminants studied. Solution pH and electrolyte concentration did not have a major effect on the adsorption of these compounds on activated carbon, confirming that the principal interactions involved in the adsorption of these compounds are non-electrostatic. Nitroimidazoles are not degraded by microorganisms used in the biological stage of a wastewater treatment plant. However. the presence of microorganisms during nitroimidazole adsorption increased their adsorption on the activated carbon, although it weakened interactions between the adsorbate and carbon surface. In dynamic regime, the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon was markedly higher in surface water and groundwater than in urban wastewaters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tens of thousands of man-made chemicals are in everyday use in developed countries. A high proportion of these, or their transformation products, probably reach the aquatic environment. A considerable amount is known about the environmental concentrations of some of these chemicals (such as metals), especially the regulated ones, but little or nothing is known about the majority. In densely populated countries, most or all rivers will receive both diffuse (e.g. agricultural runoff) and point source (e.g. sewage treatment plant effluent) inputs, and hence be contaminated with complex, ill-defined mixtures of chemicals. Most freshwater organisms will be exposed, to varying degrees, to this contamination. The number of species exposed is in the thousands, and quite possibly tens of thousands. Little is known about whether or not these species are adversely affected by the chemicals present in their environment. Often it is not even known what species are present, let alone whether they are affected by the chemicals present. In a few high-profile cases (e.g. tributyl tin causing imposex in molluscs and oestrogens 'feminizing' male fish), chemicals have undoubtedly adversely affected aquatic species, occasionally leading to population crashes. Whether or not other chemicals are affecting less visible species (such as most invertebrates) is largely unknown. It is possible that only very few chemicals in the freshwater environment are adversely affecting wildlife, but it is equally possible that some effects of chemicals are, as yet, undiscovered (and may remain so). Nor it is clear which chemicals may pose the greatest risk to aquatic organisms. All these uncertainties leave much to chance, yet designing a regulatory system that would better protect aquatic organisms from chemicals is difficult. A more flexible and intelligent strategy may improve the current situation. Finally, the risk due to chemicals is put into context with the many other threats, such as alien species and new diseases that undoubtedly can pose significant risks to aquatic ecosystems.

AB Organic chemicals discharged in urban wastewater from industrial and domestic sources, or those entering through atmospheric deposition onto paved areas via surface run-off, are predominantly lipophilic in nature and therefore become concentrated in sewage sludge, with potential implications for the agricultural use of sludge as a soil improver. Biodegradation occurs to varying degrees during wastewater and sludge treatment processes. However, residues will probably still be present in the resulting sludge and can vary from trace values of several micrograms per kilogram up to approximately 1 per cent in the dry solids for certain bulk chemicals, such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, which is widely used as a surfactant in detergent formulations. However, the review of the scientific literature on the potential environmental and health impacts of organic contaminants (OCs) in sludge indicates that the presence of a compound in sludge, or of seemingly large amounts of certain compounds used in bulk volumes domestically and by industry, does not necessarily constitute a hazard when the material is recycled to farmland. Furthermore, the chemical quality of sludge is continually improving and concentrations of potentially harmful and persistent organic compounds have declined to background values. Thus, recycling sewage sludge on farmland is not constrained by concentrations of OCs found in contemporary sewage sludges. A number of issues, while unlikely to be significant for agricultural utilization, require further investigation and include: (i) the impacts of chlorinated paraffins on the food chain and human health, (ii) the risk assessment of the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a bulk chemical present in large amounts in sludge, (iii) the microbiological risk assessment of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms in sewage sludge and sludge-amended agricultural soil, and (iv) the potential significance of personal-care products (e.g. triclosan), pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds in sludge on soil quality and human health.

AB Adsorption on activated carbon has been successfully used in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants for the removal of various pollutants. Among them, pharmaceutical compounds have become a growing issue. The present study has focused on levodopa molecule, which is one of the drugs used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The adsorption of levodopa onto three activated carbons from different source materials is reported for the first time and analyzed according to both textural and surface chemical properties of the carbons.
   The activated carbons are characterized using low temperature nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetry analysis and Boehm titration. The equilibrium isotherms are measured at 25 degrees C and five models (Langmuir, Jovanovic, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Khan) are evaluated to fit the experimental data. The characteristic parameters of each isotherm model are optimized and the selection of the most adequate one is performed using statistical regression criteria. For two of the studied carbons the adsorption process can be well described by Freundlich model with an average relative error of 5%, while for the last carbon only three-parameter models gives good fitting.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in different water bodies and the findings of effects on aquatic organisms in ecotoxicity tests have raised concerns about environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in receiving waters. Due to the fact that the amount of ecotoxicological studies has increased significantly during the last decade, probabilistic approaches for risk characterization of these compounds may be feasible. This approach was evaluated by applying it to 22 human-used pharmaceuticals covering both pharmaceuticals with a high volume and high ecotoxicity, using ecotoxicological effect data from laboratory studies and comparing these to monitoring data on the effluents from sewage treatment plants in Europe and pharmaceutical sales quantities. We found that for 19 of the 22 selected pharmaceuticals the existing data were sufficient for probabilistic risk characterizations. The subsequently modeled ratios between monitored concentrations and low-effect concentrations were mostly above a factor of 100. Compared to the current paradigm for EU environmental risk assessment where a safety factor of 10 or 100 might have been used it seems that for the modeled compounds there's a low environmental risk. However, similarly calculated ratios for five pharmaceuticals (propranolol, ibuprofen, furosemide, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were below 100. while ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin are considered to be of high concern due to lack of ecotoxicity studies. This paper shows that by applying probabilistic approaches, existing data can be used to execute a comprehensive study on probability of impacts, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.

AB Photodegradation characteristics of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the effectiveness of H2O2 addition for PPCPs photodegradation during UV treatment were examined in this study. Average k (1st order rate constant) value for all the PPCPs investigated increased by a factor of 1.3 by H2O2 addition during UV treatment using biologically treated water (TW) spiked with the 30 PPCPs. Therefore, the effectiveness of H2O2 addition for PPCPs removal during UV treatment in real wastewater treatment process was expected. It could be also known that H2O2 addition would improve photodegradation rates of PPCPs highly resistant for UV treatment such as DEET, ethenzamide and theophylline. UV dose required for 90% degradation of each PPCP was calculated from k values obtained in UV and UV/H2O2 treatment experiments using TW spiked with 30 PPCPs. For UV treatment, UV dose required for degrading each PPCP by 90% of initial concentration ranged from 38 mJ cm(-2) to 5644 mJ cm(-2). indicating that most of PPCPs will not be removed sufficiently in UV disinfection process in wastewater treatment plant. For UV/H2O2 treatment, all the PPCPs except seven PPCPs including cyclophosphamide and 2-QCA were degraded by more than 90% by UV irradiation for 30 min (UV dose: 691 mJ cm(-2)), indicating that H2O2 addition during UV treatment will be highly effective for improving the degradation of PPCPs by UV, even though much higher UV dose is still necessary comparing to for UV disinfection.

AB Amphoteric pharmaceuticals are released to the environment in treated wastewater, medicated aquaculture feed, and through land disposal of livestock wastes and municipal biosolids. These wastes are rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which may bind and potentially enhance pharmaceutical transport in the environment. To assess this potential, the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (CIP) was chosen as a model amphoteric pharmaceutical to quantify DOC-water sorption coefficients (K-doc, L kg(-1) DOC) for four reference humic materials with varying chemical properties, digested and undigested municipal biosolids, treated municipal wastewater. and beef lagoon wastewater. For reference humic materials, the predominance of sorption by cation exchange was exemplified by decreasing sorption with increasing pH and ionic strength, as well as highly predictable relationships between the sorbed CIP concentration normalized to the DOC charge versus the free aqueous concentration of the CIP cation. In contrast to humic materials, however, sorption to DOC from digested biosolids was low and showed no pH dependence, suggesting that additional weaker mechanisms contributed to binding interactions. CIP had no quantifiable affinity for DOC from undigested biosolids, treated wastewater, or beef lagoon wastewater. With K-doc values of similar to 10(4) L kg(-1) estimated for CIP concentrations reported in biosolids (similar to 20-60 mu g kg(-1) wwt), the DOC measured for digested biosolids in this study (40 mg L-1) could increase CIP mobility by up to similar to 15%, thus DOC-facilitated transport should be considered in environmental fate assessments for amphoteric pharmaceuticals. However, the potential for waste-derived DOC to enhance CIP transport would have been greatly overestimated using information derived only from reference humic materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In hospitals a large variety of substances are in use for medical purposes such as diagnostics and research. After application, diagnostic agents, disinfectants and excreted non-metabolized pharmaceuticals by patients reach the wastewater. Indeed, some of the substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be a possible cause of the cancers observed in the last decades. Genotoxicity tests are an excellent means to study the toxicity and the risk associated with these releases. This paper points out the areas of concern for hospital wastewater disposal and reports the findings of genotoxicity tests for hospital effluents from 3 major hospitals in Delhi. namely All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Apollo and Escorts. Mutagenicity of hospital wastewaters from effluent treatment plants (before and after treatment) was studied. The results of this study show that the genotoxicity of hospital wastewaters is highly reduced after the treatment process. This study calls for establishment of advanced and effective effluent treatment plants in the hospitals, which are merely dumping the wastewaters in the municipal sewerage system. The results of this study call for further detailed study in this area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of clofibric acid from aqueous solution has been investigated in catalytic and non-catalytic semicontinuous ozonation runs. Kinetic data were analyzed using second order expressions for the reaction between organics and ozone or hydroxyl radicals. Catalytic runs used a commercial titanium dioxide catalyst consisting of fumed colloidal particles. The kinetic constant of the non-catalytic ozonation of clofibric acid at pH 3 was 8.16 x 10(-3) +/- 3.4 x 10(-4) L mmol(-1) s(-1). The extent of mineralization during non-catalytic runs ranged from 50% at pH 7 to 20% at pH 3 in a reaction that essentially took place during the first 10-20 min. The catalyst increased the total extent of mineralization, its effect being more important during the first part of the reaction. The pseudo-homogeneous catalytic rate constant was 2.17 X 10(-2) L mmol(-1) s(-1) at pH 3 and 6.80 x 10(-1) L mmol(-1) s(-1) at pH 5, with up to a threefold increase with respect to non-catalytic constants using catalyst load of 1 g/L. A set of stopped-flow experiments were designed to elucidate the role of catalyst. whose effect was probably due to the adsorption of organics on catalytic sites rather than to the promotion of ozone decomposition.

AB There are several papers in the literature that have recorded satisfactory results for the degradation of different pharmaceuticals in aqueous solutions by means of oxidation processes; however. only a few of them relied on real samples in carrying out their investigations. This study examines the results of the performance of photo-induced oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, ozonation and peroxone in degrading the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (CIP) in a hospital effluent. The real samples were collected from the treatment system of the University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM). Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) was used to monitor the decrease of the CIP concentration. As expected, photo-induced oxidation was much slower than the other processes in bringing about total CIP degradation. Both heterogeneous photocatalysis and peroxone led to almost complete CIP degradation after 60 min treatment. Ozonation showed the best performance: total degradation after 30 min treatment. This was an unexpected result in view of the greater capacity of the other two processes to generate hydroxyl radicals. However, this finding supports a result in the literature that has tended to be overlooked. The by-products formed during the application of the processes were found to be very similar. Moreover, on the basis of the data obtained from the literature, there is some evidence to suggest that the by-products are derived from the oxidation of the piperazine group. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB We found that acetaminophen could be effectively transformed and removed from water by laccase-mediated oxidative coupling processes. The removal of acetaminophen followed second-order kinetics with first-order to the concentrations of both the substrate and the enzyme. Mass spectrum analysis demonstrated that polymerization through radical-radical coupling mechanism was the pathway leading to acetaminophen transformation. Coupling products thus formed are believed to be biologically inactive and more readily removable from water. Secondary mass spectra of the dimers in combination with molecular modeling analysis further elucidated that the coupling proceeded via covalent bonding between two molecules at their unsubstituted carbons in benzene rings. These findings demonstrated that laccase-mediated oxidative coupling can potentially serve as an alternative strategy to control certain micropollutants in water/wastewater treatment and reuse.

AB The removal of five selected pharmaceuticals, viz., carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen was examined by batch sorption experiments onto a synthesized mesoporous silica SBA-15. SBA-15 was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement, and point of zero charge (PZC) measurement. Pharmaceutical adsorption kinetics was rapid and occurred on a scale of minutes, following a pseudo-second-order rate expression. Adsorption isotherms were best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. High removal rates of individual pharmaceuticals were achieved in acidic media (pH 3-5) and reached 85.2% for carbamazepine, 88.3% for diclofenac, 93.0% for ibuprofen, 94.3% for ketoprofen, and 49.0% for clofibric acid at pH 3 but decreased with increase in pH. SBA-15 also showed high efficiency for removal of a mixture of 5 pharmaceuticals. Except for cloflbric acid (35.6%), the removal of pharmaceuticals in the mixture ranged from 75.2 to 89.3%. Based on adsorption and desorption results, the mechanism of the selected pharmaceuticals was found to be a hydrophilic interaction, providing valuable information for further studies to design materials for the purpose. The results of this study suggest that mesoporous-silica-based materials are promising adsorbents for removing pharmaceuticals from not only surface water but also wastewater of pharmaceutical industrial manufactures.

AB Attempts were made in this study to examine the combined polyferric sulfate (PFS) coagulation, Fenton and sedimentation process for treatment of non-degradable antibiotic fermentation wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 66.6% of color and 72.4% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were removed under the optimum conditions of PFS dosage 200 mg/L and pH 4.0. In addition, optimal parameters of Fenton process were determined to be 150 mg/L of H2O2 dosage, 120 mg/L of FeSO4 and 1 h of reaction time. When Fenton treated effluent was controlled at pH 7.0, the pollutants could be further removed by sedimentation process. The overall color, COD and suspended solids (SS) removal reached 97.3%. 96.9% and 86.7% under selected conditions, respectively. Thus this study might offer an effective way for wastewater treatment of antibiotics manufacturer and pharmaceutical industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The plant nutrients consumed in human society today are lost through the established wastewater treatment systems in industrialised countries as well as via insufficient or non-existent handling of sewage in the developing world. New sanitation systems have been designated to overcome this failure. The source separated wastewater streams collected within these systems contain a high nutrient content, and can be used as fertiliser as well as soil conditioner after appropriate storage and/or treatment. Application in agriculture with existing techniques is feasible. However, pathogens and pharmaceuticals contained in these fertiliser types are a potential hazard. Nevertheless, storage and appropriate treatment can minimise the risks. The products deriving from these systems have a high potential to preserve available plant nutrient resources and deficiencies in agriculture as well as being able to substitute synthetic plant nutrients and at the same time prevent unwanted environmental nutrient over-enrichment.

AB The ozonation of four pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) in ultra-pure (UP) water was studied in the pH range between 2.5 and 9. The experiments allowed the determination of the apparent rate constants for the reactions between ozone and the selected compounds. The values obtained varied depending on the pH, and ranged between 239 and 1.27 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) for metoprolol; 2.62 x 10(4) and 2.97 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) for naproxen; 2.31 x 10(3) and 1.21 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) for amoxicillin: and 215 and 1.57 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) for phenacetin. Due to the acidic nature of these substances, the degree of dissociation of each pharmaceutical was determined at every pH of work, and the specific rate constants of the neutral and ionic species formed were evaluated. Additionally, the simultaneous ozonation of the pharmaceuticals in different water matrices was carried out by considering a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and three secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants. The influence of the operating conditions (initial ozone dose, nature of pharmaceuticals and type of water) on the pharmaceuticals elimination efficiency was established, and a kinetic model was proposed for the evaluation of the partial contribution to the global oxidation of both, the direct ozonation reaction and the radical pathway.

AB Removal of four antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine and trimethoprim) and four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) using extended sludge age biological process was investigated. The sludge age of the biological system was greater than 200 d. Hydraulic retention time of 12 h was maintained throughout the experiment. The extended sludge age biological process is able to treat pharmaceuticals with good and steady removal efficiencies: 64-93% removal for antibiotics over 1-5 mu g L-1 influent concentrations and 94% to complete removal for acetaminophen and ibuprofen with a wide range of influent concentrations 1-100 mu g L-1. For ketoprofen and naproxen the removal efficiencies are 79-96% over a range of 1-15 mu g L-1 influent concentrations. The removal efficiency decreases with increasing initial concentrations for all target compounds except for ibuprofen. This indicates that the initial influent concentration is an important parameter for the studies of fate of pharmaceuticals. The amount of bio-mass and size of the reactor required to achieve good and steady removal efficiencies for known influent pharmaceutical concentrations are also suggested in this study.

AB Pharmaceutical substances such as 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the active component of the contraceptive pill, are often not eliminated during wastewater treatment and are persistent in the environment. Using solid-phase extraction and chromatography methods for analyzing low concentrations of EE2 and metabolites, biodegradability of EE2 was studied using four bacteria grown under aerobic conditions in the absence or presence of a readily available carbon source (2.5 g/L of adipic acid or glucose). Preliminary identification of produced metabolites was also completed. In presence of a cosubstrate, Rhodococcus erythropolis removed EE2 up to 47% of its initial concentration (1.4 and 0.5mg/L) in 13 h, while it removed only 10% after 75 h without a cosubstrate. In the presence of a cosubstrate, Rhodococcus equi removed EE2 up to 39% of its initial concentration (1.4mg/L) after 65 h, whereas no significant EE2 removal was observed using Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Rhodococcus zopfii. Preliminary analysis of EE2 transformation products confirmed the presence of phenol and a compound of high molecular weight (331 amu). These results improve our understanding of the effect of common biological wastewater treatment variables such as bacteria strains, acclimation, and presence of cosubstrate, on the removal of EE2.

AB The mechanism of product formation during ozonation of two widely used antimicrobial agents, macrolide roxithromycin and inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) trimethoprim was studied in laboratory-scale experiments with two types of matrix: distilled water and secondary wastewater effluent The structures of the primary and secondary reaction intermediates were elucidated by quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqToF) instrument, showing that in spite of their high ozone affinity both roxithromycin and trimethoprim oxidation pathway involve to a great degree the center dot OH radical chain reactions. In total nine ozonation products were detected, whereas two products of roxithromycin exhibited high refractoriness to ozonation, especially in the case of distilled water. Furthermore, the intact tertiary amine moiety of roxithromycin in these products suggests that the antimicrobial activity of the parent compound will be preserved.

AB Fluoxetine, the active ingredient of many antidepressants, was identified as specifically toxic toward algae in a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis with literature data for algae, daphnia, and fish. The goal of this study was to elucidate the mode of action in algae and to evaluate the toxicity of the major human metabolites of fluoxetine using two different algae tests. The time dependence and sensitivity of the different effect endpoints yield information on the physiological mode of action. Baseline toxicity was predicted with QSARs based on measured liposome-water partition coefficients. The ratio of predicted baseline toxicity to experimental toxicity (toxic ratio TR) gives information on the intrinsic potency (extent of specificity of effect). The metabolite p-trifluoromethyl phenol was classified to act as baseline toxicant Fluoxetine (TR 60-150) and its pharmacologically active metabolite norfluoxetine (TR 10-80) exhibited specific toxicity. By comparison with reference compounds we conclude that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have an effect on the energy budget of algal cells since the time pattern of these two compounds is most similar to that observed for norflurazon, but they act less specifically as indicated by lower TR values and the similarity of the effect pattern to baseline toxicants, The mixture toxicity of fluoxetine and its human metabolites norfluoxetine and p-TFMP can be predicted using the model of concentration addition for practical purposes of risk assessment despite small deviations from this model for the specific endpoints like PSII inhibition because the integrative endpoints like growth rate and reproduction in all cases gave agreement with the predictions for concentration addition.

AB Emerging pollutants inherent in reclaimed municipal wastewater, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), often have cast uncertainties on the safety of water reuse. We examined the fate and transport behavior of several PPCP and EDC compounds through observations made at experimental turf fields irrigated with naproxen, clofibric acid, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, estrone, 4-tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A, 4-n-nonylphenol, and triclosan latent irrigation water. The potential of the compounds to contaminate underlying groundwater was assessed using three screening protocols that employed the attributes of soils, chemicals, and water fluxes as the estimators. No compound was detected in the leachate draining through the 89-cm profile of a loamy sand soil and a sandy loam soil turf grass field during four months of irrigation according to operations typical of golf courses in southern California (USA). Ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, bisphenol A, clofibric acid, and estrone were detected in the surface to 30-cm soil profiles. Higher irrigation rate and coarser textural soil enhanced the downward movement of chemicals in both soils. The pollution risk screenings identified the same six compounds as having the potential to contaminate groundwater, and under conditions of turf grass irrigation, clofibric acid and ibuprofen would be most prone to cause the pollution.

AB A biomarker approach was undertaken using the mussel Elliptio complanata to assess the ecotoxicological effects after injection of a range concentration (0-10 mM) of three different PPCPs: carbamazepine, caffeine, methotrexate; and an effluent extract (C8) from St. Lawrence wastewaters treatment plant (Montreal, Canada). A battery of biomarkers, involving oxidative stress and genotoxicity responses: glutation-S-transferase (GST), ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), dibenzylflourescein dealkylase (DBF), xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activities, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were determined in gonad and digestive gland tissues after 48 h of injection. Results showed an induction of the oxidative metabolism with increasing pharmaceutical concentration in those mussels injected with the PPCPs and the effluent extract. Phase I detoxification enzymes were significantly induced (p<0.05), concretely DBF activity was significantly induced after caffeine. carbamazipine and C8 injection; and EROD activity after C8 and methotrexate injection. Oxidative stress induction only lead to lipid peroxidation (p<0.05) in organisms injected with carbamazepine and caffeine and DNA damage in organisms injected with methotrexate (p<0.05). EROD and DBF enzymatic activities have been found to be suitable biomarkers to determine bioavailability of pharmaceuticals. LPO and DNA damage to determine possible associated adverse effects. Nevertheless, their validation in realistic exposure scenarios and under exposure conditions should be performed in future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effects of three ions, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ on biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by a functional strain Xhhh were investigated. Through orthogonal tests, Cu2+ was determined to be the most important factor influencing Xhhh biodegradation performance. Biodegradation kinetic experiments demonstrated that with Cu2+ concentration at about 2.00 mg l(-1), the maximum of specific growth rate and specific degradation rate were obtained to be 0.033 and 0.075 d(-1), respectively. The optimal levels of Mn2+ (5.00 mg l(-1)), Cu2+ (2.00 mg l(-1)) and Zn2+ (5.00 mgl(-1)) were achieved based on experimental results of their effects on the activities of manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase, and biodegradation kinetic parameters. Among three types of biodegradation kinetic models (Monod, Tessier and Contois), Tessier model was found most reasonable for kinetics description of Xhhh growth (R-2 = 0.995) and pollutants degradation (R-2 = 0.970) in the case of metals optimization. Both kinetics evaluation and experimental results demonstrated that optimization with the three metals made a great contribution to Xhhh growth and COD removal for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The use of membrane processes for wastewater treatment and reuse is rapidly expanding. organic, inorganic, and biological constituents are effectively removed by reverse osmosis (RO) membrane processes, but concentrate in membrane retentates Disposal of membrane concentrates is a growing concern. Applying advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to RO retentate is logical because extensive treatment and energy inputs were expended to concentrate the organics, and it is cheaper to treat smaller flowstreams. AOPs (e.g., UV irradiation in the presence of titanium dioxide; UV/TiO(2)) can remove a high percentage of organic matter from RO retentates. The combination of AOPs and a simple biological system (e.g., sand filter) can remove higher levels of organic matter at lower UV dosages because AOPs produce biologically degradable material (e.g., organic acids) that have low hydroxyl radical rate constants, meaning that their oxidation, rather than that of the primary organic matter in the RO retentate, dictates the required UV energy inputs. At the highest applied UV dose (10 kWh m(-3)), the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the RO retentate decreased from similar to 40 to 8 mg L(-)1, of which approximately 6 mg L(-)1 were readily biologically degradable. Therefore, after combined UV treatment and biodegradation, the final DOC concentration was 2 mg L(-)1, representing a 91% removal. These results suggest that UV/TiO(2) plus biodegradation of RO retentates is feasible and would significantly reduce the organic pollutant loading into the environment from wastewater reuse facilities.

AB The aim of this work was to assess the treatment of wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical plant through a continuous heterogeneous catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) process using an Fe2O3/SBA-15 nanocomposite catalyst. This catalyst was preliminary tested in a batch stirred tank reactor (STR), to elucidate the influence of significant parameters on the oxidation system, such as temperature, initial oxidant concentration and initial pH of the reaction medium. In that case, a temperature of 80,C using an initial oxidant concentration corresponding to twice the theoretical stoichiometric amount for complete carbon depletion and initial pH of ca. 3 allow TOC degradation of around 50% after 200 min of contact time. Thereafter, the powder catalyst was extruded with bentonite to prepare pellets that could be used in a fixed bed reactor (FBR). Results in the up-flow FBR indicate that the catalyst shows high activity in terms of TOC mineralization (ca. 60% under steady-state conditions), with an excellent use of the oxidant and high stability of the supported iron species. The activity of the catalyst is kept constant, at least, for 55 h of reaction. Furthermore, the BOD5/COD ratio is increased from 0.20 to 0.30, whereas the average oxidation stage (AOS) changed from 0.70 to 2.35. These two parameters show a high oxidation degree of organic compounds in the outlet effluent, which enhances its biodegradability, and favours the possibility of a subsequent coupling with a conventional biological treatment.

AB The application of sonolysis (US) for remediation of wastewater is an area of increasing interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonic (US) process on the degradation of pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DCF), amoxicillin (AMX), carbamazepine (CBZ)) in single solutions and also in three mixtures spiked in urban wastewater effluent. Several operating conditions, such as power density (25-100 W L-1), initial substrate concentrations (2.5-10 mg L-1), initial solution pH (3-11), and air sparging were varied for the evaluation and understanding of the process. The degradation (as assessed by measuring UV absorbance), the generation of hydroxyl radicals (as assessed measuring H2O2 concentration), the mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), and the aerobic biodegradability (as assessed by the BOD5/COD ratio) were monitored during sonication. Ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lepidium sativum before and after treatment was also evaluated.
   It was found that the pharmaceuticals conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air. The reaction rate increases with increasing initial concentration of single pharmaceuticals but it remains constant in the mixtures, indicating different kinetic regimes (i.e. first and zero order respectively). Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than pharmaceuticals to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable. The toxicity of the wastewater samples before and after contamination with pharmaceuticals both in mixtures and in single substance-containing solutions was observed more severely on P. subcapitata; a fact that raises concerns in regards to the discharge of such effluents. D. magna displayed less sensitivity compared to P. subcapitata because it belongs in a lower taxonomic species than D. magna. The germination index of L. sativum in the presence of the drugs' mixture was stimulated instead of inducing any toxicity effect and this might be attributed to the fact the sample, laden with very low drug concentrations was able to act as a provider of additional nutrient elements.

AB The main objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the decomposition and mineralization of nitroimidazoles (Metronidazole [MNZ], Dimetridazole [DMZ], and Tinidazole [TNZ]) in waste and drinking water using gamma irradiation; (2) to study the decomposition kinetics of these nitroimidazoles; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy of nitroimidazole removal using radical promoters and scavengers. The results obtained showed that nitroimidazole concentrations decreased with increasing absorbed dose. No differences in irradiation kinetic constant were detected for any nitroimidazole studied (0.0014-0.0017 Gy(-1)). The decomposition yield was higher under acidic conditions than in neutral and alkaline media. Results obtained showed that, at appropriate concentrations, H2O2 accelerates MNZ degradation by generating additional HO center dot; however, when the dosage Of H2O2 exceeds the optimal concentration, the efficacy of MNZ degradation is reduced. The presence of t-BuOH (HO center dot radical scavenger) and thiourea (HO center dot, H-center dot and e(aq)(-) scavenger) reduced the MNZ irradiation rate, indicating that degradation of this pollutant can take place via two pathways: oxidation by HO center dot radicals and reduction by e(aq)(-) and H-center dot. MNZ removal rate was slightly lower in subterranean and surface waters than in ultrapure water and was markedly lower in wastewater. Regardless of the water chemical composition, MNZ gamma irradiation can achieve i) a decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon, and ii) a reduction in the toxicity of the system with higher gamma absorbed dose.

AB Degradation kinetics and mineralization of an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent contaminated with a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds composed of amoxicillin (10 mg L-1), carbamazepine (5 mg L-1) and diclofenac (2.5 mg L-1) by TiO2 photocatalysis were investigated. The photocatalytic effect was investigated using both spiked distilled water and actual wastewater solutions. The process efficiency was evaluated through UV absorbance and TOC measurements. A set of bioassays (Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lepidium sativum) was performed to evaluate the potential toxicity of the oxidation intermediates. A pseudo-first order kinetic model was found to fit well the experimental data. The mineralization rate (TOC) of the wastewater contaminated with the pharmaceuticals was found to be really slow (t(1/2) = 86.6 min) compared to that of the same pharmaceuticals spiked in distilled water (t(1/2) = 46.5 min). The results from the toxicity tests of single pharmaceuticals, their mixture and the wastewater matrix spiked with the pharmaceuticals displayed a general accordance between the responses of the freshwater aquatic species (P. subscapitata > D. magna). in general the photocatalytic treatment did not completely reduce the toxicity under the investigated conditions (maximum catalyst loading and irradiation time 0.8 g TiO2 L-1 and 120 min respectively).

AB This paper explored a novel process for wastewater treatment, i.e. microwave enhanced Fenton-like process. This novel process was introduced to treat high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater with initial COD loading of 49,912.5 mg L-1. Operating parameters were investigated and the optimal condition included as follows: microwave power was 300 W, radiation time was 6 min, initial pH was 4.42, H2O2 dosage was 1300 mg L-1 and Fe-2(SO4)(3) dosage was 4900 mg L-1, respectively. Within the present experimental condition used, the COD removal and UV254 removal reached to 57.53% and 55.06%, respectively, and BOD5/COD was enhanced from 0.165 to 0.470. The variation of molecular weight distribution indicated that both macromolecular substances and micromolecular substances were eliminated quite well. The structure of flocs revealed that one ferric hydrated ion seemed to connect with another ferric hydrated ion and/or organic compound molecule to form large-scale particles by means of van der waals force and/or hydrogen bond. Subsequently, these particles aggregated to form flocs and settled down. Comparing with traditional Fenton-like reaction and conventional heating assisted Fenton-like reaction, microwave enhanced Fenton-like process displayed superior treatment efficiency. Microwave was in favor of improving the degradation efficiency, the settling quality of sludge, as well as reducing the yield of sludge and enhancing the biodegradability of effluent. Microwave enhanced Fenton-like process is believed to be a promising treatment technology for high concentration and biorefractory wastewater. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emulsion liquid membrane technique was used for the extraction of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution of waste sodium clichromate recovered from the pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, Span-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent. Trioctyl amine and Aliquat-336 were used as carriers. The emulsion stability was carried out at different surfactant concentration, agitation speed and emulsification time. Statistical experimental design was applied for the optimization of process parameters for the extraction of chromium by emulsion liquid membrane. The effects of process parameters namely, agitation speed, membrane to emulsion (M/E) ratio and carrier concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using a response surface method. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium (VI) using response surface methodology for Trioctyl amine were: agitation speed - 201.369 rpm, M/E ratio - 0.5887% (v/v) and carrier concentration - 4.0932% (v/v) and for Aliquat-336: agitation speed 202.097 rpm, M/E ratio - 0.5873% (v/v) and carrier concentration - 3.9211% (v/v). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 89.2% and 96.15% using Trioctyl amine and Aliquat-336, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To respond to concerns associated with wastewater-derived contaminants water utilities are looking for new approaches for monitoring trace organic chemicals in conventional and advanced water treatment processes. This study examines the use of a combination of surrogate parameters and indicator Compounds tailored to monitor the removal efficiency of advanced oxidation processes employed by treatment plants engaged in indirect potable water reuse programs. Potential surrogate parameters and indicator compounds, identified by reviewing previous publications and classified by their structural properties, were tested in pilot- and full-scale treatment systems. Dilantin, DEET, meprobamate, and iopromide are good indicators to assess optimized oxidation conditions while ozonating tertiary-treated wastewaters. UVA reduction, ozone byproduct formation, such as simple organic acids, and ozone exposure correlated with "sweet spot" compounds, where ozone exposure correlated with trace organic removal across five tertiary-treated wastewaters. Findings indicate that the proposed framework can serve as a conservative monitoring approach for advanced oxidation processes as well as other indirect potable reuse processes to ensure proper removal of identified and unidentified wastewater-derived organic contaminants, to detect failures in system performance, and is protective of public health.

AB Seven transformation products of carbamazepine generated by at least one of three common water treatment technologies (W-radiation, oxidation with chlorine dioxide (ClO2), and biological treatment with activated Sludge) were identified by complementary use of ion trap, single quadrupole, and quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometers. Acridine was formed during all of the three treatment processes, while acridine 9-carbaldehyde was identified as an intermediate during ClO2 oxidation. Further treatment of acridine with ClO2 produced 9-hydroxy-acridine, UV-treatment resulted in the formation of acridone, hydroxy-(9H,10H)-acridine-9-carbaldehyde, acridone-N-carbaldehyde, and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H-quinazoline-2,4-dione, while biological breakdown of acridine yielded acridone. In parallel, the transformation product iminostilbene was observed during sample analysis. In addition,this study compared the treatment technologies according to the removal of carbamazepine and the production and decay of its transformation products. The most successful method for the removal of carbamazepine was UV treatment, while acridine and acridone were more susceptible to biological treatment. Therefore, based on the enhanced biodegradability of carbamazepine residues achieved by UV irradiation, we propose a coupled treatment technology involving an initial UV treatment step followed by biological treatment, which may satisfactorily remove the parent compound and its transformation products.

AB A treatability study of pharmaceutical wastewater from El-Nasr Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company, South-East of Cairo, was carried out. The company discharges both industrial (6000 m(3)/d) and municipal wastewater (128 m(3)/d) into a nearby evaporation pond without any treatment. The generated raw wastewater is characterized by high values of COD (4100-13,023), TSS (20-330 mg/L), and oil grease (17.4-600 mg/L). In addition, the presence of refractory compounds decreases BOD/COD ratio (0.25-0.30). Analysis of raw wastewater confirmed that pre-treatment is required prior to discharge into public sewers to comply with the Egyptian Environmental laws and regulations. The obtained results indicated that the refractory compounds and their by-products cannot be readily removed by biological treatment and always remain in the treated effluent or adsorbed on the sludge flocs. The application of Fenton oxidation process as a pre-treatment improved the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater and appears to be an affective solution to achieve compliance with the law legislation with respect to discharge in a determined receptor medium.

AB Water samples from four Taiwanese wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) employing secondary treatment processes were evaluated for a sweep of pharmaceuticals, and analysis of the mass loads and removal efficiencies of the compounds identified were conducted. Fifty-seven compounds were detected, including significant amounts of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), psychostimulants (caffeine), antibiotics, and beta-blockers, as well as trace levels of estrogens, vasodilators, psychiatric drugs, and lipid-regulators. Total loads ranged from 10 to 13 and 1.2 to 3.3 g/(d 1000) inhabitants for influents and effluents, respectively. NSAIDs were the main constituent (61-69%) in the water entering three WWTPs. Removal efficiencies varied among WWTPs; high removal rates (72-100%) were generally achieved for NSAIDs, estrogens, and caffeine, but some antibiotics groups (macrolides, penicillin, and imidazole) were not removed at all in many cases. This study also identified 17 mostly detected and persistent pharmaceuticals, of which caffeine, cephalexin, atenolol, and ibuprofen had the highest influent concentrations (up to 17,500, 4367, 2883, and 17,933 ng/L). These medications are used worldwide in significant amounts, and as shown here, the residuals which escape WWTP processing emerge as the primary pollutants for downstream receiving water bodies.

AB Much attention has been devoted recently to the fate of pharmaceutically active compounds such as tetracycline antibiotics in soil and water. Tetracycline (TC) biodegradability by activated sludge derived from membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating swine wastewater via CO(2)-evolution was evaluated by means of modified Sturm test, which was also used to evaluate its toxicity on carbon degradation. The impact of tetracycline on a semi-industrial MBR process was also examined and confronted to lab-scale experiments. After tetracycline injection in the pilot, no disturbance was detected on the elimination of organic matters and ammonium (nitrification), reaching after injection 88% and 99% respectively; only denitrification was slightly affected. Confirming the ruggedness and the superiority of membrane bioreactors over conventional bioreactors, no toxicity was observed at the considered level of TC in the pilot (20 mg TOC L(-1)), while at lab-scale sodium benzoate biodegradation was completely inhibited from 10 mg TOC L(-1) TC. The origin of the activated sludge showed a significant impact on the performances, since the ultimate biodegradation was in the range -50% to -53% for TC concentrations in the range 10-20 mg TOCL(-1) with conventional bioreactor sludge and increased to 18% for 40 mg TOCL(-1) of TC with activated sludge derived from the MBR pilot. This confirmed the higher resistance of activated sludge arising from membrane bioreactor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chitobiase is one of two enzymes responsible for cleaving the chitin polymers that form arthropod exoskeletons and has been found to be predictive of secondary production for marine and freshwater zooplankton. Since chitobiase is released into water during molting by aquatic arthropods, it is possible that ambient chitobiase activity may be a useful proxy of secondary production in aquatic systems. In the present study, surface water samples from the upper Tennessee River basin, USA, were collected and analyzed for chitobiase to determine how enzyme levels vary with season, water depth, and proximity to sewage treatment outfalls. Additionally, chitobiase activity was correlated with three pharmaceutical compounds to assess if changes in chitobiase activity were associated with contaminants derived from sewage treatment plants. Chitobiase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in the fall relative to other seasons. Further, chitobiase activity displayed significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between surface and subsurface samples and was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with pharmaceutical concentrations in summer samples. These results indicate the potential for chitobiase as an assessment tool in estimating secondary production and as an ecotoxicological indictor.

The liquid membrane used was composed of kerosene oil as the solvent, Span-80 as the surfactant and potassium hydroxide as internal reagent and Aliquat-336 as carrier. The process parameters, namely feed concentration, pH, internal reagent concentration and surfactant concentration on the extraction of chromium were optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions for the extraction of chromium(VI) were: feed concentration (223.55 ppm), pH (2.73), internal reagent concentration (0.72 N) and surfactant concentration (1.91%, w/w). At the optimized condition the maximum chromium extraction was found to be 97.57%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been widely detected in the environment, and are a source of increasing concern. One of the major challenges in assessing the risk associated with EDCs in the environment is that their environmental concentrations are typically extremely low - on the order of ng L-1 to mu g L-1 - making them difficult to quantify without extensive pre-concentration procedures. Further complicating their detection is the fact that they are present in mixtures, sometimes with tens to hundreds of other compounds (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, detergents, natural organic matter).
   The objective of the work described here was to develop a method for rapid monitoring and detection of EDCs at trace concentrations in natural waters. The method makes use of a W-transparent polymer-based concentrator to be used as a passive sampling device. The UV-transparent polymer-based concentrator serves both as a solid phase extraction medium to concentrate EDCs for analysis and exclude many compounds likely to interfere with detection (fines. macromolecules such as organic matter, ionic surfactants), and as an analytical optical cell, allowing rapid EDC quantification without labor-intensive preconcentration procedures. A full-spectrum deconvolution technique is used to determine EDC concentrations from measured UV absorbance spectra in the polymer.
   Experiments were conducted to measure partitioning rate behavior and partition coefficients between the selected polymer (a functional polydimethylsiloxane) and water for seven compounds known or suspected of being endocrine disruptors: estrone, progesterone, estradiol, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone, phenanthrene, triclosan, and 4-nonylphenol. The method was tested for its ability to detect and quantify individual compounds in mixtures containing up to six components. Results show the method to have selectivity suitable for rapid screening applications at many sites where multiple compounds are present. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most conventional wastewater treatment plants remove very small amounts of micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. Here, the ability of two different types of submerged nanofiltration flat sheet modules to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater is analyzed. The two nanofiltration membranes were used at relatively low pressures of only 0.3 and 0.7 bar. At such low pressures, the membranes did not retain salts to a great extent. This is advantageous in wastewater treatment because no salt concentrate is produced. Carbamazepine was retained only slightly by the nanofiltration membranes, whereas approximately 60% of diclofenac and naproxen were retained by both membranes. This level of effectiveness might not be enough to justify the use of such a system as an additional treatment step in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Background: There is an enhanced international awareness that the improper disposal of unwanted and unused medications may have a detrimental effect on the environment.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of unused medications in New Zealand that are not returned to a pharmacy for disposal and are instead disposed of via land fill or water systems. In addition, this study intended to identify why these medications were unused or unwanted. Design: An online survey was placed on the New Zealand National Poisons Centre website for a period of three months during 2008. This consisted of a series of questions with predefined answer sets and asked about collection of medications, why there may be unused medications, storage of medications and disposal of medications.
   Results: This survey was completed by 452 individuals. 62% of respondents currently had unwanted medications in their house. The most common reason for people to have leftover medication was 'medical condition improved or resolved' (n = 307). Depending on formulation type. between 13-24% of unused medications were returned to pharmacies with tablets and capsules being most likely to be returned and liquids most likely to be added to water systems.
   Conclusions: A significant percentage of unwanted medications are disposed of via routes that have the potential to adversely affect the environment. Reducing excess medications and wastage as well as education of appropriate disposal techniques may minimize their potential impact on the environment. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of triclosan, a widely-used antibacterial chemical, is currently unknown in higher trophic-level species such as marine mammals. Blood plasma collected from wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Charleston, SC (CHS) (n = 13) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) (n = 13) in 2005 was analyzed for triclosan. Plasma concentrations in CHS dolphins ranged from 0.12 to 0.27 ng/g wet weight (mean 0.18 ng/g), with 31% of the sampled individuals having detectable triclosan. The mean IRL dolphin plasma concentrations were 0.072 ng/g wet weight (range 0.025-0.11 ng/g); 23% of the samples having detectable triclosan. In the CHS area, triclosan effluent values from two WWTP were both 190 ng/L and primary influents; were 2800 ng/L and 3400 ng/L Triclosan values in CHS estuarine surface water samples averaged 7.5 ng/L (n = 18) ranging from 4.9 to 14 ng/L This is the first study to report bioaccumulation of anthropogenic triclosan in a marine mammal highlighting the need for further monitoring and assessment.

AB Background, aim, and scope Pharmaceutically active substances are a class of emerging contaminants, which has led to increasing concern about potential environmental risks. After excretion, substantial amounts of unchanged pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are discharged into domestic wastewaters. The absence of data on the environmental exposure in Eastern Europe is significant, since use patterns and volumes differ from country to country. In Romania, the majority of wastewater, from highly populated cities and industrial complex zones, is still discharged into surface waters without proper treatment or after inefficient treatment. In respect to this, it is important to determine the environmental occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewaters and surface waters. The objective of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of selected PPCPs during the transport in the Somes River by mass flow analysis before and after upgrading a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Cluj-Napoca, which serves 350,000 inhabitants and is the largest plant discharging into the Somes River. The concentrations of PPCPs at Cluj-Napoca can be correlated with the high population and a high number of hospitals located in the catchment area leading to higher mass flows. The results of this study are expected to provide information, with respect to the Romanian conditions, for environmental scientists, WWTP operators, and legal authorities. The data should support the improvement of existing WWTPs and implementation of new ones where necessary and, therefore, minimize the input of contaminants into ambient waters.
   Materials and methods The PPCPs were selected on the basis of consumption at the regional scale, reported aquatic toxicity, and the suitability of the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method for the determination of the compounds at trace levels. The studied PPCPs, caffeine ( stimulant), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), pentoxifylline ( anticoagulant), cyclophosphamide ( cytostatic), ibuprofen ( analgesic), and galaxolide ( musk fragrance), were determined in samples of the Somes River. The analytes were enriched by solid-phase extraction and subsequently determined by GC/MS. Caffeine, pentoxifylline, and galaxolide were determined underivatized, whereas the acidic pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, and ibuprofen were determined after derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide.
   Results and discussion The concentrations in the Somes River varied from below 10 ng/L up to 10 mu g/L. A substantial decrease of the exposure in the Somes River could be observed due to the upgrade of the municipal WWTP in Cluj-Napoca. The loads in the river stretch between Cluj-Napoca and Dej ( Somes Mic) varied strongly: caffeine (400-2,000 g/day), carbamazepine (78-213 g/day), galaxolide (140-684 g/day), ibuprofen (84-108 g/day). After the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca, the concentrations in the Somes of caffeine, pentoxifylline, cyclophosphamide, galaxolide, and tonalide were significantly reduced (over 75%). One might be cautious comparing both studies because the relative efficiency of the WWTP's removal of PPCP was not evaluated. However, the significantly lower concentrations of most compounds after the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca allow one to infer that the technical measures at the source substantially reduced inputs of contaminants to the receiving river. Dej loads of the poorly biodegradable substance carbamazepine increased by a factor of 2-3 as a result of wastewater discharges into the river. The disproportionate increase in caffeine loads by a factor of 4 below Cluj-Napoca indicates inputs of untreated wastewater from the Somes Mare due to the discharge of untreated wastewater derived from Bistrita, Nasaud, and Beclean ( 115,000 inhabitants).
   Conclusions The relative contribution of treated and untreated wastewater in surface water might be assessed by measuring chemical markers. Recalcitrant pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine are suitable as chemical markers for estimating the relative contribution of wastewater in surface water. The easily degradable caffeine might be a good indicator for raw sewage and hardly treated wastewaters.
   Recommendations and perspectives Municipal WWTPs have the potential of a significant contribution in reducing the load of contaminants to ambient waters. The efficiency of the wastewater treatment in Cluj-Napoca improved considerably after the upgrade of the WWTP. Therefore, it is crucial that several WWTPs must be implemented or improved in the Somes Valley Watershed in order to reduce the discharge of contaminants in the Somes River from these point sources.

AB Background, aim and scope Water is a renewable resource and acceptable quality is important for human health, ecological and economic reasons, but human activity can cause great damage to the natural aquatic environment. Managing the water cycle in a sustainable way is the key to protect natural resources and human health. On a global level, the microbiological contamination of water sources is a major problem in connection with poverty and the United Nations Millennium Development Declaration is an important initiative to handle this problem. In terms of environmental health, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) circulate globally; as they travel long distances, they are found in remote areas far from their original source of application and can cause damage wherever they move to. On a global scale, United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) issued the Stockholm Convention to reduce POPs; in the European Union (EU), one intention of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to reach the good chemical status of waters; beside these regulations, there are other directives in support of these goals. The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the Stockholm Convention and the WFD allows meeting the targets of protection of human and environmental health, which are established in the different directives and how could we approach the targets.
   Materials and methods The aims and scopes of different directives are compiled and compared with the actual quality of water, different approaches of standard settings are compared and potential treatment options are discussed. Results Under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into force in May 2004, governments are required to develop a National Implementation Plan ( NIP) setting out how they will address their obligations under the convention and how they will take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment by the use of best available techniques ( BAT) and application of best environmental practices (BEP). On a European level, the WFD has been in place as the main European legislation to protect our water resources and the water environment of Europe since 2000. It requires managing river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services of any specific water body. Nevertheless, the goals of other directives as for drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological, priority substances and priority hazardous substances (PS/PHS) contamination. Following the detection of substances, a risk assessment with sound effect data needs to be performed also for regulatory decisions and priorisation of measures to remove emerging contaminants. Beside personal care products and industrial contaminants, faecal pollution of recreational waters is one of the major hazards facing users, although microbial contamination from other sources as well as chemical and physical aspects also affects the suitability of water for recreation. As in arid and semiarid areas, wastewater is considered for irrigation with regulatory needs of hygienic and chemical parameters-health-based targets-to avoid the contamination of crops and food. In surface waters, currently, the relationships between physical and chemical properties and the biological state of surface waters were quite well-understood to enable the management of catchments and rivers to achieve ecological quality.
   Discussion Nevertheless, more work is needed to find out the actual impact of the regulations for single chemicals and complex mixtures, in terms of environmental quality standards to achieve a 'good chemical status', on the good biological status. In a next step after the adoption of the list of PS/PHS substances, which also includes the POPs, the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) needs to be adjusted and existing or new treatment options (BATs) should comply with the new requirements of the different directives.
   Conclusions Relevant substances threaten human health and the environment by new effects such as CMR, endocrine-disrupting effects or neurotoxicity which are not yet considered in an adequate way by assessment methods and regulatory standards and the application of abatement technologies. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals helps to control the sources, but WFD, the Stockholm Convention and UWWTD need to be harmonised and a rolling revision process should react on new developments. Finally, to answer the question if the Stockholm Convention and the WFD (2000/60/EC) could reach the target-I would state that they provide a very valuable frame to approach the targets, but there is still way to go to reach them on an EU level and on a global scale, also under the aspects of the Stockholm Convention and the Millennium Development Goals.
   Perspectives The compilation of the goals of different regulations and combined actions will save a lot of administrative efforts and money.

AB Every day more than 500 million cubic meters of treated wastewater are discharged into rivers, estuaries, and oceans, an amount slightly less than the average flow of the Danube River. Typically, wastewaters have high organic carbon [OC) concentrations and represent a large fraction of total river flow and a higher fraction of river OC in densely populated watersheds. Here, we report the first direct measurements of radiocarbon (C-14) in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. The radiocarbon ages of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC) in effluent are old and relatively uniform across a range of WWTPs in New York and Connecticut. Wastewater DOC has a mean radiocarbon age of 1630 +/- 500 years B.P. and a mean delta C-13 of -26.0 +/- 1 parts per thousand. Mass balance calculations indicate that 25% of wastewater DOC is fossil carbon, which is likely derived from petroleum-based household products such as detergents and pharmaceuticals. These findings warrant reevaluation of the "apparent age" of riverine DOC, the total flux of petroleum carbon to U.S. oceans, and OC source assignments in waters impacted by sewage.

AB For the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutants from wastewater by ozone, the ozone rate constants of the micropollutants and the kinetics of the reaction of ozone with wastewater must be known. The latter is multiphasic with k = 0.071 (mg DOQ)(-1) s(-1) for the first mg/L ozone (at a DOC of 7.2 mg/L) followed by 0.011 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) the next 5 mg/L ozone and the k = 0.0019 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) for subsequent 4 mg/L ozone as determined by stopped-flow and batch-quench methods. An analysis of gel permeation and UV absorption data indicates that the wastewater DOC is largely polymeric, and at 12 mg/L the concentration of its subunits must be near 100 mu M with epsilon(254 nm) approximate to 3000 M(-1) cm(-1). The center dot OH radical yield as determined by the tertiary butanol assay is similar to 13%. From its dose dependence, it follows that new center dot OH-generating sites are formed during ozonation. The center dot OH scavenging capacity of the wastewater DOC has been determined at 3 x 10(4) (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1). The contribution of bicarbonate to the OH scavenging capacity is small in comparison, similar to 10% of DOC. Simulations indicate that at 5 mg/L ozone only the most reactive (k > 3 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) micropollutants; are fully eliminated but at 10 mg/L ozone the slow ozone decay starts to contribute and even the much less reactive ones (k = 300 M(-1) s(-1)) are oxidized (25% remaining).

AB Aims: To investigate whether the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) communities of replicate nitrifying bioreactors (i) co-evolve or diverge over time and (ii) are stable or dynamic during periods of complete nitrification.
   Methods and Results: Three sequential batch reactors (SBR) were inoculated with sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, fed with ammonium- enriched tap water and operated in parallel for 134 days. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) demonstrated co-evolvement of the AOB communities over time. During start-up, temporary decreases in nitrification were noticed, and the AOB community rate of change values (Delta(t(week))) were medium to high (12-22%). During the adjacent period of complete nitrification, low AOB community dynamics were observed (Delta(t)(week) < 5%). Further pragmatic processing of the DGGE profiles revealed a high range-weighted richness and a medium functional organization of the AOB communities.
   Conclusions: After a start-up period, high functional stability and low dynamics of the AOB communities were observed. Deterministic rather than stochastic driving forces led to AOB community co-evolvement in the replicate SBR.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Replicates in identical set-ups are reproducible, and pragmatic processing of DGGE patterns is a straightforward tool to score and compare the functionality of the bacterial communities.

AB BACKGROUND: Large amounts of pharmaceutical compounds are consumed throughout the world, and after being metabolized in humans are discharged into water streams. Some of them are not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants and, as a result, they are found in some effluents as well as in surface and ground waters.
   RESULTS: Four pharmaceutical compounds (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin and phenacetin) frequently found in wastewaters were selected to be individually photo-oxidized in ultra-pure water by monochromatic UV radiation. The influence of independent variables (pH, temperature, and additional presence of hydrogen peroxide) was established, and first-order rate constants and quantum yields evaluated. The compounds were also oxidized using Fenton's reagent and, after establishing the influence of the operating conditions (ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide concentrations, pH and additional presence of UV radiation), the rate constants for the radical reaction between each pharmaceutical and hydroxyl radicals were determined. Finally, the simultaneous photo-oxidation of mixtures of the selected pharmaceuticals in several types of water (commercial mineral water, groundwater and reservoir water) was performed by means of UV radiation alone and by the combination UV/H2O2. The influence of the independent variables in these processes was discussed, and the kinetic study allowed the determination of various rate constants for each compound.
   CONCLUSION: As the pharmaceutical concentrations theoretically calculated by the proposed kinetic model agree well with the experimental results obtained, this model constitutes an excellent tool to predict the elimination of these compounds when they are present in different natural waters.

AB Bed sediments are the major sink for many contaminants in aquatic environments. With increasing knowledge of and research on the environmental occurrence of antibiotics, there has been growing interest in their behaviour and fate in aquatic environments. However, there is little information about the behaviour of antibiotics in a dynamic water/sediment environment, such as river and coastal marine water. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (1) to study the transport and distribution of four common antibiotics between water and sediment in both dynamic and quiescent water/sediment systems and (2) to understand the persistence and possible degradation of the four antibiotics in the two different systems.
   A lid-driven elongated annular flume, designed to reduce the centrifugal effect, was used to simulate a dynamic water environment. In addition, a quiescent water/sediment experiment was conducted for comparison with the dynamic water system. The seawater and sediment, used in both experiments of flowing and quiescent water/sediment systems, were collected from Victoria Harbour, a dynamic coastal environment in an urban setting. The four antibiotics selected in this study were ofloxacin (OFL), roxithromycin (RTM), erythromycin (ETM), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), the most commonly used antibiotics in South China.
   Antibiotics in an overlying solution decreased very quickly in the flume system due to the sorption to suspended particles and surface sediment. There were significant differences in the adsorption of the four antibiotics in sediment. OFL showed a high tendency to be adsorbed by sediment with a high K (d) value (2980 L/Kg), while the low K (d) values of SMZ indicated that there was a large quantity in water. The four antibiotics reached a depth of 20-30 mm in the sediment over a period of 60 days in the flume system. However, the compounds were only found in surface sediment (above 10 mm) in the quiescent system, indicating the influence of the dynamic flume system on the distribution of antibiotics in sediment. OFL showed a moderate persistence in the dynamic flume system, while other three antibiotics had less persistence in sediment. However, all of the four compounds showed moderate persistence in the quiescent system.
   The study showed the rapid diffusive transfer of antibiotics from water to sediment in the dynamic flume system. The four antibiotics exhibited larger differences in their adsorption to sediment in both dynamic and quiescent systems due to their different K (d) values. The high sorption of antibiotics to marine sediment may reduce their availability to benthic invertebrates.

AB In the early 1990s different studies highlighted the relationship between pharmaceuticals, human health and the environment. Among the emerging contaminants, antibiotics are obviously of high concern, because of their potential for inducing antibiotic resistance. In addition, natural and synthetic hormones are relevant because of their potential endocrine-disrupting effects on wildlife. This investigation focuses on the analysis of four classes of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals (sulfonamides. tetracyclines, analgesics and hormones) in surface water and wastewater in Luxembourg. The selected eleven pharmaceuticals include four sulfonamides (sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine), two tetracyclines (tetracycline and oxytetracycline), two analgesics (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and three hormones (2 naturals, estrone and beta-estradiol, and a synthetic one, 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol). The most innovative parts of this study are the simultaneous extraction of the above-mentioned pharmaceuticals as well as tracking their behaviour during flood events in a small river catchment. The method includes pre-concentration by solid phase extraction using Oasis (R) HLB (Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance) which gave superior results compared to Chromabond (R) C-18EC. Chromabond (R) EASY and Bond Elut (R) PLEXA cartridges, also evaluated in this investigation. The analysis of the investigated pharmaceutical compounds is carried out by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The limits of quantification were 1 ng L-1, except for beta-estradiol (2 ng L-1) and 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol (6 ng L-1). Recovery rates range from 70 to 94%, with relative standard deviations between 4 and 19%. Application of this method to river concentration and flood events revealed high concentrations of ibuprofen (10-4000 ng L-1), with highest levels during flood events, while concentrations of estrogens (1-240 ng L-1) and sulfonamides (1-20 ng L-1) were comparatively low.

AB The occurrence of 18 commonly used pharmaceuticals was investigated in an agricultural area, which is primarily affected by runoff from agricultural fields and septic systems, on the coastline of Maumee Bay, within the western Lake Erie basin. Selected pharmaceuticals were detected in surface water, except clofibric acid and fluoxethine. The most frequently detected compounds were caffeine (88%), carbamazepine (57%) and paraxanthine (56%). Caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and paraxanthine were detected with maximum concentrations of 4.2, 1.2, 2.8 and 1.8 mu g L(-1), respectively. However, no compound was detected in any sediment samples. In a field receiving biosolids application, pharmaceuticals were detected in the field tile drainage following biosolids application but not in soil. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water can be linked to the use of septic systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of refractory gadolinium (Gd) complexes as paramagnetic contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging has resulted in point source release of anthropogenic Gd (Gd(Anth)) into the environment, and presents opportunities to trace the fate of wastewater in natural environments. We demonstrate an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique that is capable of detecting Gd(Anth) at concentrations as low as 48 fM, approximately six orders of magnitude lower than most other micropollutants, without the need for preconcentration. Further, we establish the ubiquitous presence of Gd(Anth) in wastewater at eight separate wastewater treatment plants in Brisbane, Australia, over a 3-month time period. in contrast, there is no evidence of Gd(Anth) in tap water, or in four separate regional water supply dams in South East Queensland, Australia. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that other anthropogenic micropollutants sourced from urban wastewater would be present in the drinking water supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing attention has been given to pollution of the water environment by pharmaceutical compounds discharged from wastewater treatment plants. High-pressure driven membranes such as a nanofiltration (NF) membrane and a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane are considered to be effective for control of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment. In practical applications of NF/RO membranes to municipal wastewater treatment, feed water for the membranes always contains organic macromolecules at concentrations of up to 10 mg-TOC/L, which are mainly composed of soluble microbial products (SMPs) produced during biological wastewater treatment such as an activated sludge process. In this study, influence of these organic macromolecules on removal of six pharmaceuticals by NF/RO membranes (UTC-60 and LF10) was investigated. Two types of biological treatment (conventional activated sludge process followed by media filtration (i.e., tertiary treatment) and treatment with a membrane bioreactor (MBR)) were examined as pretreatments for NF/RO membranes in this study. In the filtration tests with wastewater effluents, removal of the pharmaceuticals was higher than that seen with deionized pure water spiked with the pharmaceuticals. The increase was significant in the case of the NF membrane. Both alteration of membrane surface properties due to membrane fouling and association of the pharmaceuticals with organic macromolecules contributed to the increase in removal of pharmaceuticals by the membranes. Characteristics of the organic macromolecules contained in the wastewater effluents differed depending on the type of treatment, implying that removal of pharmaceuticals by NF/RO membranes is influenced by the type of pretreatment employed.

AB Various pharmaceutical residues are being discharged from wastewater treatment works (WTW) effluents, the impact of which on river water quality is of high relevance to environmental risk assessment. The concentrations of eleven pharmaceutical compounds were determined in three WTWs in England, and the river Ouse receiving effluents from Scaynes Hill WTW. Results show that five compounds propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, indomethacine and diclofenac were detected in all wastewater and river water samples, with carbamazepine showing the highest concentrations (up to 2336 ng L(-1)) in WTW influent. Different compounds were removed to different extent in the WTWs. varying from 43 to 92%, with the highest performance obtained by the WTW with tertiary treatment (sand filtration). The pharmaceutical residues from Scaynes Hill WTW were eventually discharged into the river Ouse, causing an elevation in their concentrations downstream of the outfall. This was confirmed by the good agreement between measured concentrations and those predicted by a simple dilution model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effectiveness of UV-based processes (UV and UV/H2O2) for the removal of pharmaceuticals in real wastewater using bench-scale experiment setup with a treatment capacity of 10 m(3)/day was investigated. Forty-one kinds of pharmaceuticals including 12 antibiotics and 10 analgesics were detected in secondary effluent used for tested water. For UV process a good removal seems to be expected for just a few pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen, diclofenac and antipyrine. Especially, the removal efficiencies of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin, erythromycin and azithromycin for UV alone process were found to be very low even by the introduction of considerable UV dose of 2768 mJ/cm(2). For UV/H2O2 process, a 90% removal efficiency could be accomplished in 39 pharmaceuticals at UV dose of 923 mJ/cm(2), indicating that it will be possible to reduce UV energy required for the effective pharmaceuticals removal by the combination of H2O2 with UV process.

AB The removal of biological or pharmaceutical compounds through the wastewater treatment becomes relevant. These compounds are present as traces in sewage. In this work, we propose a coupling process which combines the pre-concentration of the pollutant by selective extraction and then degradation of these pollutants by photocatalysis in presence of TiO2. This process is efficient at room temperature by activation of a photocatalyst (TiO2) under UV light. Aromatic amino acids were chosen as model of pharmaceutical pollutants. Their extraction from water, ensured by calixarene derivatives, and their photocatalytic degradation were investigated. It was shown that photodegradation follows a first-order kinetic and that the rate constant enhances with amino acid concentration. The effect of the pH on the rate constant will be discussed.

AB This work is focused on the study of the role of several conductive-diamond characteristics (boron doping, sp(3)/sp(2) ratio, diamond-layer thickness) on the performance of the electrolysis of enrofloxacin (as model complex-organic pollutant). Commercial lots provided by an important conductive-diamond manufacturing company have been used. Results show that enrofloxacin electrooxidation is strongly influenced by the conductive-diamond characteristics; particularly the ratio diamond/graphite carbon was found one of the most significant parameters in this process: the higher the content in diamond-carbon the greater the TOC and COD decays in the bulk electrolyses. These results have been interpreted in terms of the oxidation mechanism involved. High graphite content favours direct oxidation of the pollutant on the electrode surface and leads to the formation of many intermediates. On contrary, high diamond content seems to favour the complete oxidation of the organic to carbon dioxide, thanks to the contribution of the oxidants (hydroxyl radicals and electrogenerated reagents) present in a region close to the electrode surface. Likewise, the oxidation rate seems to be improved with increase in the concentration of boron and decrease in the thickness of the substrate layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation products (OPs)formed during ozonation of metoprolol were identified via liquid chromatography and hybride Qq LIT-MS. Experiments carried out at pH 3 and 8 showed the formation of different OPs, depending on pH. The analysis of samples with and without tertiary butanol (t-BuOH) revealed the influence of OH radical reactions. The OH radical exposure was measured by adding a probe compound (para-chlorobenzoic acid, pCBA). Elucidation of chemical structures confirmed the formation of aldehyde moieties as well as the occurrence of hydroxylation reactions. Several reaction pathways for the formation of the oxidation products are proposed. Analysis of ozonated raw wastewater and the effluent of a Municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with 10 mu M metoprolol exhibited a similar OP formation pattern as detected in the reaction system at pH 8 without a radical scavenger. This indicates a significant impact of OH radical exposure on the formation of OPs in real wastewater matrices.

AB Nitration reactions of aromatic compounds are commonly involved in different industrial processes for pharmaceutical, pesticide or military uses. For many years, most of the manufacturing sites used lagooning systems to treat their process effluents. In view of a photocatalytic degradation assay. the wastewater of a lagoon was investigated by using HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. The wastewater was highly concentrated in RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) and two herbicides Dinoterb (2-tert-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol) and Dinoseb (2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol). First of all, an analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with HPLC ESI MS/MS was put in work for identification and titration of RDX, HMX and the two dinitrophenols in a complex natural matrix. Then, the UV/TiO2 treatment was investigated for pollutants removal. Dinitrophenolic compounds were significantly degraded after a 8-h-exposition of the wastewater/TiO2 suspension, whereas RDX and HMX were poorly affected. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive analysis of Turkish antibiotic data was conducted to evaluate potential environmental risks associated with antibiotic consumption in Turkey for year 2007. Antibiotics were defined for systemic use or group J01 of the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Total emissions and prescriptions for each ATC group were classified separately into 17 different J01 categories and three forms of medication (capsule/tablets, injectables and suspensions). Capsules and tablets were found as the most emitted form of medication in year 2007, with a total emission rate of about 585.5 tons/year (76%). Total antibiotic emission rates including all forms of medications were determined to be about 664.2 tons/year (86%) and 110.1 tons/year (14%) for adult and pediatric patients, respectively. An environmental risk assessment of 8 human antibiotics was conducted according to the EU draft guidance (CEC/III/5504/94, draft 6, version 4) and the risk was indicated by the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for the aquatic environment. Available acute and chronic toxicity data were collected from the open peer-reviewed literature to derive PNEC. Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were then calculated for 8 pharmaceutical substances. PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded 1.0 for beta-lactams (cephalosporins and penicillins), fluoroquinolones, macrolides and aminoglycosides. The findings of this study concluded that the release of these compounds from wastewater treatment plants may potentially be of an important environmental concern based on today's use of antibiotics in Turkey.

AB The technical feasibility and performance of photocatalytic degradation of anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen (ACTP) and beta-blocker atenolol (ATL) have been studied in a well-defined system of a pilot-plant scale Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPCs) under natural illumination. Heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO2) and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton were investigated with two different matrices: distilled water and synthetic municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent (S.E.). The initial concentrations of the pharmaceuticals studied were 10 mg L-1, whereas the concentrations of the catalysts employed were 200 mg L-1 of TiO2 and 5 mg L-1 of iron. Total disappearance of the parent compounds and discreet mineralization were attained in all experiments. Furthermore, kinetic parameters, release of heteroatoms and formation of carboxylic acids are discussed. The main intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of atelonol has been structurally elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) experiments performed at quadrupole-time of flight (QqToF) mass analyzer coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC). Six transformation products were characterized, formed by consecutive attacks of hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) radical in concomitance with the disappearance of the primary compound. The proposed TiO2 and photo-Fenton degradation route of ATL is reported for the first time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent from the secondary clarifier of an Urban Sewage Treatment Plant was oxidized by the combined and simultaneous use of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The purpose was to increase the wastewater's reuse potential by improving water quality. The removal of dissolved organic chemicals was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. These conditions led to almost complete mineralization in less than 1 h. Under similar conditions, without the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was no higher than 35%. The evolution of TOC was related to the concentration of hydroxyl radicals using a second-order kinetic model in which the exposure to hydroxyl radical was included by assuming a quasi-steady-state approximation. The concentration of hydroxyl radical was computed using the experimental data from ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The kinetic constants for the hydroxyl-mediated mineralization process were determined for wastewaters collected during a 1-year sampling campaign. The results showed that the mineralization process takes place in two periods whose rate constants were linked to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ratio and to the chloride content of wastewaters. During the first part of the runs, the specific rate of mineralization was high, before subsequently decreasing after a period of 5-15 min by an average factor of 6.4 whose 95% confidence interval was in the 3.4-9.3 range. The moles of TOC removed per mole of ozone consumed were in the range of 9.2-17.7 mg O-3/mg TOC measured at maximum ozone efficiency, which always occurred within the first 10 min.

AB Photo-treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals in effluents is a topic currently under discussion. In some countries effluents from hospitals are directly emitted into open ditches without any further treatment and with very little dilution. Under such circumstances photo-degradation in the environment can occur. However, photo-degradation does not necessarily end up with the complete mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, photo-product biodegradability and toxicity against environmental bacteria is of interest. Hospital effluents have often a pH around 9. Therefore, photo-oxidation (150 W medium-pressure Hg-lamp, batch reactor) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) was studied at pH 9. The primary elimination of CIP was monitored and structures of photo-products were assessed by liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Five compounds were identified as probable products of photo-defluorination, -decarboxylation and loss of the piperazine moiety. These photo-products were not biodegradable in the Closed Bottle test - OECD 301 D. They did not affect Vibrio fisheri in the applied concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological nutrient removal and the fate of two estrogenic compounds, bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,4-dicholorophenol (2,4-DCP) were studied using a sequencing anoxic/anaerobic-aerobic membrane bioreactor (SAM) which was fed with synthetic water and operated at SRT of 60 days. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), COD, BPA and 2,4-DCP removal performances were evaluated. The SAM showed efficient COD removal (>99%) throughout the period of operation. The TN and TP removal efficiencies were 74.3 +/- 4.7% and 79.1 +/- 7.2%, respectively. The removal efficiency of BPA and 2,4-DCP was 74.3% and 78% on average basis respectively. A mass balance of both compounds was derived considering the hydraulic characteristics of the system, mass flux due to air stripping and quantity of adsorbed compound discharged with daily excess sludge wastage. The results indicated that biodegradation was the major removal path way from the system contributing above 80% of removal.

AB A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of almost 40 pharmaceuticals: including antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, analgesics, hypolipidemics, alpha- and beta-blockers, an anti cancer drug, anti-fungal agents, an opiate, an antibiotic, an anti-coagulant, a diuretic, an anti-anginal and an anti-diabetic compound. This was used to assess the contribution of pharmaceuticals originating from hospital effluents to one of Oslo city's wastewater treatment works. Some pharmaceuticals were found to contribute to more of the wastewater loading than others. 11% of the propranolol entering the wastewater treatment works stems from hospital effluent, approximately 2% of the atenolol, carbemazepine, metaprolol and atorvastatin, and for several other compounds the contribution is less than 1%.
   This assessment shows that point sources discharges from hospitals typically make a small contribution to the overall pharmaceutical load when compared to municipal areas. however this varies from substance to substance and is not the case when a drug's use is primarily hospital based.

AB There is an increased awareness that medicinal products for human use may cause negative effects in the environment. In Sweden a voluntary environmental classification system for drugs has been established in collaboration between producers, authorities and the public health care, and used for five years. The idea is to enhance the market demand for medicines with less environmental impact, which in turn will stimulate the producers to design future medicines to be more environmentally friendly. The system is open to the public and based on assessment of the active ingredient in the medicinal product into several classes of risk and hazard, respectively. It is closely related to the EMEA guidelines. Risk is expressed as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of the active ingredient (Al) and its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). The hazard is expressed in terms of the Al's persistence, potential to bioaccumulation, and eco-toxicity. Drug data for the classification are delivered by the respective producers.
   Hitherto more than 300 Al representing more than 50% of the Swedish volume of drug use, have been classified. Data for risk assessment were missing in 47% of Al. Among drugs with data 7% had a PEC/PNEC ratio >1, and another 7% had a ratio between 0.1 and 1. The Als with highest ratio (> 10) were two estrogens. Data for hazard assessment were lacking in 16% of the Al. Among drugs with environmental data 92% were not ready biodegradable, 23% had potential to bioaccumulation, and 61% were toxic to aquatic organisms at a concentration below 1 mg/l. These data are utilized by regional pharmaceutical expert groups when selecting substances to be recommended in public health care in Sweden. They may also be used by prescribing doctors who want to identify the environmentally most favourable substance among several with equivalent medical effect.
   We conclude that environmental data on human medicinal products are often missing, or reveal unfavourable environmental properties. A proper judgement of the environmental impact of an Al requires a joint evaluation of its risk and hazard. We suggest that the pharmaceutical producers should highlight environmental precaution when designing new Als, and that the environmental data should be transparent to the general public.

AB Pharmaceuticals for human use are consumed in significant quantities and their occurrence in aquatic systems has been reported by a number of authors. In the context of environmental risk assessment, there is an increasing interest in evaluating the discharge of pharmaceutical products to surface waters through sewage treatment plants (STP). This case study was carried out on a conventional biological treatment plant (Ales, France) and focused on a set of eleven drugs representing the main therapeutic classes. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) range from the low ng L-1 to 1.5 mu g L-1 in effluent and up to few hundred ng L-1 in receiving surface waters. There is a good agreement between MEC and predicted environmental concentration (PEC) values for seven of the eleven investigated drugs in STP effluent. There is not such a good match between PEC and MEC values in surface waters, and this highlights the limits of this approach, at the local scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Among all emerging substances in water, pharmaceutical products (PPs) and residues are a lot of concern. These last two years, the number of studies has increased drastically, however much less for water resources and drinking water than for wastewater. This literature review based on recent works, deals with water resources (surface or groundwater), focusing on characteristics, occurrence and fate of numerous PPs studied, and drinking water including water quality. Through this review, it appears that the pharmaceutical risk must be considered even in drinking water where concentrations are very low. Moreover, there is a lack of research for by-products (metabolites and transformation products) characterization, occurrence and fate in all water types and especially in drinking water.

AB In this study, occurrence of 66 PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in liquid and solid phases of sewage sludge was elucidated. The extraction methods for the PPCPs from sludge were newly developed employing Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) and Ultrasonic Solvent Extraction (USE). As an appropriate method, PLE using water (pH2), PILE using methanol (pH4), and USE using mixture of methanol and water (1/9,v/v, pH11) was found most effective because total recovery of most of the PPCPs indicated 40 to 130%. The developed extraction method with previously developed method for liquid phase analysis was applied to field survey at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan. 56 compounds were detected from the primary sludge and 61 compounds were detected from the excess sludge. The concentration was ranged between several ng/g and several mu g/g. Solid-water distribution coefficient (Log K-d) ranged between 0.9 L/kg (Caffeine) and 3.7 L/kg (Levofloxacin) for primary sludge and between 1.4 L/kg (Sulpirid) and 4.3 L/kg (Mefenamic acid) for excess sludge.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutically active chemicals (PACs) in the natural aquatic environment is recognized as an emerging issue due to the potential adverse effects these compounds pose to aquatic life and humans. This study presents the monitoring of two major categories of PACs in surface water: steroid hormones and antibiotics. Surface water samples were collected in the fall season from 21 locations in suburban (4), agricultural (5) and mixed (12) use suburban and agricultural areas. The water samples collected were analyzed using GC/MS for aqueous concentration of eleven steroid hormones: six natural (17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, progesterone) and five synthetic (gestodene, norgestrel, levonorgestrel, medrogestone, trimegestone). In addition, 12 antibiotics (oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, lincomycin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, tylosin tartrate) were analyzed using LC/MS. Steroid hormones detected in surface water were: 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, estriol, estrone, progesterone and trimegestone. Estrone had the highest detection frequency of > 90% with concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 ng/l. The second most frequently detected estrogen was estriol (> 80%) with concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 19 ng/l. The detection frequency varied at different sampling locations. No antibiotics were detected in the 21 streams sampled. This study aims to give a better understanding on the presence, fate and transport of PACs derived from humans and animals.

AB Each year, large quantities of pharmaceuticals are consumed worldwide for the treatment and prevention of human and animal diseases. Although the drugs and the metabolites observed in the wastewaters and in the environment are present at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations required to exert their effects in humans or animals, their long-term impact on the environment is commonly not known. In this study, the occurrence of six antihistamines, which are used for the relief of allergic reactions such as hay fever, was determined in sewage treatment plants wastewaters and in recipient river waters.
   The occurrence of the antihistamines cetirizine, acrivastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine in sewage treatment plants wastewaters and in recipient river waters was studied. The analytical procedure consisted of solid-phase extraction of the water samples followed by liquid chromatography separation and detection by a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction mode.
   Cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine were detected in both influent and effluent wastewater samples at concentration levels ranging from about 80 to 220 ng/L, while loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine could not be detected in any samples. During sewage treatment, the concentration of the antihistamines dropped by an average of 16-36%. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of antihistamines were observed in samples collected during the season of most intensive plant pollen production, i.e. in May. In the river water samples, the relative pattern of occurrence of cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine was similar to that in the wastewater samples; although the concentration of the compounds was substantially lower (4-11 ng/L). The highest concentrations of the studied drugs were observed near the discharging point of the sewage treatment plant.
   The highest concentrations of antihistamines in STP wastewaters correlate with the outbreak of allergic reaction caused by high amounts of plant pollens in the air. The analysis results of the river water samples show that the antihistamines are carried far away from the effluent discharge points. They may account for a part of the mix of pharmaceuticals and of pharmaceutical metabolites that occur downstream of STPs.
   Antihistamines are poorly degraded/eliminated under the biological treatment processes applied in the wastewater treatment plants and, consequently, they are continuously being discharged along with other drugs to the aquatic environment.
   As a huge quantity and variety of drugs and their metabolites are continuously discharged to rivers and the sea, the compounds should be considered as contaminants that may possess risks to the aquatic ecosystem. Further studies are urgently needed on the environmental fate of the antihistamines and other pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. These studies should be concerned with the stability of the compounds, their transformation reactions and the identity of the transformation products, the distribution of drugs and their uptake and effects in organisms. On the basis of these studies, the possible environmental hazards of pharmaceuticals may be assessed.

AB Little is known about the significance of hospitals as point sources for emission of organic micropollutants into the aquatic environment A mass flow analysis of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics used in hospitals was performed on the site of a representative Swiss cantonal hospital. Specifically, we analyzed the consumption of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and cytostatics in their corresponding medical applications of radiology and oncology, respectively, and their discharge into hospital wastewater and eventually into the wastewater of the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Emission levels within one day and over several days were found to correlate with the pharmacokinetic excretion pattern and the consumed amounts in the hospital during these days. IN total emissions vary substantially from day to day from 255 to 1259 g/d, with a maximum on the day when the highest radiology treatment occurred. Parent cytostatic compounds reach maximal emissions of 8-10 mg/d. A total of 1.1%, 1.4%, and 3.7% of, the excreted amounts of the cytostatics 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (main metabolite of gemcitabine), respectively, were found in the hospital wastewater, whereas 49% of the total ICM was detected, showing a high variability among the compounds. These recoveries can essentially be explained by the high amount administered to out-patients (70% for cytostatics and 50% for ICM); therefore, only part of this dose is expected,to be excreted on-site. In addition, this study emphasizes critical issues to consider when sampling in hospital sewer systems. Flow proportional sampling over a longer period is crucial to compute robust hospital mass flows.

AB The reduction of ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 254 nm (UV(254)) and true color were identified as appropriate surrogates to assess the oxidation of six pharmaceuticals (i.e., carbamazepine, meprobamate, dilantin, primidone, atenolol, and iopromide) during ozonation of wastewater. Three tertiary-treated wastewaters were evaluated during oxidation with ozone (O(3)) and O(3) coupled with hydrogen peroxide (O(3)/H(2)O(2)). The correlation between pharmaceutical oxidation and removal of UV(254) was dependent upon the reactivity of each specific compound toward ozone, as measured by the second-order rate constant (k'(O3)). Oxidation of compounds with k'(O3) > 10(3) M(-1) s(-1) correlated well (R(2) > 0.73) with UV(254) reduction between 0-50%. Oxidation of compounds with apparent k'(O3) < 10 M(-1) s(-1) resulted primarily from hydroxyl radicals and correlated well (R(2) > 0.80) with the UV(254) reduction of 15-65%. The removal of true color also correlated well (R(2) > 0.85) with the oxidation of pharmaceuticals during the ozonation of two wastewaters. These correlations demonstrate that UV(254) reduction and true color removal maybe used as surrogates to evaluate pharmaceutical oxidation in the presence or absence of dissolved ozone residual during advanced wastewater treatment with O(3) or O(3)/H(2)O(2). The use of online UV(254) measurements would allow wastewater utilities to optimize the ozone dose required to meet their specific treatment objectives.

AB Major oxidation products (OPs) of the beta blocker propranolol, formed during ozonation in aqueous solution were identified and oxidation pathways were proposed. Ozonation led to a high number of OPs being formed. In total, chemical structures were elucidated for five different nominal masses (including constitutional isomers, approximately 13 signals), whereas at least eight other OPs and their isomers (similar to 30 signals) remained unidentified. The structural elucidation was performed via liquid chromatography coupled with hybride triple quadrupole with linear ion trap (LC-Qq LIT MS). The primary ozonation product, OP-291, was formed by ozone attacking the naphthalene ring, which resulted in the ring-opening and two aldehyde moieties being formed. OP-291 was further oxidized to OP-307, which was then oxidized to OP-281. Experiments were performed at pH 3 and pH 8, as well as in the presence and absence of a radical scavenger, Ozonation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents spiked with propranolol (10 mu M) led to the same OPs being formed as observed in the experiments with deionized water. Therefore, ozonation of WWTP effluent is resulting in the formation of a high number of OPs with an elevated toxic potential (i.e., formation of aldehydes).

AB We investigated the presence and fate of 16 antibiotics belonging to seven groups (beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim and amphenicols) in effluents of sewage plants and receiving waters in Hong Kong. Cefalexin, amoxicillin, ofloxacin and erythromycin-H2O were ubiquitous in sea water throughout Victoria Harbour, indicating continuous discharge to the environment. This is one of the few studies reporting the frequent occurrence of cefalexin and amoxicillin in sewage effluents and sea water (170-5070 and 64-1670 ng/L in sewage; 6.1-493 and 0.64-76 ng/L in sea water, respectively). Mass flows from seven sewage plants discharged an estimated total of 14.4 kg/day to the Harbour. Typhoon shelters also appeared to play an important role as sources of antibiotics, as evidenced by elevated concentrations within their boundaries. Mass balance estimations suggested significant quantities of antibiotics are discharged to the Harbour without passage through treatment plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land application of municipal biosolids can be a source of environmental contamination by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). This study examined PPCP concentrations/temporally discrete mass loads in agricultural tile drainage systems where two applications of biosolids had previously taken place. The field plots received liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) in the fall of 2005 at an application rate of similar to 93,500 L ha(-1), and a second land application was conducted using dewatered municipal biosolids (DMB) applied at a rate of similar to 8 Mt dw ha(-1) in the summer of 2006. The DMB land application treatments consisted of direct injection (DI) of the DMB beneath the soil surface at a nominal depth of similar to 0.11 m, and surface spreading (SS) plus subsequent tillage incorporation of DMB in the topsoil (similar to 0.10 m depth). The PPCPs examined included eight pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, naproxen, carbamazepine, atenolol, sulfamethoxazole), the nicotine metabolite cotinine, and two antibacterial personal care products triclosan and triclocarban. Residues of naproxen, cotinine, atenolol and triclosan originating from the fall 2005 LMB application were detected in tile water nearly nine months after application (triclocarban was not measured in 2005). There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in PPCP mass loads among the two DMB land application treatments (i.e., SS vs. DI): although, average PPCP mass loads late in the study season(> 100 days after application) were consistently higher for the DI treatment relative to the SS treatment. While the concentration of triclosan (similar to 14,000 ng g(-1) dw) in DMB was about twice that of triclocarban (similar to 8000 ng g(-1) dw), the average tile water concentrations for triclosan were much higher (43 +/- 5 ng L-1) than they were for triclocarban (0.73 +/- 0.14 ng L-1). Triclosan concentrations (maximum observed in 2006 similar to 235 ng L-1) in tile water resulting from land applications may warrant attention from a toxicological perspective.

AB Groundwater samples were obtained from the water table region of a phreatic aquifer (unsaturated zone depth up to 28 m) under land irrigated with wastewater effluents for about 5 decades and a relatively deep pumping well (109 m), used as a drinking water source till 2007, located downstream (1300 m) of wastewater effluent and sludge infiltration facilities. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) concentrations in secondary effluents varied between 90 and 150 ng/L SMX was extracted using SPE and was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. SMX (maximum concentration of 37 ng/L) was detected in the water table region. in two monitoring wells, after an unsaturated zone transport period of about 16 years. The maximum SMX concentration detected in the pumping well was of 20 ng/L These results question wastewater effluent disposal strategies including the suitability of irrigation with effluents on the replenishment area of an aquifer supplying drinking water.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a simple analytical method to determine the presence of selected pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors in wastewater treatment plant effluents. In this study, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were used to identify triclosan; 2,4-dichloro phenol; 2,3,4-trichloro phenol; galaxolide; tonalide; estrone; 17-beta-estradiol; 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol; clofibric acid; and carbamazepine.
   Extraction parameters such as types of SPME fiber, effect of ionic strength, magnetic stirring, pH, extraction temperature, extraction time, and desorption time were investigated to optimize the SPME-GC method. Also, analytical parameters such as repeatability, linearity, and detection limits were evaluated. The method developed in this study was fast (extraction procedure and GC-MS analysis was around 100 minutes), solvent-free, and low cost.
   This method was used as a screening test to determine if pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors were present in wastewater treatment plant effluents samples from the Chania Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in Crete, Greece.

AB The purpose of this study was to propose a municipal wastewater treatment method based on solar Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) permitting reuse of the treated wastewater. Experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria. Mineralisation was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the concentration profile of each compound during degradation was determined by HPLC-UV. Two different approaches, photo-Fenton (pH = 2.8) and TiO2 were tested with 9 different emerging contaminants at 100 mu g L-1 each (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, caffeine, diclofenac, isoproturon, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan) at low iron and TiO2 concentrations. Photo-Fenton was by far more effective than TiO2 for degrading these contaminants, and was therefore selected for further study. The 9 contaminants were tested under the following conditions without pH adjustment: (i) Fe = 5 mg L-1, D.I. water; (ii) Fe = 5,15 and 55 mg L-1, standard fresh water; (iii) Fe = 5 mg L-1, standard fresh water without NaHCO3. Initial amount of hydrogen peroxide was 50 mg L-1, frequently analysed and added to maintain this concentration. it was demonstrated that low efficiency in some cases is mainly due to bicarbonates, and it is therefore proposed that the process be improved, either by increasing the iron concentration, or eliminating bicarbonates.

AB Extensive use of pharmaceuticals and growth hormone in farm animal and live stocks has resulted in their frequent detection in soils, groundwater, and wastewater. The fate and transport of these compounds are strongly affected by their sorptive behavior to the soil minerals and humic materials. In this research, we conducted the sorption of tetracycline (TC), a common antibiotic, on palygorskite (PFL-1), a fibrous clay mineral of high surface area and high sorptivity towards organic compounds. The results showed that the sorption capacity of TC on PFL-1 was as high as 210 mmol/kg at pH 8.7. The sorption was relatively fast and reached equilibrium in 2 h. Solution pH and ionic strength had significant effects on TC sorption. The sorption of TC by palygorskite is endothermic and the free energy of sorption is in the range of -10 to -30 kJ/mol, suggesting a strong physical sorption. The X-ray diffraction patterns before and after TC sorption revealed no changes in d-spacing and intensity under different pH and initial TC concentrations, indicating that the sorbed TC molecules are on the external surface of the mineral in contrast to intercalation of TC into swelling clays, such as montmorillonite. The small positive value of entropy change suggested that TC molecules are in disordered arrangement on palygorskite surfaces. Surface sorption of TC on PFL-1 is further supported by the derivative of gravimetric analysis and by the calculation of the amount of TC sorption normalized to the surface area. The results suggest that palygorskite Could be a good candidate to remove TC from wastewater containing higher amounts of TC. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals, the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac and the pharmacologically active metabolite of several serum triglyceride-lowering pharmaceuticals, clofibric acid, were subjected to microbiological transformation in activated sludge bioreactors, and the production of breakdown products was studied. For separation, detection and identification of diclofenac's metabolites a UPLC-(+)ESI-QqToF-MS was employed, which enabled the detection of seven transformation products of diclofenac, all including the diagnostic fragment ion at m/z 214. The chemical structure of one metabolite was proposed,which was produced by dehydratation and lactame formation. Further investigations revealed additional two metabolites, which were isomeric structures with an elemental composition C13H10NCI2; however, their chemical structures were not completely resolved. In addition, another biodegradation product showed an abundant fragment ion at m/z 295, the elemental composition of which was confirmed with a high degree of certainty as C14H11NO2Cl2. The biodegradation of clofibric acid revealed one metabolite in the (-)ESI-QqToF chromatogram, 4-chlorophenol, which is known to exhibit a higher toxicity than the parent compound. This study confirms that further research is needed on the formation of stable metabolites both during wastewater treatment and in the environment. It also highlights the need for parallel toxicity testing. In addition, this study suggests that more needs to be known about the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals so that we are able to provide a comprehensive risk assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Triclosan and triclocarban are antibacterial agents that are widely used in numerous personal care products. Limited information is available on their environmental behavior in soils and soils land applied with wastewaters and biosolids. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to investigate their adsorption and degradation in soils. Both antibacterial agents adsorbed strongly to the sandy loam and silty clay soils with and without addition of biosolids, with distribution coefficients (K-d) ranging from 178 to 264 L kg(-1) for triclosan and from 763 to 1187 L kg(-1) for triclocarban. Sorption of triclosan decreased with increase in soil pH from 4 to 8, whereas triclocarban sorption showed no effect within the tested pH range. Competitive sorption was observed when triclosan and triclocarban coexisted, but the cosolute effect was concentration dependent. Biosolids amendment increased the sorption of triclosan and triclocarban, likely due to the addition of soil organic matter, but displayed no significant effect on degradation.

AB Four wells downgradient from a landfill near Elkhart, Indiana were sampled during 2000-2002 to evaluate the presence of waste-indicator and pharmaceutical compounds in landfill-leachate-affected ground water. Compounds detected in leachate-affected ground water included detergent metabolites (p-nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, nonylphenol diethoxylate, and octylphenol monoethoxylate), plasticizers (ethanol-2-butoxy-phosphate and diethylphthalate), a plastic monomer (bisphenol A), disinfectants (1,4-dichlorobenzene and triclosan), an antioxidant (5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole), three fire-retardant compounds (tributylphosphate and tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate, and tri(dichlorisopropyl)phosphate), and several pharmaceuticals and metabolites (acetaminophen, caffeine, cotinine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, fluoxetine, and ibuprofen). Acetaminophen, caffeine, and cotinine detections confirm prior indications of pharmaceutical and nicotinate disposal in the landfill.

AB Presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment has received a great attention due to their potential impacts on public health. This study examined the occurrence of PPCPs in West Prong Little Pigeon River in east Tennessee. As wastewater is a major source for environmental occurrence of PPCPs, both wastewater and river water samples were analyzed for nine target PPCPs and their estrogenicity. No estrogens were detected in influent, secondary effluent, and river samples. However, ibuprofen, caffeine, triclosan, bisphenol A, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in the influent. Ibuprofen, triclosan, and DEHP were detected in the secondary effluent samples. Only ibuprofen and triclosan were detected in river water collected near a wastewater outfall. Based on yeast estrogenic screening (YES) assays, estrogenic activities were observed in all influent, secondary effluent, and river water samples. Increased estrogenic activities were observed in river right after receiving effluent discharge, and the activities decreased as river water flowing away from the outfall. The estrogenicities of water samples measured from YES assays were much higher than those estimated from PPCP concentrations and their known estrogenicities, suggesting the presence of other unknown estrogenic compounds and/or additive effects of mixtures of estrogenic compounds at low concentrations. Results of this study demonstrated that wastewater contributed to environmental occurrence of PPCPs in the receiving water. As there is a myriad of known and unknown PPCPs in wastewater, in additional to chemical analysis, estrogenic bioassays are needed for assessing estrogenicity of environmental samples.

AB In this study we evaluated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of native samples of wastewaters (15 samples), surface waters (28 samples) and potable waters (8 samples) with the SOS/umuC assay with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 and MTT assay with human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The genotoxicity of selected samples was confirmed with the comet assay with HepG2 cells. In the SOS/umuC assay 13 out of the 51 samples were genotoxic: two effluent samples from chemical industry; one sample of wastewater treatment plant effluent: two hospital wastewater samples; three river water samples and four lake water samples. Six samples were cytotoxic for HepG2 cells: both effluent samples of chemical industry, two wastewater treatment plant effluent samples, and two river water samples, however, only the chemical industry effluent samples were genotoxic and cytotoxic, indicating that different contaminants are responsible for genotoxic and toxic effects. Comparing genotoxicity of river and lake water samples with the chemical analytical data of the presence of the residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, UV filters and disinfectants) in these samples, indicated that the presence of UV filters might be linked to the genotoxicity of these samples. The results showed that the application of the bacterial SOS/umuC assay and mammalian cell assays (MTT and comet assay) with HepG2 cells was suitably sensitive combination of assays to monitor genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of native samples of wastewaters and surface waters. With this study we also confirmed that the toxicity/genotoxicity bioassays should be an integral tool in the evaluation of toxicity of complex wastewaters before the release into environment, as well as for the monitoring of surface water quality, providing data useful in risk assessment.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are increasingly considered for decentralized waste water treatment. In this study, the operation parameters on a pilot MBR were optimized, and the removal of organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues was studied. During the first phase of the research project, two membrane materials (polyethersulfone, polysulfonamide) were chosen for the manufacturing of plate modules and operation in a pilot plant, which was installed in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (20.000 p.e.).
   Operation conditions were optimized with regard to flux, filtration time, aeration rate, sludge age, total suspended solids, etc. Both membranes were ultrafiltration membranes and therefore achieved a very good retention with regard to particles (microorganisms and turbidity). In comparison to the conventional wastewater treatment process the system performance with regard to COD removal was higher in the MBR. Analysis of samples taken from the MBR process tank and the filtrate of both membrane types showed an improved elimination of some specific organic pollutants. Due to the promising results, more process based MBR studies are encouraged.

AB In this study a recently built NF/RO pilot unit for removal of emerging contaminants from a plant producing veterinary pharmaceuticals was tested. A wastewater stream of the plant, containing residuals of antibiotics and other organics was treated by three different types of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration membranes: XLE, NF90 and H L. Target compounds selected for this study included three different classes of antibiotics: sulphonamides, diaminopyrimidine and fluoroquinolone. A developed chromatographic method for determination of pharmaceuticals in a complex wastewater was applied. The method involved a sample pretreatment by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analytical determination by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with DAD detectors. The results showed the complete removal of all the antibiotics by the typical RO XLE membrane and by the tight nanofiltration membrane NF90. Only the loose nanofiltration membrane element HL incompletely rejected the smaller sulphonamide molecules. The satisfactory rejection of other solutes from a complex wastewater stream was also obtained.

AB Pharmaceuticals and recently also illicit drugs have been recognised as emerging environmental contaminants due to their potential environmental impact: frequent occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic life and humans. This manuscript is part one of the two-part study aiming to provide a better understanding and application of environmental data not only for environmental aims but also to meet forensic objectives. An attempt to use wastewater data is made in order to verify patterns of the usage of drugs (in particular illicit) in local communities. The average usage of cocaine in South Wales was estimated at 0.9 g day(-1) 1000 people(-1), which equals I tonne of this drug used or disposed of to sewage annually in Wales. The calculated usage of amphetamine denoted 2.5 g day(-1) 1000 people(-1) and is suspected to be an overestimate. Because no analysis of enantiomers of amphetamine was undertaken, no distinction between amphetamine's legal and illicit usage could be made (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper pharmaceuticals were investigated as potential chemical indicators of water contamination with sewage. The monitoring program carried out in Wales revealed that some pharmaceuticals are particularly persistent and/or ubiquitous in contaminated river water and therefore might be considered as potential conservative or labile wastewater indicators. In particular, these include some anti-inflammatory/analgesics, antiepileptics, beta-blockers, some H2-receptor antagonists and antibacterial drugs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biodegradation of selected pharmaceutical micropollutants, including two pharmaceuticals with argued biodegradation, was studied by a lab-scale membrane bioreactor. The reaction kinetics and affecting factors were also investigated in this paper. Clofibric acid (CA) with contradictive biodegradation reported was degraded almost completely at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) after adaptation to microorganisms. The biodegradation of CA was disturbed at low pH operation, while the activity of microorganisms recovered again after pH adjustment to neutral condition. Ibuprofen (IBP) degraded under neutral and acidic conditions. Removals of IBP and CA were zero-order and first-order reactions under high and low initial concentrations, respectively. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were not degraded regardless of HRTs and pH.

AB We investigated the occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics, estrogens, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-blockers, and lipid regulators) in three rivers and in the waste streams of six hospitals and four pharmaceutical production facilities in Taiwan. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were acetaminophen, erythromycin-H2O, sulfamethoxazole, and gemfibrozil. NSAIDs were the next most-often detected compounds, with a detection frequency > 60%. The other analytes were not detected or were seen in only a few samples at trace concentrations. The present study demonstrates a significant discharge of human medications from hospital and drug production facilities into surface waters in the Taipei district. The high concentrations of pharmaceuticals found in the Sindian and Dahan rivers demonstrate the alarming degree to which they have been impacted by urban drainage (waste effluents from hospitals, households, and pharmaceutical production facilities). The ubiquitous occurrence at extremely high concentrations of acetaminophen and erythromycin-H2O in both rivers (up to 15.7 and 75.5 mu g/L) and in wastewater from hospitals and pharmaceutical production facilities (up to 417.5 and 7.84 mu g/L) was unique. This finding, in combination with acetaminophen's status as the drug most often prescribed by Taiwan's dominant clinical institute, suggests the potential use of acetaminophen as a molecular indicator of contamination of Taiwan's aqueous environments with untreated urban drainage.

AB Pharmaceutical products are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, lakes and, more rarely, in groundwater. The advanced oxidation methods, like ultrasound, find a promising future in the area of wastewater treatment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the influence of several parameters of the ultrasound process on the degradation of paracetamol, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory recalcitrant drug found in water and levodopa, the most frequently prescribed drug for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Experiments were carried out at 574, 860 and 1134 kHz of ultrasonic frequency with horn-type sonicator and actual power values of 9, 17, 22 and 32 W at 20 degrees C. Initial concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg L-1 of both products were used. Treatment efficiency was assessed following changes in pharmaceuticals concentration and chemical oxygen demand.
   The sonochemical degradation of both products follows a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Complete removal of pharmaceuticals was achieved in some cases but some dissolved organic carbon remains in solution showing that long lived intermediates were recalcitrant to ultrasound irradiation. Pollutants conversion and COD removal were found to decrease with increasing the initial solute concentration and decreasing power. The best results were obtained with 574 kHz frequency. Investigations using 1-butanol as radical scavenger and H2O2 as promoter revealed that pollutants degradation proceeds principally through radical reactions, although some differences were observed between both molecules. Addition of H2O2 had a positive effect on degradation rate, but the optimum concentration of hydrogen peroxide depends on the pollutant. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Septic tanks and other on-site systems are a common means of disposing domestic wastewater effluent in Ireland. In assessing site suitability, subsoils below the percolation trench have an important role in attenuating pollutants and hence in protecting groundwater. As part of an investigation into the hydraulic performance of treatment systems at four sites in Ireland with different subsoil characteristics, a series of samples were analysed for endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including oestrogens, surfactants and organic oxygen compounds. EDCs were found at all four sites, but only at low concentrations (often below those at which their presence could be confirmed) and generally only in samples known to be percolating effluent. Further research should target oestrogen compounds, as these appear to be present in higher concentrations than the other EDCs and also have greater potency.

AB A technical scale (0.12 m(3)) activated soil filter (bio filter) has been used to eliminate diverse xenobiotics (organic micro-pollutants) such as organophosphate flame retardants, and -plasticisers, musk fragrances, DEHP, benzothiazoles and triclosan from water. Model experiments to treat combined sewer overflow, storm water and a post treatment of waste water were performed in controlled laboratory experiments. The indicator compounds were typical for waste water. Diverse chemical compound groups and a wide spectrum from the lipophilic (pK(ow) = 5.9) to the hydrophilic (pK(ow) = 2.6) were included. The system consisted of a layer with high organic content (with vegetation to prevent clogging), a sand filter and a gravel drainage layer. The organic layer was spiked with activated sludge to enhance biomass and biodegradation potential. Usually the elimination rates varied from 64% to 99%, with only one compound reaching as little as 17%. For a technical suitability assessment it was calculated how long these filters would be stable in eliminating organic compounds from water. The estimated operating times for such systems was found to be about 100 years for a stack height of 2 m a year in regard to most compounds in this study (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several pharmaceutically active compounds have been monitored during 1-year period in influent and effluent wastewater from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate their temporal evolution and removal from wastewater and to know which variables have influence in their removal rates. Pharmaceutical compounds monitored were four antiinflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen), an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine) and a nervous stimulant (caffeine). All of the pharmaceutically active compounds monitored, except diclofenac, were detected in influent and effluent wastewater. Mean concentrations measured in influent wastewater were 6.17, 0.48, 93.6, 1.83 and 5.41 mu g/L for caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, respectively. Mean concentrations measured in effluent wastewater were 2.02, 0.56. 8.20, 0.84 and 2.10 mu g/L for caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, respectively. Mean removal rates of the pharmaceuticals varied from 8.1% (carbamazepine) to 87.5% (ibuprofen). The existence of relationships between the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds, their removal rates, the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters and the WWTP control design parameters has been studied by means of statistical analysis (correlation and principal component analysis). With both statistical analyses, high correlations were obtained between the concentration of the pharmaceutical compounds and the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters; and between the removal rates of the pharmaceutical compounds, the removal rates of the characterization parameters of influent wastewaters and the WWTP hydraulic retention times. Principal component analysis showed the existence of two main components accounting for 76% of the total variability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel technology for enhanced municipal wasterwater treatment was assessed based on the dual functions of Fe(VI) to oxidize micropollutants and remove phosphate by formation of ferric phosphates. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reactions of selected pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, and organic model compounds with Fe(VI) were in the range of 1 (trimethylamine) to 9000 M-1 s(-1) (aniline) in the pH-range 7-8. The selected compounds contained electron-rich moieties (ERM) such as phenols, anilines, amines, and olefins. Oxidation experiments in wastewater spiked with micropollutants at concentrations in the low mu M range at pH 7 and 8 showed that Fe(VI) doses higher than 5 mg Fe L-1 are capable of eliminating various ERM-containing micropollutants by more than 85%. In comparison to ozone, Fe(VI) was. as effective or slightly less effective in terms of micropollutants oxidation, with Fe(VI) having the benefit of phosphate removal. To lower phosphate from 3.5 to 0.8 mg PO4-P L-1 (regulatory limit for wastewater discharge in Switzerland), a Fe(VI) dose of 7.5 mg Fe L-1 was needed. Overall, this study demonstrates Fe(VI) as a promising tool for an enhanced wastewater treatment to remove micropollutants as well as to control phosphate in a single treatment step.

AB The drinking water production of a drinking water treatment plant in Berlin is affected by ambient contaminated groundwater. The three organic compounds para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), ortho-toluenesulfonamide (o-TSA) and benzenesulfonamide (BSA) were identified in the catchment area of this plant. The groundwater pollution is a result of former sewage farm irrigation in the area, operating for almost 70 years until the 1980s. The distribution of the sulfonamides in the anoxic groundwater was investigated, and a large number of observation and production wells were sampled for this purpose. The contaminant plume is 25 m*3000m*2000 m (depth, length, width) in size. The high concentrations of p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA in the groundwater show that the sulfonamides persist over decades in an anoxic aquifer environment. Groundwater quality assessment revealed that elevated concentrations of the analytes can be expected in the abstraction well galleries in the future. Therefore, sulfonamides should periodically be monitored in the drinking water (maximum allowed concentration of 0.30 mu g/L of p-TSA and for o-TSA and BSA, a limit of 0.10 mu g/L for unknown substances applies). Because of the widespread application and the persistence of the sulfonamides under anoxic conditions, our local investigations suggest that the substances may generally be present in groundwater under the influence of sewage irrigation. Incubation experiments were conducted under in situ hydrostatic pressure to study the behaviour of these trace organic compounds under different redox conditions (oxic and anoxic). Groundwater sampling equipment was either sterilised or not sterilised in order to distinguish between microbiological processes occurring in the aquifer and those representing sampling and storage artefacts (incubation experiments). Results showed that the addition of oxygen to the anoxic groundwater facilitates p-TSA and o-TSA degradation. Hence, while the substances are persistent under anoxic conditions, they are more degradable in the presence of oxygen. Results also illustrate that maintaining anoxic conditions or applying appropriate preservation techniques is necessary to ensure accurate analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Penicillin-G is the drug of choice for infection caused by organisms suspectible to it. In case of streptococcal infection (like pharyngitis, scarlet fever), staphylococcus infection, pneumococcus infection, diphtheria, tetanus and gas gangrene, anthrax, actinomycosis and rat bite fever penicillin-G is widely used. Separation and purification of penicillin-G from a mixture of other components is common and essential step in pharmaceutical industry. Separation and purification of drug component from a mixture of components, separation of enantiomeric drugs mixture, separation of chemical constituents from plant source and removal of drug components from wastewater can be carried out through foam separation method. The aim of this work is to study performance criteria of separation of penicillin-G from an aqueous solution by controlling of different variables and using two type of surfactants in foam separation method. The result showed that penicillin-G can be easily separated from dilute solution of drug mixture in a short time. The influence of operatives variables including concentration of surface active agent, pH, superficial gas velocity (SGV) and recovery of drug were investigated. The optimum separation has been set as follows: concentration of surface active agent tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (2.25 mM) and dodecylamine (2.25 mM), pH 7, superficial gas velocity 0.03 cm/s, % of drug recovery was found as 84.20 and 86.78, respectively. The unique advantage of the present work relative to other reported method is the higher separation efficiency at lowest cost.

AB The hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor was evaluated for efficacy in reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of bulk drug pharmaceutical wastewater under different operational conditions. The start-up of the reactor feed came entirely with glucose, applied at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1 kg COD/m(3) d. Then the reactor was studied at different OLRs ranging from 2 to 11 kg COD/m(3) d with pharmaceutical wastewater. The optimum OLR was found to be 9 kg COD/m3 d, where we found 65-75% COD and 80-94% of BOD reduction with biogas production containing 60-70% of methane and specific methanogenic activity was 320 ml CH4/g-VSS d. By the characterization studies of effluent using GC-MS, the hazardous compounds like phenol, 1,2-methoxy phenol, 2.4,6-trichloro phenol, dibutyl phthalate. 1-bromo naphthalene, carbamazepine and antipyrine were present. After the treatment, these compounds degraded almost completely except carbamazepine. Thermophilic methanothrix and methanosaetae like bacteria are present in the granular sludge.

AB Simple analytical methods were developed for the extraction and determination of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from water, sediments, and biota. PPCPs were determined using tandem LC-MS in electrospray ionization mode, and interactions with matrix co-eluents were investigated. Extractions of water samples were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE), sediments were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and biota was extracted by liquid extraction. The selected analytical methods yielded recoveries >= 61% in all matrixes. Matrix interactions were investigated throughout the linear range of quantification of each compound, revealing that dissolved salts had relatively minor effects on ionization (between 14% suppression to 12% enhancement), but that sediment and biota extracts caused significant matrix effects (ranging from 56% suppression to 25% enhancement). The direction and magnitude of matrix interactions reflected the physico-chemical properties of each analyte, particularly their pK(a). Among the compounds analyzed in electrospray positive mode, carbamazepine was insensitive to matrix interactions, because it is a strong proton acceptor (pK(a) = 14.0). In contrast, atorvastatin (pK(a) = 4.5), a weaker proton acceptor, was particularly sensitive to matrix effects. For those compounds analyzed in negative- ion mode, sample alkalinity was found to be important. With a pK(a) of 10.4, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol generally exhibited matrix enhancement with increased sample alkalinity. However, the presence of acidic co-eluents contributed to matrix suppression. Lastly, TCS was particularly sensitive to matrix suppression, as its circumneutral pK(a) (7.9) caused even slight changes in sample pH to considerably impact ionization. We conclude that while different matrixes have clear impacts on ionization of these PPCPs, matrix effects can be quantified and overcome.

AB Pharmaceuticals are becoming an emerging environmental issue that attracts increasing attention in recent years. This study chose tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) as examples of pharmaceuticals. Crude lignin peroxidase (LiP) produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium were used to degrade TC and OTC in vitro. The results illustrated that UP has a strong degrading ability towards TC and OTC. At 50 mg L-1 of TC and OTC and 40 U L-1 of the enzyme activity, the degradation of TC and OTC reached to about 95% in 5 min. The degradation of TC and OTC by UP was dependent on pH and temperature and was largely enhanced by increasing the concentrations of veratryl alcohol (VA) and initial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The optimized degradation conditions were determined as pH 4.2, 37 degrees C, 2 mM VA, 0.4 mM H2O2. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is among the top 100 drugs prescribed yearly in the United States and the United Kingdom. Tissue and water extraction methods were developed to detect and quantify FLX, norfluosetine and the associated biological compounds serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), tryptophan (TRP) and melatonin (MEL) using LC/MS/MS. Acute mortality and sublethal physiological effects of FLX were assessed using standard static renewal toxicity tests in which juvenile sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) were exposed to FLX. Fluoxetine did not cause significant mortality at levels near currently reported environmental concentrations. Significant changes in neurotransmitter levels were observed within the serotonergic system in juvenile sheepshead minnows exposed at concentrations approximately one order of magnitude above those currently reported in the environment. Transformation activity ratios of a product to a precursor compound (5-HT/TRP, 5-HIAA/5-HT and MEL/5-HT) also exhibited significant changes with FIX treatment. Fluoxetine exposure did not only affect 5-HT but had additional effects both upstream and downstream of 5-HT within its synthesis and metabolic pathways. These sublethal changes within the serotonergic pathway may result in behavioral changes which could, in turn, have implications for the ecological response Of Populations to additional environmental stressors.

AB Hospital wastewater is considered a complex mixture populated with pathogenic microorganisms. The genetic constitution of these microorganisms can be changed through the direct and indirect effects of hospital wastewater constituents, leading to the appearance of antibiotic multi-resistant bacteria. To avoid environmental contamination hospital wastewaters must be treated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of hospital wastewater treated by a combined process of biological degradation (septic tank) and the Fenton reaction. Thus, after septic tank biodegradation, batch Fenton reaction experiments were performed in a laboratory-scale reactor and the effectiveness of this sequential treatment was evaluated by a physico-chemical/microbiological time-course analysis of COD, BOD5, and thermotolerant and total coliforms. The results showed that after 120 min of Fenton treatment BOD5 and COD values decreased by 90.6% and 91.0%, respectively. The BOD5/COD ratio changed from 0.46 to 0.48 after 120 min of treatment. Bacterial removal efficiency reached 100%, while biotests carried out with Scenedesmus subspicatus and Daphnia magna showed a significant decrease in the ecotoxicity of hospital wastewater after the sequential treatment. The use of this combined system would ensure that neither multi-resistant bacteria nor ecotoxic substances are released to the environment through hospital wastewater discharge.

AB Contamination of natural aquatic ecosystems by hospital wastewater is a major environmental and human health issue. Disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, radionuclides and solvents are widely used in hospitals for medical purposes and research. After application, some of these substances combine with hospital effluents and, in industrialised countries, reach the municipal sewer network. In certain developing countries, hospitals usually discharge their wastewater into septic tanks equipped with diffusion wells. The discharge of chemical compounds from hospital activities into the natural environment can lead to the pollution of water resources and risks for human health. The aim of this article is to present: (i) the steps of a procedure intended to evaluate risks to human health linked to hospital effluents discharged into a septic tank equipped with a diffusion well; and (ii) the results of its application on the effluents of a hospital in Port-au-Prince. The procedure is based on a scenario that describes the discharge of hospital effluents,via septic tanks, into a karstic formation where water resources are used for human consumption. COD, Chloroform, dichlomethane, dibromochloromethane, dichlorobromomethane and bromoform contents were measured. Furthermore, the presence of heavy metals (chrome, nickel and lead) and faecal coliforms were studied. Maximum concentrations were 700 NPP/100 ml for faecal coliforms and 112 mg/L for COD. A risk of infection of 10(-5) infection per year was calculated. Major chemical risks. particularly for children, relating to Pb(II), Cr(III), Cr(VI) and Ni(II) contained in the ground water were also characterised. Certain aspects of the scenario studied require improvement, especially those relating to the characterisation of drugs in groundwater and the detection of other microbiological indicators such as protozoa, enterococcus and viruses.

AB We created a database in order to quantitatively assess the occurrence and removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). From 117 scientific publications, we compiled 6641 data covering 184 PPCPs. Data included the concentrations of PPCPs in WWTP influents and effluents, their removal efficiency and their loads to the aquatic environment. The first outputs of our database allowed to identify the most investigated PPCPs in WWTPs and the most persistent ones, and to obtain reliable and quantitative values on their concentrations, frequency of detection and removal efficiency in WWTPs. We were also able to compare various processes and pointed out activated sludge with nitrogen treatment and membrane bioreactor as the most efficient ones. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to determine the biodegradation potential of river sediment for the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its two major human metabolites N-4-acetyl-SMX and SMX-Ni-glucuronide using a water sediment test system. Each compound was tested in a separate series together with sterile and "water only" controls. All three compounds were efficiently removed from the test system by biodegradation in the sediment. Only for SMX-Ni-glucuronide, a substantial removal in the absence of sediment was determined. Dissipation times from the aqueous phase (DT50) between 8.5 and 17.2 days were measured. Sorption to sediment was of minor importance due to the slightly basic pH of the test system. By the application of a mathematical model, biodegradation half-lives in sediment between 3.3 and 25.6 h were calculated for SMX and its metabolites. The results of this study highlight the capability of native river sediment for degrading sulfonamide antibiotics, but also the potential of human metabolites to retransform into parent SMX under environmental conditions. Based on this study, it is unlikely that SMX or its metabolites will persist or accumulate in river sediments under PH conditions where sorption is of minor importance.

AB A model based on graph theory was developed to efficiently evaluate the impact of the effluent from 742 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on micropollutant loading throughout all river catchments in Switzerland. Model results agree well with measured loads for 12 compounds in river water samples, revealing mean predictive accuracy factors between 0.8 and 3.4. Subsequently, pollutant concentrations were predicted for river sections downstream from 543 WWTPs where hydrological information was available, and compared with recent recommendations for water quality criteria. At base flow conditions, carbamazepine concentrations (parent compound only) are ubiquitously below a water quality criterion of 0.5 mu g L(-1). In contrast, the sum of diclofenac and its metabolites is expected to exceed the corresponding water quality criterion of 0.1 mu g L(-1) in 224 river sections. If diclofenac cannot be eliminated at the source, the model suggests a directed upgrade of 173 WWTPs to meet the condition that concentrations are never to exceed this water quality criterion.

AB The seasonal occurrence of organic contaminants, many of which are potential endocrine disruptors, entering the Potomac River, USA, watershed was investigated using a two-pronged approach during the fall of 2005 and spring of 2006. Passive samplers (semipermeable membrane device and polar organic chemical integrative sampler [POCIS]) were deployed in tandem at sites above and below wastewater treatment plant discharges within the watershed. Analysis of the samplers resulted in detection of 84 of 138 targeted chemicals. The agricultural pesticides atrazine and metolachlor had the greatest seasonal changes in water concentrations, with a 3.1- to 91-fold increase in the spring compared with the level in the previous fall. Coinciding with the elevated concentrations of atrazine in the spring were increasing concentrations of the atrazine degradation products desethylatrazine and desisopropylatrazine in the fall following spring and summer application of the parent compound. Other targeted chemicals (organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic wastewater chemicals) did not indicate seasonal changes in occurrence or concentration; however, the overall concentrations and number of chemicals present were greater at the sites downstream of wastewater treatment plant discharges. Several fragrances and flame retardants were identified in these downstream sites, which are characteristic of wastewater effluent and human activities. The bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen in vitro assay of the POCIS extracts indicated the presence of chemicals that were capable of producing an estrogenic response at all sampling sites.

AB Ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was commonly found in treated wastewater due to its incomplete removal during sewage treatment plant processes. As treated wastewater is increasingly used for landscape irrigation, it is imperative to understand the leaching potential for ketoprofen in receiving soils. In this study, adsorption and degradation experiments were conducted in four U.S. soils with different physicochemical characteristics. Ketoprofen was not strongly adsorbed to the four soils with K(d) values ranging from 1.26 to 8.24 L kg(-1), suggesting its potential to move downward with percolating water. The adsorption was positively related to the soil organic matter (OM) content (R(2) = 0.890). Degradation experiment showed that half-lives (t(1/2)) of ketoprofen were 4.58 d in Arlington sandy loam (ASL, coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Haplic Durixeralfs), 8.04 d in Hanford loamy sand (HLS, coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorrhents), 15.37 d in Imperial silty clay (ISC, fine, semectitc, calcareous, hyperthermic Vertic Torrifluvents), and 27.61 d in Palouse silt loam (PSL) soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls), respectively. Degradation of ketoprofen in soils appeared to be influenced by the soil OM content. The prolonged t(1/2) by sterilization indicated that microbial degradation was the dominant pathway for ketoprofen degradation in soils, while photodegradation only contributed a small portion to the ketoprofen degradation. The t(1/2) and K(oc) values were fitted to screening models to predict the leaching potential of ketoprofen in soils. It appeared that relatively high leaching potential of ketoprofen existed in ISC and PSL soils.

AB The treatment of enrofloxacin synthetic wastewaters using conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO), ozonation. and Fenton oxidation has been studied. Results show that the three technologies can reduce the organic content of enrofloxacin synthetic wastewaters but with different performances. CDEO was the most efficient technology in terms of mineralization but not on COD removal, which was more efficiently achieved by ozonation. This indicates that ozonation is efficient in the breakage of the complex molecules but not on the removal of final carboxylic acids. The high initial efficiency in terms of oxidant-use obtained by Fenton oxidation evidences that it is very efficient in the removal of the enrofloxacin, although it rapidly leads to the formation of refractory compounds to the treatment. This indicates the significance of other oxidation mechanisms (e.g. coagulation) that enhance the results obtained by the expected hydroxyl-mediated oxidation. Ammonium ions were the primary product species in CDEO and nitrate ions in ozonation, whereas Fenton effluents contained similar amounts of both nitrogen ionic species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A combined strategy of a photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) was evaluated for total C and N removal from a synthetic wastewater containing exclusively 200 mg L-1 of the antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Photo-Fenton reaction was optimized at the minimum reagent doses in order to improve the biocompatibility of effluents with the subsequent biological reactor. Consequently, the pretreatment was performed with two different initial H2O2 concentrations (300 and 400 mg L-1) and 10 mg L-1 of Fe2+. The pre-treated effluents with the antibiotic intermediates as sole carbon source were used as feed for the biological reactor. The SBBR was operated under aerobic conditions to mineralize the organic carbon, and the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) was optimized down to 8 h reaching a removal of 75.7% of the initial Total Organic Carbon (TOC). The total denitrification of the NO3- generated along the chemical-biological treatment was achieved by means of the inclusion of a 24-h anoxic stage in the SBBR strategy. In addition, the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) was successfully used to complete the N balance determining the N fate in the SBBR. The characterization and the good performance of the SBBR allow presenting the assessed combination as an efficient way for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with biorecalcitrant pharmaceuticals as the SMX (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Amoxicillin's traces within pharmaceutical effluents have toxic impact toward the algae and other lower organisms within food web. Adsorption, as an efficient process to remove contaminants from water was chosen; in particular with bentonite and activated carbon as adsorbents. The study was carried out at several pH values. Langmuir and Freundlich models were then employed to correlate the equilibria data on which both models equally well-fit the data. For kinetic data, pseudo-first and second order models are selected. While chemisorption is the dominant adsorption mechanism on the bentonite case, both physisorption and chemisorption play important roles for adsorption onto activated carbon. Also, several possible mechanisms for these adsorption systems were elaborated further. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing concern about the fate of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the environment stimulates the search for alternative methods for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent polishing. The aim of this study was to establish an innovative and effective biological removal technique for EE2 by means of a nitrifier enrichment culture (NEC) applied in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). In batch incubation tests, the microbial consortium was able to remove EE2 from both a synthetic minimal medium and WWTP effluent. A maximum EE2 removal rate of 9.0 mu g EE2 g(-1) biomass-VSS h(-1) was achieved (>94% removal efficiency). incubation of the heterotrophic bacteria isolated from the NEC did not result in a significant EE2 removal, indicating the importance of nitrification as driving force in the mechanism. Application of the NEC in a MBR to treat a synthetic influent with an EE2 concentration of 83 ng EE2 L-1 resulted in a removal efficiency of 99% (loading rates up to 208 ng EE2 L-1 d(-1); membrane flux rate: 6.9 L m(-2) h(-1)). Simultaneously, complete nitrification was achieved at an optimal ammonium influent concentration of 1.0 mg NH4+-N L-1. This minimal NH4+-N input is very advantageous for effluent polishing since the concomitant effluent nitrate concentrations will be low as well and it offers opportunities for the nitrifying MBR as a promising add-on technology for WWTP effluent polishing.

AB Many pharmaceuticals are excreted in wastewater as parent substances or metabolites subsequent to therapeutic or diagnostic application in medical care. This includes the antiepileptic carbamazepine, which is not removed during conventional wastewater treatment and was found to be ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Some carbamazepine metabolites have also been found in treated wastewater, but only five of them have been studied to date. However, at least 30 carbamazepine metabolites have been identified in humans, including some pharmacologically active or genotoxic compounds. Oxcarbazepine, an antiepileptic which is increasingly used, generates metabolites common to those of carbamazepine. The present work focuses on the presence of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and seven of their metabolites (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 2-hydroxy-carbamazepine, iminostilbene, acridine, and acridone) at three different treatment plants (conventional activated sludge, trickling filter, and stabilization ponds) selected in France. The main aim of this work was to identify selected compounds in wastewater after therapeutic use and to measure concentrations in influents and effluents at the three wastewater treatment plants. Except for iminostilbene, all of these compounds were detected in wastewater. The metabolite common to carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, i.e., 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine, was detected at a higher concentration than the parent substances in wastewater. The presence of parent molecules was noted in inlet and outlet water samples. Carbamazepine, as expected, was not removed by conventional activated sludge treatment. Nevertheless, in a wastewater treatment plant with a 78-day hydraulic retention time, a 73% decrease in carbamazepine concentration was observed. For the first time, oxcarbazepine was found in environmental samples. A decrease in oxcarbazepine concentrations was observed at the three sewage treatment plants, with removal ranging from 24 to 73%. No metabolite removal was observed after activated sludge treatment. In the two other sewage treatments plants, the fate of the metabolites differed. The concentration of some metabolites, e.g., 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine and acridine, increased, possibly via different processes such as cleavage of glucuronide conjugates or biotic and abiotic degradation of parent compounds. The behavior of the studied substances is discussed in terms of the treatment process and hydraulic retention time.

AB Coagulation-flocculation and flotation processes were evaluated for the pre-treatment of hospital wastewater, including the removal of 13 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Coagulation-flocculation assays were performed in a jar-Test device and in a continuous pilot-scale plant. Raw hospital wastewater as well as the effluent from the continuous coagulation plant were treated in a flotation cell. Removal of total suspended solids (TSS) during pre-treatment was very effective, reaching an average removal efficiency of 92% in the combined coagulation-flotation process. Musk fragrances were eliminated to a high degree during batch coagulation-flocculation (tonalide: 83.4 +/- 14.3%; galaxolide: 79.2 +/- 9.9%; celestolide: 77.7 +/- 16.8%), presumably due to their strong lipophilic character which promotes the interaction of these compounds with the lipid fraction of solids. For cliclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP) maximum removals of 46%, 42% and 23%, respectively, were obtained, while the rest of PPCPs were not affected by the physico-chemical treatment. Flotation of raw wastewater led to slightly worse results compared to coagulation-flocculation, although the combined action of both improved the overall efficiency of the process. The proposed pre-treatment strategy for hospital wastewater is useful for assimilating its conventional physico-chemical characteristics to that of municipal wastewater as well as for reducing the load of some PPCPs into the sewer system.

AB Common wastewater treatment plants often do not eliminate endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Aqueous solutions of three EDCs were treated with an enhanced corona discharge technology. The three EDCs were clofibric acid, a blood lipid regulator, carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug, and iopromide, a contrast media. To simulate real conditions, EDC solutions containing landfill leachate were also used. In our setup, two barrier electrodes provided an atmospheric pressure corona discharge over a thin water film, in which the counter-electrode was submerged. Clofibric acid, carbamazepine, and iopromide were effectively removed from a single solution. After a treatment of 15 min, there were no traces of iopromide estrogen activity either as a single substance or as degradation products when using an E-Screen Assay. Continuous treatment was compared with pulsed treatment using carbamazepine solutions mixed with pretreated landfill leachate. Best degradation results were achieved with a 500 W continuous duty cycle treatment. Counter-electrodes from materials such as boron doped diamond (BDD), titanium iridium oxide, and iron were investigated for their influences on the process effectivity. Significant improvements were achieved by using an enclosed reactor, BDD electrodes, and circulating only a fresh air or argon/air mixture as cooling gas through the barrier electrodes.

AB The enantioselective degradation of ibuprofen and naproxen enantiomers was evaluated in five different wastewater treatment systems, including three constructed wetlands (vertical- and horizontal-flow configurations), a sand filter and an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. In addition, injection experiments were carried out with racemic ibuprofen at microcosm- and pilot-scale constructed wetlands. Ibuprofen and naproxen have an asymmetric carbon atom and, consequently, two enantiomeric forms (i.e. S and R). The enantiomeric fraction (EF = S/(S + R)) in the raw sewage and effluents of various wastewater treatments were found to be compound-dependent (i.e. ibuprofen: EFinfluent = 0.73-0.90, EFeffluent = 0.60-0.76; naproxen: EFinfluent = 0.88-0-90, EFeffluent = 0.71-0.86). Of the two chiral pharmaceuticals, naproxen was the only one whose effluent EF correlated with its removal efficiency (p < 0.05). The lack of correlation found for ibuprofen was attributable to the fact that its enantioselective degradation kinetics were different under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Injection experiments of ibuprofen in constructed wetlands at microcosm and pilot-scale followed similar trends. Hence, under prevailing aerobic conditions, S-ibuprofen degraded faster than R-ibuprofen, whereas under prevailing anaerobic conditions, the degradation was not enantioselective. In summary, the naproxen EF measurements in wastewater effluents show that naproxen is a suitable alternative for evaluating the removal efficiency of treatment systems because its enantioselective degradation is similar under prevailing aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB The present study investigated the biological quantification of estrogenic activity in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in the recipient river in north-western Italy. Samples of the WWTP effluent and those of river water upstream and downstream the WWTP were taken from September 2006 to May 2007. The effluent was evaluated in the presence and absence of chlorination. The E-screen assay, with human estrogens receptor-positive MCF-7 BUS breast cancer cells, was performed on samples after solid-phase extraction to determine the total estrogenic activity by measuring the 17 beta-estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ). In order to study the correlation between estrogenicity and toxicity, untreated samples were also assayed with the acute toxicity test Microtox (TM). Furthermore, to determine the efficiency of the chlorination process, all the samples were analysed for disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes) and Escherichia coli.
   The mean EEQs were 5.0 ng/L (+/- 6.1 ng/L) upstream of the plant, 6.7 ng/L (+/- 7.4 ng/L) downstream from the plant and 23.3 ng/L (+/- 20.4 ng/L) in the WWTP effluent. The difference between upstream and downstream of the treatment plant was not significant. Chlorinated water samples had lower estrogenic activity and E coli concentrations, but had greater toxicity and higher trihalomethane concentrations. Estrogenic activity was not correlated with toxicity. These results suggest that the WWTP effluent had little impact on the estrogenic activity of the recipient river. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A wide variety of antibacterial compounds is rapidly oxidized by O-3 and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) during aqueous ozonation. Quantitative microbiological assays have been developed here or adapted from existing methods and utilized to measure the resulting changes in antibacterial potencies during O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot treatment of 13 antibacterial molecules (roxithromycin, azithromycin, tylosin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, penicillin G, cephalexin, sulfamethoxazole,trimethoprim, lincomycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and amikacin) from 9 structural classes (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, lincosamides, tetracyclines, glycopeptides, and aminoglycosides), as well as the biocide triclosan. Potency measurements were determined from dose-response relationships obtained by exposing Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis reference strains to treated samples of each antibacterial compound via broth micro- or macrodilution assays and related to the measured residual concentrations of parent antibacterial in each sample. Data obtained from these experiments show that O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot reactions lead in nearly all cases to stoichiometric elimination of antibacterial activity (i.e., loss of 1 mole equivalent of potency per mole of parent compound consumed). The beta-lactams penicillin G (PG) and cephalexin (CP) represent the only clear exceptions, as bioassay measurements indicate that biologically active products may be formed in the reactions of these two compounds with both O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot. The active product(s) generated in the direct reaction of O-3 with PG appear(s) to be recalcitrant to further transformation by O-3, though any biologically active products formed in the reactions of CP with O-3, or of either PG or CP with (OH)-O-center dot, are apparently deactivated by further reactions with O-3 or (OH)-O-center dot, respectively. Thus, with few exceptions, it can be expected that municipal wastewater ozonation will generally yield sufficient structural modification of antibacterial molecules to eliminate their antibacterial activities, whether oxidation results from selective reactions with O-3 or from relatively nonselective reactions with incidentally produced (OH)-O-center dot.

AB The present study demonstrates the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water from the Mankyung River, South Korea. Samples collected at 5 Sites along the Mankyung River were assayed using a liquid chromatograph coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) for 13 PPCPs. Overall, I I out of the 13 selected PPCPs, which span a range of therapeutic classes and one personal care product, were detected in surface water samples collected from the Mankyung River. The most prevalent contaminants were ibuprofen, with average concentrations ranging from not detected (ND) to 414 ng/l, followed by carbamazepine (ND-595 ng/l), atenolol (ND-690 ng/l), clarithromycin (ND-443 ng/l), mefenamic acid (ND-326 ng/l), erythromycin (ND-137 ng/l) fluconazole (ND-111 ng/l), levofloxacin (ND-87.4 ng/l), indomethacin (ND-33.5 ng/l), propranolol (ND-40.1 ng/l). ifenprodil (ND-35.4 ng/l), disopyramide (ND) and triclosan (ND). PPCP concentrations were highest in surface water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP), implying possibly insufficient removal efficiency of the PPCPs in the STP. Contamination by PPCPs such as ibuprofen, carbamazepine, atenolol, mefenamic acid and clarithromycin was high in the Mankyung River compared to concentrations in other countries.

AB Irrigation of crops with treated wastewater has been employed in many regions of the world. It mitigates the pressure of water demand, however, it also introduces effluent-derived organic contaminants into surface waters via agricultural runoff. In this study, a potato field located in southern California was selected as the research site. Runoff samples were collected during irrigation events, and a variety of compounds were identified both in irrigation water and runoff samples. Treatments on the field included polyacrylamide (PAM) application, deep plow, previous-grown Sudan grass, and control (without above treatments). The compounds included pharmaceuticals (e.g., clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac), personal care product (e.g., triclosan), endocrine disrupting compounds (e.g., bisphenol A, 4-n-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol), and estrogenic compounds (e.g., estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol). The monitoring results showed the presence of these compounds in runoff samples. They were at concentrations from below limits of quantification (LOQ) to sub mu g/l levels. Although their levels were low, their potential to elicit adverse effects in aquatic organisms cannot be overlooked.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter aquatic environments via sewage treatment facilities and their potentially toxic effects oil biota, particularly aquatic organisms, are of considerable concern. In this Study, we investigated the acute toxicity of selected PPCPs on a freshwater crustacean (Thamnocephalus platyurus) and a fish species (Oryzias latipes). The 24-hr median lethal concentration (LC50) values of ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, indometacin, carbamazepine, propranolol, ifenprodil, clarithromycin and triclosan for T. platyurus were estimated to be 19.59, 3.95, 16.14, > 100, 10.31, 4.43, 94.23 and 0.47 mg/l respectively. Conversely, the 96-hr LC50 values for these PPCPs were estimated at > 100, 8.04, 81.92, 45.87, 11.40, 8.71, > 100 and 0.60 mg/l for O. latipes, respectively. The toxic sensitivity of T platyurus to these PPCPs, except for carbamazepine, was therefore higher than for O. latipes. No acute toxicity effects were associated with PPCPs, such as atenolol, disopyramide, famotidine, fluconazole, erythromycin and levofloxacin, in the two aquatic organisms at the concentrations tested ill this Study (> 100 mg/l). These findings may help us to understand the potential biological effects and risks associated with PPCP exposure in aquatic organisms. Further long-term studies are required to fully assess the growth and reproduction of these compounds on aquatic biota.

AB The feasibility of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process to treat wastewaters containing antibiotics was studied in this work. Concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg L-1 for tetracycline hydrochloride and from 250 to 1000 mg L-1 for chloramphenicol were tested in batch assays. A strong inhibitory effect was observed for both antibiotics.
   A concentration of 20 mg L-1 of chloramphenicol was continuously added to an Anammox Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) system, causing a decrease of the nitrogen removal efficiency of 25%. The Specific Anammox Activity (SAA) of the biomass also decreased from 0.25 to 0.05 g N (g VSS d)(-1). Similar effects were observed when 50 mg L-1 of tetracycline hydrochloride were continuously fed. Both antibiotics did not cause any changes in the physical properties of the biomass. A previous degradation step could be necessary in order to treat wastewaters containing inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics by the Anammox process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The surface flow constructed wetland (SF CW) in Can Cabanyes (Granollers, Catalonia, northeastern Spain) was created as a part of a series of activities aimed at restoring a highly impacted fluvial peri-urban zone. The system is fed with a small part of the secondary effluent, which is not completely nitrified, from an urban wastewater treatment plant. Effluents in the SF CW were sampled between 2003 and 2006 for physical and chemical parameters and faecal bacteria indicators. In addition, 8 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in June 2005 and February 2006. The system showed a good reliability for ammonium and faecal bacteria removal, with average ammonium efficiencies between 64 and 87% and a removal of approximately 2 logarithmic units of Faecal Coliforms. A clear seasonal trend was observed for ammonium. The results for PPCPs demonstrated that the wetland has a good capacity for removing a large variety of these compounds; the removal efficiencies were higher than 70% for most of them, with the exception of clofibric acid (34%) and carbamazepine (39%). Although the chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid removal rates were either low or zero because of the permanent eutrophic conditions of the system and the low incoming concentrations, the effluent quality is generally considered to be quite good.

AB The presence of 28 antibiotics in three hospital effluents, five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), six rivers and a drinking water storage catchment were investigated within watersheds of South-East Queensland, Australia. All antibiotics were detected at least once, with the exception of the polypeptide bacitracin which was not detected at all. Antibiotics were found in hospital effluent ranging from 0.01-14.5 mu g L-1, dominated by the beta-lactam, quinolone and sulphonamide groups. Antibiotics were found in WWTP influent up to 64 mu g L-1, dominated by the beta-lactam, quinolone and sulphonamide groups. Investigated WWTPs were highly effective in removing antibiotics from the water phase, with an average removal rate of greater than 80% for all targeted antibiotics. However, antibiotics were still detected in WWTP effluents in the low ng L-1 range up to a maximum of 3.4 mu g L-1, with the macrolide, quinolone and sulphonamide antibiotics most prevalent. Similarly, antibiotics were detected quite frequently in the low ng L-1 range, up to 2 mu g L-1 in the surface waters of six investigated rivers including freshwater, estuarine and marine samples. The total investigated antibiotic concentration (TIAC) within the Nerang River was significantly lower (p<0.05) than all other rivers sampled. The absence of WWTP discharge to this river is a likely explanation for the significantly lower TIAC and suggests that WWTP discharges are a dominant source of antibiotics to investigated surface waters. A significant difference (p<0.001) was identified between TIACs at surface water sites with WWTP discharge compared to sites with no WWTP discharge, providing further evidence that WWTPs are an important source of antibiotics to streams. Despite the presence of antibiotics in surface waters used for drinking water extraction, no targeted antibiotics were detected in any drinking water samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence and removal rate of seven pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, fluoxetine, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin), two metabolites (norfluoxetine, clofibric acid), one degradation product (4-isobutylacetophenone) and 3 estrogens (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone) were studied in the inlet and outlet of a tertiary sewage treatment plant (STP) in Sweden as well as between different treatment steps in the STP which includes a conventional activated sludge step. Pharmaceuticals in raw household and raw hospital sewage streams leading to the STP were as well investigated. Hydraulic retention times (HRT) of each treatment step was considered for sampling and for the calculation of the removal rates. These rates were above 90%, except for diclofenac, clofibric acid, estrone and ofloxacin. However, only diclofenac and naproxen showed significant effluent loads (>145 mg/d/1000 inh). Diclofenac was not eliminated during the treatment and in fact even higher concentrations were found at the effluent than in the inlet of the STP. 17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol was not detected in any of the samples. Results indicate that a STP such as the one in Kristianstad, Sweden, with a tertiary treatment is sufficient to remove significantly most of the investigated pharmaceuticals. The chemical treatment improved the removal of several pharmaceuticals especially the antibiotics, which showed step removal rates between 55 and 70%. The expected concentration levels of the pharmaceuticals in the surface water (dilution 1 to 10) close to the outlet of the STP are below the no-observed effect-concentration (NOEC). However, despite that this would imply no important effects in the aquatic environment one cannot rule out negative consequences nearby the STP because most of the NOEC values are derived from acute toxicity data. This may underestimate the real impact of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geochemical and microbiological techniques were used to assess water-quality impacts from the land application of treated municipal wastewater in the karstic Wakulla Springs basin in northern Florida. Nitrate-N concentrations have increased from about 0.2 to as high as 1.1 mg/L (milligrams per liter) during the past 30 years in Wakulla Springs, a regional discharge point for groundwater (mean flow about 11.3 m(3)/s) from the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA). A major source of nitrate to the UFA is the approximately 64 million L/d (liters per day) of treated municipal wastewater applied at a 774 ha (hectare) sprayfield farming operation. About 260 chemical and microbiological indicators were analyzed in water samples from the sprayfield effluent reservoir, wells upgradient from the sprayfield, and from 21 downgradient wells and springs to assess the movement of contaminants into the UFA. Concentrations of nitrate-N, boron, chloride, were elevated in water samples from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and in monitoring wells at the sprayfield boundary. Mixing of sprayfield effluent water was indicated by a systematic decrease in concentrations of these constituents with distance downgradient from the sprayfield, with about a 10-fold dilution at Wakulla Springs, about 15 km (kilometers) downgradient from the sprayfield. Groundwater with elevated chloride and boron concentrations in wells downgradient from the sprayfield and in Wakulla Springs had similar nitrate isotopic signatures, whereas the nitrate isotopic composition of water from other sites was consistent with inorganic fertilizers or denitrification. The sprayfield operation was highly effective in removing most studied organic wastewater and pharmaceutical compounds and microbial indicators. Carbamazepine (an anti-convulsant drug) was the only pharmaceutical compound detected in groundwater from two sprayfield monitoring wells (1-2 ppt). One other detection of carbamazepine was found in a distant well water sample where enteroviruses also were detected, indicating a likely influence from a nearby septic tank.

AB This research was set up in response to new European legislation to identify cost-effective treatment for removal of steroid estrogens from effluent. This study aimed to compare estrogen removal of two types of granular activated carbon: virgin (F400) and reactivated (C401) carbon. Rapid, small-scale column tests were conducted with a total bed volume of 24.9 cm(3) over three columns, and analysis was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results demonstrated that C401 performed more efficiently with greater than or equal to 81% estrogen removal in wastewater compared to F400 which produced greater than or equal to 65% estrogen removal. Estrogen removal can be affected by competitive adsorption from natural organic matter present in wastewater. In addition, the physical properties of each carbon had the potential to influence adsorption differently, thus resulting in the observed varied adsorption capability of the two carbons.

AB A photocatalytic reactor membrane pilot system, employing UV/TiO(2) photocatalysis, was evaluated for its ability to remove thirty-two pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, and estrogenic activity from water. Concentrations of all compounds decreased following treatment, and removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics as a function of the amount of treatment. Twenty-nine of the targeted compounds in addition to total estrogenic activity were greater than 70% removed while only three compounds were less than 50% removed following the highest level of treatment (4,.24 kW h/m(3)). No estrogenically active transformation products were formed during treatment. Additionally, the unit was operated in photolytic mode (UV only) and photolytic plus H(2)O(2) mode (UV/H(2)O(2)) to determine the relative amount of energy required. Based on the electrical energy per order (EEO), the unit achieved the greatest efficiency when operated in photolytic plus H(2)O(2) mode for the conditions tested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of four pharmaceutical compounds (PhACs), ibuprofen (IBU), diphenhydramine (DP), phenazone (PZ), and phenytoin (PHT) was investigated via ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and UV/H2O2 process with a low-pressure (LP) LTV lamp. For each PhAC tested, direct photolysis quantum yields at 254 nm were found to be ranging from 6.32 x 10(-2) to 2.79 x 10(-1) mol E-1 at pH 7. The second-order rate constants of the reaction between the PhACs and (OH)-O-center dot were determined to be from 4.86 x 10(9) to 6.67 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) by using a competition kinetic model which utilized para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a reference compound. The overall effect of (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging from humic acid (HA) and anions HCO3-, NO3- was measured utilizing R-OH,R-UV method through examining the aqueous photodegradation of pCBA as a probe compound. Moreover, these fundamental direct and indirect photolysis parameters were applied in the model prediction for oxidation rate constants of the PhACs in UV/H2O2 process. It was found that the predicted oxidation rate constants approximated the observed ones. The results indicated that the new R-OH,R-UV probe compound method was applicable for measuring background (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging effects in water treatment process of UV/H2O2. Furthermore, by GC-MS analysis, most of the intermediates created during the photodegradation of the selected PhACs in UV/H2O2 process were identified. For the photodegradation of PZ, a competition mechanism existed between the direct UV photolysis and the oxidation of (OH)-O-center dot. An appropriate dosage of H2O2 could hinder the occurrence of the direct photolysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology is an interesting option for single-house wastewater treatment or small communities. Because typically a very high effluent quality is achieved with respect to pathogens, suspended solids, organics and nitrogen, the permeate is well suited for reuse. Little is known about the fate of micropollutants in such small systems. The differences between centralized and decentralized biological wastewater treatment with respect to micropollutants are manifold: besides the operational parameters like hydraulic and sludge retention time, the main difference is in the load variation. While the influent load is expected to be more or less constant in large catchments, it varies strongly in small MBRs due to irregular consumption (e.g. of medication by individuals). Concentrations of micropollutants are higher by a factor 50-1000 than in centralized treatment. It is also unknown how reliable degradation of micropollutants is in case of irregular exposure.
   In this study, two experiments were conducted in a small MBR treating the wastewater of a three-person household. During normal operation of the treatment plant, 25 pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, antiphlogistics, lipid regulators, iodinated contrast media and hormones) that had not been used by members of the household were added in concentrations typical for municipal wastewater. The removal of most substances was in the same range as for centralized wastewater treatment. It was shown that biological transformation was the main elimination process while adsorption to the activated sludge was negligible for most substances due to the low sludge production at high sludge retention time. No appreciable lag for inducing biological degradation was observed. The high hydraulic and sludge residence time had a positive effect on the elimination of slowly degradable substances, but this was partly compensated by the lower biological activity. An experiment with antibiotics concentrations typical for decentralized treatment (between 500 and 1000 mu g l(-1); sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, roxithromycin) did not show an inhibitory effect on either nitrification or denitrification.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in landfills has been largely neglected. Once discarded in municipal solid waste (MSW), pharmaceuticals within a landfill may undergo degradation, adsorption, or enter the leachate and eventually exit the landfill. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration of MSW was predicted using available statistics on medication usage and directly measured by a MSW composition study. Estimation calculations resulted in a potential concentration of APIs from 7.4 to 45 mg/kg of MSW, varying with the percentage of dispensed medications assumed to become unused. Direct measurement resulted in the collection of 22 APIs comprising a total of 22,910 mg. This resulted in a final concentration of 8.1 mg/kg within MSW. Additionally, 45 empty medication containers were collected which potentially contained 33 differing APIs upon disposal. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An engineered constructed wetland, fed with wastewater effluent, was investigated with respect to the control of organic micropollutants. The levels of 30 different micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors and personal care products, were measured using solid phase extraction, followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometer. Only 9 of the 30 chemicals exhibited relatively high concentrations in the effluent samples. Therefore, these were further characterized for their removals by the constructed wetlands. Atenolol, naproxen, and triclosan consistently showed fairly good removal trends, as measured during both May and August 2007. Sulfamethoxazole and dilantine, and carbamazepine, diazepam and triclosan exhibited medium-range and fluctuating (or somewhat low) removal behaviors, respectively. Attempts were made to determine the dominant removal mechanisms, with regard to soils and plants, using two different extraction methods. However, no substantial amounts were detected, thus it was not possible to induce potential removal mechanisms. Analyses of the removal efficiencies and two characteristic parameters (logK(ow) and pK(a)) showed no evidence supporting hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions for the control of micropollutants.

AB The occurrence and estimated concentration of twenty illicit and therapeutic pharmaceuticals and metabolites in surface waters influenced by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge and in wastewater effluents in Nebraska were determined using Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS). Samplers were installed in rivers upstream and downstream of treated WWTP discharge at four sites and in a discharge canal at a fifth location. Based on differences in estimated concentrations determined from pharmaceuticals recovered from POCIS, WWTP effluent was found to be a significant source of pharmaceutical loading to the receiving waters. Effluents from WWTPs with trickling filters or trickling filters in parallel with activated sludge resulted in the highest observed in-stream pharmaceutical concentrations. Azithromycin, caffeine, 1,7-dimethylzanthine, carbamazepine, cotinine, DEET, diphenhydramine, and sulfamethazine were detected at all locations. Methamphetamine, an illicit pharmaceutical, was detected at all but one of the sampling locations, representing only the second report of methamphetamine detected in WWTP effluent and in streams impacted by WWTP effluent.

AB Microbial degradation rates were measured for 19 pharmaceuticals in estuarine and coastal surface water samples. Antipyrine, carbamazepine, cotinine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim were the most refractory (half-lives, t(1/2) = 35 to > 100 days), making them excellent candidates for wastewater tracers. Nicotine, acetaminophen, and fluoxetine were labile across all treatments (t(1/2) = 0.68-11 days). Caffeine, diltiazem, and nifedipine were also and relatively labile in all but one of the treatments (t(1/2) = 3.5-13 days). Microbial degradation of caffeine was further confirmed by production (CO2)-C-14. The fastest decay of non-refractory compounds was always observed in more sewage-affected Jamaica Bay waters. Degradation rates for the majority of these pharmaceuticals are much slower than reported rates for small biomolecules, such as glucose and amino acids. Batch sorption experiments indicate that removal of these soluble pharmaceuticals from the water column to sediments is a relatively insignificant removal process in these receiving waters.

AB In order to analyse genetic relationships between functional strain Xhhh previously constructed through protoplast fusion for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and its parents, random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPID) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to investigate genetic similarities among the strains based on genome and functional genes analyses. A total of 739 clear and consistent bands were produced in the RAPID fingerprint analysis with 40 primers. The genetic similarity indices between Xhhh and parental strains PC (Phanerochaete chrysosporium), SC (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and XZ (native bacterium Bacillus sp.) were 36.21%, 37.73% and 37.48%, respectively. With PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, Xhhh was found containing functional genes of mnp and lip from PC, FLO1 from SC and 165 rDNA fragments from XZ. Experimental results of genetic analyses were in accordance with Xhhh biochemical and phenotypic characteristics, and protoplast fusion technique is considered as a promising technique in environmental pollution control.

AB The main objective of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated and biologically treated effluent of herbal pharmaceutical industry. The acute toxicity test was determined using freshwater crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia under laboratory conditions. LC50 values for raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated effluent for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h ranged between 3.0-4.5%, 3.9-10.8% and 22-28% respectively. It is evident from the results that physicochemical treatment reduced the toxicity by around 25% while biological treatment reduced the toxicity completely. Results subjected to statistical evaluation depicted regression coefficient of more than 0.9 indicating good correlation between the mortality rate and effluent concentrations.

AB Information is limited regarding Sources, distribution, environmental behavior, and fate of prescribed and illicit drugs. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can be one of the sources of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP) into streams, rivers and lakes. The objective of this study was to determine the contamination profiles and mass loadings of urobilin (a chemical marker of human waste), macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin), and two drugs of abuse (methamphetamine and ecstasy), from a small (<19 mega liters day(-1), equivalent to <5 million gallons per day) wastewater treatment plant in southwestern Kentucky. The concentrations of azithromycin, clarithromycin, methamphetamine and ecstasy in wastewater samples varied widely, ranging from non-detects to 300 ng L-1. Among the macrolide antibiotics analyzed, azithromycin was consistently detected in influent and effluent samples. in general, influent samples contained relatively higher concentrations of the analytes than the effluents. Based on the daily flow rates and an average concentration of 17.5 ng L-1 in the effluent, the estimated discharge of azithromycin was 200 mg day(-1) (range 63-400 mg day(-1)). Removal efficiency of the detected analytes from this WWTP were in the following order: Urobilin > nnethamphetamine > azithromycin with percentages of removal of 99.9%, 54.5% and 47%, respectively, indicating that the azithromycin and methamphetamine are relatively more recalcitrant than others and have potential for entering receiving waters.

AB Membrane processes, especially reverse osmosis, have played a major role since the early 1990s in the production of high-purity water for power, pharmaceutical, beverage and semi-conductor industries, and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of this water sector to meet ever-increasing demands of water purity, especially in microelectronics applications. Power plants are the single largest user of high-purity water. Membrane processes are also being increasingly used in the reduction of wastewater, water reclamation, recycle and conservation, and environmental pollution control. The production of high-purity water and ultra-pure water for the above-mentioned industries is described in detail. Recent advances, new processes and membrane development such as high performance systems, hot water sanitisation and shrinking line width in microelectronics devices to meet critical requirements are discussed.

AB Oxolinic acid, flumequine, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol are antibiotics commonly used in farming. Because an important percentage of these antibiotics given to fish and cattle ends up, directly or indirectly, in the freshwater environment, suitable tools for the monitoring of these antibiotics are needed. A French river was chosen because of the location of four fish farms and a sewage plant on its main course. First, a passive monitoring program involving water, sediment, and autochthonous bryophytes was performed at 25 sampling sites tested once every three months for one year. Second, an active monitoring method was performed using moss bags for a one-month exposure period, both upstream and downstream of each potential source of antibiotics. Sediment and bryophyte samples, but not water samples, were found to be useful for monitoring environmental contamination by oxolinic acid, flumequine, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol. Sediments and bryophytes also appeared to be complementary media for dating the river's contamination by antibiotics. Data collected by both active and passive monitoring methods confirmed contamination of the river, mainly by flumequine and oxytetracycline, attributable to fish farming but also to terrestrial animal farming and perhaps human pharmaceuticals.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in treated wastewater and in surface waters is a growing environmental concern. This paper provides information about general awareness of the issue, disposal practices, willingness to pay for a disposal program, and willingness to participate in a disposal program. The results are based on a telephone survey of 1005 residents in southern California. Less than half of the respondents are aware of the issue. While disposal of unused medications through the trash and toilet/sink is the most common practices, respondents that are aware of the issue are more likely to return pharmaceuticals to a pharmacy or drop them off at a hazardous waste center. The results of a contingent valuation question indicate a substantial willingness to pay a surcharge on prescriptions to support the establishment of a pharmaceutical disposal program. The more conservative estimate of mean willingness to pay is $1.53 per prescription, which translates into an average annual willingness to pay of approximately $14. A benefit-cost comparison suggests ample scope for establishing a pharmaceutical disposal program that would yield positive net social benefits, even if the surcharge was applied to only one prescription per year. We also find that respondents are likely to participate in a disposal program. Assuming that the program is based on drop-off locations at local pharmacies, approximately 70 percent of the respondents would be very likely to return their unwanted or expired medicines.

AB Nanomolar concentrations of steroid hormones such as 17 beta-estradiol can influence the reproductive development and sex ratios of invertebrate and vertebrate populations. Thus their release into surface and ground waters from wastewater facilities and agricultural applications of animal waste is of environmental concern. Many of these compounds are chromophoric and susceptible to photolytic degradation. High intensity UV-C radiation has been demonstrated to degrade some of these compounds in engineered systems. However, the degradation efficacy of natural solar radiation in shallow fresh waters is less understood. Here photolytic experiments with 17 beta-estradiol demonstrated modest photodegradation (similar to 26%) when exposed to simulated sunlight between 290 and 720 nm. Photodegradation significantly increased (similar to 40-50%) in the presence of 2.0-15.0 mg/l of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from humic acids of the Suwannee River, GA. However, rates of photodegradation reached a threshold at approximately 5.0 mg/l DOC. Observed suppression of photolysis in the presence of a radical inhibitor (i.e. 2-propanol) indicated that a significant proportion of the degradation was due to radicals formed from the photolysis of DOC. Although photodegradation was greatest in full sunlight containing UV-B (290-320 nm), degradation was also detected with UV-A (320-400 nm) and visible light (400-720 nm) alone. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Passive sampling is a tool to monitor the presence and concentrations of micropollutants in the aquatic environment. We investigated the duration of integrative sampling and the effects of flow rate on the performance of three configurations of the Chemcatcher - a sampler for polar organic compounds. Chemcatchers were fitted with Empore (TM) styrenedivinylbenzene (SDB) XC disks (XC), SDB-RPS disks (RPS) or SDB-RPS disks covered with a polyethersulfone membrane (RPS-PES). Samplers were either exposed to treated sewage effluent for 5 days at various flow rates, or at a single flow rate with overlapping exposures of 3-24 days. Chemical analysis focused on a set of pharmaceuticals and biocides and ecotoxicological analysis measured inhibition of photosystem II in algae. For compounds with log K-OW > 2, both XC and RPS disks respond dynamically to higher flow rates; uptake increased up to five-fold when flow increased from 0.03 to 0.37 m s(-1). At a flow rate of 0.13 m s(-1) the integrative window of SDB disks approached 6 days for more hydrophobic compounds (log K-OW > 3.5). The RPS-PES configuration was less affected by flow and also showed an extended integrative window (up to 24 days). The membrane causes a lag phase of up to 2.3 days which thwarts a sound interpretation of data from sampling periods of less than 10 days. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil-aquifer treatment is a wastewater treatment and reclamation option to facilitate beneficial water reuse. The fate of wastewater originated micropollutants in the soil-aquifer system is important to understand. In the study the sorption behavior of potential wastewater indicators such as two antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, primidone), one sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole), and one corrosion inhibitor (benzotriazole) were determined with three natural soils (Lufa 2.2, Euro Soil 5, and Wulpen sand) that differed in pH, organic carbon content and particle size distribution. As aqueous phase a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution as well as the effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used. Affinities of all analytes to the soil increased from Wulpen sand, over Lufa 2.2 to Euro Soil 5, indicating that the organic carbon contents might be crucial for sorption. isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model. Sorption was mainly close to linear (n = 0.93-1.07) for most target compounds and soils. Desorption gave rise to a small hysteresis only for Euro Soil 5 which was likely artificial, due to slow desorption kinetics beyond 24 h used in the experiment. All sorption studies confirmed that Carbamazepine, Benzotriazole and Primidone are appropriate to be used as wastewater indicator substances based on their low sorption affinity to soils, while the suitability of Sulfamethoxazole is limited due to the formation of non-extractable residues, especially at lower pH values.

AB Three tertiary-treated wastewater effluents were evaluated to determine the impact of wastewater quality (i.e. effluent organic matter (EfOM), nitrite, and alkalinity) on ozone (O-3) decomposition and subsequent removal of 31 organic contaminants including endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. The O-3 dose was normalized based upon total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrite to allow comparison between the different wastewaters with respect to O-3 decomposition. EfOM with higher molecular weight components underwent greater transformation, which corresponded to increased O-3 decomposition when compared on a TOC basis. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) exposure, measured by parachlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), showed that limited (OH)-O-center dot was available for contaminant destruction during the initial stage of O-3 decomposition (t < 30 s) due to the effect of the scavenging by the water quality. Advanced oxidation using O-3 and hydrogen peroxide did not increase the net production of (OH)-O-center dot compared to O-3 under the conditions studied. EfOM reactivity impacted the removal of trace contaminants when evaluated based on the O-3:TOC ratio. Trace contaminants with second order reaction rate constants with O-3 (k(O3)) > 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and (OH)-O-center dot (k(OH)) > 10(9) M-1 s(-1), including carbamazepine, diclofenac, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan, were >95% removed independent of water quality when the O-3 exposure (integral O-3 dt) was measurable (0-0.8 mg min/L). O-3 exposure would be a conservative surrogate to assess the removal of trace contaminants that re fast-reacting with O-3. Removal of contaminants with k(O3) < 10 M-1 s(-1) and k(OH) > 10(9) M-1 s(-1), including atrazine, iopromide, diazepam, and ibuprofen, varied when O-3 exposure could not be measured, and appeared to be dependent upon the compound specific k(OH center dot) Atrazine, diazepam, ibuprofen and iopromide provided excellent linear correlation with pCBA (R-2 > 0.86) making them good indicators of (OH)-O-center dot availability.

AB The removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs was investigated in a representative conventional German WWTP by long-term measurement campaigns along different biological treatment processes. The activated sludge treatment with an elevated SRT of 18 d was the only process which led to a significant removal of certain beta blockers and psycho-active drugs. The removal efficiency was below 60% for all compounds except for the natural opium alkaloids codeine and morphine being removed by more than 80%. Primary biological transformation and sorption onto sludge as the main removal mechanisms were examined in lab-scale batch experiments. Sorption onto activated sludge was found to be negligible (<3%). The biological transformation could be described by pseudo-first order kinetics and the transformation constants k(biol) were used to predict the removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in an activated sludge unit with a model. For most compounds the removal efficiencies measured on the full-scale WWTP were within the 95% confidence intervals predicted by the model. The results from full-scale measurements and modeling indicate that biological transformation in the nitrification tank together with parameters such as the sludge retention time and the temperature is crucial regarding the biological transformation of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in conventional WWTPs.

AB Estimates of cocaine consumption are currently resulting from population surveys, consumer interviews and crime statistics. A new approach ("sewage epidemiology") based on the analysis of cocaine (COC) and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), in water samples was applied to 10 river sites and 30 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Belgium. Each river site was sampled twice, during the summer of 2007 and the winter of 2007-2008, while each WWTP was sampled on a Sunday and a Wednesday, during the summer-autumn of 2007 and the winter of 2007-2008. This sampling strategy allowed for the evaluation of spatial and seasonal variations in the occurrence of COC and BE in waste- and surface water. WWTP Brussel-Noord was sampled for 19 consecutive days to evaluate daily and weekly variations in the presence of COC and BE in wastewater. For 7 WWTPs, influent and effluent water samples were collected to investigate the removal of COC and BE during the wastewater treatment process. Analysis of water samples was performed using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Measured concentrations were further converted into an amount of used cocaine, called cocaine equivalents, as previously described in the literature. Results showed no significant difference in cocaine use between the investigated seasons. A constant cocaine consumption was observed during the week (Monday-Friday) with peaks during the weekend for WWTP Brussel-Noord. The COC/BE ratio in water samples was significantly higher during winter, most probably due to a slower hydrolysis of cocaine in low-temperature water. COC and BE were removed in the investigated WWTPs with a removal efficiency of >93%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Remediation of pharmaceutical wastewater, containing nalidixic acid (NXA; 38 mg/L), a quinolone antibacterial agent commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, and characterized as having mainly 725 mg/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 3400 mg/L chemical oxygen demand, and around 4 g/L NaCl, was studied. A prior biodegradability study (Zahn-Wellens test) had demonstrated that the matrix was biodegradable after a rather long biomass adaptation period. After 4 days of treatment in an immobilized biomass reactor (IBR), 96% of the original DOC was removed by the biological treatment; however, more than 50% of NXA was adsorbed on the biomass. As development of chronic toxicity in the IBR is possible after long exposure to NXA, adsorption and biomass stability during continuous exposure to NXA were studied in different cycles for one month. After the biotreatment, the effluent was treated by solar photo-Fenton. Total degradation of NXA and reduction intoxicity were observed. The intermediates formed during degradation by biotreatment and subsequent photo-Fenton were studied by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

AB The treated wastewater consists of refractory materials and high organic content of hydrolyzed peptone residues from pharmaceutical factory. The combination of electrocoagulation (EC) followed by heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO2) conditions was maximized. The EC: iron cathode/anode (12.50 cm x 2.50 cm x 0.10 cm), current density 763 A m(-2), 90 min and initial pH 6.0. As EC consequence. the majority of the dissolved organic and suspended material was removed (about 91% and 86% of the turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively). After EC, refractory residues still remained in the effluent. The subsequent photocatalysis: UV/TiO2/H2O2 (mercury lamps), pH 3.0, 4h irradiation, 0.25 g L-1 TiO2 and 10 mmol L-1 H2O2 shows high levels of inorganic and organic compounds eliminations. The obtained COD values: 1753 mg L-1 for the sample from the factory, 160 mg L-1 after EC and 50 mg L-1 after EC/photocatalyzed effluents pointed out that the combined treatment stresses this water purification.

AB The aim of the present work was to evaluate the sorption capacity of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) to remove mixtures of ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid in water and wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained for carbamazepine and ibuprofen while a less satisfactory performance was observed for clofibric acid. In a mixture of the three compounds in water a slight decrease in the sorbed amounts is observed in comparison with solutions of the single compounds, indicating some competitive sorption. In wastewater, the pharmaceuticals mixture also undergoes a slight reduction in the sorbed amounts of carbamazepine and ibuprofen, probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter which increases their solubility These compounds were removed in the following order of efficiencies in all the tested conditions: carbamazepine > ibuprofen > clofibric acid. Two other clay materials - sepiolite and vermiculite - were tested for the removal of the more recalcitrant clofibric acid, and vermiculite exhibited higher removal efficiency than LECA. The sorption is characterized by an initial fast step, with most pharmaceuticals being removed within the first 24h. The results of this study are a first step in the process of selecting an appropriate material or combination of materials to be used as media in SSF-CWs designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters.

AB The reaction of the drug atenolol with hypochlorite under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection was investigated. The pharmaceutical reacted in 1 h yielding three products that were separated by chromatographic techniques and characterized by spectroscopic features. Two unusual products 2-(4-(3-(chloro(2-chloropropan-2-yl)amino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and 2-(4-(3-formamido-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide were obtained along with 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide. When the reaction was stopped at shorter times only 2-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl) acetamide and the dichlorinated product were detected. Tests performed on the seeds of Lactuca sativa show that chlorinated products have phytotoxic activity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A screening using four white-rot fungi (Trametes versicolor, Irpex lacteus, Ganoderma lucidum and Phanerochaete chrysosporium) was performed on the degradation of 10 mg L-1 of ibuprofen (IBU, anti-inflammatory), clofibric acid (CLOFI, lipid regulator) and carbamazepine (CARBA, antiepileptic/analgetic) after 7 d of incubation. Whereas IBU was extensively degraded by all the fungi tested, T. versicolor was the only strain able to degrade either CLOFI (similar to 91%) and CARBA (similar to 58%), although the latter was also degraded by G. lucidum (similar to 47%). In vitro experiments using manganese peroxidase and laccase-mediator system showed that extracellular fungal enzyme systems did not appear to play a role in the first step of degradation. However, our in vivo studies using the cytochrome P450 inhibitors I-aminobenzotriazole and piperonyl butoxide suggested that the cytochrome P450 system may be involved in the first step of CLOFI and CARBA oxidation by T. versicolor. During the very early stages of IBU degradation by T. versicolor, two hydroxylated metabolites were detected: 1-hydroxy ibuprofen and 2-hydroxy ibuprofen. These byproducts were subsequently degraded by the fungus to 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, that was not reported in biological systems to date. Furthermore, these results are of particular interest because CLOFI and CARBA are highly persistent in the aquatic environment and they pass unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The ozonation of caffeine in water was performed at different pH values, including acidic conditions. Kinetic experiments were conducted by adding pulses of a concentrated caffeine solution to ozone saturated water. The results showed a rapid decrease of ozone concentration during the first 15 s after injection, followed by a gradual decline at a much slower rate. The data were fitted to a second order kinetic model with rate constants increasing from 0.25 to 1.05 M(-1) s(-1) for pH in the 3-10 range. The initial ozone consumption per mol of ozonated caffeine was greater at high pH values, reflecting a higher ozone decomposition rate. The decomposition of ozone was positively affected by the concentration of caffeine, an effect that could be attributed to the presence of a reaction intermediate from the ozonation of caffeine that behaved as a strong promoter of ozone decomposition. A study of the transformation products identified by liquid chromatography in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was carried out, which permitted a tentative degradation pathway to be proposed and several persistent by-products to be identified at both pH 3 and 8. Most transformation products were the result of the opening of the imidazole ring after breaking caffeine's N9C8 double bond. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Strategies for sample preparation. solid-phase extraction (SPE), clean-up, and detection conditions of an optimized solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography/mass/mass spectrometry (SPE-LC/MS/MS) method for determining multi-residues of four classes of widely used antibiotics in pig farms, sulfonamides (SAs), fluoroquinolone (FQs), tetracycline (TCs) and chloramphenicol (CAP) were presented. The multi-residue analysis was used in MS analysis, selecting two precursor ions to produce ion transitions for each target compound. Samples of swine wastewater, lake water and groundwater collected from two pig farms in central China were used to test the applicability of the multi-residue analysis method. The average antibiotics concentrations in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater were, respectively, 1.6-8.6, 5.7-11.6, 7.9-1172.3 and 8.5-21692.7 ngL(-1) in summer; respectively, 2.0-7.3, 6.7-11.7,5.8-409.5 and 32.8-11276.6ngL(-1) in winter. The limits of quantification were 0.8-4.1,1.4-5.5,1.8-11.5 and 6.4-104.4ngL(-1), respectively, in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater. Results of multi-residue analysis of antibiotics in the samples indicate that SAs, FQs and TCs were widely used veterinary medicines in the pig farms. As compared with previous studies, higher elimination rates (more than 80%) of the antibiotics (except DC) were observed in effluent in this study. More detailed work is indispensable to investigate the fate and transport of antibiotics in the environment and to find out cost-effective approaches of removing antibiotics from swine wastewater and contaminated sites.

AB Sertraline hydrochloride is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely prescribed to patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Pharmaceutical products such as sertraline have been identified in environmental waters. This study describes the evaluation of sertraline using a battery of freshwater species representing four trophic levels. The species most sensitive to sertraline were Daphnia magna 21 d reproduction test, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata 72 h growth inhibition, and Oncorhynchus mykiss 96 h mortality, with the Microtox assay being the least sensitive assay. The D. magna 21 d reproduction test was approximately two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the other bioassays. These results show the advantages of having a tiered approach within a test battery. The presented results indicate that sertraline hydrochloride adversely affects aquatic organisms at levels several orders of magnitude higher than that reported in municipal effluent concentrations, however adverse effects may result from lower concentration exposures, further research into chronic toxicity is therefore advocated.

AB Although various single-concentration measurements of the pharmaceutical diclofenac are available in literature, detailed information on the mass flux in the aquatic environment is often missing. Therefore, the overall load of diclofenac was obtained by recording each concentration in nine effluents of sewage treatment plants (STP) and at three river sites located in the area of the river Main (Germany) over a time period of six weeks.
   In STP effluents, concentrations of up to 2200 ng/L were obtained. In combination with flow rates and connected population an average specific load per capita and day of 0.28 mg (+/-0.11 mg) diclofenac reaches the receiving water course. This average specific load per capita is an expressive parameter to assess main diclofenac exposure to the aquatic environment avoiding uncertainties of estimated data commonly used in exposure assessment. Accordingly, predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) of 140 ng/L for a realistic worst case scenario and 2 to 52 ng/L based on water quality modeling were derived. Since concentrations of up to 140 ng/L were observed in surface water, the obtained PEC is in perfect agreement with measured concentrations. Hence, comparing the PEC with published predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC), chronic adverse effects in fish populations may occur. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The drinking water for more than 28 million people was screened for a diverse group of pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and other unregulated organic contaminants. Source water, finished drinking water, and distribution system (tap) water from 19 U.S. water utilities was analyzed for 51 compounds between 2006 and 2007. The 11 most frequently detected compounds were atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, estrone, gemfibrozil, meprobamate, naproxen, phenytoin, sulfamethoxazole, TCEP, and trimethoprim. Median concentrations of these compounds were less than 10 ng/L, except for sulfamethoxazole in source water (12 ng/L), TCEP in source water (120 ng/L), and atrazine in source, finished, and distribution system water (32, 49, and 49 ng/L). Atrazine was detected in source waters far removed from agricultural application where wastewater was the only known source of organic contaminants. The occurrence of compounds in finished drinking water was controlled by the type of chemical oxidation (ozone or chlorine) used at each plant. At one drinking water treatment plant, summed monthly concentrations of the detected analytes in source and finished water are reported. Atenolol, atrazine, DEET, estrone, meprobamate, and trimethoprim can serve as indicator compounds representing potential contamination from other pharmaceuticals and EDCs and can gauge the efficacy of treatment processes.

AB Some sources of organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) to streams, lakes, and estuaries, including wastewater-treatment-plant effluent, have been well documented, but other sources, particularly wet-weather discharges from combined-sewer-overflow (CSO) and urban runoff, may also be major sources of OWCs. Samples of wastewater-treatment-plant (WWTP) effluent, CSO effluent, urban streams, large rivers, a reference (undeveloped) stream, and Lake Champlain were collected from March to August 2006. The highest concentrations of many OWCs associated with wastewater were in WWTP-effluent samples, but high concentrations of some OWCs in samples of CSO effluent and storm runoff from urban streams subject to leaky sewer pipes or CSOs were also detected. Total concentrations and numbers of compounds detected differed substantially among sampling sites. The highest total OWC concentrations (10-100 mu g/l) were in samples of WWTP and CSO effluent. Total OWC concentrations in samples from urban streams ranged from 0.1 to 10 mu g/l, and urban stream-stormflow samples had higher concentrations than baseflow samples because of contributions of OWCs from CSOs and leaking sewer pipes. The relations between OWC concentrations in WWTP-effluent and those in CSO effluent and urban streams varied with the degree to which the compound is removed through normal wastewater treatment. Concentrations of compounds that are highly removed during normal wastewater treatment [including caffeine, Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, and cholesterol] were generally similar to or higher in CSO effluent than in WWTP effluent (and ranged from around 1 to over 10 mu g/l) because CSO effluent is untreated, and were higher in urban-stream stormflow samples than in baseflow samples as a result of CSO discharge and leakage from near-surface sources during storms. Concentrations of compounds that are poorly removed during treatment, by contrast, are higher in WWTP effluent than in CSO, due to dilution. Results indicate that CSO effluent and urban stormwaters can be a significant major source of OWCs entering large water bodies such as Burlington Bay.

AB Wastewater impact on drinking water sources was assessed using several approaches, including analysis of three pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)-primidone, carbamazepine, and caffeine-as indicators, and determination of precursor concentrations for the disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) using formation potential (FP) tests. Samples were collected in 2006 and 2007 in rivers impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges, at drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intakes upstream or downstream from these discharges, and from two WWTP effluents in two watersheds. The levels [10th percentile-maximum (median)] of primidone, carbamazepine, caffeine, and NDMAFP were 2-95 (7) ng/l, 2-207 (18) ng/l, 7-687 (78) ng/l, and 12-321 (35) ng/l, respectively. The highest concentrations of primidone, carbamazepine, and NDMA precursors were from one of the WWTP effluents, whereas the highest concentration of caffeine was detected in a river heavily impacted by treated wastewater discharges. The lowest concentrations of the three PPCPs were from a DWTP influent upstream of a metropolitan urban area with minimum wastewater impact. Temporal variations in PPCP and NDMAFP concentrations and streamflows in two selected watersheds were also observed. Furthermore, correlation analysis between caffeine or carbamazepine and primidone was evaluated. The results show that measurement of the two pharmaceuticals and NDMAFP tests can be used to evaluate wastewater impact in different watersheds, whereas caffeine results were more variable.

AB Life Cycle Assessment has been used to compare different scenarios involving wastewater reuse, with special focus on toxicity-related impact categories. The study is based on bench-scale experiments applying ozone and ozone in combination with hydrogen peroxide to a wastewater effluent from a Spanish sewage treatment plant. Two alternative characterisation. models have been used to account for toxicity of chemical substances, namely USES-LCA and EDIP97. Four alternative scenarios have been assessed: wastewater discharge plus desalination supply, wastewater reuse without tertiary treatment, wastewater reuse after applying a tertiary treatment consisting on ozonation, and wastewater reuse after applying ozonation in combination with hydrogen peroxide. The results highlight the importance of including wastewater pollutants in LCA of wastewater systems assessing toxicity, since the contribution of wastewater pollutants to the overall toxicity scores in this case study can be above 90%. Key pollutants here are not only heavy metals and other priority pollutants, but also non-regulated pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Wastewater reuse after applying any of the tertiary treatments considered appears as the best choice from an ecotoxicity perspective. As for human toxicity, differences between scenarios are smaller, and taking into account the experimental and modelling uncertainty, the benefits of tertiary treatment are not so clear. From a global warming potential perspective, tertiary treatments involve a potential 85% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when compared with desalination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals are regularly released into the environment; in particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics. Erythromycin, naproxen, furosemide and atenolol are reported to be stable for up to 1 year in the environment, which increases the risk for accumulation. In the present study we have measured the occurrence and concentration of phannaceuticals in river Viskan (Jossabron) downstream of a sewage treatment plant in Boras, Sweden. Pharmaceuticals and water samples were tested for potential human risk by evaluating inflammatory responses (NF-kappa B and AP-1) using human T24 bladder epithelial cells and Jurkat T-cells. NF-kappa B activity in T24 cells was significantly reduced by all NSAIDs analysed (diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprophen and dextropropoxyphene), but also by trimethoprim, using environmentally relevant concentrations. NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation was further analysed in response to water samples collected from different locations in Sweden. Dose-dependent down-regulation of AP-1 activity in Jurkat cells was observed at all locations. At two locations (Jossabron and Almenas) down-regulation of NF-kappa B was observed. In contrast, the NF-kappa B response was potentiated by exposure to water from both locations following activation of NF-kappa B by treatment with heat-killed Escherichia coli. To determine the involvement of pharmaceuticals in the responses, T24 cells were exposed to the pharmaceutical mixture, based on the determined levels at Jossabron. This resulted in reduction of the NF-kappa B response following exposure to the pharmaceutical mixture alone while no potentiation was observed when cells were co-exposed to heat killed E. coli and pharmaceuticals. The obtained results demonstrate that the identified pharmaceuticals affect the inflammatory responses and furthermore indicate the presence of unknown substance(s) with the ability to potentiate inflammatory responses.
