AB Many pharmaceuticals pass the unsaturated zone before reaching an aquifer. Therefore, laboratory sand column transport experiments were conducted to study the transport behavior of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone under unsaturated conditions. The test water was artificial sewage effluent to simulate the infiltration of reused wastewater. The test water was spiked with the pharmaceutically active compounds and the tracer LiCl. Afterwards it was passed through laboratory sand columns, one experiment for each pharmaceutical. The physical and chemical parameters were recorded and general ions measured. Pharmaceuticals were measured using solid phase extraction, derivatization, and detection with GC-MS.
   The column experiments indicate a significant elimination of ibuprofen (54%), propyphenazone (55%), and diclofenac (35%), whereas carbamazepine was not eliminated. Retardation factors varied between 1.84 for carbamazepine, 2.51 for propyphenazone, 3.00 for ibuprofen, and 4.80 for diclofenac. These results show that mobility and elimination of diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone is about in the same range as for experiments under saturated conditions whereas carbamazepine had a significantly lower sorption and elimination under unsaturated conditions.

AB Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world, being routinely applied to control weeds in both agricultural and urban settings. Microbial degradation of glyphosate produces aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA). The high polarity and water-solubility of glyphosate and AMPA has, until recently, made their analysis in water samples problematic. Thus, compared to other herbicides (e.g. atrazine) there are relatively few studies on the environmental occurrence of glyphosate and AMPA. In 2002, treated effluent samples were collected from 10 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to study the occurrence of glyphosate and AMPA. Stream samples were collected upstream and downstream of the 10 WWTPs. Two reference streams were also sampled. The results document the apparent contribution of WWTP effluent to stream concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, with roughly a two-fold increase in their frequencies of detection between stream samples collected upstream and those collected downstream of the WWTPs. Thus, urban use of glyphosate contributes to glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in streams in the United States. Overall, AMPA was detected much more frequently (67.5%) compared to glyphosate (17.5%). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing macrolide antibiotics was investigated. Specifically, it was determined whether a UASR could be used as pre-treatment system at an existing pharmaceutical production plant to reduce the antibiotics in the trade effluent. Accordingly, a UASR was developed with an active reactor volume of 11 L being divided into four 2.75 L stages. Each stage of the reactor was an up-flow sludge blanket reactor and had a 3-phase separator baffle to retain biomass. The reactor was fed with real pharmaceutical wastewater containing Tylosin and Avilamycin antibiotics and operated with step-wise increases in the reactor organic loading rate (OLR) from 0.43 to 3.73 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) d(-1), and then reduced to 1.86, over 279 days. The process performance of the reactor was characterised in terms of its COD removal, Tylosin reduction, pH, VIA production, methane yield and sludge washout. At a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 d and OLR of 1.86 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), COD reduction was 70-75%, suggesting the biomass had acclimated to the antibiotics. Furthermore, an average of 95% Tylosin reduction was achieved in the UASR, indicating that this antibiotic could be degraded efficiently in the anaerobic reactor system. in addition, the influence of elevated Tylosin concentrations on the UASR process performance was studied using additions of Tylosin phosphate concentrate. Results showed similar efficiency for COD removal when Tylosin was present at concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 mg L-1 (mean removal over this range was 93%), however, at Tylosin concentrations of 600 and 800mgL(-1) there was a slight decline in treatment efficiency at 85% and 75% removal, respectively.

AB Antibiotic molecules have been reported among the xenobiotics present at trace levels in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and aquatic environment. Lincomycin, one of the most used in clinical practices whose presence in the STP effluents has been often documented, is submitted to an extensive investigation to assess its persistence in the environment and toxicity towards different algal strains. The possibility to remove the lincomycin from water by means of ozonation is demonstrated and a reduction of toxicity of ozonated solutions on S. leopoliensis, with respect to untreated solutions containing this compound, is obtained even just for 1 h of treatment. Kinetic constants for the attack to lincomycin of ozone (from 1.53 X 10(5)M(-1) s(-1) at pH = 3.0 and 4.93 x 105 M-1 s-1 at pH = 6.7) and OH radicals (4.37 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH = 5.5 and 4.59 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH = 7.5) are also evaluated.

AB The reaction of the common pain reliever acetaminophen (paracetamol, 4-acetamidophenol) with hypochlorite was investigated over time under conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection. Initially, the reaction was studied in pure water at neutral pH (7.0), a range of reaction times (2-90 min), and a molar excess of hypochlorite (2-57 times) relative to the acetaminophen concentration. The reaction was monitored using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) with ultraviolet absorbance, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric detection. At 1 mu mol/L (150 ppb) and 10 mu mol/L (1.5 ppm) levels, acetaminophen readily reacted to form at least 11 discernible products, all of which exhibited greater LC retention than the parent. Two of the products were unequivocally identified as the toxic compounds 1,4-benzoquinone and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI, which is the toxicant associated with lethality in acetaminophen overdoses. With a hypochlorite dose of 57 mu mol/L (4 ppm as Cl-2) 88% of the acetaminophen (10,mu mol/L initial) was transformed in I h. The two quinoidal oxidation products 1,4-benzoquinone and NAPQI accounted for 25% and 1.5% of the initial acetaminophen concentration, respectively, at a I h reaction time. Other products that were identified included two ring chlorination products, chloro-4-acetamidophenol and dichloro-4-acetamidophenol, which combined were approximately 7% of the initial acetaminophen concentration at 1 h. The reaction was also studied in wastewater, where similar reactivity was noted. These results demonstrate that acetaminophen is likely to be transformed significantly during wastewater chlorination. The reactivity of the chlorine-transformation products was also studied with sulfite to simulate dechlorination, and 1,4-benzoquinone and NAPQI were completely reduced.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a worldwide-applied antibacterial drug, was recently found in surface waters and in secondary wastewater effluents, which may result in ecotoxical effects in the environment. Herein, removal of SMX by environmentally-friendly oxidant, potassium ferrate(VI) (K2FeO4), is sought by studying the kinetics of the reaction between Fe(VI) and SMX as a function of pH (6.93-9.50) and temperature (15-45 degrees C). The rate law for the oxidation of SMX by Fe(VI) is first-order with respect to each reactant. The observed second-order rate constant decreased non-linearly from 1.33 +/- 0.08 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) to 1.33 +/- 0.10 x 10(0) M-1 s(-1) with an increase of pH from 7.00 to 9.50. This is related to protonation of Fe(VI) (HFeO4- double left right arrow H+ + FeO42-; pK(a,HFeO4) = 7.23) and sulfamethoxazole (SH double left right arrow H+ + S-; pK(a,SH) = 5.7). The estimated rate constants were k(11) (HFeO4- + SH) = 3.0 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1), k(12) (HFeO4- + S-) = 1.7 x 10(2) M-1 (FeO42- + SH) = 1.2 x 10(0) M-1 s(-1). The energy of activation at pH 7.0 was found to be 1.86 +/- 0.04 kJ mol(-1). If excess potassium ferrate(VI) concentration (10 mu M) is used than the SMX in water, the half-life of the reaction using a rate constant obtained in our study would be approximately 2 min at pH 7. The reaction rates are pH dependent; thus, so are the half-lives of the reactions. The results suggest that K2FeO4 has the potential to serve as an oxidative treatment chemical for removing SMX in water. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals and contrast media have been detected in hospital effluents, sewage treatment plants, surface water, and ground water. Only little is known about their elimination during sewage treatment and effects of possible biotransformation products against bacteria. The modified Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT, OECD 302 B) and a test simulating biological sewage treatment (modified OECD 303 A test) were used to assess the biodegradability of the widely used ionic iodinated contrast agent diatrizoic acid (diatrizoate). Effects against sewage sludge bacteria were studied in the two test systems by monitoring the biomarkers quinones, polyamines, phospholipids and adenosine triphosphate. Diatrizoate was biotransformed into 2,4,6-triiodo-3,5-diamino-benzoic acid in the ZWT. 2,4,6-Triiodo-3,5-diamino-benzoic acid was stable under the test conditions of the ZWT. Diatrizoate was not eliminated in the OECD 303 A simulation test. It was not adsorbed by the sewage sludge. No effects of the test compound or its aerobic transformation products against the bacteria present in the sewage sludge were detected using phospholipids, quinones, polyamines, and adenosine triphosphate as biomarkers.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment as a result of human and veterinary use, posing relevant environmental concerns. The present paper reports the acute toxic effects of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the hypersalinc crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica. This study specially focused on oxidative stress parameters, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) total Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and (4) glutathione-S-traiisferases (GSTs). The effects of tested substances on lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), and soluble cholinesterases (ChE) were also investigated. Diazepam caused a significant inhibition of ChE (LOEC = 7.04 mg/l) and total GPx activities. SDS was responsible for a decrease in the activity of both ChE (LOEC = 8.46 mg/l) and GRed (LOEC = 4.08 mg/l). Both fibrates (clofibrate and clofibric acid) were responsible for significant decreases in Se-dependent GPx, with LOEC values of 176.34 and 3.09 mg/l, respectively. Clofibrate also caused a slight increase of TBARS content of A. parthenogenetica homogenates. These results indicate that the exposure to all the tested compounds induced alterations on the Cellular redox status in A. parthenogenetica. In addition, diazepam was shown to have the capability of interfering with A. parthenogenetica neurotransmission, through the inhibition of ChE. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For that purpose ISO 8192 activated sludge inhibition and Daphnia magna acute toxicity tests were conducted. BOD5 measurements that were carried out to preevaluate the biocompatibility of untreated, ozonated, and perozonated PPG effluent have shown that BOD5 alone was not a very correct or useful too] to predict the actual biodegradability of PPG effluent. No significant correlation existed between the BOD5 and the toxicity test results. Acute toxicity studies carried out with D. magna and synthetic Municipal sewage sludge have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of H2O2/O-3 oxidation. COD removal of pharmaceutical wastewater containing PPG effluent with acclimated sewage sludge decreased from 79% to 50% after H2O2/O-3 pretreatment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater-derived contaminants (WWDCs) occur in surface water due to inadequate wastewater treatment and subsequently challenge the capabilities of drinking water treatment. Fundamental chemical properties must be understood to reduce the occurrence of known WWDCs and to better anticipate future chemical contaminants of concern to water supplies. To date, examination of the fundamental properties of WWDCs in surface water appears to be completely lacking or inappropriately applied. In this research, the hydrophobicity-ionogenicity profiles of WWDCs reported to occur in surface water were investigated, concentrating primarily on pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), steroids, and hormones. Because most water treatment is conducted between pH 7 and 8 and because D-OW, the pH-dependent n-octanol-water distribution ratio embodies simultaneously the concepts of hydrophobicity and ionogenicity, D-OW at pH 7 - 8 is presented as an appropriate physicochemical parameter for understanding and regulating water treatment. Although the pH-dependent chemical character of hydrophobicity is not new science, this concept is insufficiently appreciated by scientists, engineers, and practitioners currently engaged in chemical assessment. The extremely hydrophilic character of many WWDCs at pH 7 - 8, indicated by D-OW (the combination of K-OW and pK(a)) not by K-OW of the neutral chemical, is proposed as an indicator of occurrence in surface water.

AB For all new pharmaceuticals, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed according to guidelines developed by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. An important factor of this procedure is the assessment of the predicted environmental concentration in the aquatic environment, which is significantly influenced by the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants. Established standardized methods for determining biodegradation under laboratory conditions apply to substance concentrations, which are much higher than those expected in reality. Against this background, the laboratory scale sewage treatment plant (LSSTP), as described by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline No. 303A, was modified to construct a lossless system, which allows laboratory testing at realistic concentrations. To verify the experimental setup, the antibiotics benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim were tested at low concentrations (mu g/L) using C-14-labeled compounds. The results show that approximately 25% of benzylpenicillin was mineralized, whereas ceftriaxone and trimethoprim were not mineralized at all. Due to the high total recoveries of added radioactivity (>= 95%) and the fact that the findings comply with available literature data, the lossless operation of the test system could be proved. Consequently, the modified LSSTP is a suitable tool to determine more realistic biodegradation data required for the exposure assessment within the scope of an ERA for pharmaceuticals.

AB A listing of "priority pharmaceuticals" for human use in Italy resulted in the selection of 26 pharmaceuticals, belonging to 11 therapeutic classes. They were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, their occurrence was assessed in six sewage treatment plants (STPs), and the loads and the removal rates (RR) were studied. Total loads ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 g/day/1000 inhabitants in influents and 1.0 and 3.0 g/day/1000 inhabitants in effluents. Total RR in STPs were mostly lower than 40%. Pharmaceuticals could be divided into three groups according to their behavior in STPs: one group with RR higher in summer than in winter, one group with RR similar in summer and winter, and a last group not removed. Last, we studied the distribution and fate of residual pharmaceuticals in the surface waters receiving the effluents of the UPS and identified degradation and sorption as the major factors affecting attenuation. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole (antibiotics), atenolol (cardiovascular drug), ibuprofen (antiinflammatory), furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide (diuretics), ranitidine (gastrointestinal drug), and bezafibrate (lipid regulator) were the most abundant residual drugs, thus those of environmental concern.

AB The overall ecotoxicological effect of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) detected in the effluents of Korean wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to Daphnia magna was investigated using biological and chemical analyses. The bioassay results showed median lethal concentrations and no -observed -effect concentrations ranging from a few to tens of ppm levels for nine PhACs in 48-h acute and 21-d chronic tests. The mixture effects of pharmaceuticals also were examined by other acute and chronic tests, which showed no significant toxicity despite a slightly increased combined effect of approximately twofold. The residual concentrations of nine PhACs were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 89 mu g/L in the influents and from 10 ng/L to 11 mu g/L in the effluents from four metropolitan cities in South Korea between January and November of 2004. Through repeated investigations of the influents and the effluents from different WWTPs, relatively higher removal efficiencies (23.9-91.3%) compared with those of previous surveys performed in other countries were observed for most pharmaceuticals, with the exception of acetaminophen (8.7%). The present Study showed no significant risk effects of the effluents from WWTPs containing pharmaceuticals (i.e., hazard quotient < 1), even at the 95th percentile contamination range, although a risk assessment factor of 1,000 was applied. Therefore, it can be concluded that the potential risk of pharmaceuticals should be monitored carefully with more bioassay data, because many uncertainties still exist in the determination and toxicity of metabolites in water environments. No significant risk was observed, however, from the selected PhACs in the effluents from WWTPs discharged into surface waters.

AB Many industries use dyes and pigments to colour their products. The largest customers of these dyes are textile, tannery, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food processing units and they are in turn the most serious polluters of our environment. The proper treatment of aqueous wastes is fundamental for the preservation of environmental equilibria and the quality of aquatic systems. Electrochemical techniques and adsorption methods offer good potential to remove colour from wastewater. In the present work both the electrochemical and adsorption methods were applied for colour removal and comparative results are presented. Effectiveness of using low cost adsorbent wheat husk was explored.

AB Anaerobic and aerobic treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated in this study. A batch test was performed to study the biodegradability of the wastewater, and the result indicated that a combination anaerobic-aerobic treatment system was effective in removing organic matter from the high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater. Based on the batch test, a pilot-scale system composed of an anaerobic baffled reactor followed by a biofilm airlift suspension reactor was designed. At a stable operational period, effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the anaerobic baffled reactor ranged from 1,432 to 2,397 mg/L at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.25 day, and 979 to 1,749 mg/L at an HRT of 2.5 day, respectively, when influent COD ranged from 9,736 to 19,862 mg/L. As a result, effluent COD of the biofilm airlift suspension reactor varied between 256 and 355 mg/L at HRTs of from 5.0 to 12.5 h. The antibiotics ampicillin and aureomycin, with influent concentrations of 3.2 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively, could be partially degraded in the anaerobic baffled reactor: ampicillin and aureomycin removal efficiencies were 16.4 and 25.9% with an HRT of 1.25 day, and 42.1 and 31.3% with HRT of 2.5 day, respectively. Although effective in COD removal, the biofilm airlift suspension reactor did not display significant antibiotic removal, and the removal efficiencies of the two antibiotics were less than 10%.

AB Giving public water authorities another tool to monitor and measure levels of human waste contamination of waters simply and rapidly would enhance public protection. Most of the methods used today detect such contamination by quantifying microbes occurring in feces in high enough densities that they can be measured easily. However, most of these microbes, for example E. coli, do not serve as specific markers for any one host species and many can have origins other than feces. As an alternative, chemicals shed in feces and urine might be used to detect human waste contamination of environmental waters. One potential chemical marker of human waste is the compound urobilin. Urobilin is one of the final by- products of hemoglobin breakdown. Urobilin is excreted in both the urine and feces from many mammals, particularly humans. Source waters from 21 sites in New England, Nevada, and Michigan were extracted using hydrophilic - lipophilic balance ( HLB) cartridges and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray mass spectrometry ( HPLC - ES- MS). As a marker of human waste, urobilin was detected in many of the source waters at concentrations ranging from not detectable to 300 ng L (-1). Besides urobilin, azithromycin, an antibiotic widely prescribed for human use only in the US, was also detected in many of these waters, with concentrations ranging from not detectable to 77 ng L (-1). This methodology, using both urobilin and azithromycin ( or any other human- use pharmaceutical) could be used to give public water authorities a definitive method for tracing the sources of human waste contamination. The analysis and detection of urobilin in surface waters by HPLC - ES- MS has not been previously reported in the peer- reviewed literature.

AB The advanced treatment using integrated Fenton's reaction and coagulation process was investigated in this study. Before the advancement, the pharmaceutical wastewater containing lincomycin hydrochloride was pretreated by UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge bed) and a SBR (sequencing batch reactor) process. The residual recalcitrant compounds, measured by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), mainly consisted of alcohols, phenols, and nitrogenous and sulfur compounds. The experimental results indicated that when the Fenton's reaction was conducted at pH=3.0, H2O2/CODCr = 0.27, H2O2/Fe2+ = 3:1 and 30 min of reaction time, and the coagulation process operated at a sulfate aluminum concentration of 800 mg/L and pH value of 5.0, the color and COD in the wastewater decreased by 94% and 73%, respectively; with a finale COD concentration of 267 mg/L and color level of 40 units, meeting the secondary standard of GB8978-1996 for industrial wastewater.

AB According to European Union Council directive 2001/83, an application for the marketing authorization of a medicinal product shall be accompanied by an environmental risk assessment, including an exposure assessment. Computerized exposure models constitute an important tool in predicting environmental exposure to substances yet to be introduced on the market. This paper reports the process of identifying appropriate exposure models for estimating PECs (Predicted Environmental Concentrations) for pharmaceuticals and veterinary products, focusing on emissions to Swedish aquatic and terrestrial environments via water and sludge from sewage treatment plants. From a large number of information sources, a set of 181 potentially relevant exposure models was identified. A process of scrutinizing and testing these models resulted in a final selection of two models, namely SimpleTreat 3.1 that is used to estimate distribution and elimination of chemicals in sewage treatment plants (resulting in a PEC), and VetPec, suited for veterinary products, that estimates PEC in soil (including pore water), groundwater, and surface water. It is concluded that there is still potential for further development of exposure model(s) specifically designed for pharmaceutical emissions to the Nordic environment and climate. Furthermore, increased regulatory data requirements would facilitate the use of existing models, and improve the quality of the output data from these models.

While there is limited removal of these compounds within wastewater treatment plants, wetland treatment might prove to be an effective means to reduce the discharge of the compounds into the environment. Wetlands can promote removal of these pharmaceutical compounds through a number of mechanisms including photolysis, plant uptake, microbial degradation, and sorption to the soil. We review relevant laboratory research on these various mechanisms and provide data on the few studies that have examined wetland removal. There is a need to document the degree to which various pharmaceutical compounds are removed in full-scale treatment wetlands, as there is a paucity of data on overall pharmaceutical removal rates.

AB Due to a growing interest in the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the aquatic environment and their potential impacts on humans and the environment, a collaborative study was conducted on these emerging contaminants in the effluents from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the drinking water supply system of Calgary, Alberta. A number of PhACs and EDCs were detected in the WWTP effluents, at concentrations ranging from ng/L to low mu g/L. Although these compounds were generally removed from WWTP effluents during wastewater treatment, some compounds, such as carbamazepine were more persistent. Some target PhACs and EDCs were detected at low ng/L levels in the surface and potable water in this study. Currently, there is no evidence that trace amounts of PhACs and EDCs in Calgary's waterways can have a health impact on humans, but they may pose adverse chronic effects on aquatic life.

AB Biological degradation in packed bed anaerobic mesophilic reactors with five different support materials was studied for the treatment of chemical-pharmaceutical wastewater with high COD (23-31 g/L), which contains toxic organic compounds. Experimental up-flow bio-filters were operated at different organic loads for a two-year period. Removals of 80-98% were obtained in the reactors with sand, anthracite and black tezontle, but at relatively low organic loads, less than 3.6 kg m(-3) d(-1). The reactor with granular activated carbon (GAC) had a better performance; efficiencies higher than 95% were obtained at loads up to 17kg m(-3) d(-1) and higher than 80% with loads up to 26 kg m(-3) d(-1). Second in performance was the reactor with red tezontle which allows COD removals higher than 80% with loads up to 6 kg m(-3) d(-1). The use of GAC as support material allows greater biodegradation rates than the rest of the materials and it makes the process more resistant to organic load increases, inhibition effects and toxicity. Methanogenic activity was inhibited at loads higher than 21.9 kg m(-3) d(-1) in the GAC-reactor and at loads higher than 3.6 kg m(-3) d(-1) in the rest of the reactors. At loads lower than the previously mentioned, high methane production yield was obtained, 0.32-0.35 m(3)CH(4)/kg CODremoved.

AB Most commercially available auto-sampling devices do not support a continuous flow-proportional sampling mode, which would conceptually be the best for collecting representative composite samples. Instead different discrete sampling modes are available. Household chemicals can show considerable random short-term variations. With the anticorrosive benzotriazole, relating to a middle-frequent household activity, we show that, besides an accurate flow meter, mainly three factors are decisive for the representativeness of a substance's average load: the substance's load pattern, the sampling frequency and the length of the composite sample. When the sampling intervals are 10 minutes or longer, errors in the order of +/- 40% (standard deviation) or more have to be accepted, if the substance of interest is contained in a low number of wastewater pulses (i.e. the level of household activity). This particularly holds true for specific pharmaceuticals e.g. carbamazepine. Ammonium would be less critical, because it relates to a larger number of sources in the same catchment.

AB In wastewater treatment, micro- and ultra-filtration membranes are used for the separation of the activated sludge (biomass) from the treated water. This offers the advantages of a complete removal of solids and bacteria, as well as most of the viruses, namely those attached to the suspended solids. Compared to the conventional activated sludge process (CAS) this technology allows a much higher biomass concentration (MLSS) whereby the reactor volume and the footprint decreases. With increasing MLSS, the viscosity of the sludge increases, which leads to reduced oxygen transfer rates. Depending on the type of membrane and membrane module, the pre-treatment has to be more sophisticated to prevent clogging and sludging of the modules.
   Due to fouling and scaling, the flux through the membranes will decrease with time. The decrease depends on the water quality as well as on the measurements taken to minimize fouling. Mainly, three strategies are available: lowering the flux, increasing the "crossflow" and cleaning of the membranes. Different strategies including backwash and chemical cleaning "in situ", "on air" and "ex situ" can be applied. It has been proven more effective to apply preventive regular cleaning.
   Besides the energy demand for oxygen supply - which is typically in the range of 0.3 kWh/m(3) for municipal wastewater - the energy for fouling prevention is substantial. Immersed membranes need approximately 0.4 to 1 kWh/m(3) -:or the coarse bubble aeration, whereas tubular modules require 1 to 4 kWh/m3 pump energy.
   For proper design of industrial wastewater treatment, the verification of applicability and the development of adequate cleaning strategies, it is a precondition to run pilot tests for a sufficient period of time with the wastewater to be treated. More than 100 industrial wastewater treatment membrane bioreactors (MBR) are in operation in Europe. Data of three case studies for a sewage sludge dewatering plant in UK (12,000 m(3)/d), a plant for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater in Germany (3,600 m(3)/d), as well for revamping of an chemical WWTP > 2,000 m(3)/d in Italy, are given.
   MBRs will be used in future wherever high quality effluent is required, because of a sensitive receiving water body or due to the fact of water reuse as process water. MBRs are a perfect pre-treatment in industrial applications when further treatment with nanofiltration or reverse osmosis is considered.
   The technique is advanced and can be applied both in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. Higher operational costs must be balanced by superior effluent quality.

AB Many novel treatment technologies, usually representing a pre-treatment prior to the biological degradation process, have been developed in order to improve the recycling and reuse of sewage sludge. Among all the methods available, a chemical (alkaline) and a thermal treatment have been considered in this study. The behaviour of 13 substances belonging to different therapeutic classes (musks, tranquillisers, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, X-ray contrast media and estrogens) has been studied during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge combined with these pre-treatments (advanced operation) in comparison with the conventional process. Two parameters have been analysed; the temperature (mesophilic and thermophilic conditions) and the sludge retention time. While organic matter solubilization was higher with the alkaline process (55-80%), no difference between both pre-treatments was observed concerning volatile solids solubilization (up to 20%). The removal efficiencies of solids and organic matter during anaerobic digestion ranged from 40-70% and 45-75%, respectively. The higher removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and personal. care products were achieved for the antibiotics, Naproxen and the natural estrogens (> 80%). For the other compounds, the values were in the range 20-70%, except for Carbamazepine, which was not removed at any condition tested.

AB Residual pharmaceutical products in sewage and other water environments have recently become a serious social problem in advanced countries. Among these pharmaceutical products, antibiotics have attracted special attention due to their serious impact on the ecosystem and connections to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Our research intended to develop a new method to analyse the three antibiotics estimated to be released out of the body in large amounts in Japan; levofloxacin (LVFX), clarithromycin (CAM) and azithromycin (AZM), and survey the state of pollution in the sewerage. The concentrations of the water-phase antibiotics LVFX, CAM and AZM were measured in each process of activated sludge process in six wastewater treatment plants. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used to analyse solutions of the antibiotics after pretreatment with a solid phase extraction. The limits of quantification and the average recoveries for these antibiotics in the influent were 1.2 to 29 ng/L and 46 to 93%, respectively. In the influent, LVFX, CAM and AZM were detected at concentrations of 552, 647 and 260 ng/L, respectively, while their removal efficiencies were 42, 43 and 49%, respectively. Although the CAM and AZM concentrations decreased as the treatment progressed, it was shown that the LVFX concentration increased in activated sludge reactors in some cases. Despite differences in octanol-water partition coefficients among LVFX, CAM and AZM, their removal efficiency showed no major difference. This indicates that this removal phenomenon cannot be explained by simple adsorption by the activated sludge.

AB Water reclamation and reuse is playing an increasingly important role in sustainable water resources management. But is water reuse sustainable? To be sustainable, a water reuse project must serve its long-term functional roles without shifting environmental burdens to future generations or producing adverse socio-economic effects. In this paper, we review sustainability assessment methods to aid decision makers in comparing alternative systems, improving environmental performance, and tracking progress toward sustainability. We discuss concerns regarding long-term environmental effects of water reuse systems, including energy demands, impacts on irrigated land, and accumulation and health effects of trace contaminants. We also suggest socio-economic considerations that are key to maintaining long-term benefits of water reuse systems.

AB Pharmaceuticals are produced and used in increasingly large Volumes every year. With this growth comes concern about the fate and effects of these compounds in the environment. The discovery of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has stimulated research in the last decade. A wide range of pharmaceuticals has been found in fresh and marine waters, and it has recently been shown that even in small quantities, some of these compounds have the potential to cause harm to aquatic life. The primary pathway into the environment is the use and disposal of medicines; although much of the research in the area currently focuses on the removal of pharmaceuticals during sewage treatment processes, disposal via household waste might be a significant pathway requiring further research. To investigate the household disposal of unused and expired pharmaceuticals as a source of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment, we carried out a survey and interviewed members of 400 households, predominantly from southeastern England. We used the information on when and how they disposed of unfinished pharmaceuticals to construct a conceptual model to assess the pathways of human pharmaceuticals into the environment. The model demonstrated that disposal of unused pharmaceuticals, either by household waste or via the sink or toilet, may be a prominent route that requires greater attention.

AB An Advanced Water Recycling Demonstration Plant (AWRDP) was commissioned and constructed by the Queensland State Government in Australia. The AWRDP was used to study the effectiveness of a variety of treatment processes in the upgrading of municipal wastewater for water recycling applications. The AWRDP consists of eight modules, each housing an individual specific treatment process. These processes are flocculation, dissolved air flotation, dual media filtration, ozonation, biological activated carbon adsorption, microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet disinfection. The individual performances of the treatment processes were determined, as well as their interdependence in series. A range of chemical water quality parameters were investigated. The study provides a broad process comparison on the basis of an important catalogue of these key parameters. This will be valuable in the selection and optimization of treatment processes trains in full-scale water recycling applications. (c) 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB The discharge of relatively small volumes of untreated sewage is a source of wastewater-derived contaminants in surface waters that is often ignored because it is difficult to discriminate from wastewater effluent. To identify raw sewage discharges, we analyzed the two enantiomers of the popular chiral pharmaceutical, propranolol, after derivitization to convert the enantiomers to diastereomers. The enantiomeric fraction (the ratio of the concentration of one of its isomers to the total concentration) of propranolol in the influent of five wastewater treatment plants was 0.50 +/- 0.02, while after secondary treatment it was 0.42 or less. In a laboratory study designed to simulate an activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment system, the enantiomeric fraction of propranolol decreased from 0.5 to 0.43 as the compound underwent biotransformation. In a similar system designed to simulate an effluent-dominanted surface water, the enantiomeric fraction of propranolol remained constant as it underwent biotransformation. Analysis of samples from surface waters with known or suspected discharges of untreated sewage contained propranolol with an enantiomeric fraction of approximately 0.50 whereas surface waters with large discharges of wastewater effluent contained propranolol with enantiomeric fractions similar to those observed in wastewater effluent. Measurement of enantiomers of propranolol may be useful in detecting and documenting contaminants related to leaking sewers and combined sewer overflows.

AB Aquatic systems, particularly in rural areas, may be contaminated by antimicrobials from wastewater treatment effluent or diffuse pollution. Recent investigations of pharmaceutical contaminants in surface waters in the United States and Europe revealed the presence of antimicrobials such as synthetic and naturally derived antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. The fate of these antimicrobials in the aquatic environment, along with the rising trend of antibacterial resistance in aquatic and soil microorganisms, is poorly understood. This research was designed to investigate the removal of antimicrobials in multistage filtration, provide information for rural communities affected by antimicrobial surface water pollution, identify topics for future research, and aid environmental and human health risk assessments. The study examined schmutzdecke sorption behavior and removal efficiencies in a pilot roughing and slow sand filter fed 0.2 mg/L of five compounds from four classes of antimicrobials. Aqueous antimicrobial concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.

AB The ability of ferrate (Fe(Vl)) to oxidize phenolic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and phenols during water treatment was examined by determining the apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) for the reaction of Fe(VI) with selected environmentally relevant phenolic EDCs(17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, beta-estradiol, and bisphenol A) and 10 substituted phenols at pH values ranging from 6 to 11. The three selected groups of EDCs showed appreciable reactivity with Fe(VI) (k(app) at pH 7 ranged from 6.4 x 10(2) to 7.7 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)). The kapp for the substituted phenols studied at pH 7 ranged from 6.6 to 3.6 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), indicating that many other potential phenolic ENS can be oxidized by Fe(VI) during water treatment. The Hammett-type correlations were determined for the reaction between HFeO4- and the undissociated (log(k) = 2.24-2.27 sigma(+)) and dissociated phenol (log(k) = 4.33-3.60 sigma(+)). A comparison of the Hammett correlation obtained for the reaction between HFeO4- and dissociated phenol with those obtained from other drinking water oxidants revealed that HFeO4- is a relatively mild oxidant of phenolic compounds. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) for the oxidative removal of phenolic EDCs was also confirmed in both natural water and wastewater.

AB Four water samples collected using standard depth and width water-column sampling methodology were compared to an innovative passive, in situ, sampler (the polar organic chemical integrative sampler or POCIS) for the detection of 96 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) in a stream that receives agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewaters. Thirty-two OWCs were identified in POCIS extracts whereas 9 24 were identified in individual water-column samples demonstrating the utility of POCIS for identifying contaminants whose occurrence are transient or whose concentrations are below routine analytical detection limits. Overall, 10 OWCs were identified exclusively in the POCIS extracts and only six solely identified in the water-column samples, however, repetitive water samples taken using the standard method during the POCIS deployment period required multiple trips to the sampling site and an increased number of samples to store, process, and analyze. Due to the greater number of OWCs detected in the POCIS extracts as compared to individual water-column samples, the ease of performing a single deployment as compared to collecting and processing multiple water samples, the greater mass of chemical residues sequestered, and the ability to detect chemicals which dissipate quickly, the passive sampling technique offers an efficient and effective alternative for detecting OWCs in our waterways for wastewater contaminants.

AB The occurrence of five pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and bezafibrate) in the influent and effluent water of a sewage treatment plant (STP) in the recipient river water and in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) located downstream from the STP was followed during three seasons: winter, spring, and summer. In the STP, the elimination of the pharmaceuticals decreased significantly (an average of 25% compared to spring and summer) in wintertime leading to increased concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluent water. The total concentration of all the studied pharmaceuticals in the effluent water was 3-5 times higher in wintertime (about 2500 ng L-1) than during the other seasons (about 500-900 ng L-1). Accordingly, the highest concentrations (up to 129 ng L-1) in the recipient river were measured in the wintertime. Pharmaceuticals were carried longer distances downstream from the STP when the river was covered by ice and snow. During a drastic increase in water flow rate (i.e., during snowmelting), a fast transportation of the pharmaceuticals was observed. The DWTP located downstream from the STP produced water that contained about 8 ng L-1 of ibuprofen and ketoprofen in the winter sample, whereas in spring and summer the studied pharmaceuticals could not be detected in the drinking water. The results show that cold seasons in boreal areas can severely increase the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals and the risk for contamination of drinking water.

AB In recent years, the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has been of growing interest. These new contaminants are important because many of them are not degraded under the typical biological treatments applied in the wastewater treatment plants and represent a continuous input into the environment. Thus, compounds such as diclofenac are resent in surface waters in all Europe and a crucial need for more enhanced technologies that can reduce its presence in the environment has become evident. In this sense, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) represent a good choice for the treatment of hazardous nonbiodegradable pollutants. This work deals with the solar photodegradation of diclofenac, an antiinflammatory drug, in aqueous solutions by photo-Fenton reaction. A pilot-scale facility using a compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor was used for this study. Results obtained show rapid and complete oxidation of diclofenac after 60 min, and total mineralization (disappearance of dissolved organic carbon, DOC) after 100 min of exposure to sunlight. Although diclofenac precipitates during the process at low pH, its degradation takes place in the homogeneous phase governed by a precipitation-redissolution-degradation process. Establishment of the reaction pathway was made possible by a thorough analysis of the reaction mixture identifying the main intermediate products generated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) were used to identify 18 intermediates, in two tentative degradation routes. The main one was based on the initial hydroxylation of the phenylacetic acid moiety in the C-4 position and subsequent formation of a quinone imine derivative that was the starting point for further multistep degradation involving hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and oxidation reactions. An alternative route was based on the transient preservation of the biphenyl amino moiety that underwent a similar oxidative process of C-N bond cleavage. The proposed degradation route differs from those previously reported involving alternative degradation processes (ozonization, UV/H2O2, or photolysis), indicating that diclofenac degradation follows different pathways, depending on the treatment applied.

AB The exposure and uptake of environmental estrogenic compounds have been reported in previous studies of demersal flatfish species in the central Southern California Bight (SCB), USA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic or feminizing activity of marine sediments from the SCB by using in vivo vitellogenin (VTG) assays in male or juvenile fish. In 2003, sediments were collected near wastewater outfalls serving the counties of Los Angeles (LACSD) and Orange (OCSD), and the city of San Diego (SD), California, USA. Cultured male California halibut (CH; Paralichthys californicus) were either directly exposed to sediments for 7 d or treated with two intraperitoneal injections of sediment extract over 7 d. The 17 beta-estradiol (E2) equivalent values ranged from 1 to 90 mu g/kg with LACSD > SD > OCSD. Measurable concentrations of E2 were observed in all sediment extracts and ranged from 0.16 to 0.45 ng/g. Estrone (El) was only observed in sediments near the LACSD outfall (0.6 ng/g). Alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates were observed in all sediment samples, but were highest near the OCSD outfall, where concentrations of nonylphenol were 3,200 ng/g. Fractionation studies of the LACSD sediment extract collected in 2004 failed to demonstrate relationships between VTG expression and 62 analytes, including E2, which was observed in the whole extract (2.9 ng/g). Oxybenzone (1.6 ng/g) was identified in bioactive fractions as well as unknown compounds of relatively high polarity. These results indicate that estrogen receptor-based assays may underestimate environmental estrogenic activity and estrogenic compounds other than classic natural and xenoestrogens may contribute to estrogenic activity of sediments from the SCB.

AB Low-temperature or psychrophilic (<20 degrees C) anaerobic digestion (PAD) has recently been demonstrated as a cost-effective option for the treatment of a range of wastewater categories. The aim of this work was 2-fold: (1) to screen three anaerobic sludges, obtained from full-scale reactors, with respect to suitability for PAD of pharmaceutical-like, solvent-contaminated wastewater; (2) to assess the feasibility of PAD of this wastewater category. Toxicity thresholds of key trophic groups within three candidate biomass samples were assessed against solvents prevalent in pharmaceutical wastewaters (propanol, methanol and acetone). Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) assays indicated that the metabolic optimum of each candidate biomass was within the mesophilic range. One biomass sample exhibited higher SMA assays than the other candidate samples and was also the sample least methanogenically inhibited by the addition of solvents to batch cultures. This sludge was selected as the biomass of choice for laboratory-scale trials. Two identical expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-based anaerobic reactors were used for the treatment of solvent-contaminated wastewater at 15 degrees C, and at applied organic loading rates (OLRs) of 5-20 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3)d(-1). COD removal efficiencies of 60-70% were achieved during the 450 day trial. In addition, SMA assays carried out at the conclusion of the trial indicated the development of a putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two physico-chemical processes, coagulation-flocculation and flotation, have been assessed for enhancing the removal of some selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) present in sewage, Eight compounds, representative of three main groups of PPCPs according to their physico-chemical properties, have been selected: lipophilic compounds (the synthetic musks Galaxolide and Tonalide), neutral compounds (the tranquillizer Diazepam and the antiepileptic Carbamazepine) and acidic compounds (the anti-inflammatories Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Diclofenae). During the coagulation-flocculation assays, the main parameters considered were the selection of the additives, their doses and the temperature of operation (12 or 25 degrees C), Musks which are highly lipophilic and Diclofenae-with significant sorption affinity-were removed around 50 70%. at both temperatures independently of the dose and type of coagulant used, However, the rest or the compounds, which are more hydrophilic, were affected to a lesser degree (with maximum reductions below 25%). The exceptions to this behavior were Carbamazepine and Ibuprofen, which were not removed under any condition tested. During the flotation assays. the parameters studied were the initial content of fat in wastewaters and temperature. Again, musks were removed to a greater degree (35-60%), followed by Diazepam (40-50%) and Diclofenae (20 45%) and, to a lesser extent, Carbamazepine (20-35%), Ibuprofen (10-25%) and Naproxen (10-30%). The best results were always, obtained at 25 degrees C, although in some cases the operation at 12 degrees C gave similar results, The removal Of musks and neutral compounds was higher in wastewaters with a high fat content (around 150 mgl(-1)).

AB Eight pharmaceuticals, two polycyclic musk fragrances and nine endocrine disrupting chemicals were analysed in several waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). A membrane bioreactor in pilot scale was operated at different solid retention times (SRTs) and the results obtained are compared to conventional activated sludge plants (CASP) operated at different SRTs. The SRT is an important design parameter and its impact on achievable treatment efficiencies was evaluated. Different behaviours were observed for the different investigated compounds. Some compounds as the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were not removed in any of the sampled treatment facilities and effluent concentrations in the range of influent concentrations were measured. Other compounds as bisphenol-A. the analgesic ibuprofen or the lipid regulator bezafibrate were nearly completely removed (removal rates >90%). The operation of WWTPs with SRTs suitable for nitrogen removal (SRT > 10 days at 10 degrees C) also increases the removal potential regarding selected micropollutants. No differences in treatment efficiencies were detected between the two treatment techniques. As in conventional WWTP also the removal potential of MBRs depends on the SRT. Ultrafiltration membranes do not allow any additional detention of the investigated substances due to size exclusion. However, MBRs achieve a high SRT within a compact reactor. Nonylphenolpolyehtoxylates were removed in higher extend in very low-loaded conventional WWTPs, due to variations of redox conditions, necessary for the degradation of those compounds.

AB Kinetics and product formation of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated in lab-scale experiments during reactions with ozone and OH radicals. Ozone reacts rapidly with the double bond in CBZ, yielding several ozonation products containing quinazoline-based functional groups. The structures for three new oxidation products were elucidated using a combination of mass spectrometric and NMR techniques. The three products were determined to be 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro(1H, 3M-quinazoline-2-one (130,M), 1-(2-benzaldehyde)(1 (1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (130), and 1-(2-benzoic acid)(1H, 3M-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BaQD). Additional kinetic studies of the ozonation products showed very slow subsequent oxidation kinetics with ozone (second-order rate constants, k(O3) = similar to 7 M(-1) s(-1) and similar to 1 M-1 s-1 at pH 6 for BQM and BOO, respectively). Rate constants for reactions with OH radicals, k(OH), were determined as similar to 7 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for BQM and similar to 5 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for BQD. Thus, mainly reactions with OH radicals lead to their further oxidation. A kinetic model including ozone and OH radical reactions allows a prediction of the time-dependent product distribution during ozonation of natural waters. In Rhine River water, CBZ spiked at 500 ng/L was completely oxidized by ozone with applied doses >= 0.3 mg/L. To confirm that the two major ozonation products BQM and BQD are produced as a result of the ozonation of a CBZ-containing natural water, Lake Zurich water samples were spiked with CBZ (1 mu M, 236 mu g/L). The oxidation products were identified via LC-UV. Concentrations of 0.48 and 0.15 mu M for BQM and BQD, respectively, were measured for an ozone dose of 1.9 mg/L. BQM and BQD were also identified in ozonated water from a German waterworks containing CBZ in its raw water with 0.07-0.20 mu g/L. Currently, there are no data available on the biological effects of the formed oxidation products.

AB During 2003/2004, water samples were collected upstream and downstream of two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outlets in order to determine the contribution of urban centres to concentration of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, lipid regulators and carbamazepine) and pesticides into a Mediterranean river basin (Arc river, Aix en Provence, France). Pharmaceutical loads were compared to pesticide ones. They could be nearly regarded as important as pesticide ones at least at one sampling site. The observed pollution patterns differed from pesticides to pharmaceuticals. Pesticide pollution occurred through a high pollution peak in spring while pharmaceuticals were continuously infused into the river via WWTP effluents. Carbamazepine and bezafibrate were detected in almost all samples at concentration levels ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. The major pharmaceutical source could be ascribed to WWTP effluents and pharmaceutical concentrations increased during low flow rate conditions (summer), when municipal wastewater effluents accounted for the majority of the river water flow. Treated wastewaters contributed to a lesser extent to pesticide river water pollution. In an urbanized Mediterranean river basin, a deep understanding of water pollution by organic waste contaminants is required in order to set up an efficient programme of pollution reduction measures.

AB The effects of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) were studied in three freshwater invertebrate species representing different taxonomic groups, life histories, and habitats in aquatic ecosystems. The oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was exposed by way of CBZ-spiked sediments at nominal concentrations between 0.625 and 10 mg/kg dry weight (dw) for 28 days. At the end of the test, reproduction and biomass were monitored as end points. The nonbiting midge Chironomus riparius was exposed to CBZ in a series of tests at nominal CBZ concentrations in sediment ranging from 0.16 to 100 mg/kg dw at 20 degrees C and 23 degrees C. Emergence and gender ratio were monitored at the end of the test. The freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum as the third test species was used in a chronic reproduction test for 28 days at aqueous CBZ concentrations from 0.4 to 250 mg/L. Whereas for the oligochaete and the snail no effects were observed, C. riparius exhibited a significant and concentration-dependent decrease of emergence in all test series. No observed effect concentrations and 10% effect concentrations were in the range of 33 to 140 and 70 to 210 mu g/kg dw, respectively, based on measured CBZ concentrations in sediments. These low values indicate that CBZ may pose a potential threat for the survival of C. riparius and probably also for other aquatic insect populations in the field.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been globally detected in surface waters, and the ecological impacts of these biologically-active, ubiquitous chemicals are largely unknown. To evaluate the aquatic toxicity of individual pharmaceuticals and mixtures, we performed single species laboratory toxicity tests with Daphnia magna, a common freshwater zooplankton. We conducted acute (6-day) and chronic (30-day) exposure pharmaceutical bioassays and evaluated survivorship and morphology of adults and neonates, adult length, resting egg production, brood size (fecundity), and the proportion of male broods produced (sex ratio). In general, exposure to a single pharmaceutical in the 1-100 mu g/l range yielded no apparent effects on the normal life processes of Daphnia. However, chronic fluoxetine exposure (36 mu g/l) significantly increased Daphnia fecundity, and acute clofibric acid exposure (10 mu g/l) significantly increased sex ratio. A mixture of fluoxetine (36 mu g/l) and clofibric acid (100 mu g/l) caused significant mortality; the same fluoxetine concentration mixed with 10 mu g/l clofibric acid resulted in significant deformities, including malformed carapaces and swimming setae. Mixtures of three to five antibiotics (total antibiotic concentration 30-500 mu g/l) elicited changes in Daphnia sex ratio. We conclude: (1) individual and mixtures of pharmaceuticals affect normal development and reproduction of Daphnia magna, (2) aquatic toxicity of pharmaceutical mixtures can be unpredictable and complex compared to individual pharmaceutical effects, and (3) timing and duration of pharmaceutical exposure influence aquatic toxicity.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are discharged into the environment from domestic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we determined the distribution of the anti-epileptic drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), and its major metabolites and caffeine in both aqueous and solid phases through different treatment processes of a WWTP. A method was developed to extract samples of biosolids using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), coupled with cleanup of extracts using solid-phase extraction. Samples of biosolids and wastewater were analyzed for caffeine and CBZ and five of its metabolites, 10,-11-dihydro-10,11-epoxycarbamazepine (CBZ-EP), 11-dihydro-10, 11-epoxycarbamazepine (CBZ-DiOH), 2-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ-2OH), 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ3OH), and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ-100H). The analytes were quantified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The recoveries of the analytes were 82.1-91.3% from raw biosolids and 80.1-92.4% from treated biosolids, and the limits of detection were 0.06-0.50 and 0.06-0.40 mu g/kg on a wet weight basis for raw and treated biosolids, respectively. The behavior of carbamazepine and its metabolites, together with caffeine as a marker of domestic inputs, was investigated in the WWTP for the City of Peterborough, ON, Canada, which utilizes secondary sewage treatment technologies. CBZ, CBZ-2OH, CBZ3OH, and CBZ-DiOH were detected at concentrations of 69.6, 1.9, 1.6, and 7.5 mu g/kg (dry weight), respectively, in untreated biosolids and at concentrations of 258.1, 3.4, 4.3, and 15.4 mu g/kg (dry weight), respectively, in treated biosolids. However, CBZ-EP and CBZ-100H were not detected in any of the biosolid samples. CBZ and its five metabolites were detected in all wastewater samples collected from four different stages of treatment. The results showed that 29% of the carbamazepine was removed from the aqueous phase during treatment in the WWTP, while the metabolites were not effectively removed. Concentrations of caffeine were reduced by 99.9% in the aqueous phase, which appeared to be due primarily to degradation. Caffeine was also detected at concentrations of 165.8 and 7.6 mu g/kg (dry weight) in raw and treated biosolids, respectively. Because of differences in hydrophobicity, CBZ is the primary analyte in biosolids, while CBZ-DiOH is the primary analyte in the aqueous phase of the wastewater. A mass balance calculation showed that the majority of CBZ and its metabolites exist in the aqueous phase (i.e., wastewater), rather than in the biosolids, 78 g of CBZ and its metabolites enters the Peterborough WWTP daily, and 91 g is discharged from the WWTP daily in the combined suspended solids and aqueous phases of the wastewater. The calculated daily inputs into the WWTP are somewhat less than the inputs of 192 g estimated from Canadian annual sales data for CBZ.

AB In many surface waters, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent is a substantial source of both regulated and unregulated contaminants, including a suite of complex organic compounds derived from household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and industrial and medical byproducts. In addition, STP effluents in some urban areas have also been shown to have a positive gadolinium (Gd) anomaly in the rare earth element (REE) pattern, with the Gd derived from its use in medical facilities. REE concentrations are relatively easy to measure compared to many organic wastewater compounds and may provide a more widely utilized tracer of STP effluents. To evaluate whether sewage treatment plant-associated Gd is a useful tracer of treatment plant effluent, an investigation of the occurrence, fate, and transport of rare earth elements was undertaken. The rare earth element patterns of four of five STP effluents sampled display positive Gd anomalies. The one site that did not have a Gd anomaly serves a small community, population 1200, with no medical facilities. Biosolids from a large metropolitan STP are not enriched in Gd even though the effluent is, suggesting that a substantial fraction of Gd remains in the aqueous phase through routine treatment plant operation. To evaluate whether STP-derived Gd persists in the fluvial environment, a 14-km study reach downstream of an STP was sampled. Gadolinium anomalies were present at all five downstream sites, but the magnitude of the anomaly decreased. Effluent from STPs is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic constituents, and to better understand the chemical interactions and their effect on REES, the aqueous speciation was modeled using comprehensive chemical analyses of water samples collected downstream of STP input. These calculations suggest that the REES will likely remain dissolved because phosphate and carbonate complexes dominate over free REE ions. This study supports the application of Gd anomalies as a useful tracer of urban wastewater.

AB Ozonation and chlorination of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), and nonylphenol (NP) were performed to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the by-products of these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). After 15 min oxidation, samples were extracted using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and tested in vitro to measure the estrogenic activities of the oxidized products. MCF-7 cell proliferation assay showed that chlorinated BPA solution displayed slightly stronger estrogenicity than BPA, while chlorinated NP retained about one-tenth of its bioactivity. The estrogenic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-CIBPAs and di-CINP were screened out from the corresponding chlorinated products by a combined application of estrogen receptor (ER) binding with ultrafiltration and identified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Ozonation of the above four estrogens and chlorination of E2 and EE2 significantly decreased their estrogenic activities under the applied conditions.

ID RISK
AB A comparative assessment of the risks of three effluent disposal alternatives currently available to wastewater utilities in Southeast Florida is presented in this paper. The alternatives are: deep well injection and ocean outfalls following secondary treatment, and surface water (canal) discharges following secondary wastewater treatment, filtration and nutrient removal. Water quality data, relative to disposal of wastewater treatment plant effluent were gathered, along with water quality data on the receiving waters, from utilities. Comparisons and conclusions regarding potential health concerns associated with the three disposal alternatives are presented. The results indicated that health risks associated with deep wells were generally lower than those of the other two alternatives. The proximity of injection wells to aquifer storage and recovery wells was a determining factor relative to injection well risk. Urban ecological risks were also indicated to be lower, though impacts of urban water use/reuse to the Everglades were not studied. Additional data collection and analysis were recommended to understand the effects of wastewater management on the cycling of water. nutrients and other constituents on southeast Florida. In particular, it was recommended that monitoring of effluents for nitrosamines and pharmaceutically active substances be implemented on a broad scale.

AB The removal of seven pharmaceuticals and two fragrances in the biological units of various full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants was studied. The observed removal of pharmaceuticals was mainly due to biological transformation and varied from insignificant (< 10%, carbamazepine) to > 90% (ibuprofen). However, no quantitative relationship between structure and activity can be set up for the biological transformation. Overall, it can be concluded that for compounds showing a sorption coefficient (K-d) of below 300 L kg(-1), sorption onto secondary sludge is not relevant and their transformation can consequently be assessed simply by comparing influent and effluent concentrations. The two fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) studied were mainly removed by sorption onto sludge. For the compounds studied, comparable transformation and sorption was seen for different reactor types (conventional activated sludge, membrane bioreactor and fixed bed reactor) as well as for sludge ages between 10 and 60-80 days and temperatures between 12 degrees C and 21 degrees C. However, some significant variations in the observed removal currently lack an explanation. The observed incoming daily load of iopromide and roxithromycin in medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plants (up to 80,000 population equivalents) is generated by only a small number of patients: the consequences for representative 24 h composite sampling are discussed. Generally, the paper presents a method for setting up mass balances for micropollutants over entire wastewater treatment plants, including an estimation of the accuracy of the quantified fate (i.e. removal by sorption and biological transformation).

AB Although pharmaceutical and therapeutic products are widely found in the natural environment, there is limited Understanding of their ecological effects. Here we used rotating annular bioreactors to assess the impact of 10 mu g-L-1 of the selected pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, carbamazepine, furosemide, and caffeine on riverine biofilms. After 8 weeks of development, community structure was assessed using in situ microscopic analyses, fluor-conjugated lectin binding, standard plate counts, fluorescent in Situ hybridization, carbon utilization spectra, and stable carbon isotope analyses. The biofilm communities varied markedly in architecture although only caffeine treated biofilms were significantly thicker. Cyanobacteria were Suppressed by all 4 compounds, whereas the nitrogen containing caffeine, furosemide, and carbamazepine increased algal biomass. Ibuprofen and carbamazepine reduced bacterial biomass, white caffeine and furosemide increased it. Exopolymer content and composition of the biofilms was also influenced. Significant positive and negative effects were observed in carbon utilization spectra. In situ hybridization analyses indicated all treatments significantly decreased the gamma-proteobacterial Populations and increased beta-proteobacterial. Ibuprofen in particular increased the alpha-proteobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, cytophaga-flavobacteria, and SRB385 probe positive populations. Caffeine and carbarnazepine additions resulted in significant increases in the high GC354c and low GC69a probe positive cells. Live-dead analyses of the biofilins indicated that all treatments influenced the ratio of live-to-dead cells with controls having a ratio of 2.4, carbamazepine and ibuprofen being 3.2 and 3.5, respectively, and furosemide and caffeine being 1.9 and 1.7, respectively. Stable isotope analyses of the biofilms indicated delta C-13 values shifted to more negative values relative to control biofilins. This shift may be consistent with proportional loss of cyanobacteria and relative increase in algal biomass rather than incorporation of pharmaceutical carbon into microbial biofilm. Thus, at 10 ug.L-1 levels pharmaceuticals exhibit both nutrient-like and toxic effects on riverine microbial communities.

AB A study was conducted to examine the influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solid retention time (SRT) on the removal of tetracycline in the activated sludge processes. Two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated to simulate the activated sludge process. One SBR was spiked with 250 mu g/L tetracycline, while the other SBR was evaluated at tetracycline concentrations found in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) where the activated sludge was obtained. The concentrations of tetracyclines in the influent of the WWTP ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 mu g/L. Three different operating conditions were applied during the study (phase 1-HRT: 24 h and SRT: 10 days; phase 2-HRT: 7.4 h and SRT: 10 days; and phase 3-HRT: 7.4 h and SRT: 3 days). The removal efficiency of tetracycline in phase 3 (78.4 +/- 7.1%) was significantly lower than that observed in phase 1 (86.4 +/- 8.7%) and phase 2 (85.1 +/- 5.4%) at the 95% confidence level. The reduction of SRT in phase 3 while maintaining a constant HRT decreased tetracycline removal efficiency. Sorption kinetics reached equilibrium within 24 h. Batch equilibrium experiments yielded an adsorption coefficient (K-ads) of 8400 +/- 500 mL/g and a desorption coefficient (K-des) of 22 600 +/- 2200 mL/g. No evidence of biodegradation for tetracycline was observed during the biodegradability test, and sorption was found to be the principal removal mechanism of tetracycline in activated sludge.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the co-occurrence of caffeine and the extent of its influence front to other traditional water quality parameters ( microbiological indicator data) in way to characterize it as an efficient pollution indicator of anthropogenic origin in urban aquatic environments. Caffeine is a constituent of a variety of beverages ( coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks) and of numerous food products ( chocolate, pastries and dairy desserts). Although the human body is efficient at metabolising this stimulant, between 0.5 - 10% is excreted, mostly in urine. In addition, caffeine from domestic use may find its way directly into the sewer system due to the disposal of unconsumed drinks. The analysis of samples from Leopoldina Hydrographic Basin and Guanabara Bay revealed a significant difference areas not commonly affected by nutrient enrichment or sewage inputs versus areas chronically influenced by sewage discharges. Monitoring caffeine will be fundamental in urban-stressed aquatic environments where frequent accidental ruptures of sewage lines, pump station overflows or elevated numbers of inefficient septic tank systems are common.

AB The regeneration of activated carbons used for the decontamination of water and wastewater polluted with organic compounds related to the pharmaceutical industry, has been studied in this work. To this end, the pyrolysis of exhausted activated carbons was performed in a quartz reactor. The influence of the pyrolysis of saturated activated carbons on their adsorptive capacities and porous structure was evaluated. Textural characterisation of the samples was carried out by helium density, and N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms, at -196 and 0 degrees C, respectively. Consecutive cycles of pyrolysis of activated carbons exhausted with phenol and salicylic acid, generated a widening of the microporosity, and a decrease in the apparent BET surface areas. The adsorptive capacities for phenol retention after a series of adsorption/ pyrolysis cycles were found to decrease drastically. In contrast, consecutive cycles gave higher salicylic acid adsorptive capacities, as compared to phenol. The DTG pyrolysis profiles of the samples saturated with salicylic acid appeared at lower temperatures than those of phenol, which showed two peaks, while those exhausted with salicylic acid only showed one. These results provide evidence of the different adsorption mechanisms of these two pollutants. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The exposure and fate of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was evaluated using modeled predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) according to the U.S. and the European Union (EU) guidelines and microcosm model ecosystems. According to the U.S. guidance, crude environmental introduction concentrations, the only SSRI that would require environmental assessment would be sertraline. However, the more conservative EU draft guidance PEC would require further assessment of all five SSRIs. Refined PECs developed using the U.S. and the EU guidelines along with estimates of removal by sewage treatment and receiving water dilution factors indicate that the U.S. methodology corresponds better to MEC data determined in the U.S. and Canada. Worst-case (99th centile) PECs for citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were 30, 19, 30, 65, and 122 ng/L, respectively, using the U.S. methodology and 142, 182, 841, 144, and 575 ng/L, respectively, using the EU draft methodology. The dissipation of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine from the water column in aquatic microcosms was best described using a two-compartment model while sertraline followed a one-compartment model. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine water concentrations initially dissipated with first phase half-lives of 3.8 and 1.8 days, respectively, but levelled off at concentrations around 10 mu g/L with second phase half-lives of 76.7 and 59.3 days, respectively, not including those estimated as infinity. Sertraline dissipation tended toward the detection limit with a half-life of 3.4 days. Fluoxetine was found to be the most persistent followed by fluvoxamine and sertraline. Estimated log(K-OC) values for all SSRIs were >4.3 indicating that SSRIs are expected to adsorb to sediment or sludge. Partitioning into other environmental compartments such as this may act as a reservoir from which SSRIs may be re-released into surface waters and indicates the potential susceptibility of benthos.

AB The quality of drinking and recreational water is currently (2005) determined using indicator bacteria. However, the culture tests used to analyze for these bacteria require a long time to complete and do not discriminate between human and animal fecal material sources. One complementary approach is to use chemicals found in human wastewater, which would have the advantages of (1) potentially shorter analysis times than the bacterial culture tests and (2) being selected for human-source specificity. At 10 locations, water samples were collected upstream and at two successive points downstream from a wastewaster treatment plant (WWTP); a treated effluent sample was also collected at each WWTP. This sampling plan was used to determine the persistence of a chemically diverse suite of emerging contaminants in streams. Samples were also collected at two reference locations assumed to have minimal human impacts. Of the 110 chemical analytes investigated in this project, 78 were detected at least once. The number of compounds in a given sample ranged from 3 at a reference location to 50 in a WWTP effluent sample. The total analyte load at each location varied from 0.018 mu g/L at the reference location to 97.7 mu g/L in a separate WWTP effluent sample. Although most of the compound concentrations were in the range of 0.01-1.0 mu g/ L, in some samples, individual concentrations were in the range of 5-38 mu g/L. The concentrations of the majority of the chemicals present in the samples generally followed the expected trend: they were either nonexistent or at trace levels in the upstream samples, had their maximum concentrations in the WWTP effluent samples, and then declined in the two downstream samples. This research suggests that selected chemicals are useful as tracers of human wastewater discharge.

AB In recent years there has been growing interest on the occurrence and the fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, few data are available covering the fate of the pharmaceuticals in the water/ sediment compartment. In this study, the environmental fate of 10 selected pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites was investigated in water/sediment systems including both the analysis of water and sediment. The experiments covered the application of four C-14-labeled pharmaceuticals (diazepam, ibuprofen, iopromide, and paracetamol) for which radio-TLC analysis was used as well as six nonlabeled compounds (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, ivermectin, and oxazepam), which were analyzed via LC-tandem MS. Ibuprofen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, and paracetamol displayed a low persistence with DT50 values in the water/sediment system <= 20 d. The sediment played a key role in the elimination of paracetamol due to the rapid and extensive formation of bound residues. A moderate persistence was found for ivermectin and oxazepam with DT50 values of 15 and 54 d, respectively. lopromide, for which no corresponding DT50 values could be calculated, also exhibited a moderate persistence and was transformed into at least four transformation products. For diazepam, carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine, and clofibric acid, system DT90 values of > 365 d were found,which exhibit their high persistence in the water/sediment system. An elevated level of sorption onto the sediment was observed for ivermectin, diazepam, oxazepam, and carbamazepine. Respective K-OC values calculated from the experimental data ranged from 1172 L(.)kg(-1) for ivermectin down to 83 L(.)kg(-1) for carbamazepine.

AB Subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFs) constitute a wastewater treatment alternative to small communities due to the low operational cost, reduced energy consumption, and no sewage sludge production. Although much information is available about conventional water quality parameters in SSF constructed wetlands, few data are available regarding specific contaminants. In this paper, we focus on the behavior of three widely used pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, and carbamazepine) in two pilot SSF constructed wetlands planted with Phragmites australis and characterized by different water depths (i.e., 0.3 and 0.5 m). These SSFs partially treat the urban wastewater from a housing development (ca. 200 inhabitants). The three pharmaceuticals and bromide were continuously injected into the two SSFs during a period of 150-200 In, and the effluent concentration was simultaneously measured as 6 h composite samples. Their removal efficiency was calculated from the injected concentration, and the hydraulic parameters were evaluated and compared to bromide as tracer. In this regard, the behavior of clofibric acid was similar to that of bromide, and no sorption into the gravel bed occurred. On the other hand, carbamazepine showed a higher sorption than bromide and clofibric acid, which is attributable to its interaction on the gravel bed. Accordingly, the use of clofibric acid as a hydraulic tracer is proposed, taking into account its low residence time. lbuprofen removal was 81% in the shallow SSF and 48% in the deep one. Differences in removal efficiency could be explained by the less anaerobic environment of the shallow wetland.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment lately have been acknowledged to constitute a health risk for humans and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Human and veterinary applications are the main sources of PhACs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge to the environment through sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, the occurrence and fate of selected human PhACs belonging to different therapeutic classes (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, anti-epileptics, antibiotics and beta-blockers) were investigated in a small river in the very south of Sweden. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of a high and rather constant load in sewage influent on downstream concentrations and whether substances that are metabolized to a high degree in humans also show a low persistency in a natural aquatic environment. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the STP, in a series of dammed reservoirs leading to discharge into the Hoje River in Sweden, and at several locations in the river downstream of the outfall. After enrichment by solid-phase extraction, the compounds were analyzed using GC-MS (methylated derivatives) or LC-MS/MS. In addition to the targeted pharmaceuticals, GC-MS analysis of the samples revealed the presence of other sewage-related pollutants (triclosan, caffeine, flame-retardants, antioxidants) and these results where included for comparison. Removal efficiencies were calculated in the STP and found to display a wide range with numerous species surviving treatment at greater than half their influent concentrations, including diclofenac, the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, a beta-blocker (propanolol), and antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Low removals were also observed for Tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (flame retardant), BHT-aldehyde (oxidation product of BHT) and synthetic musk (HHCB). The concentrations of chloride (Cl-) and boron (B) were used as natural inert tracers to estimate the relative extent of dilution of PhACs measured in the effluent of the STP on concentrations measured further downstream. Based on spatial trends of concentrations (recalculated to reflect a hypothetical scenario with no dilution), ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen and dicofenac were shown to be subject to significant abiotic or biotic transformations or physical sequestration in the river. The beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol, the antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfametoxazole, and carbamazepine demonstrated a high degree of persistence. Fluctuations in the concentration of carbamazepine and gemfibrozil were observed along the series of reservoirs and within the river and are hypothesized to be due to release of parent compound from glucuronides. Several of the investigated substances (metaprolol, propanolol and carbamazepin) that exhibit low excretion rates as parent compounds demonstrate a surprising persistence in the aquatic environment. It is concluded that pharmaceutical substances with a high metabolic rate in humans (low excretion rate) do not necessarily induce a short lifetime in aquatic environments. Results from this study emphasize the need for a broader view on the concept of persistence that accounts for loading rates, in addition to removal mechanisms (e.g., transformation, volatility and physical sequestration by solids), under a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

AB A predictive approach seems useful to identify pharmaceuticals in the environment and give an idea of overall levels of contamination, so as to restrict monitoring to those molecules most likely to be contaminants. We propose an approach based on two parts. The first is to rank the molecules according to the predicted environmental loads; the second is to refine the list by analysing the pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and comparing the concentrations with levels previously measured in surface water. This approach identified a restricted group of priority pollutants (ofloxacin, furosemide, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, spiramycin, bezafibrate, erythromycin, lincomycin and clarithromycin) in the aquatic environment in Italy, for further studies and monitoring.

AB The anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac are frequently found as residues in the aquatic environment and also in samples of ground and drinking water. For both compounds, their loads occurring in the effluents from a military hospital and in the combined (household and hospital) sewage of a sewage pumping station (SPS) and a large municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) were predicted and measured within a field trial by collecting and analyzing defined composite samples over a time period of I week. The use of pharmacokinetic data and precise information on the administration of the individual medicinal formulation was found to be essential for the validity of the predicted data. The measured data confirmed the validity of the predicted loads with recoveries between 63 and 102% for carbamazepine and around 35% for diclofenac, in the hospital wastewater. A comparison of the weekly loads predicted and measured in the influents and effluents of a STP in Berlin (Germany) yielded a very low removal rate for diclofenac (less than 15%) and a removal rate of up to 40% for carbamazepine. In total, 2.0 kg of carbamazepine per week (105 kg/a) and 4.4kg of diclofenac per week (226 kg/a) were discharged into Berlin's surface water by the municipal STP, which treats both household sewage from approximately one million inhabitants and large amounts of hospital effluents (approximately 12,060 hospital beds).

AB The presence of amoxicillin, a widely used antibiotic, has been documented in Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) effluents. As for other pharmaceuticals, ozonation is proposed as a process for its abatement from these effluents. The results of ozonation experiments on amoxicillin containing aqueous solutions indicate that ozone attack is mainly directed towards the phenolic ring of the studied molecule leading to the formation of hydroxyderivative intermediates. No direct evidences of attack on sulfur atom with sulfoxide formation are found. A kinetic investigation is carried out allowing the assessment of the kinetics of direct ozone attack and that of OH radicals to amoxicillin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethoxazole, a common antibiotic, was found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions. The fate of sulfamethoxazole in the activated sludge process was studied using a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Aerobic biomass was acclimated to sulfamethoxazole and a series of kinetic experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of other carbon and nitrogen sources on the degradation of the antibiotic. It was found that sulfamethoxazole serves both as carbon and nitrogen source for the enriched consortium. It was degraded whenever there was a depletion of carbon or nitrogen or both in the feeding medium, while in the presence of acetate and ammonium nitrogen (alternative carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively), sulfamethoxazole remained intact.

AB Wastewater reuse presents a promising solution to the growing pressure on water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance, technical, economic and hygienic risks and further uncertainties caused by a lack of awareness, accepted standards, uniform guidelines and legislation. So far, there are no supra-national regulations on water reuse in Europe and further development is slowed by lack of widely accepted standards, e.g. in terms of required water quality, treatment technology and distribution system design and operation. Treatment technology encompasses a vast number of options and membrane processes are regarded as key elements of advanced wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes and are included in a number of prominent schemes world-wide, e.g. for artificial groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse as well as for industrial process water production. For dual reticulation purposes in urban areas two types of systems have been built, a centralised type of treatment with dual membrane processes, including e.g. microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO), and small scale systems using membrane bioreactors. This paper will provide an overview of the status of membranes processes in wastewater reclamation and reuse world-wide and will depict their potential role in promoting more sustainable water use patterns.

AB The degradation of three estrogens, two endocrine disruptors and ten pharmaceutical substances in a membrane separation bioreactor was experimentally examined. Higher removal of acidic pharmaceutical substances was obtained in the case of lower pH operation because of the increased tendency of adsorption to the sludge particles. The target substances attached to the sludge were not accumulated in the reactor and they were biologically degraded. The membrane used in this study was a microfiltration membrane which has much larger pores than target substances. However, the permeate concentration was lower than the water phase concentration in the reactor probably due to activated sludge deposition onto the membrane surface. The additional removal by the membrane was increased with the time elapsed, though the removal was not significantly high for the relatively hydrophilic compounds.

AB Unintentional indirect potable water reuse, where wastewater effluent is used as a part of a downstream drinking water source, has become a great concern. In this case, a variety of organic micro-pollutants contained in wastewater effluent could create problems. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have gained significant popularity as an advanced wastewater treatment technology and might be effective in removing such organic micro-pollutants. Available information on the performance of MBRs regarding removal of micro-pollutants, however, is currently limited. This study examined the ability of submerged MBRs to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Experiments were conducted at an existing municipal wastewater treatment facility, and the performance of the MBRs was compared with that of the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. Six acidic PhACs (clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen) and one acidic herbicide (dichloprop) were investigated. Compared with CAS, MBRs exhibited much better removal regarding ketoprofen and naproxen. With respect to the other compounds, comparable removal was observed between the two types of treatment. Removal efficiencies of the PhACs were found to be dependent on their molecular structure such as number of aromatic rings or inclusion of chlorine.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment as a result of human and veterinary use, posing relevant environmental concerns. This study evaluated the acute toxicity of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate, and clofibric acid) and a detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS) in three aquatic species, namely the euryhaline fish Gambusia holbrooki, the hypersaline crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica, and the marine algae Tetraselmis chuii. The ranking of 50% lethal concentrations (LC50) for the two animal species and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the algal species was, in decreasing order, clofibric acid > SDS > diazepam > clofibrate for G. holbrooki, clofibric acid > clofibrate > SDS > diazepam for A. parthenogenetica, and clofibric acid > clofibrate > SDS > diazepam for T. chuii. These differences show that the intrinsic nature of test organisms must be considered when evaluating the toxicity of these agents to aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an antimicroibial disinfectant agent used in a wide array of consumer products. An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by reverse phase, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization (negative)-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-EST(-)-MS/MS; in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode) was developed, optimized and validated for the determination of triclosan in wastewater/sewage treatment plant (WSTP) effluent and surface waters from the upper Detroit River (Canada). The mean recoveries ( +/-%RSD) of triclosan and the internal standard 2-HO-tlibromodiphenyl ether (2'-HO-BDE-28) spiked to surface water and WSTP effluent samples ranged similarly from 104 +/- 8% and 91 +/- 10%, respectively, and method limits of quantification were in the low ppb/high ppt range. However, ESI(-) enhancement was found for both analytes due to sample matrix effects, as indicated by % process efficiencies (a measure of ESI(-) enhancement/suppression), which were in the 111-128% range. We report the first known assessment of triclosan in the Detroit River watershed of the Great Lakes, which preliminarily examined the presence and UV-treatment effects on triclosan in effluent from the major WSTP serving the City of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and fate in surface waters of the upper Detroit River. Triclosan in WSTP effluent decreased 22% after final UV treatment to a mean concentration of 63 ng/L. Concentrations were further reduced to 4 and 8 ng/L (a > 90% reduction) in surface water samples from sites downstream on the Canadian shoreline of the Detroit River, which was due to dilution. Two hydroxylated tribrominated diphenyl ethers, which are structurally similar to triclosan, were also detected in WSTP effluent and surface water samples. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmacologically active substances used to treat human and animal illnesses can enter the aquatic environment via effluents from wastewater treatment plants or in the case of veterinary drugs directly through liquid manure discharge. Some of these substances enter the environment either as the parent compound or as active/inactive metabolites. Due to their pharmacological activity, their determination and understanding their behavior and fate in the environment are important.
   The scope of this paper was to develop an analytical procedure to determine common pharmaceutical residues in wastewaters. Pharmacologically active substances were chosen according to their wide spread application in Slovenia and Central Europe and are members of analgesics, e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac. Selected compounds were isolated from synthetic water using a novel SPE sorbent Strata (TM) X. Due to the non-volatile nature of these compounds they were first silylised prior to gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric detection. The developed procedure was tested with synthetic wastewaters and their extraction efficiency (> 84%) and method limits of detection (2-6 ng L-1) were determined. Our procedure has been adopted and optimised for "real'' water samples and applied to eleven drinking and ten river water samples from Slovenia. The results showed no traces of NSAIDs in all potable water samples and low-range contamination (ng L-1) of Slovene rivers. These results show that NSAIDs contamination of Slovene waters is comparable with published results of water contamination in Central Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory degradation tests with five acidic pharmaceuticals using activated sludge as inocculum under aerobic conditions were performed and microbial metabolites were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Ketoprofen was partly mineralized as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolites determined by LC-MS suggest microbial ketoprofen degradation to proceed along the pathway known for biphenyls and related compounds. Bezafibrate, naproxen and ibuprofen were degraded only cometabolically whereas no transformation was obtained for diclofenac. Some biodegradation intermediates in these batch tests could be tentatively identified by means of LC-MS. The first step in microbial bezafibrate degradation appears to be the hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond, generating well degradable 4-chlorobenzoic acid as one of the hydrolysis products. As previously found for mammals, ether cleavage and formation of desmethyinaproxen was the initial step in microbial degradation of naproxen. Two isomers of hydroxy-ibuprofen were detected as intermediates in the mineralization of ibuprofen. Laboratory studies suggest that naproxen and ibuprofen can be fully mineralized whereas more stable metabolites occur in microbial ketoprofen and bezafibrate transformation, that may deserve further attention. A LC-MS method for the trace analysis of these metabolites in water was developed and applied to municipal wastewater. Municipal wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor may gradually improve the removal of these pharmaceuticals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Various members of the popular fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) have been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water bodies in recent years. This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the fate of FQs in the sediment-water environment. Seven FQS were examined for adsorptive and oxidative interactions with delta-MnO2 under environmental conditions and exhibited reactivity in the order of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin similar to norfloxacin similar to ofloxacin similar to lomefloxacin > pipemidic acid >> flumequine. Four amines that are structurally related to the aniline and piperazine functional groups of HIS showed reactivity to oxidation by delta-MnO2 in the order of 1-phenylpiperazine > aniline > N-phenylmorpholine > 4-phenylpiperidine. Comparison among the above compounds clearly indicates that the piperazine moiety of FQs is the predominant adsorptive and oxidative site to MnO2. Product analyses showed that oxidation by MnO2 results in dealkylation and hydroxylation at the piperazine moiety of FQs, with the quinolone ring essentially intact. The reaction kinetics, reactivity comparison, and product characterization point to a surface reaction mechanism that likely begins with formation of a surface complex between FQ and the surface-bound Mn-IV, followed by oxidation at the aromatic N-1 atomof FQ's piperazine moiety to generate an anilinyl radical intermediate. The radical intermediates subsequently undergo N-dealkylation, C-hydroxylation, and possibly coupling to yield a range of products. Even though the quinolone ring appears to be stable with respect to MnO2, it affects the overall reactivity and potentially product distribution of FQs via substituent effects. Results of this study strongly suggest that manganese oxides commonly present in soils will likely play an important role in the abiotic degradation of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents in the environment.

AB Human and veterinarian pharmaceuticals have been detected in the aquatic environment for a number of years, but the potential for biological effects in exposed aquatic organism is only now being reported. The lipid regulator, gemfibrozil (GEM) is detected at mu g/L concentrations in domestic wastewater and ng/L concentrations in surface waters. We investigated the uptake of GEM in goldfish (Carassius auratus) over a 96 h time period by measuring GEM in blood plasma using LC-MS/MS. Results indicated that GEM can be taken up from water through the gills. In goldfish exposed to GEM by a single intraperitoneal injection, concentrations of GEM in the blood plasma declined rapidly over 96 It post-injection, with a half-life estimated at approximately 19 h.
   Exposure of goldfish to waterborne GEM at an environmentally relevant concentration over 14 days resulted in a plasma bioconcentration factor of 113. In goldfish exposed to aqueous concentrations of GEM for 96 It or 14 days, plasma testosterone (T) was reduced by over 50% in fish from all treatments. As a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed reduction in T, levels of steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein transcript in goldfish testes were assessed by RT-PCR. StAR protein is involved in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane for transformation by the first enzyme in steroidogenesis. After exposure to GEM for 96 h, a 50% decrease in StAR mRNA levels was observed in goldfish. Gonadal StAR mRNA levels were not affected in the 14 days exposure, indicating that the observed decreases in plasma testosterone were not solely due to impaired delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results demonstrate that exposure to environmental levels of GEM leads to bioconcentration of the drug in plasma and the potential for endocrine disruption in fish. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic exposure to municipal sewage treatment effluent at environmentally relevant concentrations on immune parameters in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), including the assessment of potential differences in reactivity between sexually mature male and female fish. Trout were exposed to 1.5 and 15% (v/v) secondary treated municipal sewage effluent for 32 weeks. Fish were injected intra-peritoneally either with inactivated Aeromonas salmonicida to simulate an infection or with PBS as control for this immune challenge 6 weeks prior to sampling., Exposure to effluent resulted in a decrease in A. salmonicida-specific serum antibody level and blood lymphocyte numbers in mature females, but not in male fish. Injection of A. salmonicida resulted in enhanced serum lysozyme activity in mature male trout, which were not exposed to effluent. This stimulating effect of A. salmonicida could not be found in effluent-exposed trout, again potentially revealing a suppressive effect of the effluent. An influence of sampling fish on two consecutive days was observed in many immune parameters, most likely reflecting handling stress. Leucocyte and lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood were consistently lower in male and female fish on the second sampling day. Phagocytosis in head kidney macrophages from male trout was also influenced by sampling day, whereby a stimulation of this reaction occurred on the second day of sampling. Liver mixed function oxygenase activity was found to be enhanced in mature male trout exposed to 15% effluent. In conclusion, the study showed, that exposure to sewage treatment plant effluent, in surface water relevant concentrations, can lead to potentially adverse effects on selected immune reactions in rainbow trout. However, this study also demonstrated that both handling stress and the sex of mature fish have distinct influences on the immune response detected in male and female fish and are likely to influence measured immune parameters to the extent that subtle effluent induced changes may be difficult to detect.

AB The occurrence of sulfonamide and macrolide antimicrobials, as well as trimethoprim, was investigated in conventional activated sludge treatment. Average daily loads in untreated wastewater correlated well with those estimated from annual consumption data and pharmacokinetic behavior. Considerable variations were found during a day, and seasonal differences seem to occur for the macrolides, probably caused by a higher consumption of these substances in winter. The most predominant macrolide and sulfonamide antimicrobials were clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. In the case of sulfamethoxazole, the main human metabolite, M-acetylsulfamethoxazole, was included as an analyte, accounting for up to 86% of the total load in untreated wastewater. The results obtained illustrate the importance of considering retransformable substances, for example human metabolites, when investigating the behavior and fate of pharmaceuticals. Average concentrations of sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azithromycin, and clarithromycin in activated sludge ranged between 28 and 68 mu g/kg of dry weight. Overall the sorption to activated sludge was shown to be low for the investigated antimicrobials, with estimated sorption constants for activated sludge below 500 L/kg. Elimination in activated sludge treatment was found to be incomplete for all investigated compounds. In final effluents, the median concentrations for sulfa methoxazole and clarithromycin were 290 and 240 ng/L, respectively.

AB To reduce the release of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors into the aquatic environment or to remove them from wastewater intended for direct or indirect reuse, the application of advanced wastewater treatment may be required. In the present study, municipal wastewater effluents were treated with ozone (O-3) in a pilot-scale plant consisting of two bubble columns. The investigated effluents, which varied in suspended solids concentrations, comprised an effluent of conventional activated sludge treatment (CAS), the same effluent dosed with 15 mg of TSS L-1 of activated sludge (CAS + SS), and the effluent of a membrane bioreactor pilot plant (MBR). Selected classes of pharmaceuticals were spiked in the wastewater at realistic levels ranging from 0.5 to 5 mu g L-1. Samples taken at the inlet and the outlet of the pilot plant were analyzed with liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Macrolide and sulfonamide antibiotics, estrogens, and the acidic pharmaceuticals diclofenac, naproxen, and indomethacin were oxidized by more than 90-99% for O-3 doses >= 2 mg L-1 in all effluents. X-ray contrast media and a few acidic pharmaceuticals were only partly oxidized, but no significant differences were observed among the three effluents. These results show that many pharmaceuticals present in wastewater can be efficiently oxidized with O-3 and that suspended solids have only a minor influence on the oxidation efficiency of nonsorbing micropollutants.

Solutions were irradiated with a xenon arc lamp (765 W/m(2); 290 nm < lambda < 700 nm) and analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with electrospray ionization for pharmaceuticals and atmospheric pressure photoionization for estrogens. In river water, half-lives were 4. 1 h for ketoprofen, 1. 1 min for propranolol, 1.4 h for naproxen, 2 to 3 h for estrogens, and 15 It for gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. In air-saturated purified water, rates generally were slower except for that of ketoprofen, which reacted with a half-life of 2.5 min. Naproxen, propranolol, and E, reacted with half-lives of 1.9, 4.4, and 4.7 h, respectively. The EE2, estriol, E-2, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen reacted with half-lives of 28.4, 38.2, 41.7, 91.4, and 205 h, respectively. The presence of oxygen doubled the direct photolysis rates of naproxen and propranolol. In nonautoclaved river water, 80% of E-2 rapidly biotransformed to E-1 within less than 20 min, whereas all other compounds remained stable over 22 h.

AB The aerobic biodegradability of four antimicrobials (sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole, and trimethoprim) was investigated in sewage collected at four treatment stages (primary treatment, activated sludge treatment, aerobic nitrification process, and after disinfection of treated sewage) of a municipal sewage treatment plant. The biodegradability tests were conducted in aerated batch reactors by spiking the sewage with 20 mu g/L of each of the test substance. Concentration profiles of the assayed compounds were monitored during a 54-d period using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. Substantial differences in the degradation curves were observed between trimethoprim and the three sulfonamides. The behavior of the latter was characterized by a general biodegradability in the primary and secondary treatment. The highest degradation rates were obtained in the sewage from the activated sludge treatment, where no adaptation phase was observed. On the other hand, the onset of biodegradation in the sewage from the primary treatment was preceded by a lag phase ranging from 10 to 15 d. In contrast, trimethoprim displayed high resistance to microbial degradation in the sewage from the primary treatment and the activated sludge treatment. However, primary degradation of this compound was completed within only 3 d in the sewage from the nitrification process.

AB The occurrence of five acidic pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and bezafibrate, in seven different sewage treatment plants (STP) and three receiving waters were determined. The analytical procedure included solid phase extraction, liquid chromatographic separation and detection by a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The studied pharmaceuticals were found in all the STPs. The pattern of the occurrence of individual compounds was the same in every STP and matched the consumption figures reported in the literature. Ibuprofen is the most used pharmaceutical in Finland and was accordingly found to be the most abundant compound in the raw sewage. In the treatment processes, the highest removal rate was observed for ibuprofen and the lowest for diclofenac, 92% +/- 8% and 26% +/- 17%, respectively. Due to the incomplete removal in the STPs, the pharmaceuticals were found in rivers at the discharge points of the STP effluents. Downstream from the discharge points, the concentrations decreased significantly mainly due to dilution in the river water. The risk to the aquatic environment was estimated by a ratio of measured environmental concentration (MEC) and predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). At the concentrations the compounds were found in the surface waters, they should not pose risk for the aquatic environment. However, at dry seasons and/or during malfunctions of STPs, ibuprofen could be associated with a risk in small river systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Twelve antibiotic substances for human use, including trimethoprim and representatives of the fluoroquinolone (FQ), sulfonamide (SA), penicillin (PE), cephalosporin (CE), nitroimidazole (NI), tetracycline (TC), and macrolide (MA) groups, were subjected to a screening study at five Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) during one week in 2002 and one week in 2003. The analytes were extracted from raw sewage water, final effluent, and sludge by solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-solid extraction (as appropriate) and then identified and quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The most frequently detected antibiotics in the matrices considered in this study were norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline. The other analytes were only detected in a few samples. Analysis of the weekly mass flows through each STP showed that FIGS were partly eliminated from the water during sewage water treatment and the highest amounts of these substances were found in sludge. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were mainly found in raw sewage water and final effluent, but these substances had balancing mass flows, indicating that they too can withstand sewage water treatment. The mass flow patterns for doxycycline were more complex, with high amounts occurring in sludge in some cases, suggesting that the behavior of this analyte may be more strongly influenced by the treatment process and other variables at individual STPs. The environmental load (the sum of the amounts in the final effluent and sludge) normalized to the number of inhabitants in the catchment area of each investigated STP compared with theoretical predictions based on consumption data (in parentheses) showed good correlations: norfloxacin, 0.8 (0.9); ofloxacin, 0.3 (0.2); ciprofloxacin, 1.3 (3.5); sulfamethoxazole, 0.2 (0.4); trimethoprim, 1.1 (1.0); and doxycycline, 0.7 (0.4) mg per person per week. The results show that reasonably accurate predictions of environmental load of these antibiotics can be time-effectively derived from consumption data without additional measurements.

AB The fate of antibiotics that bind to riverine sediment is not well understood. A solution used in geochemical extraction schemes to determine loosely bound species in sediments, 1 M MgCl2 (pH 8), was chosen to determine loosely bound, and potentially bioavailable, tetracycline antibiotics (TCs), including oxytetracycline (5-OH tetracycline) (OTC) in sediment samples from two rivers on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Bottom sediments were collected at sites upstream from, at, and downstream from municipal sewage-treatment plants (STPs) situated on two natural waterways, Yellow Bank Stream, MD, and the Pocomoke River, MD. Concentrations of easily desorbed OTC ranged from 0.6 to approximately 1.2 mu g g(-1) dry wt sediment in Yellow Bank Stream and from 0.7 to approximately 3.3,mu g g(-1) dry wt sediment in the Pocomoke River. Concentrations of easily desorbable OTC were generally smaller in sediment upstream than in sediment downstream from the STP in the Pocomoke River. STPs and poultry manure are both potential sources of OTC to these streams. OTC that is loosely bound to sediment is subject to desorption. Other researchers have found desorbed TICS to be biologically active compounds.

AB The photochemical behaviour of the four pharmaceuticals, atorvastatin, carbamazepine, levofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole in sunlit surface water was investigated. These compounds, which have been observed or have the potential to be in surface waters, were susceptible to direct and indirect photodegradation. Several photoproducts are identified using authentic standards, and structures of other degradation products are proposed based on mass spectral information from this and previous studies. The same degradation compounds are formed from direct and indirect photolysis, suggesting the same photoproducts are formed by alternate pathways. The natural water constituents nitrate, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and bicarbonate influence the elimination rates of the pharmaceuticals differently. Since direct photolysis appears important in limiting the persistence of levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, the presence of humic matter decreases degradation rates. The same constituent has an opposite and positive effect on the elimination rates of atorvastatin and carbamazepine and thus, photosensitization reactions or photooxidants generated from DOM photolysis are important. Products resulting from direct and indirect photolysis also seem to be susceptible to photodegradation, suggesting they will not persist in sunlit aqueous systems.

AB Recent surveys of aquatic habitats suggest that organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) may be common in aquatic ecosystems. However, relatively little is known about the impacts of OWCs on amphibians. We studied the lethal and sublethal effects of three OWCs (acetaminophen, caffeine, and triclosan) on American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles. High concentrations of triclosan increased activity, whereas acetaminophen had a significant effect on activity but there was no discernable pattern or trend with concentration. Caffeine did not affect activity in B. americanus tadpoles. None of the OWCs we studied had a significant effect on growth. Caffeine had no effect on survivorship. Higher concentrations of acetaminophen increased mortality. Intermediate concentrations of triclosan had a negative effect on survivorship, but the highest concentration apparently had a positive effect on survivorship. Our results suggest that there is variation in the toxicity of the three OWCs we studied.

AB One of the most frequently detected organic chemicals in a nationwide study concerning the effects of wastewater on stream water quality conducted in the year 2000 was the widely used insect repellant NN-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). It was detected at levels of 0.02 mu g/L or greater in 73% of the stream sites sampled, with the selection of sampling sites being biased toward streams thought to be subject to wastewater contamination (i.e., downstream from intense urbanization and livestock production). Although DEET frequently was detected at all sites, the median concentration was low (0.05 mu g/L). The highest concentrations of DEET were found in streams from the urban areas (maximum concentration, 1.1 mu g/L). The results of the present study suggest that the movement of DEET to streams through wastewater- treatment systems is an important mechanism that might lead to the exposure of aquatic organisms to this chemical.

AB The occurrence and fate of five acidic drugs (Mefenamic acid, Ibuprofen, Ketoprofen, Diclofenac and Clofibric acid) were analysed in three sewage treatment plants (STP) over 4-7 consecutive days. The results point out that the five substances were persistent in wastewater effluents after municipal wastewater treatment. At the most, half of Mefenamic acid was eliminated. Ibuprofen was well removed (80%) by one sewage treatment plant. The removal of Ibuprofen is dependent on the residence time of wastewater in the STPs. A long raining period induce an important decrease of removal of Ibuprofen and Ketoprofen. Removal rates showed a great variability according to sewage treatment plants and types of treatments (e.g. biological, physico-chemical). The concentrations of Ibuprofen, Mefenamic acid and Diclofenac were relatively high in the effluents (150-2000 ng/l), showing a potential contamination of surface water. An environmental risk assessment is presented. Mefenamic acid seems to present a risk for the aquatic environment, with a ratio PEC/PNEC higher than one. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmentally relevant polar persistent organic pollutants (pharmaceuticals and diagnostic agents) were chosen according to human consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment (sewage plant effluents, rivers and groundwater) to investigate their behavior during photocatalytic oxidation. From data compilation in the literature, the active metabolite clofibric acid of some lipid lowering agents, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and the X-ray contrast media iomeprol were selected. The degradation of the persistent pollutant was monitored by HPLC/DAD/FLD. The study also focuses on the identification and quantification of possible degradation products by HPLC/DAD/FLD and HPLC/MS/MS. The degradation process was also monitored by determination of sum parameters and inorganic ions. Various aromatic and aliphatic degradation products have been identified and quantified. From analytical data, a possible degradation scheme for carbamazepine was proposed. Kinetic studies showed that the TiO2 photocatalyst P25 was more active in clofibric acid degradation than Hombikat UV 100. For photocatalytic degradation of iomeprol Hombikat UV 100 was more suitable than P25. In general the presence of NOM and carbamazepine retarded the photocatalysis of clofibric acid. Radiation attenuation, competition for active sites and surface deactivation of the catalyst by adsorption are the reason for that. The results of this work proof that photocatalysis is a promising technology to reduce persistent substances even if they are present in low concentrations or in a complex matrix.

AB Pilot plant experiments applying solar titanium dioxide photocatalysis and solar photo-Fenton treatment at different pH and iron concentrations with an initial diclofenac concentration of 50 mg L-1 are described.
   In preliminary experiments absence of hydrolysis and slow photolysis under solar irradiation of diclofenac solutions were observed. Solar photo-Fenton treatment with freshly precipitated iron at pH around 7 showed first order kinetics, the reaction taking place on the surface of the iron precipitate. Simultaneous oxidation, precipitation and re-dissolution processes of diclofenac governed photo-Fenton decomposition kinetics at pH 2.8. The use of different iron concentrations (0.03-0.75 mM) showed no influence on the reaction rate in a neutral medium due to reactor geometry. Similar behaviour (no influence of iron concentration) was observed at pH 2.8, due to precipitation problems. A pH of around 4. close to the pK(a), of diclofenac, showed promising results, partly overcoming both iron and diclofenac precipitation. Solar titanium dioxide photocatalysis with Degussa P-25 followed first order kinetics and no precipitation or adsorption occurred.
   Decomposition of diclofenac took around 100 min under all photo-Fenton treatment conditions employed. Decomposition by titanium dioxide photocatalysis took about 200 min. In photo-Fenton treatment, hydrogen peroxide consumption to diclofenac decomposition was about 80-110 mM at pH 2.8 and 40 mM in the other two treatments (neutral pH and pH = 4).

AB Herbal Pharmaceutical wastewater was subjected to physico-chernical treatment using conventional coagulants individually and in combination with different anionic, cationic and nonionic polyelectrolytes. Results indicate cationic polyelectrolyte to be the best polymer. Individually Alum did not give good results but Alum with cationic polymer in the ratio of 300:0.25 mg l(-1) resulted in the best removals of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Solids (SS) of 64.0%, 69.4% and 80.82% respectively. The next combination which resulted in good removals was Lime: cationic polymer in the ratio of 300:0.20 mg l(-1) with COD, BOD, and SS removals of 57.6%, 65.1% and 74.0%, respectively. Overall the studies indicated that the herbal pharmaceutical wastewater needs to be treated by physico-chemical treatment as a primary process to reduce the organic load and increase the performance efficiency of the secondary biological treatment process. This paper discusses in detail the studies carried out using conventional coagulants along with synthetic polyelectrolyte.

AB The removal of three estrogens such as 17 beta-estradiol, two endocrine disruptors like bisphenol A, and 10 pharmaceutical substances like ibuprofen (IBP) by activated sludge was experimentally examined. The contribution of adsorption and degradation to the overall removal was estimated separately and successfully. At the neutral pH condition, the target pharmaceutical substances showed little tendency of adsorption to the sludge and their water-sludge partition coefficients were lower than those of the target estrogens. On the other hand, the increasing tendency of adsorption was observed in the lower pH condition. A linear relationship between the log of the partitioning coefficient and log K-ow was observed when pH was lowered to keep the pharmaceuticals neutral solutes. The acidic operational condition was preferable for the removal of acidic pharmaceutical substances because the limiting stage for the removal was not biodegradation but the transfer of substances from the water phase to the sludge phase.

AB Distribution and occurrence of Archaea and methanogenic activity in a laboratory scale, completely mixed anaerobic reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewaters were investigated and associated with reactor performance. The reactor was initially seeded with anaerobic digester sludge from an alcohol distillery wastewater treatment plant and was subjected to a three step feeding strategy. The feeding procedure involved gradual transition from a glucose containing feed to a solvent stripped pharmaceutical wastewater and then raw pharmaceutical wastewater. During the start-up period, over 90 % COD removal efficiency at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 6 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) was achieved with glucose feeding, and acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 336 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). At the end of the primary loading, when the feed contained solvent stripped pharmaceutical wastewater at full composition, 71 % soluble COD removal efficiency was obtained and acetoclastic methanogenic activity decreased to half of the rate under glucose feed (166 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1)). At the end of secondary loading with 60 % (w/v) raw pharmaceutical wastewater, COD removal dropped to zero and acetoclastic methanogenic activity fell to less than 10 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). Throughout the course of the experiment, microbial community structure was monitored by DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Five different archaeal taxa were identified and the predominant archaeal sequences belonged to methanogenic Archaea. Two of these showed greatest sequence identity with Methanobacterium formicicum and Methanosaeta concilii. The types of Archaea present changed little in response to changing feed composition but the relative contribution of different organisms identified in the archaeal DGGE profiles did change.

AB Irrigation of crops with treated wastewater has the potential to introduce effluent-derived organic microcontaminants into surface waters through agricultural runoff. To determine whether compounds indicative of the presence of treated effluent in irrigation water could be identified in agricultural runoff, surface runoff samples collected from effluent-irrigated and rain-fed cultivated fields were analyzed for a broad spectrum of organic compounds. A variety of compounds was identified that appeared to be associated with irrigation with treated wastewater. These compounds included human pharmaceuticals (e.g., carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, carisoprodol), personal care product ingredients (e.g., insect repellent, polycyclic musks), and alkyl phosphate flame retardant chemicals. Most of these compounds appear not to have been previously reported in agricultural runoff. These compounds were present at concentrations below the few published aquatic toxicology data available; however, their potential to elicit more subtle effects in aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. None of these compounds were detected by broad-spectrum analysis in samples from the same fields during runoff-producing rain events.

AB A test battery for identifying ecotoxicological hazards was applied to six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole), to their mixtures, and to urine spiked with pharmaceuticals to test the suitability of biotests for screening urine and wastewater and for monitoring the efficiency of wastewater treatment. The test battery comprised the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri, the yeast estrogen screen, and a photosynthesis inhibition assay in algae based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Mixture and additional experiments with a cocktail of pharmaceuticals added to urine confirmed the applicability of the test systems as an integrated measure of the overall micropollutant burden. Because the concentration of pharmaceuticals in wastewater is low and the nutrients and salts may have a negative impact on the bioassays, urine and wastewater samples were cleaned and concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The compounds of interest ranged from polar to nonpolar and from positively charged to neutral and negatively charged. Consequently, the SPE method was optimized for universality rather than for specificity. Results of preliminary experiments with raw and treated urine and wastewater indicate the suitability of the proposed test battery for screening urine and wastewater.

AB The occurrence of quinolone antibiotics (QAs) was investigated in wastewater effluents and surface river/lake waters in the US and Canada by using solid-phase extraction with mixed phase cation exchange disk cartridge and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography fluorescence detection (LC-FLD). Ofloxacin (OFL) was detected in secondary and final effluents of a wastewater treatment plant (WWP) in East Lansing, Michigan, at concentrations of 204 and 100 ng/l, respectively. The mass flow calculation, estimated by multiplying the OFL concentration in the final effluent by the average influent volume of the WWTP. showed that the discharge of OFL to the river was 4.8g/day. The OFL concentrations in wastewater effluents measured in this studs, are comparable to or less than those observed in several European countries. QAs were not detected in river and lake waters analsyed in this studs,. which may due to dilution effects and to the higher detection limits. relative to those reported previously OFL concentrations were approximate to1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the EC50 concentrations for environmental bacterium. However, greater concentrations of other QAs in sewage sludge from WWTPs may result in cumulative effects. Considering that the sewage sludge is applied to the land as fertilizers. soil-dwelling organisms could experience greater exposures to such antibiotics. Monitoring studies of QAs in sewage from WWTPs and in sediment/soil near aquaculture facilities and livestock farms will be necessary for the evaluation of the environmental distribution and risk of these compounds.

AB Increasing evidence indicates widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal effluent discharges and surface waters. Studies that characterize the fate and effects of PPCPs in aquatic systems are limited, and to our knowledge, data regarding pharmaceutical accumulation in fish of effluent-dominated ecosystems have not been previously reported. In the present study, fish populations were sampled from a reference stream and an effluent-dominated stream in north Texas, USA. Lepomis macrochirus, Ictalurus punctatus, Cyprinus carpio, and Pontoxis nigromaculatus were killed; the liver, brain, and lateral filet tissues dissected; and the tissues stored at -80degreesC until analysis. Fish tissues were extracted using solid-phase extraction and then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the negative chemical ionization mode. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline and the SSRI metabolites norfluoxetine and desmethylsertraline were detected at levels greater than 0.1 ng/g in all tissues examined from fish residing in a municipal effluent-dominated stream. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of SSRI residues in fish residing within municipal effluent-dominated systems.

AB Naproxen is an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that has been detected in natural and engineered aquatic environments. The primary aim of this research was to study chemical transformations of naproxen following chlorine oxidation, which is common in water and wastewater treatment systems. Synthetic waters containing elevated concentrations of naproxen were oxidized by free chlorine at naproxen:chlorine molar ratios of 0.02-3:1 and pH values of 5-9. The formation of naproxen products was dependent on pH, chlorine dosage and contact time. This study demonstrates that naproxen readily reacts with free chlorine and forms disinfection products. The formation of specific reaction products can vary depending on the characteristics of the water or wastewater and treatment operating conditions. More research is needed to identify intermediate and chemical reaction end products and to understand the reaction kinetics of naproxen chlorination for a range of water and wastewater treatment conditions. A secondary aim of this research was to study effects of naproxen and its chlorination products on biofilm processes, which are common in water and wastewater treatment systems and natural aquatic environments. A bioreactor was fed a naproxen solution and then fed a solution at the same naproxen concentration following contact with free chlorine. Results indicate that naproxen was not degraded biologically for the conditions of this study. In contrast, the naproxen solution containing products of chlorination caused an adverse response by discharging biomass from the bioreactor. Results therefore demonstrate that naproxen products of chlorination can adversely affect a biofilm process, which potentially can impact the performance of biofilm processes in natural and engineered aquatic environments. More research is needed to study naproxen chlorination reactions at low concentrations and in complex matrices, and to understand the toxicological relevance of naproxen and its products of chlorination in natural and engineered aquatic environments.

AB In hospitals a large variety of substances are in use for medical purposes such as diagnostics and research. After application, diagnostic agents, disinfectants and excreted non-metabolized pharmaceuticals by patients, reach the wastewater. This form of elimination may generate risks for aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to present: (i) the steps of an ecological risk assessment and management framework related to hospital effluents evacuating into wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) without preliminary treatment; and (ii) the results of its application on wastewater from an infectious and tropical diseases department of a hospital of a large city in southeastern France. The characterization of effects has been made under two assumptions, which were related to: (a) the effects of hospital wastewater on biological treatment process of WWTP, particularly on the community of organisms in charge of the biological decomposition of the organic matter; (b) the effects on aquatic organisms. COD and BOD5 have been measured for studying global organic pollution. Assessment of halogenated organic compounds was made using halogenated organic compounds absorbable on activated carbon (AOX) concentrations. Heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chrome, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc) were measured. Low most probable number (MPP) for faecal coliforms, has been considered as an indirect detection of antibiotics and disinfectants presence. For toxicity assessment, bioluminescence assay using Vibrio fischeri photobacteria, 72-h EC50 algae growth Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and 24-h EC50 on Daphnia magna were used. The scenario allows to a semi-quantitative risk characterization. It needs to be improved on some aspects, particularly those linked to: long term toxicity assessment on target organisms (bioaccumulation of pollutants, genotoxicity, etc.); ecotoxicological interactions between pharmaceuticals, disinfectants used both in diagnostics and in cleaning of surfaces, and detergents used in cleaning of surfaces; the interactions into the sewage network, between the hospital effluents and the aquatic ecosystem.

AB The yeast toxicity test (YTT), based on the inhibition of saccharose fermentation by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was evaluated using standard toxicants (copper sulphate, formaldehyde, sodium nitrite, sodium sulphite, phenol and zinc sulphate). Repeated measurements of YTT accuracy with the standard toxicants showed EC50 values characterized by low standard deviation and coefficient of variation (7.62%). Moreover, the YTT was compared to standard prokaryotic biotests by estimating the toxicity of wastewater from pharmaceutical sources. The toxicity of wastewaters measured by YTT agrees sufficiently with those measured by standard methods of the determination of toxicity such as inhibition of bioluminescence, TTC-dehydrogenase activity, aerobic bacterial growth and anaerobic sludge biogas production. The YTT is a rapid, simple, reliable, sensitive and cost-effective method for presumptive estimations of the toxicity of wastewaters, which could be performed in laboratory as well as in field conditions.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of emerging contaminants whose fate in the wastewater treatment process has received increasing attention in past years. Acidic pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and diclofenac), caffeine, and the antibacterial triclosan were quantified at four different steps of wastewater treatment from three urban wastewater treatment plants. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples on Waters Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid-phase extraction columns, silylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the chemicals studied, it was found that the majority of the influent load was removed during secondary treatment (51-99%), yielding expected surface water concentrations of 13 to 56 ng/L.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ratio between COD and biomass (SO/Xo) on inert COD fraction in pharmaceutical wastewaters under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In this concept, wastewater diluted to 2000 mg.L-1 with the same initial COD and biomass concentration of 50 mg.L-1 were treated in batch reactors to determine the inert COD fraction. The pharmaceutical wastewater consists of a lot of volatile organic compounds, and high concentrations of COD may inhibit particularly the aerobic systems. The aerobic and anaerobic batch runs were operated for 37 days and 86 days, respectively [1]. The results of the aerobic inert COD experiment indicated that the biological removal was only 19%, and 81% of the initial COD level has been removed by air stripping. The anaerobic experiments were carried out at five different S-0/X-0 ratios and an efficiency of 88 % could be provided. It was seen that increasing S-0/X-0 ratios did not change the soluble inert COD (SI). Some unexpected peaks could be observed in raw wastewater, possibly originating from additive effects of particular wastewater fractions increasing COD by degradation or destroyed cell material. Additionally, the concentrations of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and their behavior in the inert systems were analyzed and discussed.

AB Antibiotics are frequently used in the United States as feed efficiency promoters and medicines for livestock that is destined for human consumption. These antibiotics are released into the environment through the runoff and wastewater streams from animal feedlots and land applications of manure. The exposure of microorganisms to these antibiotics has reportedly resulted in the development of resistant species of microorganisms, which in turn can lead to human health hazards. Phytoremediation of these antibiotics can be a useful tool for countering this problem. Aquatic plants, Myriophyllum aquaticum (parrot feather) and Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), were used for studying phytoremediation of tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from aqueous media. TC and OTC are two of the most commonly used tetracyclines in veterinary medicine. M. aquaticum and P. stratiotes gave high antibiotic modification rates of both antibiotics. Kinetic analyses dismiss direct enzyme catalysis; the modification rates decreased with increasing OTC concentrations. Sterile, cell-free root exudates (filtered through 0.2 mu m membranes) from both species also exhibited comparable antibiotic modification rates. The involvement of root-secreted metabolites in antibiotic modification is suggested. The changes in the UV absorbance spectra of OTC during treatment with the root exudates confirmed the modification.

AB Aims: To investigate whether two different wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) - treating the same pharmaceutical influent - select for a different bacterial and/ or ammonia oxidizing bacterial ( AOB) community.
   Methods and Results: Molecular fingerprinting demonstrated that each WWTP had its own total bacterial and AOB community structure, but Nitrosomonas eutropha and N. europea were dominant in both WWTP A and B. The DNA and RNA analysis of the AOB communities revealed different patterns; so the most abundant species may not necessarily be the most active ones. Nitritation failures, monitored by chemical parameter analysis, were reflected as AOB community shifts and visualized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE)- based moving window analysis.
   Conclusions: This research demonstrated the link between functional performance ( nitritation parameters) and the presence and activity of a specific microbial ecology ( AOB). Clustering and moving window analysis based on DGGE showed to be valuable to monitor community shifts in both WWTPs.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study of specific community shifts together with functional parameter analysis has potential as a tool for relating functional instability ( such as operational failures) to specific-bacterial community shifts.

AB Land application systems, also referred to as beneficial reuse systems, are engineered systems that have defined and permitted application areas based on site and waste characteristics to determine the land area size requirement. These terrestrial systems have orders of magnitude greater microbial capability and residence time to achieve decomposition and assimilation compared with aquatic systems. In this paper we focus on current information and information needs related to terrestrial fate pathways in land treatment systems. Attention is given to conventional organic chemicals as well as new estrogenic and pharmaceutical chemicals of commerce. Specific terrestrial fate pathways addressed include: decomposition, bound residue formation, leaching, runoff, and crop uptake. Molecular decomposition and formation of bound residues provide the basis for the design and regulation of land treatment systems. These mechanisms allow for assimilation of wastes and nondegradation of the environment and accomplish the goal of sustainable land use. Bound residues that are biologically produced are relatively immobile, degrade at rates similar to natural soil materials, and should present a significantly reduced risk to the environment as opposed to parent contaminants. With regard to leaching and runoff pathways, no comprehensive summary or mathematical model of organic chemical migration from land treatment systems has been developed. For the crop uptake pathway, a critical need exists to develop information for nonagricultural chemicals and to address full-scale performance and monitoring at more land application sites. The limited technology choices for treatment of biosolids, liquids, and other wastes implies that acceptance of some risks and occurrence of some benefits will continue to characterize land application practices that contribute directly to the goal of beneficial reuse and sustainability.

AB Each year, large quantities of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are used worldwide. Once conveyed to wastewater treatment plants, PPCPs can remain unchanged or undergo partial or complete transformation during wastewater treatment processes before discharge into the environment via effluent and biosolids for land application. Biosolids can be a major sink for some PPCPs. Previous investigations have indicated that land application of biosolids may be a potential important route through which PPCPs enter the environment. However, no information is available on exactly how closely the concentrations of PPCPs in the environmental media are related to the land application of PPCP-containing biosolids. This paper reviews currently available information on the occurrence of PPCPs in biosolids, methods of analysis, the potential fate of PPCPs in biosolids-applied soils, and composting as a potential means for removal of PPCPs from biosolids.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCPs) in biosolids generated during municipal wastewater treatment (WWTP) was monitored weekly for 19 weeks. Biosolids samples obtained from a local WWTP were subjected to extraction with Soxhlet(R) apparatus for 24 hours. The extracts were concentrated and analyzed with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. There were 18 compounds representing a wide range of origins identified in biosolids including phthalate esters, ibuprofen and galaxolide. Phthalate esters were the most frequently detected compounds; and 4-nonyl phenol was the most concentrated chemical at 210 mg/kg-dry weight basis. The efficacy of the composting process to degrade the 10 of the PPCP compounds was also investigated with and without spiking biosolids. Biosolids were amended with straw, and composted for up to 45 days using a laboratory-scale composting system. The lowest degradation rate was observed for 50.11% for octyl-4-methoxy cinnamate (OM) and the highest was 99.73% for butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT). For all tested compounds except for unspiked OM, degradation efficiencies surpassed 85% at the end of the 45 days of composting study. The results of this study confirm the presence of various organic contaminants originated from personal care products in biosolids, and suggest that composting could be an effective treatment alternative for biosolids.

AB Awareness of antibiotics in wastewaters and aquatic ecosystems is growing as investigations into alternate pollutants increase and analytical techniques for detecting these chemicals improve. The presence of three antibiotics (ciproffoxacin, norfloxacin and cephalexin) was evaluated in both sewage effluent and environmental waters downstream from a sewage discharge. Bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor and receiving waters were tested for resistance against six antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin, trimethoprim, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole) and effects of short term exposure (24h) to antibiotics on bacterial denitrification rates were examined. Antibiotics were detected entering the sewage treatment plant with varying levels of removal during the treatment process. Antibiotics were also detected in effluent entering receiving waters and detectable 500m from the source. Among the bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor, resistance was displayed against all six antibiotics tested and bacteria cultured from receiving waters were resistant against two of the antibiotics tested. Rates of denitrification were observed to decrease in response to some antibiotics and not to others, though this was only observed at concentrations exceeding those likely to be found in the environment. Findings from this preliminary research have indicated that antibiotics are entering our aquatic systems and pose a potential threat to ecosystem function and potentially human health.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic environment has become an increasing concern for researchers and regulators in the past decade, and recent research has focused on pharmaceutical contamination from point sources, such as wastewater treatment facility outfalls. As an important initial step we are going to analyze 75 recent publications concerning the information on 12 selected drugs belonging to different groups of pharmaceuticals. Hence we cope with an initial data-matrix of the dimension 12x75. Thus, the object set contains 12 chemicals, the information base IB 75 attributes. This 12x75-data-matrix is evaluated by the Hasse Diagram Technique, a method derived from discrete mathematics. As this initial step leads to a diagram with many incomparabilities a data-reduction method on the attribute side is performed as the second step. Aggregation procedures of the data-matrix will be performed by applying METEOR (Method of Evaluation by Order Theory). Different weighting schemes are performed. In all approaches EES=Estinyl Estradiol is in a maximal position whereas FEN: Fenofibrate is a minimal object. This means that EES is the best scrutinized pharmaceutical and FEN the least analysed one within this information base IB.

AB Pharmaceutical industries in and around Hyderabad produce a wide variety of products using both organic and inorganic substances as raw materials thereby generating a large quantity of complex toxic organic liquid wastes containing high concentrations of inorganic TDS. These wastes are highly toxic to biological life and are usually characterized by high BOD, COD and a high COD:BOD ratio. In the present study an attempt has been made to evaluate the treatability of a bulk drug pharmaceutical wastewater using a lab-scale activated sludge reactor with acclimatized mixed consortia. The application of chemical coagulation as a pretreatment for the removal of sulphates from the effluent was examined with lime as a coagulant to reduce the TDS levels. A 44-48% removal of sulphates was achieved which helped in increasing the efficiency for achieving better biological treatment. The treatability studies with mixed consortia revealed that the acclimatized bacteria were highly effective in treating the waste by achieving a maximum reduction of 86.6% from as high as 4000 mg/l COD concentration. At an HRT of 4.5 days maximum reduction in the COD concentration is found in all the concentrations studied. The biokinetic parameters like Y, K-s, k, mu(max) and k(d) which will be useful to design a prototype activated sludge reactor are evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rejection of emerging trace organics by a variety of commercial reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), and ultra-low-pressure RO (ULPRO) membranes was investigated using TFC-HR, NF-90, NF-200, TFC-SR2, and XLE spiral membrane elements (Koch Membrane Systems, Wilmington, Massachusetts) to simulate operational conditions for drinking-water treatment and wastewater reclamation. In general, the presence of effluent organic matter (EfOM) improved the rejection of ionic organics by tight NF and RO membranes, as compared to a type-II water matrix (adjusted by ionic strength and hardness), likely as a result of a decreased negatively charged membrane surface. Rejection of ionic pharmaceutical residues and pesticides exceeded 95 % by NF-90, XLE, and TFC-HR membranes and was above 89 % for the NF-200 membrane. Hydrophobic nonionic compounds, such as bromoform and chloroform, exhibited a high initial rejection, as a result of both hydrophobic-hydrophobic solute-membrane interactions and steric exclusion, but rejection decreased significantly after 10 hours of operation because of partitioning of solutes through the membranes. This resulted in a partial removal of disinfection byproducts by the RO membrane TFC-HR. In a type-II water matrix, the effect of increasing feed water recoveries on rejection of hydrophilic ionic and nonionic compounds was compound-dependent and not consistent for different membranes. The presence of EfOM, however, could neutralize the effect of hydrodynamic operating condition on rejection performance. The ULPRO and tight NF membranes were operated at lower feed pressure, as compared to the TFC-HR, and provided a product water quality similar to a conventional RO membrane, regarding trace organics of interest.

AB Micropollutants as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) or pharmaceuticals are of increased interest in water pollution control. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are relevant point sources for residues of these compounds in the aquatic environment. The solids retention time (SRT) is one important parameter for the design of WWTPs, relating to growth rate of microorganisms and to effluent concentrations. If a specific substance is degraded in dependency on the SRT, a critical value for the sludge age can be determined. In WWTPs operating SRTs below this critical value, effluent concentrations in the range of influent concentrations or a distribution according to the adsorption equilibrium have to be expected, whereas in WWTPs operating at SRTs higher than the critical value degradation will occur. Critical SRTs were determined for different micropollutants, indicating that the design criteria based on the sludge age allows an estimation of emissions. Different treatment technologies as conventional activated sludge systems and a membrane bioreactor were considered and no significant differences in the treatment efficiency were detected when operated at comparable SRT. The results of the investigations lead to the conclusion that low effluent concentrations can be achieved in WWTPs operating SRTs higher than 10 days (referred to a temperature of 10degreesC). This corresponds to the requirements for WWTPs situated in sensitive areas according to the urban wastewater directive of the European Community (91/271/EEC) in moderate climatic zones.

AB The behaviour of nine pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) of different diagnostic groups is studied during a nitrifying-denitrifying process in an activated sludge system. The compounds selected cover a wide range of frequently used substances such as anti-epileptics (carbamazepine), tranquillisers (diazepam), anti-depressants (fluoxetine and citalopram), anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac) and estrogens (estradiol and ethinylestradiol). The main objective of this research is to investigate the effect of acclimation of biomass on the removal rates of these compounds, either by maintaining a high sludge retention time or at long-term operation. The removal rates achieved for nitrogen and carbon in the experimental unit exceed 90% and were not affected by the addition of PhACs. Carbamazepine, diazepam and diclofenac were only removed to a small extent. On the other hand, higher removal rates have been observed for naproxen and ibuprofen (68% and 82%), respectively.

AB Thirteen pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds have been surveyed along the different units of a municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) to study their fate across each step and the overall removal efficiency. The STP studied corresponds to a population of approximately 100,000 inhabitants located in Galicia (northwest Spain), including three main sections: pre-treatment (coarse and fine screening, grit and fat removal); primary treatment (sedimentation tanks); and secondary treatment (conventional activated sludge). Among all the substances considered (galaxolide, tonalide, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, estrone, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, roxitromycin, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide), only significant concentrations were found for two musks (galaxolide and tonalide), two antiphlogistics (ibuprofen and naproxen), two natural estrogens (estrone, estradiol), one antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) and the X-ray contrast media (iopromide), being the other compounds below the quantification level. In the primary treatment, only the fragrances were partly removed, with efficiencies of 20-50% for galaxolide and tonalide. However, the aerobic treatment caused an important reduction in all compounds detected, between 35 and 75%, with the exception of iopromide. The overall removal efficiency of the STP ranged between 70 and 90% for the fragrances, 45 and 70% for the acidic compounds, around 67% for estradiol and 57% for the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole.

AB Chemical pre-treatment of synthetic Procaine Penicillin G (PPG) effluent with ozone (applied dose = 1440 mg/h; treatment duration = 60 min) at pH = 7 was investigated. Successive biological treatability studies were performed with raw, ozonated penicillin formulation effluent and synthetic readily biodegradable substrate as simulated domestic wastewater. The PPG effluent additions were adjusted to constitute approximately 30% of the total COD in the reactor. Ozonation of PPG effluent resulted in practically complete removal of the parent pollutant accompanied by 40% COD abatement. Speaking for the raw PPG effluent, prolonged acclimation periods were necessary to obtain significant COD removal efficiencies. Batch activated sludge treatment experiments and respirometric studies have demonstrated that the selection of true retention time is extremely crucial for having high amount of slowly hydrolysable substrate or complex wastewater, like pharmaceutical effluent. The effect of ozonation time on biological treatability performance of PPG has been evaluated in the study. Pre-ozonation of PPG effluent did not improve its ultimate biodegradability.

ID AIRLIFT REACTOR; SLUDGE
AB Aerobic granulation seems to be an a attractive process for COD removal from industrial wastewater, characterised by a high content of soluble organic compounds. In order to evaluate the practical aspects of the process, comparative experimental tests are performed on synthetic and on industrial wastewater, originating from pharmaceutical industry. Two pilot plants are operated as sequencing batch bubble columns. Focus was put on the feasibility of the process for high COD removal and on its operational procedure. For both wastewaters, a rapid formation of aerobic granules is observed along with a high COD removal rate. Granule characteristics are quite similar with respect to the two types of wastewater. It seems that filamentous bacteria are part of the granule structure and that phosphorus precipitation can play an important role in granule formation. For both wastewaters similar removal V performances for dissolved biodegradable COD are observed (> 95%). However, a relatively high concentration of suspended solids in the outlet deteriorates the performance with regard to total COD removal. Biomass detachment seems to play a non-negligible role in the current set-up. After a stable operational phase the variation of the pharmaceutical wastewater caused a destabilisation and loss of the granules, despite the control for balanced nutrient supply. The first results with real industrial wastewater demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative process. However, special attention has to be paid to the critical aspects such as granule stability as well as the economic competitiveness, which both will need further investigation and evaluation.

AB Two configurations of membrane bioreactors, were identified to achieve enhanced biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal, and assessed over more than two years with two parallel pilot plants of 2 m(3) each. Both configurations included an anaerobic zone ahead of the biological reactor, and differed by the position of the anoxic zone: standard pre-denitrification, or post-denitrification without dosing of carbon source. Both configurations achieved improved phosphorus removal. The goal of 50 mu gP/L in the effluent could be consistently achieved with two types of municipal wastewater, the second site requiring a low dose of ferric salt ferric salt < 3 mgFe/L. The full potential of biological phosphorus removal could be demonstrated during phosphate spiking trials, where up to 1 mg of phosphorus was biologically eliminated for 10 mg BOD5 in the influent. The post-denitrification configuration enabled a very good elimination of nitrogen. Daily nitrate concentration as low as 1 mgN/L could be monitored in the effluent in some periods. The denitrification rates, greater than those expected for endogenous denitrification, could be accounted for by the use of the glycogene pool, internally stored by the denitrifying microorganisms in the anaerobic zone. Pharmaceuticals residues and steroids were regularly monitored on the two parallel MBR pilot plants during the length of the trials, and compared with the performance of the Berlin-Ruhleben WWTP. Although some compounds such as carbamazepine were persistent through all the systems, most of the compounds could be better removed by the MBR plants. The influence of temperature, sludge age and compound concentration could be shown, as well as the significance of biological mechanisms in the removal of trace organic compounds.

AB In the present study, oxidative pre-treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater originating from the formulation of the penicillin Sultamycillin Tosylate Diydrate via ozonation at varying pH and ozone feed rates was investigated. Biological treatability studies were performed with a synthetic wastewater alone and supplemented with raw and ozonated penicillin formulation effluents. The highest COD (34%) and TOC (24%) removal efficiencies were obtained at pH 11.0, whereas the BOD5 value increased from 16 mg l(-1) to 128 mg l(-1) after 40 min of ozonation, corresponding to an applied ozone dose of 1670 mg l(-1) and 33% relative ozone absorption. The studies showed that no degradation of raw penicillin fraction (30% of total COD) occurred, and degradation of the synthetic wastewater being completely treatable without penicillin addition, was inhibited by 7%. Upon 40 min ozonation, the synthetic wastewater could be completely oxidized and at the same time 35% of ozonated penicillin wastewater removal was obtained. Respirometric studies were conducted in parallel and produced results indicating a 22% decrease in the total oxygen consumption rate established for raw penicillin formulation effluent compared to the results obtained from the aerobic batch reactor. No inhibition of the synthetic fraction was observed for the 40 min-ozonated penicillin formulation effluent, biodegradability of the 60 min-ozonated penicillin effluent decreased possibly due to recalcitrant oxidation product accumulation. The modeling study provided experimental support and information on inhibition kinetics in activated sludge model no. 3 (ASM3) by means of respirometric tests for the first time.

AB GUMS-screening analyses of water samples from the Lippe River, Germany, revealed the presence of a wide spectrum of low-molecular weight organic compounds ranging from non-polar constituents like aliphatic hydrocarbons to polar constituents like n-carboxylic acids and phenols. Most of the identified compounds could be attributed to anthropogenic input and are used as plasticizers, flame retardants, pharmaceutical drugs or fragrances. Some of them had rarely been noticed as organic pollutants of aquatic environments before. These are, among others, 9-methylacridine, the plasticizer 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentandioldiisobutyrate (TXIB), the surfactant 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (TMDD), triphenylphosphinoxide and the flame retardant tris(chloropropyl)phosphate. On the other hand, most of the identified trialkyl phosphates, pharmaceutical drugs and synthetic fragrances have been reported in surface waters by several authors so far.
   Input pathways of the detected compounds were traced back by sampling various input sources of organic matter such as discharges of wastewater and Lippe River tributaries. Several contaminants were ubiquitous in Lippe River water and also occurred in sewage effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant and in samples from the tributaries. This observation suggests that they are typical sewage derived contaminants and have the potential to be used as anthropogenic molecular markers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A method for determination of antibiotics in hospital sewage water has been developed and validated. Analogue internal standards for fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporines), nitroimidazoles and tetracyclines were successfully used for calibration and shown to generally improve precision compared to external calibration. Matrix components caused ion suppression/enhancement effects during the MS detection for all analytes studied. Two effects were observed: general suppression and short-term variations in the MS response.
   In the hospital sewage water large temporal variations in the analyte concentration were observed during the course of the sampling period (seven grab samples in 13 h). Analyte concentrations varied within the following ranges (in mug l(-1)): ciprofloxacin, 3.6-101.0; metronidazole, 0.1-90.2; sulfamethoxazole, 0.4-12.8; ofloxacin, 0.2-7.6; trimethoprim, 0.6-7.6; and doxycycline, 0.6-6.7.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate both acute and chronic effects of clofibrate and clofibric acid on the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) of the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). AChE. commonly used as a biomarker of neurotoxicity, was determined in the total head. LDH, an important enzyme of anaerobic metabolism, was quantified in dorsal muscle, and CAT, enzyme which has been used as indicative parameter of peroxisome proliferation, was determined in the liver. Furthermore, alterations of body and liver weight were also deter-mined, through the calculation of the ratios final body weight/initial body weight, liver weight/final body weight, liver weight/gills weight and liver weight/head weight. Acute exposure of G. holbrooki to both clofibrate and clofibric acid induced a decrease in liver CAT activity, an increase in muscle LDH activity, while no effects were observed on AChE activity. However, chronic exposure did not alter significantly the enzymatic activities, suggesting reduced or null effects over these pathways, relative to effects reported in other species. No effects were observed for the calculated ratios, except a significant weight reduction for males chronically exposed to clofibrate. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As high quality drinking water becomes scarcer, unintentional indirect potable water reuse, where wastewater effluent is used as a part of a downstream drinking water source, has become a great concern throughout the world. In this case, a variety of organic micro-pollutants contained in wastewater effluent Could create problems. High pressure-driven membranes such as nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) might be a powerful option to deal with such micro-pollutants, however, a lack of information on their performance is apparent. This study examined the ability of RO membranes to retain neutral (uncharged) endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). A total of 11 compounds were chosen so that a certain range of molecular weights and octanol-water distribution coefficients (K-ow) could be studied. With respect to membranes, two different materials (polyamide and cellulose acetate) were examined. Generally, the polyamide membrane exhibited a better performance in terms of the rejection of the selected compounds but the retention was not complete (57-91%). It was found that salt rejection or molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) that are often used to characterize membrane rejection properties did not provide quantitative information in terms of EDCs/PhACs rejection by NF/RO membranes. Molecular weight of the tested compounds could generally indicate the tendency of rejection for the polyamide membranes (size exclusion dominated the retention by the polyamide membrane) while polarity was better able to describe the retention trend of the tested compounds by the cellulose acetate membrane. The results obtained in this study imply that each membrane polymer material for NF/RO membranes, including ones that will be newly developed in the future, Would exhibit different trends in terms of rejection of organic micro-pollutants, which is determined by physico-chemical properties of the compounds.

AB Recent occurrences of pharmaceutical antibiotics in surface water, drinking water, and wastewater systems have gained significant attention due to their potential threats to human health. This study determined the absolute second-order rate constants of ozone with two amine-based antibiotics, namely, lincomycin and spectinomycin, using the stopped-flow technique under controlled ionic strength, buffer, and temperature. Results indicate that ozone reacts quickly with the selected antibiotics, and the reaction rate significantly depends on solution pH. For lincomycin, ozone attacks its free amine group and sulfur group with absolute rate constants of 2.76 x 10(6) M-1.s(-1) (for neutral form) and 3.26 x 10(5) M-1.s(-1) (for monoprotonated form), respectively. For spectinomycin, ozone attacks two free amine groups with absolute rate constants of 1.27 x 10(6) M-1.s(-1) (for neutral form) and 3.30 x 10(5) M-1.s(-1) (for monoprotonated form), respectively. These rate constants have been corrected to zero ionic strength. Protonated amine is nonreactive toward ozone. Model prediction indicates that lincomycin and spectinomycin can be effectively transformed by ozonation processes around neutral pH.

AB Wastewater from defect sewers can affect groundwater quality. An assessment of this environmental impact for a city of 50 000 inhabitants (Rastatt, SW Germany) was done using marker species distributions, condition monitoring of the sewer network, lab-scale analogy experiments, and specifically instrumented in-situ test sites near defect sewers. The studies revealed elevated concentrations of iodated X-ray contrast media (up to 360 ng/L amidotrizoic acid) and boron concentrations in the urban groundwater which are directly related to leaky sewers. Other common pharmaceuticals could not be detected in the groundwater. Observation wells were installed based on the information from a sewer defect database. These wells focusing on specific sewer leakages show significant changes in groundwater quality parameters.

AB In recent years growing attention has been paid toward the discharge, presence and potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Using different existing analytical methods several studies have already identified a variety of drugs in waste-, surface- and drinking water. The monitoring of surface waters for drugs is of great importance because drugs are designed to be biological very active substances. A capillary LC/ES-MS-MS method has been developed that enables the sensitive and specific detection of diazepam in water samples up to 0.1 ng/ml (LOD). It requires neither multiple extraction steps, nor the use of large volumes of organic solvent. Applying this assay we have detected diazepam in 'in/effluent samples' collected in Belgium and demonstrated the applicability for water analysis without off-line pre-concentration of the analyte.

AB The ecotoxicity of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been evaluated using acute Daphnia and algal tests. Toxicities were relatively low, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values obtained using Daphnia in the range from 68 to 166 mg L-1 and from 72 to 626 mg L-1 in the algal test. Acute effects of these substances seem to be quite improbable. The quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approach showed that all substances act by nonpolar narcosis; thus, the higher the n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (log K-ow) of the substances. the higher is their toxicity. Mixture toxicity of the compounds could be accurately predicted using the concept of concentration addition. Toxicity of the mixture was considerable, even at concentrations at which the single substances showed no or only very slight effects, with some deviations in the Daphnia test, which could be explained by incompatibility of the very steep dose-response curves and the probit analysis of the data. Because pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment occur usually as Mixtures, an accurate prediction of the mixture toxicity is indispensable for environmental risk assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX)-a member of the sulfonamide antibacterial class-has been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water bodies in recent years. Kinetics, mechanisms, and products of SMX in reactions with free chlorine (HOCl/OCl-) were studied in detail to evaluate the effect of chlorination processes on the fate of sulfonamides in municipal wastewaters and affected drinking waters. Direct reactions of free available chlorine (FAC) with SMX were quite rapid. A half-life of 23 s was measured under pseudo-first-order conditions ([FAC](0) = 20 AM (1.4 mg/L) and [SMX](0) = 2 muM) at pH 7 and 25 degreesC in buffered reagent water. In contrast, a half-life of 38 h was determined for reactions with combined chlorine (NH2Cl, NHCl2) under similar conditions. Free chlorine reaction rates were first-order in both substrate and oxidant, with specific second-order rate constants of 1.1 x 10(3) and 2.4 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) for SMX neutral and anionic species, respectively. Investigations with substructure model compounds and identification of reaction products verified that chlorine directly attacks the SMX aniline-nitrogen, resulting in (i) halogenation of the SIVIX aniline moiety to yield a ring-chlorinated product at sub-stoichiometric FAC concentrations (i.e., [FAC](0):[SMX](0) less than or equal to 1) or (ii) rupture of the SMX sulfonamide moiety in the presence of stoichiometric excess of FAC to yield 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, SO42- (via SO2), and N-chloro-p-benzoquinoneimine. Reaction ii represents an unexpected aromatic amine chlorination mechanism that has not previously been evaluated in great detail. Experiments conducted in wastewater and drinking water matrixes appeared to validate measured reaction kinetics for SMX, indicating that SMX and likely other sulfonamide antibacterials should generally undergo substantial transformation during disinfection of such waters with free chlorine residuals.

AB Antibiotic formulation effluent is well known for its important contribution to environmental pollution due to its fluctuating and recalcitrant nature. In the present study, the chemical treatability of penicillin formulation effluent (average filtered CODo = 830 mg/l; average soluble CODo = 615 mg/l; pH(o) = 6.9) bearing the active substances penicillin Amoxicillin Trihydrate (C16H19N3O5S . 3H(2)O) and the P-lactamase inhibitor Potassium Clavulanate (C8H8KNO5) has been investigated. For this purpose, the penicillin formulation effluent was subjected to ozonation (applied ozone dose = 2500 mg/(1 x h)) at varying pH (2.5-12.0) and O-3 + H2O2 (perozonation) at different initial H2O2 concentrations (= 2-40 mM) and pH 10.5. According to the experimental results, the overall Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiency varied between 10 and 56% for ozonation and 30% (no H2O2) and 83% (20 mM H2O2) for the O-3 + H2O2 process. The addition of H2O2 improved the COD removal rates considerably even at the lowest studied H2O2 concentration. An optimum H2O2 concentration of 20 mM existed at which the highest COD removal efficiency and abatement kinetics were obtained. The ozone absorption rate ranged between 53% (ozonation) and 68% (perozonation). An ozone input of 800 mg/l in 20 min was sufficient to achieve the highest BOD5/COD (biodegradability) ratio (=0.45) and BOD5 value (109 mg/l) for the pre-treated penicillin formulation effluent. After the establishment of optimum ozonation and perozonation conditions, mixtures of synthetic domestic wastewater+raw, ozonated and perozonated penicillin formulation effluent were subjected to biological activated sludge treatment at a food-to-microorganisms (F/M) ratio of 0.23 mg COD/(mg MLSS x d), using a consortium of acclimated microorganisms. COD removal efficiencies of the activated sludge process were 71, 81 and 72% for pharmaceutical wastewater containing synthetic domestic wastewater mixed with either raw, ozonated or perozonated formulation effluent, respectively. The ultimate COD value obtained after 24-h biotreatment of the synthetic domestic wastewater+pre-ozonated formulation effluent mixture was around 100 mg/l instead of 180 mg/l which was the final COD obtained for the wastewater mixture containing raw formulation effluent, indicating that pre-ozonation at least partially removed the non-biodegradable COD fraction of the formulation effluent.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are omnipresent in wastewater world-wide. In order to predict their sorption quantities onto sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d values) of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, estrogens, lipid regulators, anti-epileptic and cytostatic agents) and polycyclic musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) were determined in primary and secondary sludges taken from a German municipal WWTP. For the K-d determination, batches of primary and secondary sludge slurries were spiked with the respective target compounds and slowly stirred under defined conditions (e.g. an argon atmosphere). Finally, the water and solid sludge phases were analysed. The K-d values of pharmaceuticals ranged from < 1 to 500 L kg(-1), while those for the polycyclic musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB proved to be up to 5300 and 4900 L kg(-1), respectively. The primary and secondary sludge showed significant differences for some pharmaceuticals such as Diclofenac and Cyclophosphamide due to the different pH and composition of the two sludges. The removal rate from the water phase caused by sorption in a WWTP can be reasonably predicted on the basis of the Kd values. (C)(C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters of the US and Europe, originating largely from two sources, sewage effluent and agricultural runoff. These compounds often occur as mixtures leading to potential combined effects. In order to investigate the effects of a realistic pharmaceutical mixture on an ecosystem, a study utilizing 15 of 12,000 L aquatic microcosms treated with eight common pharmaceuticals (atorvastatin, acetaminophen, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, levofloxacin, sertraline, and trimethoprim) at total (summed) molar concentrations of 0, 0.044, 0.608, 2.664, and 24.538 mumol/L (n = 3) was conducted. Phytotoxicity was assessed on a variety of somatic and pigment endpoints in rooted (Myriophyllum sibiricum) and floating (Lemna gibba) macrophytes over a 35-day period. EC10, EC25 and EC50 values were calculated for each endpoint exhibiting a concentration-dependent response. Generally, M. sibiricum and L. gibba displayed similar sensitivity to the pharmaceutical mixture, with phytotoxic injury evident in both species, which was concentration dependent. Through single compound 7-day daily static renewal toxicity tests with L. gibba, the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin and the blood lipid regulator atorvastatin were found to be the only compounds to elicit phytotoxic effects in the concentration range utilized (0-1000 mug/L). Atorvastatin concentration was highly correlated to decreased pigment content in L. gibba, likely inhibiting the known target enzyme HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Hazard quotients were calculated for both microcosm and laboratory studies; the highest HQ values were 0.235 (L. gibba) and 0.051 (L. gibba), which are below the threshold value of I for chronic risks. The microcosm data suggest that at an ecological effect size of >20%, biologically significant risks are low for L. gibba and M. sibiricum exposed to similar mixtures of pharmaceutical compounds. For M. sibiricum and L. gibba, respective minimum differences of 5 and 1%, were detectable, however, these effect sizes are not considered ecologically significant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates the separation process of two estrogenic hormones, estrone and estradiol, using eight commercial NF and low pressure RO membranes. The results indicate that the separation mechanism of estrone and estradiol in membrane filtration processes is similar. While estrogenic hormone retention by more porous membranes decreases with decreasing adsorption and the subsequent retention is relatively low, tighter NF and RO membranes can retain estrogenic hormones effectively. It appears that the presence of organic matter in solution can enhance retention due to the interaction of such substances with estrogenic hormones. The results also suggest that physicochemical interactions within the membrane can play an important role. There is no cross-flow velocity effect on retention, whereas an increase in transmembrane pressure may lead to a decrease in steroid hormones retention for some membranes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Samples were collected from two stormwater canals and a recreational urban waterway known as Bayou St. John in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA and analyzed for a range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Concentrations of 7 PPCPs and EDCs were measured by a method that provides for simultaneous extraction and quantification of the following compounds: clofibric acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, fluoxetine, clorophene, triclosan, bisphenol A. The method also was used as an indicator of the occurrence of estrogenic compounds by targeting estrone and 17beta-estradiol. The two canals (Orleans and London) are used to drain a portion of the city's stormwater directly into the Mississippi River or Lake Pontchartrain. Bayou St. John is located between the two canals and supplied with water from Lake Pontchartrain. Results from the 6-month sampling period indicated the following concentration ranges for the two stormwater canals: naproxen (ND - 145 ng/l), ibuprofen (ND - 674 ng/l), triclosan (ND - 29 ng/l) and bisphenol A (1.9-158 ng/l). Concentrations of these target analytes increased with cumulative rainfall. For bayou waters, only naproxen (2.1-4.8 ng/l) and bisphenol A (0.9-44 ng/l) were detected. Estrone was detected but determined non-quantifiable for multiple sampling events at the 3 sites. None of the other target analytes (clofibric acid, fluoxetine, clorophene, and 17beta-estradiol) were detected above their method detection levels. Results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of PPCPs and EDCs in New Orleans stormwater canals and Bayou St. John. Results also demonstrate the use of this analytical technique as an indicator of non-point source sewage contamination in New Orleans stormwater canals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 12 selected pharmaceutical compounds and pharmaceutical compound metabolites in sewage treatment works (STW) effluents and surface waters was investigated. The substances selected for the monitoring programme were identified by a risk ranking procedure to identify those substances with the greatest potential to pose a risk to the aquatic environment. STW final effluent and surface water samples were collected from Corby, Great Billing, East Hyde, Harpenden and Ryemeads STWs. Ten of the 12 pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the STW effluent samples: propranolol (100%, median = 76 ng/l), diclofenac (86%, median = 424 ng/l), ibuprofen (84%, median = 3086 ng/l), mefenamic acid (81%, median = 133 ng/l), dextropropoxyphene (74%, median= 195 ng/l), trimethoprim (65%, 70 ng/l), erythromycin (44%, <10 ng/l), acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (33%, median = <50 ng/l), sulfamethoxazole (9%, median = <50 ng/l), tamoxifen (4%, median = <10 ng/l). In the corresponding receiving streams, fewer compounds and lower concentrations were found: propranolol (87%, median = 29 ng/l), ibuprofen (69%, median = 826 ng/l), mefenamic acid (60%, median = 62 ng/l), dextropropoxyphene (53%, median = 58 ng/l), diclofenac (47%, median = <20 ng/l), erythromycin (38%, median = <10 ng/l), trimethoprim, (38%, median = <10 ng/l), acetyl sulfamethoxazole (38%, median = <50 ng/l). Four human pharmaceutical compounds were detected in samples upstream of the STWs sampled: ibuprofen (57%, median = 181 ng/l), trimethoprim (36%, median <10 ng/l), erythromycin (17%, median = <10 ng/l), propranolol (14%, median = <10 ng/l), suggesting that longer range stream transport of some compounds is possible.
   The particular STW that was sampled and the month that it was sampled significantly influenced the measured concentrations of several, but not all, substances. There was no significant relationship between usage data and the overall frequency with which different substances were detected. There was however, some evidence to suggest that usage data are positively associated with concentrations of pharmaceuticals in effluent and, particularly, with concentrations measured in surface waters below STWs.
   These results suggest that most sewage treatment works in England and Wales are likely to be routinely discharging small quantities of pharmaceuticals into UK rivers. None of the pharmaceuticals were found at concentrations that were high enough to cause acute toxic impacts to aquatic organisms. However, insufficient data were available to be able to comment on whether the concentrations measured have the potential to result in more subtle long-term effects on aquatic organisms (e.g. effects on growth, ability to reproduce).

AB The purpose of the research presented in this paper was twofold: (1) to demonstrate the coupling of two state-of-the-art techniques: a time-weighted polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and microliquid chromatography-electrospray/ion-trap mass spectrometry and (2) to assess the ability of these methodologies to detect six drugs (azithromycin, fluoxetine, omeprazole, levothyroxine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) in a real-world environment, e.g., waste water effluent. In the effluent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), azithromycin was detected at concentrations ranging from 15 to 66 ng/L, which is equivalent to a total annual release of 1 to 4 kg into receiving waters. Detected and confirmed in the effluent from two WWTPs were two illicit drugs, methamphetamine and MDMA, at 2 and 0.5 ng/L, respectively. Although the ecotoxicologic significance of drugs in environmental matrices, particularly water, has not been closely examined, it can only be surmised that these substances have the potential to adversely affect biota that are continuously exposed to them even at very low levels. The potential for chronic effects on human health is also unknown but of increasing concern because of the multiuse character of water, particularly in densely populated, arid areas.

AB Medicinal drugs were found to be ubiquitous in the river Elbe, its tributary the river Saale and in other tributaries at their points of entry into the Elbe. The distribution of concentration peaks along the investigated river stretches provides an indication that they are mainly due to the emission of treated waste water from municipal sewage treatment works. This leads to the conclusion that medicinal substances can be regarded as faecal indicators for water pollution caused by human activity. The main substances found in the Elbe in 1998 were diclofenac, ibuprofen and carbamazepine as well as various antibiotics and lipid regulators in the concentration range of <20-140 ng/l. The more thorough investigations carried out in 1999 and 2000 show that in addition to the drugs (phenazone, isopropyl-phenazone and paracetamol) metabolite concentrations contributed significantly to the total concentration of pharmaceuticals in the Elbe. The metamizole metabolites N-acetyl-4-aminoantipyrine (AAA) and N-formyl-4-aminoantipyrine (FAA) were found in concentrations from <20 to 939 ng/l. A multivariate statistical analysis revealed a high correlation in respect of the distribution of persistent substances. The metoprolol distribution throughout the Saale demonstrated that the tributaries cause either an increase (Weise Elster, Unstrut, Ilm) or a reduction (Wipper, Bode) in the concentration, depending on the respective load of waste water. Wide scale sampling in Saxony during 2002 showed the ubiquitous occurrence of carbamazepine in surface waters. The ecotoxicological effects of this contamination cannot be assessed at present. This is due to the fact that no legal framework in respect of these medicinal drugs for human consumption has been established and therefore little research and no risk assessment has been carried out. Therefore it is urgently necessary to include at least the quantitatively most significant substances in the new assessment concept of the EC White Paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the oxidation of the oral contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) during ozonation. First, the effect of ozone (O-3) on the estrogenic activity of aqueous solutions of EE2 was studied using a yeast estrogen screen (YES). It could be shown that O-3 doses typically applied for the disinfection of drinking waters were sufficient to reduce estrogenicity by a factor of more than 200. However, it proved impossible to completely remove estrogenic activity due to the slow reappearance of 0.1 - 0.2% of the initial EE2 concentration after ozonation. Second, oxidation products formed during ozonation of EE2 were identified with LC-MS/MS and GC/MS and the help of the model compounds 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthol (THN) and 1-ethinyl-1-cyclohexanol (ECH),which represent the reactive phenolic moiety and the ethinyl group of EE2. Additionally, oxidation products of the natural steroid hormones 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were identified. The chemical structures of the oxidation products were significantly altered as compared to the parent compounds, explaining the diminished estrogenic activity after ozonation. Overall, the results demonstrate that ozonation is a promising tool for the control of EE2, E2, and El in drinking water and wastewater.

AB Metabolic products are often more toxic than their pharmacological parent compounds. Therefore, the acute and chronic effects of the main metabolites-salicylic acid (SAL), gentisic acid (GEN), and o-hydroxyhippuric acid (HDP)-of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active ingredient in Aspirin(R) and many other pharmaceuticals, were assessed using standard (Daphnia magna) and autochthonous (Daphnia longispina) cladocerans. The sequence of decreasing levels of acute and chronic toxicity of ASA metabolites to daphnids was GEN > SAL > HDP. HDP did not present acute toxicity, but chronic exposures enabled the production of abnormal neonates and, in particular, egg abortion. Thus, reproduction was the end point most susceptible to HDP. On the other hand, SAL and GEN induced changes in the normal patterns of reproduction and growth of both species. In general, D. longispina was more sensitive than was D. magna, although the population growth of the autochthonous species was superior under SAL exposures than that of the standard test species. Although the concentrations that were determined to have a toxic effect were above the levels detected in aquatic environmental samples, exposure to low levels of pharmacologically active substances for a duration longer than the test period may induce changes in nontarget organisms.

AB The growing concern over the release of pharmaceutically active compounds and personal care products into the environment has prompted the introduction of risk assessment guidelines in both the European Union by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) and in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), details of which are presented herein. Both employ a similar tiered system that compares the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) with the worst-case no effect concentrations estimated from standard toxicity assays. These approaches are compared and contrasted. Results demonstrate room for improvement in areas such as the use of threshold values to trigger investigations, chronic and mechanism specific toxicity screening and mixture toxicity for which possible solutions are proposed.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals, nonylphenol ethoxylate metabolites, and other wastewater-derived contaminants in surface waters is a potential environmental concern, especially since the discovery of contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties. The present study investigated the discharge of emerging contaminants into the Santa Ana River (CA, USA) and their attenuation during river transport and passage through a constructed wetland. Contaminants studied included pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and carbamazepine) and their metabolites, hormones, the metabolites of alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEMs), N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (NBBS), and chlorinated tris-propylphosphates (TCPPs). The APEMs included alkylphenols (APs), short-chain AP polyethoxylates (APEOs), AP polyethoxycarboxylates (APECs), and carboxylated APECs (CAPECs). In wastewater treatment plant effluent, APECs and CAPECs represented the dominant APEM fraction (1.8-18.7 mug/L), whereas APEOs and APs contributed only small amounts to the overall APEM concentrations (0.10-0.92 and less than or equal to 0.1 mug/L, respectively) except where the effluent was infiltrated into soil (5.2 mug/L). In effluents, ibuprofen and its metabolites TCPPs, and NBBS were detected regularly (<0.5 mug/L), and the other pharmaceuticals were detected occasionally. Transport in the Santa Ana River for 11 km resulted in the significant attenuation of all contaminants, from 67% for gemfibrozil to 100% for others. Wetland treatment (residence time, 2-4 d) resulted in partial removal of ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and TCPPs and transformed APEOs to APECs.

AB Occurrences of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water and sewage water have been widely reported. Investigations show the presence of several classes of pharmaceuticals such as antirheumatics (e.g., diclofenac), analgesics (e.g., propyphenazone), and blood lipid regulators (clofibric acid), even in ground water. Compared to their occurrences in surface water, however, the reported incidences of drugs in ground water are much rarer. This may be due to the input, but also to transport processes and degradation in the aquifer.
   In field studies investigating ground water sampled at a bank infiltration site at Lake Tegel, Berlin, Germany, clofibric acid was found at concentrations up to 290 ng/L, and propyphenazone up to 250 ng/L. whereas concentrations of diclofenac were around the detection limit.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the ground water transport behavior of the pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, propyphenazone, and diclofenac with a laboratory soil column experiment. Results show that clofibric acid exhibits no degradation and almost no retardation (R-f = 1.1). Diclofenac (R-f = 2.0) and propyphenazone (R-f = 1.6) are retarded, whereas significant degradation was not observed for both pharmaceuticals under the prevailing conditions in the soil column. We conclude that the concentration distribution of the pharmaceuticals at the bank filtration site at Lake Tegel is controlled by sorption, desorption, and input variation, rather than by degradation.

AB In a study conducted by the US Geological Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 water samples were collected at selected locations within a drinking-water-treatment (DWT) facility and from the two streams that serve the facility to evaluate the potential for wastewater-related organic contaminants to survive a conventional treatment process and persist in potable-water supplies. Stream-water samples as well as samples of raw, settled, filtered, and finished water were collected during low-flow conditions, when the discharge of effluent from upstream municipal sewage-treatment plants accounted for 37-67% of flow in stream 1 and 10-20% of flow in stream 2. Each sample was analyzed for 106 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) that represent a diverse group of extensively used chemicals. Forty OWCs were detected in one or more samples of stream water or raw-water supplies in the treatment plant; 34 were detected in more than 10% of these samples. Several of these compounds also were frequently detected in samples of finished water; these compounds include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, fragrance compounds, flame retardants and plasticizers, cosmetic compounds, and a solvent. The detection of these compounds suggests that they resist removal through conventional water-treatment processes. Other compounds that also were frequently detected in samples of stream water and raw-water supplies were not detected in samples of finished water; these include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, disinfectants, detergent metabolites, and plant and animal steroids. The non-detection of these compounds indicates that their concentrations are reduced to levels less than analytical detection limits or that they are transformed to degradates through conventional DWT processes. Concentrations of OWCs detected in finished water generally were low and did not exceed Federal drinking-water standards or lifetime health advisories, although such standards or advisories have not been established for most of these compounds. Also, at least 11 and as many as 17 OWCs were detected in samples of finished water. Drinking-water criteria currently are based on the toxicity of individual compounds and not combinations of compounds. Little is known about potential human-health effects associated with chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple OWCs through routes such as drinking water. The occurrence in drinking-water supplies of many of the OWCs analyzed for during this study is unregulated and most of these compounds have not been routinely monitored for in the Nation's source- or potable-water supplies. This study provides the first documentation that many of these compounds can survive conventional water-treatment processes and occur in potable-water supplies. It thereby provides information that can be used in setting research and regulatory priorities and in designing future monitoring programs. The results of this study also indicate that improvements in water-treatment processes may benefit from consideration of the response of OWCs and other trace organic contaminants to specific physical and chemical treatments.

AB Selected pharmaceuticals, among them analgesics, beta-blockers and anti-depressants as well as caffeine, the antibacterial triclosan and the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-3-toluamide (DEET) were determined in different sewage samples (sewage treatment plants, hospital effluents) from Tromso/Norway and in seawater from Tromso-Sound, into which the sewage is discharged. While caffeine, triclosan, ibuprofen and its major metabolites hydroxy- and carboxyibuprofen were present in all sewage samples, additional pharmaceuticals were observed in sewage containing hospital effluents. Concentrations. were in the range of 20-293 mug/l (caffeine), 0.2-2.4 mug/l (triclosan) and 0.1-20 mug/l (Sigmaibuprofen + metabolites). In seawater, only caffeine (7-87 ng/l), DEET (0.4-13 ng/l) and ibuprofen + metabolites (sum concentration < LOQ-7.7 ng/l) were detected. Ibuprofen and its metabolites hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen were quantified individually by use of the respective reference compounds. Relative amounts of the three compounds were determined in different types of water showing characteristic patterns, with hydroxy-ibuprofen being the major component in sewage whereas carboxy-ibuprofen was dominant in seawater samples. The patterns which were compared to those observed in similar samples from Germany indicated different transformation behaviour under limnic and marine conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the anaerobic treatment of high-strength antibiotic production wastewater and the development of a mathematical model for the treatment were attempted. Anaerobic treatability was investigated using synthetic solutions and original wastewater of which the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined. Initial COD of solutions was increased from 3,000 to 43,000 mg O-2/liter in an anaerobic bioreactor. The bioreactor pH was maintained at 6.5-7.5. The temperature was kept constant at 37 +/- 1degreesC. Raw materials and original wastewater containing penicillin antibiotics were obtained from Fako Pharmaceutical Factory (Fako) in Istanbul, Turkey. Anaerobic sludge used for treatment was obtained from Pakmaya Baker's Yeast Producing Factory (Pakmaya) in Izmit, Turkey and the Fako. A mathematical model based on substrate (total COD) concentration was developed assuming that only three consecutive reactions, namely, hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis, are significant. From the experimental data, a model that can be used for COD calculation as a function of time was developed using the first- and the second-order kinetic approaches. Making use of the developed model equation, it was proved that the anaerobic treatment of high strength (COD > 25,000 mg O-2/liter) antibiotic production wastewater fits the second-order kinetics.

AB Antibiotics are one of a group of pharmaceutical compounds that have been found in lakes and streams throughout the world and the occurrence of these compounds in the environment has raised concerns regarding the toxicity to aquatic organisms and the emergence of strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objective of this study was to assess the use of a relatively simple coupled solid-phase extraction (SPE)/radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for screening and/or monitoring tetracycline (TC) and sulfonamide (SA) compounds in water. Cross-reactivity of TCs and SAs was used to determine the specificity of the assays. The results indicate that TC, oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC) of the investigated 5 TCs, and sulfamethazine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxane (SDM) and sulfathiazole (STZ) of the investigated 6 SAs in water matrix cross-react to a similar degree within each family in RIA and SPE/RIA. Water samples were collected across a watershed in northern Colorado in addition to the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. SPE/RIA analysis of these samples was compared with SPE/liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) quantification of 5 TC and 6 SA compounds. Results of the study indicate that SPE/RIA can be an effective technique for monitoring antibiotic compounds in waters suspected to be contaminated with these compounds. The coupled method provides a sufficiently low detection limit (0.05 mug/L) to screen large sample sets at environmentally relevant concentrations. The method provides a semi-quantitative composite measurement of similar compounds in an antibiotic family without complex and expensive analytical equipment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB During 2001, 76 water samples were collected upstream and downstream of select towns and cities in Iowa during high-, normal- and low-flow conditions to determine the contribution of urban centers to concentrations of pharmaceuticals and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in streams under varying flow conditions. The towns ranged in population from approximately 2000 to 200 000. Overall, one or more OWCs were detected in 98.7% of the samples collected, with 62 of the 105 compounds being found. The most frequently detected compounds were metolachlor (pesticide), cholesterol (plant and animal sterol), caffeine (stimulant), beta-sitosterol (plant sterol) and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (caffeine degradate). The number of OWCs detected decreased as streamflow increased from low- (51 compounds detected) to normal- (28) to high-flow (24) conditions. Antibiotics and other prescription drugs were only frequently detected during low-flow conditions. During low-flow conditions, 15 compounds (out of the 23) and ten compound groups (out of 11) detected in more than 10% of the streams sampled had significantly greater concentrations in samples collected downstream than in those collected upstream of the urban centers. Conversely, no significant differences in the concentrations were found during high-flow conditions. Thus, the urban contribution of OWCs to streams became progressively muted as streamflow increased. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The leaching behaviour of six selected pharmaceuticals was tested in different soils. Leaching experiments are a part of environmental risk assessment to estimate the distribution and fate of these pharmaceuticals in the environment. Based on the results of this assessment their mobility in soil and their potential to contaminate groundwater was evaluated. When assessing the leaching behaviour of these compounds, the influence of the properties (e.g. grain size distribution, pH, C-org) of different soils has to be taken into account. The test results indicated that the leaching potential found could be rated as low for diazepam, ibuprofen, ivermectin and carbamazepine. Therefore, contamination of the groundwater with these substances seems to be unlikely if the groundwater level is covered with sufficient layers of the soils investigated. Clofibric acid and iopromide were very mobile under the experimental conditions and thus, groundwater contamination would be possible if the soil is exposed to these pharmaceuticals, i.e. wastewater irrigation. These results are more or less in agreement with groundwater monitoring data found in the literature for ibuprofen and diazepam which were in general not present in groundwater, while clofibric acid and iopromide were frequently detected. However, a discrepancy was found for carbamazepine, since it occurs very often in groundwater. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the leaching tests were performed with soil, whereas in reality the groundwater contamination. occurs mainly over river sediments and sub soil from receiving waters.

AB Many of the human pharmaceuticals detected in municipal wastewater effluent, surface water, and groundwater contain functional groups that could undergo transformation reactions during chlorine disinfection. To assess the potential importance of these reactions to the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals, the rate of transformation of a group of compounds was measured over a pH range of 5-10. Several of the pharmaceuticals reacted rapidly with free chlorine (i.e., HOCl/OCl-) and would be expected to undergo transformation under the conditions typically encountered in many chlorine disinfection systems. For compounds containing aromatic ether functional groups, the rate of transformation was strongly affected by the other substituents on the ring. The amine-containing pharmaceuticals underwent a rapid reaction with hypochlorous acid to form chlorinated amines, which could be converted back into the parent compound by reaction with thiosulfate. In the absence of thiosulfate, the chlorinated amines slowly decomposed to form species that could not be converted back into the parent compound. The reaction rates of the pharmaceuticals with combined chlorine (i.e., chloramines) were significantly slower, and transformation of the compounds would not be expected under the conditions encountered during chloramination.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine the application of the divalent cation bridging theory (DCBT) to improve settling, dewatering, and effluent quality in pilot-scale reactors and a full-scale system treating an industrial wastewater. This was accomplished by lowering the monovalent-to-divalent (M/D) cation ratio by direct divalent cation addition. Research has shown that the M/D ratio is a potential indicator for settling and dewatering problems at wastewater treatment plants, and M/D ratios above 2 have been associated with poor settling, dewatering, and effluent quality. The M/D ratio of the wastewater in this study ranged from 6 to 20. The cations studied were calcium and magnesium. Results showed that the addition of calcium improved floc properties compared to control reactors with no calcium addition. The reductions in sludge volume index, effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), and effluent total suspended solids (TSS) were approximately 35, 34, and 55%, respectively, when the M/D ratio was decreased to approximately 2:1. In addition, the cake solids from a belt filter press simulator increased by 72% and the optimum polymer dose required for conditioning was reduced by 70% in the reactor fed the highest calcium concentration when compared to control reactors with no calcium addition. The addition of calcium also decreased the negative effect of high filamentous organism numbers. In general, the addition of magnesium (Mg2+) had similar effects on effluent quality and dewatering properties, although some differences were measured. A full-scale test using calcium addition was performed. Measurements of effluent quality and floc properties were performed before, during, and after the calcium (Ca2+) addition period. The average M/D ratio during these periods was 6.2, 4.6, and 14.0, respectively. The addition of Ca2+ decreased the effluent five-day biochemical oxygen demand, effluent TSS, and effluent COD. The increased Ca2+ concentration also improved dewatering measured by a decrease in specific resistance to filtration and capillary suction time. Overall, the addition of divalent cations to the pilot- and full-scale activated sludge systems improved floc properties and the data fit well with the DCBT.

AB Two cosmetic ingredients (galaxolide, tonalide), eight pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide) and three hormones (estrone, 17beta-estradiol and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol) have been surveyed along the different units of a municipal Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Galicia, NW Spain. Among all the substances considered, significant concentrations in the influent were only found for the two musks (galaxolide and tonalide), two anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen and naproxen), two natural estrogens (estrone, 17beta-estradiol), one antibiotic (sulfaniethoxazole) and the X-ray contrast medium (iopromide), where the other compounds studied were below the limit of quantification. In the primary treatment, only the fragrances (30-50%) and 17beta-estradiol (20%) were partially removed. On the other hand, the aerobic treatment (activated sludges) caused an important reduction in all compounds detected, between 351/4 and 75%, with the exception of iopromide, which remained in the aqueous phase. The overall removal efficiencies within the STP ranged between 70-90% for the fragrances, 40-65% for the anti-inflammatories, around 65% for 17beta-estradiol and 60% for sulfamethoxazole. However, the concentration of estrone increased along the treatment due to the partial oxidation of 17beta-estradiol in the aeration tank. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate (the active ingredient in Paxil) is a pharmaceutical compound used for the treatment of depression, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Paroxetine (PA) is extensively metabolized in humans, with about 97% of the parent compound being excreted as metabolites through the urine and feces of patients. Therefore PA and metabolites have the potential to be discharged into wastewater treatment systems after therapeutic use. PA and its major human metabolite (PM) were investigated using studies designed to describe physical/chemical characteristics and determine their fate and effects in the aquatic environment. A significant portion of the PM entering a wastewater treatment plant would be expected to biodegrade given the higher activated sludge solids concentrations present in a typical wastewater treatment plant. The potential for direct photolysis of PM is also possible based on photolysis results for PA itself. These results provide strong support for expecting that PA and PM residuals will not persist in the aquatic environment after discharge from a wastewater treatment facility This conclusion is also supported by the results of a USGS monitoring study, where no PM was detected in any of the samples at the 260 ng/L reporting limit. The results presented here also demonstrate the importance of understanding the human metabolism of a pharmaceutical so that the appropriate molecule(s) is used for fate and effects studies. In addition to the PA fate studies, PM was investigated using studies designed to determine potential environmental effects and a predicted no effect level (PNEC). The average measured activated sludge respiration inhibition value (EC50) for PM was 82 mg/L. The measured Microtox EC50 value was 33.0 mg/L, while the Daphnia magna EC50 value was 35.0 mg/L. The PNEC for PM was calculated to be 35.0 mug/L. Fate data were then used in a now watershed-based environmental risk assessment model, PhATE, to predict environmental concentrations (PECs). Comparison of the calculated PECs with the PNEC allows an assessment of potential environmental risk. Within the 1-99% of stream segments in the PhATE model, PEC values ranged from 0.003 to 100 ng/L. The risk assessment PEC/PNEC ratios ranged from similar to3 x 10(-8) to similar to3 x 10(-3), indicating a wide margin of safety, since a PEC/PNEC ratio < 1 is generally considered to represent a low risk to the environment. In addition, Microtox studies carried out on PM biodegradation byproducts indicated no detectable residual toxicity. Any compounds in the environment as a result of the biodegradation of PM should be innocuous polar byproducts that should not exert any toxic effects.

AB Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals have been shown to occur in considerably high amounts in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and surface waters. The non-steroidal inflammatory drug diclofenac represents one of the most commonly detected compounds. Information concerning possible ecotoxicological risks of the substance are rather scarce. So far there are no data available on its possible effects in fish after prolonged exposure. In order to evaluate sublethal toxic effects of diclofenac in fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to diclofenac concentrations ranging from mug/L to 500 mug/L over a 28 day period were investigated by histopathological methods. In addition, diclofenac residues in various organs were analyzed by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
   The histopathological examinations of diclofenac-exposed fish revealed alterations of the kidney such as an hyaline droplet degeneration of the tubular epithelial cells and the occurrence of an interstitial nephritis. In the gills, the predominant finding consisted in a necrosis of pillar cells leading to damage of the capillary wall within the secondary lamellae. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) at which both renal lesions and alterations of the gills occurred was 5 mug/L. In contrast, the light microscopical examination of the liver, the gastro-intestinal tract, and the spleen did not reveal any histopathological alterations neither in diclofenac-exposed fish nor in solvent controls or control individuals.
   Chemical analysis showed a concentration-related accumulation of diclofenac in all organs examined. The highest amounts could be detected in the liver, followed by the kidney, the gills and the muscle tissue. Dependent on the diclofenac concentration used, the bioconcentration factors (BCF) were 12-2732 in the liver, 5-971 in the kidney, 3-763 in the gills, and 0.3-69 in the muscle respectively. From the present findings it can be assumed, that prolonged exposure in environmentally relevant concentrations of diclofenac leads to an impairment of the general health condition of fish.

The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) for cytological alterations in liver, kidney and gills was 1 mug/L. In the gut, however, no diclofenac-induced cytopathology occurred. As the most prominent reactions induced by diclofenac (1) in the kidney, a severe accumulation of protein in the tubular cells (so called hyaline droplet degeneration), macrophage infiltration and structural alterations (dilation, vesiculation) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the proximal and distal renal tubules were observed. Furthermore, shortening of podocytes and their retraction from the basal lamina, a thickening of the basal lamina, the formation of desmosomes, and necrosis of endothelial cells in the renal corpuscles occurred; (2) in the liver, the most striking reactions were the collapse of the cellular compartmentation as well as the glycogen depletion of hepatocytes; (3) in the gills, pillar cell necrosis, hypertrophy of chloride cells, and epithelium lifting became evident in the secondary lamellae.

AB The fate of enrofloxacin present in raw sewage at a swine-breeding facility was investigated by liquid-liquid extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Samples were collected in the storage pits of each pigsty and in a nonaerated lagoon used to stock the sewage. In the pigsties, the sewage was mixed with 10% olive oil groundwater, following a certified procedure (cod. Cer 020301) which reduces the bad odors and produces a better manure. This sewage treatment for 8 months in the lagoon dramatically reduced the amount of enrofloxacin to levels under the detection limit of 0.6 mug.L-1. The results stress the importance of correct sludge management in limiting the impact of enrofloxacin in the environment.

AB Presented here, based on new recommendations of the European Commission, is an environmental risk assessment (ERA) of a selected group of pharmaceuticals for Phase 1, environmental exposure assessment, and Phase II Tier A, initial environmental fate and effect analysis. This pharmaceutical group is composed of the 111 highest-selling human drug substances that have annual sales in Germany of more than 5,000 kg. The data required for this ERA came from analyzing: (1) sales annually (in kg or IU) of the 2671 active pharmaceutical drug substances (2001) on the German market in all medicinal products sold by pharmacies (with and without prescriptions) and used in hospitals in 1996-2001; (2) the use pattern of drug substances as categorized according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification indexes ATC3 and ATC7; (3) data for excretion, toxicity, and metabolites of the 111 selected human drug substances; (4) the physicochemical properties of these substances; and (5) the degradability of selected drug substances in sewage treatment plants (STPs) by using a validated and accredited liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. A correction factor for the pharmaceutical therapeutic (PT) activity of metabolites, the PTindex (excretion rate/100) for drug substances and PT active metabolites was established to refine the predicted environmental concentration (PECSURFACEWATER). A refinement of the PECSURFACEWATER was carried out with the market penetration factor of the human drug substances in Germany. In addition, for effect analysis the predicted no-effects concentration (PNEC) was calculated using assessment factors. The estimated PEC results were validated with the exposure results of effluents of the STPs. All results on ERA of drug substances have been documented in a Microsoft Access 2000 database.

AB Organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) have recently been documented in several aquatic ecosystems. We examined the effects of three OWCs (caffeine, acetaminophen, and triclosan) on the activity level, startle response, survivorship, and growth of northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) tadpoles. We conducted two experiments: one on the effects of acetaminophen and triclosan alone and in combination, and the other on the effects of caffeine and acetaminophen alone and in combination. In both experiments acetaminophen had no effect on activity, startle response, survivorship, or final mass. In experiment 1, tadpoles exposed to triclosan were less active than controls. Tadpoles exposed to the highest triclosan concentration had lower startle response and survivorship than in the other concentrations and in the control. Tadpoles exposed to the intermediate triclosan concentrations were heavier than in other treatments, but not in the control. In experiment 2, tadpoles exposed to the highest caffeine concentration were the most active. Acetaminophen increased the effect of caffeine on activity. More tadpoles exposed to caffeine exhibited a startle response than did control tadpoles. Survivorship was 100% for all caffeine treatments. There was a tendency (P = 0.06) for tadpoles exposed to higher concentrations of caffeine to be smaller. In general, the interactive effects were not important. Our results show that ecologically relevant levels of some OWCs can have both behavioral and physiological effects on R. pipiens tadpoles. Thus, amphibians may be affected by exposure to levels of OWCs that appear to be widespread in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Pharmaceutically active substances have recently been recognised as an emerging environmental problem. Human and veterinarian therapeutic agents can contaminate aquatic ecosystems via sewage discharges (human and animal excretion), improper disposal or industrial waste. Very little is known on the effects of pharmaceutical pollutants on aquatic photosynthetic organisms. In this study the effects of erythromycin, tetracycline and ibuprofen on the growth of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and the duckweed Lemna minor FBR006 were studied at concentrations of 1-1000 mug l(-1). At dosage of 1 mg l(-1), erythromycin affected the growth of both Synechocystis and Leinna with a maximum inhibition of 70 and 20%, respectively. Tetracycline had inhibitory effects (20-22% reduction in growth) on Synechocystis at intermediate dosages. The same aminoglycoside antibiotic promoted growth in Lemna by 26% at 10 mug l(-1), while frond development was reduced at 1 mg l(-1) (tetracycline). The anti-inflammatory ibuprofen strongly stimulated the growth of Synechocystis at all concentrations tested (72% increase at 10 mug l(-1)) although inhibited Lemna in a linear dose-dependent manner with a 25% reduction over control levels at a dosage of 1 mg l(-1). The 7 days effective concentration (EC50) calculated for Lemna were 5.6, 1 and 4 g l(-1), respectively, for erythromycin, tetracycline and ibuprofen. Moreover, exposure to the three pharmaceuticals resulted in the production of the stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), in Lemna. Erythromycin and tetracycline were more effective in promoting ABA synthesis compared to ibuprofen. The effects shown by the three therapeutic drugs on Synechocystis and Lemna growth may have potential implications in the assessments of residual environmental risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems. Promotion of ABA synthesis in Lemna by the two antibiotics and by copper suggests that the plant hormone could be a suitable (additional) indicator for future evaluation of phytotoxicity that results in plant senescence.

ID PHARMACEUTICAL RESIDUES; SEWAGE; QUANTITIES
AB This article presents an approach to describing the presence of measurable pharmaceutical residuals originating in municipal sewage, which in turn provides a means of predicting the likely appearance of individual contaminants in effluents and downstream water sources. Trace organic contaminants come from many sources in wastewater. Their health significance is unknown and a problem for toxicologists to define. Analytical technology now enables measurement of many organic contaminants at very low concentrations and for which no adequate understanding of health significance has been developed. The study was conducted to show how a class of contaminants (pharmaceutical residuals) can be described and to demonstrate the presence of unmeasurable residuals. Regulators will increasingly be faced with pressure to assure safety without a clear toxicological basis for measuring risk. This work provides a blueprint for describing the presence and distribution of other groups of trace organic contaminants. It also underscores the urgent need for development of fundamental toxicological principles for assessing potential significance to human health from exposure to trace and ultratrace contaminants and mixtures.-LH.

AB The Biological Nitrogen Removal (BNR) process of some pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants has important operational problems. This study shows that, in order to solve these problems, the design of industrial BNR processes start by analysing three key parameters: the characteristics of the wastewater load, the determination of the maximum TXN removal rate and the detection of toxic or inhibitory compounds in the wastewater. A case study of this analysis in pharmaceutical wastewater is presented here. In this case, the conventional TKN analytical method does not make an accurate characterisation of the wastewater load because it measures a concentration of 100 mg TKN l(-1) whereas the real concentration, determined with a modified TKN analytical method, is 150-500 mg TKN l(-1). Also, the TXN removal of the treatment system is insufficient in some periods because it falls below legal requirements. This problem might be a consequence of the wrong characterisation of wastewater during the design process. The maximum TKN removal at 27 degreesC (24 mg N g VSS-1 l(-1) or 197 mg N l(-1) d(-1)) was evaluated in a pilot-scale plant. This value is six times greater than the Ave. NLR applied in the full-scale plant. Finally, some of the components of the wastewater, such as p-phenylenediamine X have inhibitory or toxic effects on the biological process. P-phenylenediamine causes a large decrease in the nitrification rate. This effect was determined by respirometry. This methodology shows that the effect is mainly inhibitory with a contact time of 30 min and if the contact time is longer, 14 hours, a toxic effect is observed.

AB Pharmaceuticals have a wide range of biological properties and are released into the environment in relatively large amounts, yet little information is available regarding their effects or potential ecological risks. We exposed outdoor aquatic microcosms to combinations of ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), and ciprofloxacin (a DNA gyrase-inhibiting antibiotic) at concentrations of 6, 10, and 10 mug/L, respectively (low treatment [LT]); 60, 100, and 100 mug/L, respectively (medium treatment [MT]); and 600, 1,000, and 1,000 mug/L, respectively (high treatment [HT]). We maintained these concentrations for 35 d. Few responses were observed in the LT; however, effects were observed in the MT and HT Fish mortality occurred in the MT (<35 d) and in the HT (<4 d). Phytoplankton increased in abundance and decreased in diversity (number of taxa) in the HT, with consistent trends being observed in the MT and LT. Zooplankton also showed increased abundance and decreases in diversity in the HT, with consistent trends being observed in the MT. Multivariate analyses for zooplankton and phytoplankton suggested interactions between these communities. Lemna gibba and Myriophyllum spp. showed mortality in the HT; growth of L. gibba was also reduced in the MT Bacterial abundance did not change in the HT. All responses were observed at concentrations well below the equivalent pharmacologically active concentrations in mammals. Although the present data do not suggest that ibuprofen. fluoxetine, and ciprofloxacin are individually causing adverse effects in surface-water environments, questions remain about additive responses from mixtures.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed and used because of their specific biological effects. Over the past decade, compounds from various classes of pharmaceuticals have been detected in the environment. Concern has grown about the adverse effects pharmaceuticals in the environment might potentially have on human and ecological health. A sound risk assessment is therefore urgently needed for pharmaceuticals. Standardized tests for assessing the effects of chemicals on environmental organisms are widely used for this purpose. However it is questionable whether classical standardized tests give reliable data needed for environmental risk assessment. In this study we investigated the suitability of the respiration inhibition test OECD 209 for the assessment of the effects of antibiotics, disinfectants and cytotoxics on sewage sludge bacteria. We found that inhibition concentrations can strongly depend on the test period and the type of compound. We conclude that tests to assess the effects of pharmaceuticals on environmental organisms such as bacteria have to be evaluated before their results can be used in environmental risk assessment.

AB Wastewater from the fertiliser industry is characterised by high chloride concentration, normally varying between 60 and 76 g/ l. Experiments with biological,denitrification were performed in laboratory-scale 'fill and draw' reactors with synthetic fertiliser wastewater, with chloride concentrations up to 96.7 g Cl/lat 37degreesC; the pH was controlled in the range 6.8 to 7.2. Potassium acetate was added as carbon source for the suspended cultures. The results of the experiments showed that biological denitrification was feasible at the extreme environmental conditions prevailing in undiluted fertilliser-wastewater. However, the extreme conditions affected the denitrification rates, The volumetric rates were reduced by a factor of ten between chloride levels of 4.8 to 96.7 g/l. The results from the performed tests can also be applied to other wastewaters with similar characteristics as that of the fertitiser industry, i.e. with high salinity. As an example, the pharmaceutical and aquacultural industries can be mentioned.

AB Studies reveal that surface waters worldwide are contaminated with hormonally active agents, many released from sewage treatment plants. Another potential source of aquatic hormonal contamination is livestock feedlot effluent. In this study, we assessed whether feedlot effluent contaminates watercourses by measuring a) total androgenic [methyltrienolone (R1881) equivalents] and estrogenic (17beta-estradiol equivalents) activity using the A-SCREEN and E-SCREEN bioassays and b) concentrations of anabolic agents via gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and enzyme-based immunoassays. Water samples were collected over 3 years from up to six sites [all confluent with the Elkhorn River, Nebraska, USA: a feedlot retention pond (site 1), a site downstream from site 1 (site 2), a stream with intermediate livestock impact (site 3), and three sites with no observable livestock impact (sites 4-6)] and two sources of tap water. In 1999, samples from site 1 contained 9.6 pM R1881 equivalents and 1.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. Site 2 samples had estrogen levels similar to those in site 1 samples but lower androgen levels (3.8 pM R1881 equivalents). Androgen levels in site 3 samples were similar to those in site 2 samples, whereas estrogen levels decreased to 0.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. At site 6, androgen levels were approximately half those found at site 3, and estrogen levels were comparable with those at site 3. Sampling in later years was limited to fewer sites because of drought and lack of permission to access one site. Instrumental analysis revealed estrone but no significant levels of resorcylic acid lactones or trenbolone metabolites. Tap water was devoid of hormonal activity. We conclude that feedlot effluents contain sufficient levels of hormonally active agents to warrant further investigation of possible effects on aquatic ecosystem health.

AB Over the last decade, research has examined the endocrine-disrupting action of various environmental pollutants, including hormones, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants, in sewage treatment plant effluent. Responding to the growth of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the pollutants present in their wastewater (e.g., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rule that tightens the regulation of CAFOs. In this study, we collected wild fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to feedlot effluent (FLE) and observed significant alterations in their reproductive biology. Male fish were demasculinized (having lower testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size). Defeminization of females, as evidenced by a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio of in vitro steroid hormone synthesis, was also documented. We did not observe characteristics in either male or female fish indicative of exposure to environmental estrogens. Using cells transfected with the human androgen receptor, we detected potent androgenic responses from the FLE. Taken together, our morphologic, endocrinologic, and in vitro gene activation assay data suggest two hypotheses: a) there are potent androgenic substance(s) in the FLE, and/or b) there is a complex mixture of androgenic and estrogenic substances that alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or gonadotropins. This is the first study demonstrating that the endocrine and reproductive systems of wild fish can be adversely affected by FLE. Future studies are needed to further investigate the effects of agricultural runoff and to identify the biologically active agents, whether natural or pharmaceutical in origin.

AB A proof-of-concept experiment was devised to determine if pharmaceuticals and other organic waste water compounds (OWCs), as well as pathogens, found in treated effluent could be transported through a 2.4 m soil column and, thus, potentially reach ground water under recharge conditions similar to those in and or semiarid climates. Treated effluent was applied at the top of the 2.4 m long, 32.5 cm diameter soil column over 23 days. Samples of the column inflow were collected from the effluent storage tank at the beginning (T-begin) and end (T-end) of the experiment, and a sample of the soil column drainage at the base of the column (Bend) was collected at the end of the experiment. Samples were analyzed for 131 OWCs including veterinary and human antibiotics, other prescription and nonprescription drugs, widely used household and industrial chemicals, and steroids and reproductive hormones, as well as the pathogens Salmonella and Legionella. Analytical results for the two effluent samples taken at the beginning (Tbegin) and end (Tend) of the experiment indicate that the number of OWCs detected in the column inflow decreased by 25% (eight compounds) and the total concentration of OWCs decreased by 46% while the effluent was in the storage tank during the 23-day experiment. After percolating through the soil column, an additional 18 compounds detected in Tend (67% of OWCs) were no longer detected in the effluent (Bend) and the total concentration of OWCs decreased by more than 70%. These compounds may have been subject to transformation (biotic and abiotic), adsorption, and (or) volatilization in the storage tank and during travel through the soil column. Eight compounds-carbamazapine; sulfamethoxazole; benzophenone; 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole; N, N-diethyltoluamide; tributylphosphate; tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate; and cholesterol-were detected in all three samples indicating they have the potential to reach ground water under recharge conditions similar to those in and and semiarid climates. Results from real-time polymerase chain reactions demonstrated the presence of Legionella in all three samples. Salmonella was detected only in Tbegin, suggesting that the bacteria died off in the effluent storage tank over the period of the experiment. This proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that, under recharge conditions similar to those in and or semiarid climates, some pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and other OWCs can persist in treated effluent after soil-aquifer treatment.

AB Bank filtration and artificial ground water recharge are important, effective, and cheap techniques for surface water treatment and removal of microbes, as well as inorganic, and some organic, contaminants. Nevertheless, physical, chemical, and biological processes of the removal of impurities are not understood sufficiently. A research project titled Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration attempts to provide more clarity in the processes affecting the removal of these contaminants. The project focuses on the fate and transport of selected emerging contaminants during bank filtration at two transects in Berlin, Germany. Several detections of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in ground water samples from bank filtration sites in Germany led to furthering research on the removal of these compounds during bank filtration. In this study, six PhACs including the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone, the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone, and the drug metabolites clofibric acid and 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide were found to leach from the contaminated streams and lakes into the ground water. These compounds were also detected at low concentrations in receiving public supply wells. Bank filtration either decreased the concentrations by dilution (e.g., for carbamazepine and primidone) and partial removal (e.g., for diclofenac), or totally removed PhACs (e.g., bezafibrate, indomethacine, antibiotics, and estrogens). Several PhACs, such as carbamazepine and especially primidone, were readily transported during bank filtration. They are thought to be good indicators for evaluating whether surface water is impacted by contamination from municipal sewage effluent or whether contamination associated with sewage effluent can be transported into ground water at ground water recharge sites.

AB A reliable and sensitive analytical method for the determination of estrone (El), 17beta-estradiol (E2), and the synthetic hormone 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) has been established. Samples are concentrated using automated solid-phase extraction and analysis is performed by liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass spectrometry. Recoveries of all analytes were between 93% and 107%, and limits of quantification (LOQs) between 0.1 and 0.4 ng/L for purified sewage, and surface, ground, and drinking water, and between 1 and 2 ng/L in case of raw sewage. For the investigation of estrogen release into the environment and its behavior during sewage and surface water treatment, and during ground water recharge, samples from municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), a surface water treatment plant, a bank filtration site, and a ground water enrichment (GWE) pond were analyzed. E1 was found in the raw waste water with an average concentration of 157 ng/L, whereas E2 and EE2 were found with mean concentrations of only 18 and 9 ng/L, respectively. Sewage treatment by municipal WWTPs affected a removal of EE2 (76%), E1 (92%), and E2 (94%). In the investigated surface water of Berlin, only E1 could be detected at concentrations around or below 1 ng/L. E2 and EE2 were not present in the Berlin surface water above the LOQ of 0.2 ng/L, respectively. Surface water treatment also leads to a significant removal of E1 (> 80%). In the ground water samples from the GWE site near Lake Tegel, only a few samples contained detectable concentrations of E1. These samples were collected from a shallow monitoring well located very close to the bank of the pond. Even a short distance between the bank and observation wells led to concentrations of E1 below the LOQ showing the potential of ground water recharge systems for the retention of estrogenic steroids depending on the environmental setting.

AB Ground water samples collected from the Norman Landfill research site in central Oklahoma were analyzed as part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Toxic Substances Hydrology Program's national reconnaissance of pharmaceuticals. and other organic waste water contaminants (OWCs) in ground water. Five sites, four of which are located downgradient of the landfill, were sampled in 2000 and analyzed for 76 OWCs using four research methods developed by the USGS. OWCs were detected in water samples from all of the sites sampled, with 22 of the 76 OWCs being detected at least once. Cholesterol (a plant and animal steroid), was detected at all five sites and was the only compound detected in a well upgradient of the landfill. N,N-diethyltoluamide (DEET used in insect repellent) and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (fire-retardant) were detected, in water samples from all four sites located within the landfill-derived leachate plume. The sites closest to the landfill had more detections and greater concentrations of each of the detected compounds than sites located farther away. Detection of multiple OWCs occurred in the four sites located within the leachate plume, with a minimum of four and a maximum of 17 OWCs detected. Because the landfill was established in the 1920s and closed in 1985, many compounds detected in the leachate plume were likely disposed of decades ago. These results indicate the potential for long-term persistence and transport of some OWCs in ground water.

AB The occurrence, structure, and mobility of Tn1546-like elements were studied in environmental vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRIE) isolated from municipal sewage, activated sludge, pharmaceutical waste derived from antibiotic production, seawater, blue mussels, and soil. Of 200 presumptive VRE isolates tested, 71 (35%) harbored vanA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis allowed the detection of 26 subtypes, which were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n = 13), E. casseliflavus (n = 6), E. mundtii (n = 3), E. faecalis (n = 3), and E. durans (n = 1) by phenotypic tests and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Long PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (L-PCR-RFLP) analysis of Tn1546-like elements and PCR analysis of internal regions revealed the presence of seven groups among the 29 strains studied. The most common group (group 1) corresponded to the structure of Tn1546 in the prototype strain E. faecium BM4147. Two novel L-PCR-RFLP patterns (groups 3 and 4) were found for E. casseliflavus strains. Indistinguishable Tn1546-like elements occurred in VRE strains belonging to different species or originating from different sources. Interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of vancomycin resistance to E. faecium BM4105 was demonstrated for E. faecalis, E. mundtii, and E. durans. This study indicates that VRE, including species other than E. faecium and E. faecalis, are widespread in nature and in environments that are not exposed to vancomycin selection and not heavily contaminated with feces, such as seawater, blue mussels, and nonagricultural soil. Tn1546-like elements can readily transfer between enterococci of different species and ecological origins, therefore raising questions about the origin of these transposable elements and their possible transfer between environmental and clinical settings.

AB As an integral part of our continuing research in environmental quality assessment approaches, we have developed a variety of passive integrative sampling devices widely applicable for use in defining the presence and potential impacts of a broad array of contaminants. The semipermeable membrane device has gained widespread use for sampling hydrophobic chemicals from water and air, the polar organic chemical integrative sampler is applicable for sequestering waterborne hydrophilic organic chemicals, the stabilized liquid membrane device is used to integratively sample waterborne ionic metals, and the passive integrative mercury sampler is applicable for sampling vapor phase or dissolved neutral mercury species. This suite of integrative samplers forms the basis for a new passive sampling approach for assessing the presence and potential toxicological significance of a broad spectrum of environmental contaminants. In a proof-of-concept study, three of our four passive integrative samplers were used to assess the presence of a wide variety of contaminants in the waters of a constructed wetland, and to determine the effectiveness of the constructed wetland in removing contaminants. The wetland is used for final polishing of secondary-treatment municipal wastewater and the effluent is used as a source of water for a state wildlife area. Numerous contaminants, including organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organophosphate pesticides, and pharmaceutical chemicals (e.g., ibuprofen, oxindole, etc.) were detected in the wastewater. Herein we summarize the results of the analysis of the field-deployed samplers and demonstrate the utility of this holistic approach. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The PhATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model presented in this paper was developed as a tool to estimate concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in U.S. surface waters that result from patient use (or consumption) of medicines. PhATE uses a mass balance approach to model predicted environmental concentrations (PECS) in 11 watersheds selected to be representative of most hydrologic regions of the United States. The model divides rivers into discrete segments. It estimates the mass of API that enters a segment from upstream or from publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and is subsequently lost from the segment via in-stream loss mechanisms or flow diversions (i.e., man-made withdrawals). POTW discharge loads are estimated based on the population served, the API use per capita, the potential loss of the compound associated with human use (e.g., metabolism), and the portion of the API mass removed in the POTW. Simulations using three surrogate compounds show that PECS generated by PhATE are generally within an order of magnitude of measured concentrations and that the cumulative probability distribution of PECs for all watersheds included in PhATE is consistent with the nationwide distribution of measured concentrations of the surrogate compounds. Model simulations for 11 APIs yielded four categories of results. (1) PECs fit measured data for two compounds. (2) PECs are below analytical method detection limits and thus are consistent with measured data for three compounds. (3) PECS are higher than (i.e., not consistent with) measured data for three compounds. However, this may be the consequence of as yet unidentified depletion mechanisms. (4) PECS are several orders of magnitude below some measured data but consistent with most measured data for three compounds. For the fourth category, closer examination of sampling locations suggests that the field-measured concentrations for these compounds do not accurately reflect human use. Overall, these results demonstrate that PhATE may be used to predict screening-level concentrations of APIs and related compounds in the environment as well as to evaluate the suitability of existing fate information for an API.

AB Various human activities threaten the groundwater quality and resource under urban areas, and yet residents increasingly depend on it for their livelihood. The anticipated expansion of the world's urban population from 3 to 6 billion in the coming 50 years does not only pose a large water management threat but also provides an opportunity to conserve groundwater in a better way than up to now. The authors argue for a new way to manage urban activities in order to conserve the precious groundwater resource. The focus is on the quality of the discharged water after use in households. Restrictions on what is added to water while using it, e.g. detergents, excreta, paint residues, oils, and pharmaceuticals, are important to simplify the treatment and reuse of used water. Avoiding mixing different wastewater flows has the same positive effect. If increased volumes of wastewater can be treated and reused, the demand on the groundwater resource is reduced, as also occurs with demand management measures. Reduced discharge of polluted water to the environment from households and utilities also conserves the quality of groundwater and reduces sophisticated treatment costs.

AB Sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents are significant sources of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters, where high concentrations of the antiepileptic drug Carbamazepine have been detected. The solids retention time (SRT) is the most important parameter for the design of STPs. It relates to the growth rate of microorganisms and to effluent concentrations. The influence of SRT on the removal of Carbamazepine was studied on lab-scale plants. The results from these tests were then validated on several full-scale plants. Due to the lack of suitable receiving waters and groundwater resources, one of these STPs has to infiltrate the treated wastewater into unsaturated soil. Here, groundwater samples at equal distances from the infiltration point were taken to estimate the behaviour of Carbamazepine during soil passage and within the groundwater. This antiepileptic drug seems to be very persistent in the environment, therefore qualifying as a suitable marker for anthropogenic influences in the aquatic environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A conceptual model is presented for determining which currently prescribed pharmaceutical compounds are most likely to be found in sewage, and for estimating their concentrations, both in raw sewage and after successive stages of secondary sewage treatment. A ranking of the "top-50" pharmaceutical compounds (by total mass dispensed) in Australia over the 1998 calendar year was prepared. Information on the excretion ratios and some metabolites of the pharmaceuticals enabled prediction of the overall rates of excretion into Australian sewage. Mass-balance and fugacity modelling, applied to sewage generation and to a sewage treatment plant, allowed calculation of predicted concentrations of the compounds in raw, primary and secondary treated sewage effluents. Twenty nine of the modelled pharmaceutical residuals were predicted to be present in raw sewage influent at concentrations of 1 mugl(-1) or greater. Twenty of the compounds were predicted to remain in secondary effluent at concentrations of 1 mugl(-1) or greater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The UV/H2O2-induced degradation of carbamazepine, a worldwide used antiepileptic drug, recently found as contaminant in many municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and other aquatic environments, is investigated. The oxidation treatment caused an effective removal of the drug. At complete abatement of the substrate after 4 min treatment, a 35% value of removed total organic carbon (TOC) was obtained. A kinetic constant of (2.05 +/- 0.14) x 10(9) 1 mol(-1) s(-1) was determined for OH radical attack to carbamazepine in the UV/H2O2 process. Preparative TLC of the reaction mixture led to the isolation of acridine-9-carboxaldehyde as a reaction intermediate. HPLC and GC/MS analysis indicated formation of small amounts of acridine, salicylic acid, catechol and anthranilic acid among the reaction products. Under the same reaction conditions, synthetically prepared 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was easily degraded to acridine as main product, suggesting that this epoxide is a likely intermediate in the oxidative conversion of carbamazepine to acridine. Under sunlight irradiation, carbamazepine in water underwent slow degradation to afford likewise acridine as main product. In view of the mutagenic properties of acridine, these results would raise important issues concerning the possible environmental impact of carbamazepine release through domestic wastewaters and support the importance of prolonged oxidation treatments to ensure complete degradation of aromatic intermediates.

AB Recently, several new types of organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been found in sewage or surface waters. Some of the polar pharmaceuticals have also been detected in samples of ground and drinking water, especially when water from induced recharge is used for drinking water production. The fate and the transport of eight drug residues during groundwater recharge (GWR) of contaminated surface water was investigated at an artificial groundwater replenishment plant in Berlin, Germany. After a recharge distance of only a few meters, bezafibrate, a blood lipid regulator, and indomethacin, an analgesic, were removed below their detection limits. Clofibric acid, a metabolite of blood lipid lowering agents, and the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone were also attenuated during GWR. However, they were still detectable in the receiving water supply wells at low concentration levels (<= 40 ng L-1). The anti-epileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone and the drug metabolite AMDOPH (1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide) were not significantly affected by GWR occurring in the water supply wells at mean individual concentrations between 100 and 1570 ng L-1.

AB Goals, Scope and Background. From 2005, deposition of organic waste will be banned in Sweden. Likewise, in Germany and Austria, similar bans are being planned, and further countries will probably follow. Thus, there is a need to develop new methods and to refine established techniques for sludge management in the whole of the European Union. For this end, there is also an urgent need for appropriate ecotoxicological approaches to elucidate and assess the hazard potential of sewage sludge. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the capacity of various established sludge treatment methods using different oxygen regimes to degrade recalcitrant nitro-substituted organic compounds and reduce their toxicity. Sewage sludge samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Sweden (Cambrex Karlskoga AB, industrial area Bjorkborn) receiving wastewater from industries manufacturing pharmaceutical substances, chemical intermediates and explosives were processed with different sludge treatment methods. Among other treatment methods, bioreactors (for anaerobic and aerobic sludge treatment) were used. In the present investigation, a battery of in vitro bioassays was employed to compare the cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials of different fractions of sludge samples in order to elucidate whether the treatments were suitable to reduce the toxicity of the sludge.
   Methods. In order to investigate the cytotoxicity of the extracts of treated and untreated sludge samples, the acute cytotoxicity test with the permanent cell line RTL-W1 was used. Genotoxicity was tested by means of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) with RTL-W1 cells, and mutagenicity was assessed with the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA98NR and TA100. Sludge toxicity was tested in different fractions of organic extracts produced by acetone and hexane extractions. The subsequent clean-up procedure (silica gel chromatography and elution with hexane and dichloromethane) resulted in two fractions, a lipophilic hexane-fraction and a semi-lipophilic dichloromethane-fraction. For the genotoxicity and mutagenicity tests, these fractions were reunited at equal ratios. Results and Discussion. The acute cytotoxicity test with RTL-W1 cells revealed a high cytotoxic potential for the semi-lipophilic DM-fractions of all sludge samples with NR50 values (= effective concentration for 50% cell death in the neutral red test) from 8.9 up to 20 mg sludge d.w./ml medium. A low cytotoxic potential for the hexane fractions of the untreated sludge samples (NR50 400 to > 400 mg sludge d.w./ml medium) was observed, whereas the hexane fractions of the treated sludge samples showed elevated cytotoxicity increasing further with treatment in the bioreactors. The comet assay indicated that three out of eight of the reunited fractions had a significant genotoxic potential. Whereas the genotoxic potential of one sample treated anaerobically was very high with an induction factor of 11.6, a similar sample (taken from the same anaerobic reactor four months later) and one untreated sample showed lower potentials. The samples treated in another anaerobic bioreactor as well as the samples treated aerobically showed no genotoxic potential. Results indicate that aerobic treatment was basically adequate for reducing the genotoxicity of the sludge, whereas anaerobic treatment was only partly useful for reduction of genotoxicity. The Ames test revealed a very high mutagenic potential for the reunited fractions of the untreated sludge samples with strain TA98 (maximum induction factors (IFmax) up to 45) and a relatively high potential for one of the samples treated aerobically (S2, IFmax = 18 (TA98, S9-)), thus documenting the suitability of both anaerobic and aerobic treatments to reduce the mutagenicity of the samples, however, with the aerobic treatment being less effective.
   Conclusions. Overall, none of the microbiological treatments for wastewater sludge in bioreactors was found to be ideal for general toxicity reduction of the sludge samples. Whereas cytotoxicity of the sludge increased or levelled off in most cases following either treatment, genotoxicity both increased or decreased after anaerobic treatment, depending on the specific sample. However, mutagenicity could generally be reduced by anaerobic treatment and, to a lesser degree, by aerobic treatment.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The complex modification of the diverse damage potentials of sludge sample extracts by use of an in vitro biotest battery following treatment for toxicity reduction in bioreactors showed that considerations of different toxicological endpoints is essential for an adequate hazard assessment. Whereas in the case of cytotoxicity reduction, the reactors proved ineffective, mutagenicity could be reduced significantly at least in some cases in this case study.

AB Pharmaceuticals formulation industry poses a problem for water pollution control due to complexity and variability of pollutant source and characteristics. In this study, wastewater character of a pharmaceuticals formulation industry and its treatability were experimentally investigated. Three groups of products that are commonly used were selected. These are liquid products, lacque tablet and antibiotics. Biological treatability and pretreatment by ozone oxidation with or without catalyst were assessed. Liquid production wastewater proved to be capable of being directly handled by the biological treatment, while lacque tablet manufacturing wastewater required pretreatment for effective biological treatment. Biological treatment of antibiotic manufacturing wastewater was found to be having no effect with or without pretreatment.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of chemicals whose fate in the environment has received increasing attention in the past few years. A quantitative method was developed for the determination of acidic pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and diclofenac), caffeine and the antibacterial triclosan in wastewater effluent. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples on Waters Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction columns, derivatized with N,O-bis [Trimethylsilyl] trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Estimated method detection limits ranged from 6 to 45 ng/L based on replicate analyses (n = 10). This method was applied to the analysis of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant and compounds were detected at concentrations of 18-72 ng/L.

AB In this study, effects of a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater on activity or acetoclastic methanogens within a lab-scale anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) were investigated. The CSTR was initially fed with glucose and loaded up to an organic loading rate of 6 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) at which 92% soluble COD removal efficiency was achieved. Acetoclastic methanogenic activity was found to be 336 mL CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). The CSTR was then, fed with several dilutions of preaerated wastewater with glucose at 10% wtv(-1), 30% wtv(-1), and 70% wtv(-1) ratios and followed by 100% wtv(-1) preaerated wastewater. In the latter, 71% soluble COD removal efficiency was obtained and a maximum acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 166 mL CH4 gTVS(-1)d(-1). Finally, raw wastewater diluted with preaerated wastewater was fed into the CSTR in increasing ratios of 10-60% wtv(-1). Total failure of anaerobic reactor was observed at 60% wtv(-1) raw wastewater fed. The study was, therefore, discontinued due to poor acetoclastic methanogenic activity of reactor sludge which was totally distorted.

AB Toxic effects of herbal pharmaceutical wastewater on common fish (Lebistes reticulatus) under laboratory conditions were studied. LC50 values for raw, neutralized, and physico-chemically treated effluent for 24, 48, 72, and 96h ranged between 3.0-9.5%, 5.0-10.5%, and 35-41%, respectively. It was evident from the studies that physico-chemical treatment reduces the toxicity by more than 30%. This article discusses in detail the bioassay evaluation of raw, neutralized, and primary treated effluent. Physico-chemically treated effluent was further subjected to biological treatment by activated sludge system. Effluent from biological treatment revealed no toxic effect even after one month of exposure.

AB Diclofenac, a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been found in many Sewage Treatment Plant effluents, rivers and lake waters, and has been reported to exhibit adverse effects on fish. Advanced oxidation processes, ozonation and H2O2/UV were investigated for its degradation in water. The kinetic of the degradation reaction and the nature of the intermediate products were still poorly defined. Under the conditions adopted in the present study, both ozonation and H2O2/UV systems proved to be effective in inducing diclofenac degradation, ensuring a complete conversion of the chlorine into chloride ions and degrees of mineralization of 32% for ozonation and 39% for H2O2/UV after a 90 min treatment.
   The reactions were found to follow similar, but not identical, reaction pathways leading to hydroxylated intermediates (e.g. 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]-5-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and C-N cleavage products (notably 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) through competitive routes. Subsequent oxidative ring cleavage leads to carboxylic acid fragments via classic degradation pathways. In the pH range 5.0-6.0 kinetic constants (1.76 x 10(4)-1.84 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) were estimated for diclofenac ozonation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An advanced water recycling demonstration plant was employed to investigate the effectiveness of a number of treatment technologies in the removal of some residuals of commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals as well as natural and synthetic hormones found in sewage. Analysis of targeted compounds was carried out by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Initial tests were undertaken to determine the background concentrations of the analytes during various stages of treatment. Subsequent tests, undertaken by spiking with standard solutions of the target compounds provided further information on the removal efficiencies of some selected treatment modules. The results of the study indicate that while ozonation, microfiltration and nanofiltration were partially effective, treatment by reverse osmosis was the most universally successful in the removal of the target residuals. While significantly more data is required for a full evaluation, this initial investigation suggests that reverse osmosis may be an effective means of removing a wider range of pharmaceutically active residuals and hormones from treated sewage.

AB The possibility of applying main AOP techniques, namely ozonation, H2O2/UV photolysis and TiO2 photocatalysis to provide a significant reduction of toxicity of pharmaceutical mixtures has been evaluated. For the preparation of the mixture six pharmaceuticals were chosen among those found at highest concentrations in Sewage Treatment Plant effluents, namely carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin and propranolol.
   The blue-green alga Synechocaccus leopoliensis and the rotifer Brachyonus calyciflorus were utilised to assess the toxicity of the mixtures after AOP treatments. All the toxicity tests were performed using chronic standardized bioassays. The best results were obtained with ozonation. With this type of treatment a complete removal of mixture toxicity on S. leopolensis was obtained even after the shortest time of application (1 min). The ozonation treatment leads also to removal of all the pharmaceutical mixture toxicity on B. calyciflorus, by applying the oxidizing agent for at least for 2 minutes.

AB In this study, laboratory scale experiments were conducted to investigate the nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater. The results indicate that by selective inhibition of free ammonia on oxidizers, nitrogen removal can be achieved by nitritation and denitritation process. The nitrite ratio was above 98% in the aerobic stage and the nitrogen removal efficiency was about 99%. The complete ammonia removal corresponded exactly to the "Ammonia Valley" in the pH versus time graphic and the anoxic reaction was completed when the "Nitrite Knee" appeared in the ORP versus time graphic. Optimization of the SBR cycle by step-feed and on-line control with pH and ORP strategy allowed the carbon and energy saving. The easy operation and the low cost make the SBR system an interesting option for the biological nitrogen removal from the pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater.

AB Micropollutants as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), residuals of personal care products or endocrine disrupting chemicals are of increasing interest in water pollution control. In this context the removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are of importance, as their effluents are important point sources for the release of those substances into the aquatic environment. Activated sludge based wastewater treatment is the worldwide prevalently used treatment technique. In conventional plants the separation of treated wastewater and sludge occurs via sedimentation. A new development is the application of membrane technology for this separation step. The studies focus on the influence of the solids retention time (SRT) on the removal efficiency, as the SIRT is the most important parameter in the design of STPs. A conventional activated sludge plant (CASP) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR) were operated at different SRTs. The substances selected are the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the analgesics diclofenac and ibuprofen, the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the polycyclic musks tonalide and galaxolide and the contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiole. No significant differences in the removal efficiency were detected. Due to the absence of suspended solids in the MBR effluent, substances with high adsorption potential could be retained to slightly higher amounts.

AB In this study, laboratory-scale experiments were conducted applying a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) activated sludge process to a wastewater stream from a pharmaceutical factory. Nitrogen removal can be achieved via partial nitrification and denitrification and the efficiency was above 99% at 23degreesC +/- 1. The experimental results indicated that the nitrite oxidizers were more sensitive than ammonia oxidizers to the free ammonia in the wastewater. The average accumulation rate of nitrite was much higher than that of nitrate. During nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway, the end of nitrification and denitrification can be exactly decided by monitoring the variation of pH. Consequently, on-line control for nitrogen removal from the pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater can be achieved and the cost of operation can be reduced.

AB Influent-effluent monitoring by comprehensive chemical analyses was conducted at the Avedoere wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) during 2002. In one programme, the same samples were tested for algal toxicity by the ISO 8692 method. Based on evaluation of 17 hazardous substances (including 7 heavy metals), there was a quite good agreement between calculated and measured toxic units. In another programme, influent - effluent monitoring for 11 pharmaceuticals and specific hormones showed high removal rates, except for sulphamethizol and furosemide. High removal is probably due to WWTP operation with long SRTs. Effluent biomonitoring of freshwater mussels showed only bioaccumulation for: diethylphthalate, LAS, EOX as well as Cr and Ni. Surprisingly, no bioaccumulation could be observed for 100 other specific organic compounds and 8 other heavy metals (including Hg, Cd and Pb).

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent a significant source for the input of micro pollutants as endocrine disruptors (EDs) or pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) into the aquatic environment. Treatment efficiency of WWTPs often is reported, taking into account only inflow and effluent concentrations without further specification of the WWTP investigated. In order to allow comparison and evaluation of the removal efficiency of different layouts and concepts in wastewater treatment, additional information like the sludge retention time (SRT) and sludge load (F/M ratio) are necessary. Presented results from different WWTPs show correlation of removal of EDs and PhACs to the SRT. Compared to WWTPs with high F/M ratio implementation of the nitrification process on WWTPs results in a significant increase of the removal efficiency for EDs and PhACs. This paper describes an approach to determine comparable removal rates for different activated sludge systems based on mass balance and SRT.

AB The removal of commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim) and a biocide (triclosan) in operating wastewater treatment plants in five EU countries has been studied. Under normal operating conditions the acidic drugs and triclosan were partially removed with removal rates varying from ca. 20 to >95%. The highest removal rate was found for ibuprofen and triclosan (>90%) followed by naproxen (80%), gemfibrozil (55%) and diclofenac (39%). Ibuprofen undergoes an oxidative transformation to corresponding hydroxy- and carboxy-metabolites, which contributes to its high removal rate. Disturbances in the activated sludge process resulted in lower removal rates for all acidic drugs, mostly for diclofenac (<10% removed) but also for ibuprofen (<60% removed). The treatment of wastewaters by activated sludge usually did not result in any practical removal (<10%) of neutral carbamazepine or basic atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim. The removal rates of the investigated drugs and triclosan are discussed in terms of mechanisms responsible for their removal. Discharges of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, triclosan and trimethoprim from WWTPs to the aquatic environment, expressed as the average concentration in the effluent and the daily discharged quantity per person served by WWTPs were assessed.

AB Numerous investigations in different European countries observed various pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in notable concentrations in the aquatic environment. Further determinations found the effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) to be significant sources for the entry of pharmaceutical residuals to rivers, streams and surface waters. Due to those pathways the knowledge about the elimination of these substances and their behaviour in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is elementary for protection of an intact aquatic environment. Since the sludge retention time (SRT) is the most important parameter for the design of STPs, its influence on the reduction rate of these PhACs in the wastewater treatment process was investigated. To study this influence of the SRT on the elimination of PhACs, lab scale plants have been operated with different sludge retention times. The results of the laboratory experiments have been validated analysing various STPs within a wide capacity range and operating at different SRTs. This report describes the determinations observed on the antiepileptic drug Carbamazepine, the two antiphlogistics and analgesics Diclofenac and Ibuprofen and the lipid regulator Bezafibrate.

AB Pharmaceuticals present in sewage may inhibit the biological processes in a sewage treatment plant. In this work, the toxic-effect of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, propranolol hydrochloride, diclofenac sodium, ofloxacin and clofibric acid) on the anaerobic digestion process is assessed. Acetoclastic methanogenes are the most sensitive group of microorganisms participating in the anaerobic digestion process. Appropriate toxicity tests for these microorganisms were then based on assessing the impact of pharmaceuticals on the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the anaerobic biomass. The toxicity was expressed by the IC80 and IC50 Values, i.e. the concentration at which bioactivity was 80% and 50% of the control, respectively. Results showed that the pharmaceuticals tested caused a mild inhibition to the methanogenes in most cases, related directly to the tendency of the compounds to adsorb on the anaerobic biomass.

AB Pharmaceuticals or their metabolites are partially excreted with urine or faeces ending up in raw sewage. Many of these substances are not biodegradable and their presence in influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants may cause adverse effects to sensitive biological processes such as nitrification, while on the other hand, they may go through the activated sludge process unreacted. The second step of nitrification, i.e. oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is particularly sensitive. Inhibition of this step under uncontrolled conditions may lead to accumulation of nitrite nitrogen in the plant effluent, a form of nitrogen which is particularly toxic. The effects caused by the presence of seven different pharmaceuticals to a culture of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from activated sludge are presented. These pharmaceuticals were ofloxacin, propranolol, clofibrate, triclosan, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole. Different effects were observed for each of the pharmaceuticals tested in this study. In the cases of ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole significant inhibition was observed. Triclosan presented a substantial inhibitory effect on the substrate (nitrite) reduction rate. The long-term effect of triclosan on nitrite oxidizers was also examined in a CSTR reactor and conclusions were drawn regarding the reversibility of the inhibition caused by this compound.

AB In this work, a real wastewater (deriving from the chemical-pharmaceutical field) was treated by means of H2O2/UV process under different conditions in a pilot-scale plant. Several methods were used in order to assess the oxidation efficiency and to understand the main reaction features. It was shown that nonconventional COD measurement (with a 75degreesC digestion of the sample) is helpful for understanding reaction mechanisms, when integrated with TOC and COD analyses and GC-MS determinations. For the biodegradability study, beside BOD (5 and 20 days) measurements, OUR and AUR tests provide additional information especially when wastewater is tested by taking the activated sludge from the treatment plant which should really be fed with it. Finally, dehydrogenase activity measurements can show the presence of complex organic matter, which may be degraded only by an acclimated biomass.

AB An analytical method was developed for determining macrolide antibiotics in treated wastewater effluents and in ambient water based on solid-phase extraction and LC/MS analysis as well as on LC/MS/MS for structural confirmation, In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) macrolides are only partly eliminated and can therefore reach the aquatic environment, In treated effluents from three WWTPs in Switzerland, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and erythromycin-H2O, the main degradation product of erythromycin, were found. The most abundant, clarithromycin, reflects the consumption pattern of macrolide antibiotics. Summer concentrations of clarithromycin varied between 57 and 330 ng/L in treated WWTP effluents. In the WWTP Kloten-Opfikon seasonal differences revealed a load two times higher in winter than in summer. The higher abundance of erythromycin-H2O in the effluent of WWTP Kloten-Opfikon can be explained by distinct consumption patterns due to the main international airport of Switzerland in the catchment area. In the Glatt River clarithromycin reached concentrations of up to 75 ng/L. Mass flux determinations in treated effluents and in river water in the Glatt Valley watershed showed that elimination of clarithromycin along the river stretch of 36 km is insignificant (<20%). Investigations in the Glatt River before and after the diversion of the largest WWTP revealed an observable decrease in clarithromycin loads.

AB The growing demand on water resources has increased interest in wastewater reclamation for potable reuse, in which rejection of organic micropollutants such as disinfection by-products (DBPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is of great concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the rejection of DBPs, EDCs, and PhACs by nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes as a function of their physico-chemical properties and initial feed water concentration. Experimental results indicated that negatively charged compounds could be rejected very effectively (i.e., >90%) regardless of other physico-chemical properties of the tested compounds due to electrostatic exclusion. No time-dependency was observed for rejection of charged compounds. In contrast, rejection of non-charged compounds was generally lower (<90% except for one case) and influenced mainly by the molecular size of the compounds. A clear time-dependency was observed for rejection of non-charged compounds, attributable to compound adsorption on the membrane. It was demonstrated that feed water concentration influenced rejection efficiency of the membrane. Experiments conducted at a low ng/l concentration range resulted in lower rejection efficiency as compared to experiments conducted at a mug/l range, suggesting the need to conduct experiments at the relevant concentration of interest.

AB The aqueous photochemistry of four pharmaceutical compounds detected in surface waters (naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and clofibric acid) was investigating in purified (Milli-Q) water and in Mississippi River water (MRW). Both direct photolysis and hydroxyl radical-mediated indirect photolysis (using a combination of probe and quencher experiments) were studied. Singlet oxygenation was also investigated for naproxen. Second-order rate constants for reaction with hydroxyl radical were determined using Fenton's reagent. Naproxen was rapidly transformed via direct photolysis in sunlight in both Milli-Q and MRW. The radical quencher isopropyl alcohol (IPA), had a similar effect in both systems, and this effect was interpreted as a reaction of a carboxyl radical intermediate of naproxen. Diclofenac was found to undergo rapid direct photolysis under sunlight, confirming the results of prior studies. Addition of IPA led to more rapid transformation, possibly due to formation of other radical species or photoreduction with IPA serving as the H-source. When irradiated under natural sunlight, slow direct photolysis of clofibric acid is observed in Milli-Q water, and a combination of direct photolysis and radical mediated indirect processes appear responsible for clofibric acid photolysis in MRW. The dominant photochemical loss process for ibuprofen irradiated with a medium pressure Hg-vapor lamp was identified as reaction with photo-generated radicals. These results suggest that photolytic processes are important removal mechanisms for pharmaceutical compounds discharged into sunlit surface waters.

AB Samples of influent (untreated) and effluent (treated) from 18 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 14 municipalities in Canada were analyzed for residues of selected prescription and nonprescription drugs. Several neutral and acidic drugs were detected in effluents. including analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents, lipid regulators, and an antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine. Residues were extracted from effluents by solid-phase extraction, followed by either methylation and analysis of acidic drugs by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or direct analysis of neutral drugs by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as the metabolite of acetylsalicyclic acid, salicylic acid, were often detected in final effluents at mug/L concentrations. The acidic lipid regulator, clofibric acid, and the analgesic/anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac were not detected in any final effluent samples, which is not consistent with data from Europe. The precursor to clofibric acid, clofibrate, is not widely prescribed as a lipid regulator in Canada. However, the lipid regulators bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were detected in some samples Of influent and effluent. The chemotherapy drugs ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide and the anti-inflammatory phenazone were not detected in influent or effluent samples, but the vasodilator drug pentoxyfylline was detected at ng/L concentrations in some final effluents. The widespread occurrence of carbamazepine at concentrations as high as 2.3 mug/L may be explained by use of this drug for other therapeutic purposes besides treatment of epilepsy and its resistance to elimination in STPs. The rates of elimination of ibuprofen and naproxen appeared to be elevated in STPs with hydraulic retention times for sewage greater than 12 h.

AB Prescription and nonprescription drugs have been detected in rivers and streams in Europe and the United States. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important source of these contaminants, but few data exist on the spatial distribution of drugs in surface waters near STPs. Samples of surface water were collected in the summer and fall of 2000 at open-water sites in the lower Great Lakes (Lake Ontario and Lake Erie), at sites near the two STPs for the city of Windsor (ON, Canada), and at sites in Hamilton Harbour (ON. Canada), an embayment of western Lake Ontario that receives discharges from several STPs. In a follow-up study in the summer of 2002. samples of surface water and final effluent from adjacent STPs were collected from sites in Hamilton Harbour and Windsor. In addition, surface water and STP effluent samples were collected in Peterborough (ON, Canada). All samples of surface water and STP effluents were analyzed for selected acidic and neutral drugs. In the survey of Hamilton Harbour and Windsor conducted in 2000, acidic drugs and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were detected at ng/L concentrations at sites that were up to 500 in away from the STP, but the hydrological conditions of the receiving waters strongly influenced the spatial distribution of these compounds. Drugs were not detected at open-water locations in western Lake Erie or in the Niagara River near the municipality of Niagara-on-the-Lake (ON, Canada). However, clofibric acid, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, and carbamazepine were detected in samples collected in the summer of 2000 at sites in Lake Ontario and at a site in the Niagara River (Fort Erie, ON. Canada) that were relatively remote from STP discharges. Follow-up studies in the summer of 2002 indicated that concentrations of acidic and neutral drugs in surface waters near the point of sewage discharge into the Little River (ON, Canada) STP were approximately equal to the concentrations in the final effluent from the STP. Caffeine and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine. were generally present in STP effluents and surface waters contaminated by drugs. The antidepressant fluoxetine and the antibiotic trimethoprom were also detected in most STP effluents and some surface water samples. For the first time, the lipid regulating drug atorvastatin was detected in samples of STP effluent and surface water.

AB A wide variety of chemicals are used in pharmaceuticals. Most of these are already under thorough control for endocrine activity. The main causal agents recognized for endocrine disruption from sewage are substances used in medicine (sex hormones, glucocorticoids, and others), natural substances (estrone and 17beta-estradiol), and synthetic estrogens (e.g., 17alpha-ethinylestradiol). Similar substances are used in anabolic agents (growth hormones) in livestock production in some countries. Although the estimated use of anabolic agents in livestock production is approximately one order of magnitude below the natural release of estrogens from farm animals, their possible significance remains unanswered.
   At present, no other medical substances are recognized as endocrine disruptors in the environment. However, candidates may be identified on the basis of simple assumptions regarding their use and activity: (1) Nonestrogenic steroids may react with environmental endocrine receptors or metabolize on their way to the environment and thus form endocrine disruptors. (2) Many high-volume drugs released to the environment have not yet been tested for their endocrine properties, and some of these are known to interact with the human endocrine system. (3) Compared to medicinal substances, personal care products and additives in drugs are used in high amounts; from this group, parabens, siloxanes, and other substances are suspected of causing endocrine disruption in the environment.

AB Probably the only thing that can be said with certainty about the future of this field of ecotoxicology is that predicting it is foolish; the chances of being right are very slim. Instead, it seems to me likely that unexpected discoveries will probably have more influence on the field of endocrine disruption than the outcomes of all the planned experiments. It is certainly true that chance discoveries, such as masculinized fish in rivers receiving paper-mill effluent, imposex in molluscs due to exposure to tributyltin, and feminized fish in rivers receiving effluent from sewage-treatment works, have been pivotal in the development of the field of endocrine disruption in wildlife. I consider that further such discoveries are likely, but I do not know which species will be affected, what effects will be found, what chemical(s) will be the cause, or what endocrine mechanism(s) will underlie the effects. The recent realization that many pharmaceuticals are present in the aquatic environment only underscores the range of effects that could, in theory at least, occur in exposed wildlife. What is somewhat easier to predict is the research that will be conducted in the immediate future, which will build upon what is known already. For example, it is clear that wildlife is rarely, if ever, exposed to single chemicals, but instead is exposed to highly complex, ill-defined mixtures of chemicals, including many that are endocrine active in various ways. We need to understand much better how chemicals interact, and what overall effects will occur upon exposure to such mixtures. We also need to move from assessing effects at the individual organism level, to understanding the consequences of these effects at the population level. Then, we need to determine the significance of any population-level effects due to endocrine disruption in comparison with the impact of many other significant stressors (e.g., over-exploitation, habitat loss, climate change) that also negatively impact wildlife. Such research will be difficult, and time-consuming, and will probably produce many surprises. All I can be fairly certain about is that the next few years are likely to be as interesting and exciting as the last few have been.

AB Like hardly any other issue in ecotoxicology, endocrine disruption has given rise to public concern. Reproductive, behavioral, and immunological effects in wildlife were publicly not only understood as possible threats to wildlife populations, but also as early warning signals that human health could be at risk. Above all, the public has been concerned about negative outcomes in reproductive health, and effects like feminization in fish were regarded as evidence for the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that environmental levels of hormonally active chemicals are high enough to affect human reproductive health.
   Public concern has been mirrored by several parliamentary and governmental decisions emphasizing the need for extensive research and rapid measures to reduce the risk associated with endocrine-disrupting substances.
   Endocrine disruption in wildlife is clearly a priority issue. At least in densely populated areas like Europe, symptoms of endocrine disruption in wildlife cannot only be detected in areas with abnormally high levels of pollution, but have also occurred in main river systems, estuaries, and even in the open sea. Imposex in mollusks and feminization in fish that were clearly related to disturbances in the hormonal system of these organisms by exogenous substances have been used as markers in monitoring programs. Though symptoms of endocrine disruption can be clearly identified, it is much more difficult to link these outcomes to causative chemicals or mixtures of substances. Natural and pharmaceutical hormones, phytoestrogens, pesticides, and industrial chemicals may all play a role to a different degree depending on the site under study. This means that several different risk-reduction strategies have to be applied, including bans of substances, use restrictions, and installation and optimization of sewage treatment works embedded in a strategy for the overall reduction of chemical input into the environment.
   It should be noted that, in addition to national and international regulatory actions taken by state authorities, a considerable reduction of the environmental input could be achieved in several countries by voluntary actions taken by industry.
   Regulatory bodies are still facing major problems in the field of risk assessment and risk reduction. Association between effects and causative agents or mixtures are in many cases weak. Important tools for risk assessment such as dose-response relationships or the existence of thresholds are not yet agreed on. These uncertainties are the reason that many national governments and the European Commission have identified precaution as the main element in chemicals policy for the management of endocrine disruptors.

AB To simulate the filtration and/or degradation of trickling sewage from leaky sewers through the non-water-saturated underground, sewage was trickled through sand of 0.4-2 mm from the Rhine valley in glass columns of 125 cm length. For the same sewage the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was almost independent of low or high trickling rates. The COD removal efficiency varied, however, from 67% to 79%, for sewage from rain and dry weather periods, respectively. The water content of the moist sand increased from initially 80ml kg(-1) with increasing sewage trickling rates to 108 ml kg(-1) sand. It remained at 108 ml kg(-1) at higher trickling rates higher than 600 ml d(-1). Analyses of effluent of five consecutive 25-cm soil columns revealed that about 50% of the initial COD were filtrated off on top of the sand or degraded in the uppermost 25 cm. at varying trickling rates. Another 6-12% of the COD were removed in the following 25-50 cm of sand, whereas almost no further COD removal was seen in the subsequent two or three 25-cm columns. The COD elimination during trickling of sewage through the segmented column (interrupted random flow) was slightly better than that in the non-segmented column. Total and faecal coliform bacteria decreased faster with increasing trickling depth than that of total aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. After a filter/degradation stretch of 125cm elimination of all bacteria reached 96.2-99.9%. The sewage contained low concentrations of at least 10 different pharmaceuticals or X-ray media. During trickling of sewage through sand, elimination of these compounds by adsorption onto sand and/or biodegradation varied from a complete removal, e.g. Ibuprofen or Naproxen, to almost no removal for several X-ray contrast media. Some of the medicals were removed as effectively as during conventional sewage treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A river along the semi-arid Front Range of Colorado was monitored for antibiotics including five tetracycline and six sulfonamide compounds. Existing analytical methods were adapted to measure these compounds in a surface water matrix at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05mug/L). Natural organic matter present in surface waters was confirmed to significantly impact the low-level analysis of tetracyclines (TCs) necessitating the use of standard addition quantification techniques. Five sites along the Cache la Poudre River were monitored for antibiotics encompassing pristine areas without anthropogenic influence, urban areas impacted by wastewater discharges and agricultural areas susceptible to non-point source contaminant runoff. The only site at which no antibiotics were detected was the pristine site in the mountains before the river had encountered urban or agricultural landscapes. By the time the river had exited the urban area. 6 of the 11 antibiotic compounds that were monitored were found in the samples. At Site 5, which had both urban and agricultural influences all five of the TCs monitored were detected indicating both urban and agricultural influences. The concentration of TCs at Site 5 ranged from 0.08 to 0.30mug/L. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals or their active metabolites in surface and ground waters has been recently reported as mainly due to an incomplete removal of these pollutants in sewage treatment plants (STP). Advanced oxidation processes may represent a suitable tool to reduce environmental release of these species by enhancing the global efficiency of reduction of pharmaceuticals in the municipal sewage plant effluents. The present work aims at assessing the kinetics of abatement from aqueous solutions of clofibric acid (a metabolite of the blood lipid regulator clofibrate) which has been found in surface, ground and drinking waters. Ozonation and hydrogen peroxide photolysis are capable of fast removal of this species in aqueous solution, with an almost complete conversion of the organic chlorine content into chloride ions for the investigated reaction conditions. A validation of assessed kinetics at clofibric acid concentrations as low as those found in STP effluents is presented for both systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals in surface waters under solar irradiation was investigated. Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals caused by sun irradiation may be of major significance in the natural elimination process. Based on a data compilation from the literature, the lipid lowering agent metabolite clofibric acid, the iodinated X-ray contrast media iomeprol, which contribute to the adsorbable organic halogen compounds, and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were selected. The irradiation experiments were carried out in batch experiments with simulated UV-sunlight. The photodegradation of the pharmaceuticals showed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The objective of this investigation was to demonstrate that the extent of photoinduced degradation of pharmaceuticals can vary significantly for the different pharmaceuticals and it strongly depends on the water constituents present in solution. The influences of different initial pharmaceutical concentrations, the presence of other pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine or clofibric acid and the presence of natural organic matter on the photochemical degradation rate of pharmaceuticals in aqueous solutions were investigated. Analyses of the pharmaceuticals and their photodegradation products were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array and fluorescence detection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study a number of analytical procedures are described to determine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites during sewage treatment. The work shows that PPCPs occur in sewage influent and are removed by various wastewater treatment processes. PPCPs include a wide range of chemicals such as prescription drugs as well as diagnostic agents, fragrances, sun-screen agents, and various other compounds commonly present in household items (e.g. detergents, cleaners, toothpastes etc.). During this study a number of PPCPs including painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen), cholesterol control medication (clofibric acid), antibacterial agents (triclosan), musks (including galaxolide and tonalide), X-ray contrast media (diatrizoate), cancer treatment drugs (cyclophosphamide) and anti-depressant drugs (fluvoxamine) were investigated. Analysis was carried out using a number of techniques. Samples were extracted using solid phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction and the extracts analysed using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with selected ion monitoring or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or LC-MS-MS. The results obtained show that aspirin, clofibric acid, diatrozate, fluvoxamine and cyclophosphamide were not detected in any of the crude sewage or sewage effluent samples above the limit of detection of the applied methods. Ibuprofen was detected in all crude sewage samples as well as in all effluent samples with one exception. Removal of ibuprofen by the different STWs was generally between 80-100%, with the exception of one STW where removal was poor (14.4 to 44%). Triclosan was also detected in all crude sewage samples and in all sewage effluent samples. The highest concentration of triclosan detected was 3100 ng l(-1). A high removal efficiency was observed in effluent samples taken on two occasions (average removal 95.6%). The concentrations of musks detected in the crude sewage were generally low except for galaxolide and tonalide. The results from STW effluent samples showed significant removal of galaxolide (70-83% removal) except at one STW (STW 1) where removal was low (57% and 39%). Similar removal efficiencies for tonalide were achieved at these STWs (73-96%) except at STW 1 where removal was poor (53%).

AB Land use in geographic areas that replenish groundwater and surface water resources is increasingly recognized as an important factor affecting drinking water quality. Efforts to understand the implications for health, particularly outcomes with long latency or critical exposure windows, have been hampered by lack of historical exposure data for unregulated pollutants. This limitation has hindered studies of the possible links between breast cancer risk and drinking water impacted by endocrine disrupting compounds and mammary carcinogens, for example. This paper describes a methodology to assess potential historical exposure to a broad range of chemicals associated with wastewater and land use impacts to 132 groundwater wells and one surface water body supplying drinking water to 18 public distribution systems on Cape Cod, MA. We calculated annual measures of impact to each distribution system and used the measures as exposure estimates for the residential addresses of control women in the Cape Cod Breast Cancer and Environment Study (Cape Cod Study). Impact was assessed using( 1) historical chemical measurements of nitrate at the water supply sources (performed as required by the Safe Water Drinking Act) and (2) a geographic information system analysis of land use within the zones of contribution (ZOCs) delineated for each well in a state-mandated wellhead protection program. The period for which these impact estimates were developed (1972-1995) was constrained by the availability of chemical measurements and land use data and consideration of time required for groundwater transport of contaminants to the water supply wells. Trends in these estimates for Cape Cod suggest increasing impact to drinking water quality for land use over the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect on the distribution of controls' cumulative exposure estimates from (1) reducing the area of the ZOCs to reflect typical well operating conditions rather than extreme pumping conditions used for the regulatory ZOCs, (2) assuming residences received their drinking water entirely from the closest well or cluster of wells rather than a volume-weighted annual district-wide average, and (3) changing the travel time considered for contaminants to reach wells from land use sources. We found that the rank and distribution of controls' cumulative exposure estimates were affected most by the assumption concerning district mixing; in particular, assignment of exposure estimates based on impact values for the closest well(s) consistently produced a larger number of unexposed controls than when a district-wide average impact value was used. As expected, the results suggest that adequate characterization of water quality heterogeneity within water supplies is an important component of exposure assessment methodologies in health studies investigating impacted drinking water.

AB Experiments were carried out on clindamycin's separation and recovery from clindamycin fermentation wastewater with nanofiltration (NF) membranes. Four types of flat-sheet NF membranes, DLNF-1, NTR-7250, XCNF-1 and MPF-44, were tested under different dynamic operating conditions. It was found that the operating pressure and solute concentration had great influence on membrane performance while flow rates (or velocities) had little influence on membrane performance. Experiments on SO42- rejection were conducted with such four flat-sheet NF membranes because SO42- had bad influence on microbes in biochemical process following the NF process. The results indicated that DLNF-1 and MPF-44 membranes had higher SO42- rejection among four membranes. Two spiral membranes, MPS-44 (1.4 m(2)) and DLNF2-30 (0.24 m(2)), were adopted in a concentrating process for clindamycin's separation and recovery from clindamycin fermentation wastewater under laboratory conditions. After being operated for 60 h, clindamycin wastewater was concentrated from 266 to 26 L, and the clindamycin was concentrated from 220 to 1940 mg/L, which met the demand of reuse. This research may widen the application of NF membranes in disposal of pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behavior of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) during mechanical-biological wastewater treatment was studied by mass flow analysis. In addition, the fate of FQs in agricultural soils after sludge application was investigated. Concentrations of FQs in filtered wastewater (raw sewage, primary, secondary, and tertiary effluents) were determined using solid-phase extraction with mixed phase cation exchange disk cartridges and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. FQs in suspended solids, sewage sludge (raw, excess, and anaerobically digested sludge), and sludge-treated soils were determined as described for the aqueous samples but preceded by accelerated solvent extraction. Wastewater treatment resulted in a reduction of the FQ mass flow of 88-92%, mainly due to sorption on sewage sludge. A sludge-wastewater partition coefficient (log K-d similar to 4) was calculated in the activated sludge reactors with a hydraulic residence time of about 8 h. No significant removal of FQs occurred under methanogenic conditions of the sludge digesters. These results suggest sewage sludge as the main reservoir of FQ residues and outline the importance of sludge management strategies to determine whether most of the human-excreted FQs enter the environment. Field experiments of sludge-application to agricultural land confirmed the long-term persistence of trace amounts of FQs in sludge-treated soils and indicated a limited mobility of FQs into the subsoil.

AB A highly sensitive and specific indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of diclofenac in water samples was developed With pure water, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) and IC50 were found to be 6 ng/L and 60 ng/L, respectively. The analytical working range was about 20-400 ng/L. Highest cross-reactivity (CR) of 26 tested pharmaceuticals, metabolites, and pesticides was found for 5-hydroxydiclofenac (100%). Other estimated values were well below 4% and, therefore, are negligible. The assay was applied for the determination of diclofenac in tap and surface water samples as well as wastewater collected at 20 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Austria and Germany. Humic substances were identified as main interference in surface water. Wastewater samples which were only submitted to filtration and dilution yielded about 25% higher diclofenac concentrations using the ELISA compared to GC-MS. However, the ELISA turned out to be a simple, inexpensive, and accurate method for the determination of diclofenac both in influent and effluent wastewater after rather simple sample preparation, i.e., filtration, acidification, and readjustment to neutral pH-value, and at least 10-fold dilution with pure water.

AB The pre-oxidation of an extremely polluted pharmaceutical wastewater (chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 362,000 mg/l) using the Fenton's reagent has been systematically studied using an experimental design technique. The parameters influencing the COD removal of the wastewater, namely temperature, ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide concentrations have been optimized to achieve a COD global reduction of 56.4%.
   The total range of the proposed experimental design, however, could not be tested because under some conditions (hydrogen peroxide concentration over 5 M) the Fenton's reaction became violent and could not be controlled, probably due to the high exothermic effect associated with COD oxidation. For the tested conditions, the optimal values of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion concentration were 3 and 0.3 M, respectively, whereas temperature only showed a mild positive effect on COD removal. In addition, during the first 10 min of Fenton's reaction, more than 90% of the total COD removal can be achieved.
   Fenton's reaction has proved to be a feasible technique for the pre-oxidation of the wastewater under study, and can be considered a suitable pre-treatment for this type of wastewaters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A newly developed analytical method was used to measure concentrations of nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in samples from two surface water bodies, a sewage treatment plant effluent and various stages of a drinking water treatment plant in Louisiana, USA, and from one surface water body, a drinking water treatment plant and a pilot plant in Ontario, Canada. The analytical method provides for simultaneous extraction and quantification of the following broad range of PPCPs and endocrine-disrupting chemicals: naproxen; ibuprofen; estrone; 17beta-estradiol; bisphenol A; clorophene; triclosan; fluoxetine; and clofibric acid. Naproxen was detected in Louisiana sewage treatment plant effluent at 81-106 ng/l and Louisiana and Ontario surface waters at 22-107 ng/l. Triclosan was detected in Louisiana sewage treatment plant effluent at 10-21 ng/l. Of the three surface waters sampled, clofibric acid was detected in Detroit River water at 103 ng/l, but not in Mississippi River or Lake Pontchartrain waters. None of the other target analytes were detected above their method detection limits. Based on results at various stages of treatment, conventional drinking-water treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation) plus continuous addition of powdered activated carbon at a dosage of 2 mg/l did not remove naproxen from Mississippi River waters. However, chlorination, ozonation and dual media filtration processes reduced the concentration of naproxen below detection in Mississippi River and Detroit River waters and reduced clofibric acid in Detroit River waters. Results of this study demonstrate that existing water treatment technologies can effectively remove certain PPCPs. In addition, our study demonstrates the importance of obtaining data on removal mechanisms and byproducts associated with PPCPs and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals in drinking water and sewage treatment processes.

AB Ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a complexing agent and has the ability to form stable water-soluble complexes with metal ions. It is used in a variety of industrial applications including pulp and paper, metal, textile, leather rubber, pharmaceuticals, food, polymer production and others. Most of these applications are water based and lead to emissions into the waste water and reach sewage treatment plants. Industrial sources and municipal waste waters were monitored simultaneously. Mixed samples were taken over periods of one week at nine sample sites. The concentrations of EDTA were measured in waste water samples by gas chromatography using N-selective detection. The results showed that, although, the concentrations and loads were variable the paper manufacturing industry was the major EDTA contributor to the influent of the waste water treatment plant and contributed more than 98% of the total load. All the other sources including two household areas, were comparably low. In waste water of households concentrations between 10 and 70 mug/l EDTA could be detected. Concentrations of EDTA from different industrial waste water sources ranged from 28 up to 3980 mug/1. Influent and effluent concentrations of the WWTP were usually high in the range of 500-940 and 390-760 mug/l; respectively. Elimination rates averaged 15%, the calculation is based on emission loads. Specific emission factors were calculated based on population equivalents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In four countries (France, Greece, Italy, and Sweden) occurrence in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and ecotoxicity of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac were investigated. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, microcrustaceans, and fishes in order to calculate their predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) and to perform a first approach of risk characterization. For this aim, risk has been estimated by the predicted environmental concentration/PNEC ratio and the measured environmental concentration/PNEC ratio. First, regarding the PNEC, carbamazepine appears to be the more hazardous compound. Second, even though it is demonstrated that carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac have been detected in effluents, only carbamazepine have been detected in all sewage treatment plants with the greatest concentrations. Third, risk quotients greater than unity were calculated only for carbamazepine, suggesting that risk for the water compartment is expected. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Many tons and numerous varieties of pharmaceutical substances are used in the UK and other countries. They enter the environment via excretion, improper disposal or industrial waste. If they are not treated and degraded completely they could contaminate the environment. Little is known about their biodegradability. Department of Health (UK) data have been analysed to identify the prescription pharmaceuticals that are most consumed in the UK. This study has produced a list of the 100 most prescribed pharmaceutical substances by mass, which has not been available until now. Co-codamol (codeine phosphate/paracetamol, 444.34 t), paracetamol (403.11 t), co-proxamol (dextropropoxyphene HCl/paracetamol, 336.21 t), metformin hydrochloride (205.79 t) and ibuprofen (162.91 t) are the top five most consumed pharmaceutical substances in the UK. A comparison of these data with information about the biodegradability of the substances in sewage treatment works points to five substances that may accumulate and lead to future problems in the aquatic environment: oxytetracycline, amitriptyline, thioridazine, fluoxetine and dextroproxyphene. However, there may be other non-biodegradable pharmaceutical substances, which have not been reported so far. It is suggested that environmental risk assessment and methods for the removal of these substances from water need to be developed and evaluated, and that field studies on their fates are required.

AB The biodegradation of three active compounds of pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, ibuprofen, and diclofenac was investigated in short-term tests with a pilot sewage plant (PSP) and biofilm reactors (BFR, oxic and anoxic) as model systems for municipal sewage treatment. The PSP was characterized with respect to mixing behavior, the BFR with respect to biofilm content and sorption of the pharmaceutical compounds. The short-term experiments were carried out for 55 It in the PSP and for 48 h in the BFR. The concentration of the pharmaceuticals was in the microgram per liter range in presence of readily biodegradable substances in the milligram per liter range. Therefore, a too short time period and too low concentration to promote adaption of the microorganisms were applied. Under the operating conditions applied the biodegradation of the lipid lowering agent clofibric acid and the analgesic agents ibuprofen and diclofenac in the oxic BFR resembled that in the PSP. Clofibric acid and diclofenac were not eliminated and reached a level of approximately 95% of their initial concentration, whereas the concentration of ibuprofen was decreased to approximately 40% in the PSP and to approximately 35% in the oxic BFR. Both systems showed, therefore, an inherent ability for ibuprofen biodegradation. Elimination in the anoxic BFR resulted in a decrease of the concentration of all three substances to values between 60 and 80% of their initial concentration. In contrast to the PSP acetone revealed as inhibitor in the BFR. In both systems acetone was not degraded in the short-term tests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last years more and more often detections of antimicrobially active compounds ("antibiotics") in surface waters have been reported. As a possible input pathway in most cases municipal sewage has been discussed. But as an input from the realm of agriculture is conceivable as well, in this study it should be investigated if an input can occur via the pathway application of liquid manure on fields with the subsequent mechanisms surface run-off/interflow, leaching, and drift. For this purpose a series of surface waters, soils, and liquid manures from North Rhine-Westphalia (Northwestern Germany) were sampled and analyzed for up to 29 compounds by HPLC-MS/MS.
   In each of the surface waters antibiotics could be detected. The highest concentrations were found in samples from spring (300 ng/L of erythromycin). Some of the substances detected (e.g., tylosin), as well as characteristics in the landscape suggest an input from agriculture in some particular cases. In the investigation of different liquid manure samples by a fast immunoassay method sulfadimidine could be detected in the range of 1...2 mg/kg. Soil that had been fertilized with this liquid manure showed a content of sulfadimidine extractable by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) of 15 mug/kg dry weight even 7 months after the application. This indicates the high stability of some antibiotics in manure and soil.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have recently. been detected in the aquatic environment. Many studies have identified domestic waste water discharge as the source for detectable concentrations of PPCPs in surface water. PPCPs are a concern for the aquatic environment when production and use are sufficiently large and physicochemical properties are appropriate. Hydrophilic PPCPs present in surface water or waste water may also affect ground water quality where water is used to recharge ground water. However, less is known about how efficiently PPCPs are removed during percolation, through the subsurface. The scope of this study was to. examine the fate of selected PPCPs during ground water recharge at two water reuse sites where secondary and tertiary treated waste water is used for subsequent ground water recharge. The ground water recharge sites selected differ in aboveground treatment and geohydrological settings. The selected pharmaceutials represent blood lipid regulators, analgesics/anti-inflammatories, blood viscosity agents, and antiepileptics. Organic iodine was used as a surrogate parameter for X-ray contrast agents. Composite samples of treated waste water and from ground water monitoring wells were collected and, analyzed for pharmaceuticals using gas chromatography with mass spectroscopic,detection.
   The study revealed that the stimulant caffeine, analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and fenoprofen, and blood lipid regulators such as gemfibrozil were efficiently removed to concentrations near or below the detection limit of the analytical method after retention times of less than six months during ground water recharge. The antiepileptics carbamazepine and primidone were not removed during ground water recharge under either anoxic saturated or aerobic unsaturated flow conditions during travel times of up to eight years. Organic iodine showed a partial removal only under anoxic, saturated conditions as compared to aerobic conditions and persisted in the recharged ground water.

AB There are numerous observations of pharmaceuticals (or their metabolites) as contaminants in wastewater, surface water and groundwater. This implies a potential for indirect human exposure to pharmaceuticals via drinking water supplies. Various effect benchmarks may be employed in an evaluation of the significance of such indirect exposure. In this study a comparison was made between reported concentrations of pharmaceuticals in German drinking water and therapeutic dose. The margin between potential indirect daily exposure via drinking water and daily therapeutic dose was at least three orders of magnitude and typically much more. For certain compounds it was also possible to benchmark exposure against ADIs derived within the context of meat and food stuff residues following veterinary use. In all cases potential exposure was less than the ADIs, similarly suggesting that for these compounds there are no substantial concerns with regards to indirect exposure via drinking water.

AB Recent studies indicate that the pharmaceutical fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is discharged in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents to surface waters. Few data on environmental fluoxetine exposure and hazard to aquatic life are currently available in the literature. Here, we summarize information on fluoxetine detection in surface waters and review research on single-species toxicity test, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) reproduction and endocrine function, and freshwater mesocosm community responses to fluoxetine exposure. Based on results from our studies and calculations of expected introduction concentrations, we also provide a preliminary aquatic risk characterization for fluoxetine. If standard toxicity test responses and a hazard quotient risk characterization approach are solely considered, little risk of fluoxetine exposure may be expected to aquatic life. However, our findings indicate that: (1) the magnitude, duration and frequency of fluoxetine exposure in aquatic systems requires further investigation; (2) mechanistic toxicity of fluoxetine in non-target biota, including behavioral responses, are clearly not understood; and (3) an assessment of environmentally relevant fluoxetine concentrations is needed to characterize ecological community responses.

AB To evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of ten prescription drugs against aquatic organisms from different taxonornical classes, a set of biotests were performed using the cladoceran Daphnia magna, the chlorophyte Desniodesmus subspicatus and the macrophyte Lemna minor. Endpoints were immobilisation for Daphnia and inhibition of the average growth rate for Desmodesmus and Lemna. For most of the substances, toxicities were moderate, with EC(50)s in the range from 10 to 100 mg l(-1) or even far above, whereas Lemna was the most sensitive test species in the majority of all tested compounds. Tests with combinations of various pharmaceuticals revealed stronger effects than expected from the effects measured singly. Clofibrinic acid and Carbamazepine have been found to act by a non-specific mode of action (non-polar narcosis), and with Daphnia the combination effect of these substances followed the concept of concentration addition, while in the algae test the concept of independent action could be used to calculate the mixture toxicity. The anti-inflammatory drugs Diclofenac and Ibuprofen have also been found to act unspecific by non-polar narcosis and to follow the concept of concentration addition in the algal test as well as in the Daphnia test. The measured toxicities of the tested pharmaceuticals shows that acute effect of single substances in the aquatic environment are very unlikely. But we should keep in mind that considerable combination effects can occur and that toxicity data from chronic studies are needed to assess the environmental risk of drug residues.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter natural waters through sewage effluent and landfill leachates and present an unknown risk to aquatic species including freshwater invertebrates. In this study the acute and chronic toxicity of 10 drugs, commonly prescribed in the UK i.e. ibuprofen, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, amoxicillin, bendroflumethiazide, furosemide, atenolol, diazepam, digoxin, amlodipine were assessed using the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris. In a 7 day exposure period there were no effects on survival at concentrations up to 1.0 mg l(-1) and after 17 days neither feeding nor bud formation were adversely affected. However the ability of dissected polyps to regenerate a hypostome, tentacles and foot was inhibited by diazepam, digoxin and amlodipine at 10 mug l(-1). It is suggested that other drugs targeted at mammalian receptor systems may also affect aquatic invertebrates although it is unlikely, at their low environmental concentrations, that those examined in this study actually present a risk.

ID WASTE-WATER; TRICLOSAN; ENVIRONMENT; MIXTURES; STREAMS
AB Treated wastewaters in the United States contain detectable quantities of surfactants, antibiotics, and other types of antimicrobial chemicals contained in pharmaceutical and personal-care products (PPCPs) that are released into stream ecosystems. The degradation characteristics of many of these chemicals are not yet known, nor are the chemical properties of their byproducts. They also are not currently mandated for removal under the U.S. Clean Water Act. Three representative PPCPs were individually tested in this study using a series of laboratory dilution bioassays: Ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic), Triclosan (an antimicrobial agent), and Tergitol NP 10 (a surfactant), to determine their effects on natural algal communities sampled both upstream and downstream of the Olathe, KS wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). There were no significant treatment effects on algal community growth rates during the exponential phase of growth, but significant differences were observed in the final biomass yields (p < 0.001). All three compounds caused marked shifts in the community structure of suspended and attached algae at both the upstream and downstream sites (p < 0.05). Increasing the concentrations of all three compounds over a 3 orders of magnitude range also caused a consistent decline in final algal genus richness in the bioassays. Our results suggest that these three PPCPs may potentially influence both the structure and the function of algal communities in stream ecosystems receiving WWTP effluents. These changes could result in shifts in both the nutrient processing capacity and the natural food web structure of these streams.

AB Experiments were conducted to study the role of micro-electrolysis in removing chromaticity and COD and improving the biodegradability of wastewater from pharmaceutical, dye-printing and papermaking plants. Results showed that the use of micro-electrolysis technology could remove more than 90% of chromaticity and more than 50% of COD and greatly improved the biodegradability of pharmaceutical wastewater. Lower initial pH could be advantageous to the removal of chromaticity. A retention time of 30 minutes was recommended for the process design of micro-electrolysis. For the use of micro-electrolysis in treatment of dye-printing wastewater, the removal rates of both chromaticity and COD were increased from neutral condition to acid condition for disperse blue wastewater; more than 90% of chromaticity and more than 50% of COD could be removed in neutral condition for vital red wastewater.

AB The potential effect of human and veterinary medicines and other personal care products on the environment has become an important topic over the past few years. Whilst an assessment of the potential environmental risks posed by new and existing pharmaceuticals has been required in the United States (U.S.) for a number of decades, in the European Union (EU) and Canada assessments have only been required in the last 5 - 10 years. In the U.S., guidance has been available since the early 1980s on the assessment of veterinary medicines, whereas only recently has detailed guidance become available on how to perform the risk assessment in other areas. For example, in Canada, new pharmaceuticals (and other substances including novel foods, food additives, human biologics and genetic therapies, medical devices, natural health products, veterinary drugs, cosmetics) have been required to be notified for an environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA 1999) since 2001. The European Medicines Evaluation Authority (EMEA) has published guidelines for assessment of veterinary medicines in use in Europe. For veterinary medicines attempts are currently being made by the Veterinary International Co-operation on Harmonisation (VICH) to harmonise these approaches. Generally, the current assessment approaches are tiered and initially involve a comparison of environmental concentrations with set trigger values. If the trigger values are exceeded then a formal assessment has to be performed requiring data on environmental fate and ecotoxicity. Concerns have been raised over the current approaches used in each of the assessment processes and there are a number of areas that warrant further research. This paper will provide an overview of the regulatory assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and will expand on many of the topics for research in the future, and the role that QSAR scientists can play in this research will be highlighted.

AB A two-stage pilot-scale thermophilic aerobic suspended carrier biofilm process (SCBP) was set up for the on-site treatment of pulp and paper mill whitewater lining. The microbial diversity in this process was analyzed by length heterogeneity analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA. The primer pair selected for PCR amplification was first evaluated by a computational analysis of fragment lengths in ten main phylogenetical eubacterial groups. The fragment contained the first third of the 16S rRNA gene, which was shown to vary naturally between 465 and 563 bp in length. The length heterogeneity analysis of polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) profile of the biomass attached to carrier elements was found to be diverse in both stages of the SCBP. During normal operating conditions, sequences belonging to beta-Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group and gamma-Proteobacteria were assigned to the most prominent LH-PCR peak. Samples from the suspended biomass consisted of completely different bacterial populations, which were, however, similar in the serial reactors. The pilot process experienced alkaline shocks, after which Bacillus-like sequences were detected in both the biofilm and suspended biomass. However, when the conditions were reversed, the normal microbial population in the biofilm recovered rapidly without further biomass inoculations. This study shows that LH-PCR is a valuable method for profiling microbial diversity and dynamics in industrial wastewater processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic wastes are increasingly collected source separated, thus requiring additional treatment or recovery capacities for municipal biowastes, organic industrial wastes, as well as agroindustrial byproducts. In this study, we demonstrate that anaerobic digestion is preferentially suited for high-water-containing liquid or pasty waste materials. We also evaluate the suitability of various organic wastes and byproducts as substrates for anaerobic digestion and provide a current status survey of codigestion. Biodegradation tests and estimations of the biogas yield were carried out with semisolid and pasty proteins and lipids containing byproducts from slaughterhouses; pharmaceutical, food, and beverage industries; distilleries; and municipal biowastes. Biogas yields in batch tests ranged from 0.3 to 1.36 L/g of volatile solids(added). In continuous fermentation tests, hydraulic retention times (HRTs) between 12 and 60 d, at a fermentation temperature of 35degreesC, were required for stable operation and maximum gas yield. Laboratory experiments were scaled up to full-scale codigestion trials in municipal and agricultural digestion plants. Up to 30% cosubstrate addition was investigated, using municipal sewage sludge as well as cattle manure as basic substrate. Depending on addition rate and cosubstrate composition, the digester biogas productivity could be increased by 80-400%. About 5-15% cosubstrate addition proved to be best suited, without causing any detrimental effects on the digestion process or on the further use of the digestate.

AB The construction and electrochemical response characteristics of poly (vinyl chloride) matrix membrane sensors for seven phenolic compounds (phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol, alpha-naphthol and beta-naphthol) are described.
   The membranes incorporate ion association complexes of these seven phenolic anions with phenanthroline-iron(II) as electroactive materials.
   These sensors show linear response for phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol, alpha-naphthol, and beta-naphthol over wide concentration ranges, with an average anionic slope 54.3 mV per concentration decade.
   The suggested sensors exhibit fast response time (1 min), low determination limits (1 x 10(-5) M), good stability (2-3 weeks), reasonable selectivity to phenolic compounds in the presence of other water pollutants. The average percentage recovery was 99.78+/-0.088 for individual phenolates and 99.61+/-0.198 for phenolates in mixtures.
   The investigated sensors were successfully used for direct potentiometric determination of traces of these phenolic compounds in wastewater samples. Results with mean accuracy of 99.74 +/- 0.29%, 99.82+/-0.36%, 99.65+/-0.47%, 99.73+/-0.37%, 99.77+/-0.30%, 99.86+/-0.31% and 99.91+/-0.22% was obtained for the seven sensors, respectively.
   These results were compared with data obtained using the British pharamacopial method (The British Pharmacopoeia, Her Majesty's Stationary Office, London, 1993) and others (Clarke's Isolation and Identification of Drugs in Pharmaceuticals Body Fluids and Post-mortem Materials, 2nd Edition, The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1998).

AB A pilot plant for ozonation and UV-disinfection received effluent from a German municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) to test the removal of pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and musk fragrances from municipal wastewater. In the original STP effluent, 5 antibiotics (0.344.63 mug l(-1)), 5 betablockers (0.18-1.7 mug l(-1)), 4 antiphlogistics (0.10-1.3 mug l(-1)), 2 lipid regulator metabolites (0.12-0.13 mug l(-1)), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (2.1 mug l(-1)), 4 ICM (1.1-5.2 mug l(-1)), the natural estrogen estrone (0.015 mug l(-1)) and 2 musk fragrances (0.14.73 mug l(-1)) were detected by LC-electrospray tandem MS and/or GC/MS/MS. ICM, derived from radiological examinations, were present with the highest concentrations (diatrizoate: 5.7 mug l(-1), iopromide: 5.2 mug l(-1)). By applying 10-15 mg l(-1) ozone (contact time: 18 min), all the pharmaceuticals investigated as well as musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) and estrone were no longer detected. However, ICM (diatrizoate, iopamidol, iopromide and iomeprol) were still detected in appreciable concentrations. Even with a 15 mg l(-1) ozone dose, the ionic diatrizoate only exhibited removal efficiencies of not higher than 14%, while the non-ionic ICM were removed to a degree of higher than 80%. Advanced oxidation processes (O-3/UV-low pressure mercury arc, O-3/H2O2), which were non-optimized for wastewater treatment, did not lead significantly to a higher removal efficiency for the ICM than ozone alone.

AB Despite contributing 75% of the total wastewater flow to domestic sewers, little is currently known concerning the detailed production patterns and characteristics of grey wastewater. In this study, an inventory of the consumption of household chemicals including a diary survey of water-consuming activities was carried out over seven consecutive days in a block of flats. In total 290 parameters in 92 household chemicals were registered in the inventory in which 30 out of 38 tenants participated. The study was accompanied by quantitative analyses of selected parameters and a screening for organic components in grey wastewater. More than 190 individual components were identified by GC-MS. Identified substances were grouped into eight substance classes based on their application and their concentrations were semi-quantitatively assessed. Several fragrances like citronellol, hexyl cinnamic aldehyde and menthol as well as some preservatives, e.g. citric acid and triclosan, were identified. The measurements also showed that unwanted and unexpected compounds like drugs and pesticides could be present, as well as chemicals not directly deriving from household chemicals or personal care products, e.g. flame-retardants. The inventory provided detailed information about the consumption of various types of household chemicals, but no information on compound concentrations could be assessed due to the limited data in the list of contents of the household chemicals. It was shown that tracking of potentially toxic compounds used in households was possible.

AB Although various single-concentration measurements of pharmaceuticals are available in the literature, detailed information on the variation over time of the concentration and the load in wastewater effluents and rivers and on the fate of these compounds in the aquatic environment are lacking. We measured the concentrations of six pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen, in the effluents of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in two rivers and in the water column of Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) over a time period of three months. In WWTP effluents, the concentrations reached 0.95 mug/L for carbamazepine, 0.06 mug/L for clofibric acid, 0.99 mug/L for diclofenac, 1.3 mug/L for ibuprofen, 0.18 mug/L for ketoprofen, and 2.6 mug/L for naproxen. The relative importance in terms of loads was carbamazepine, followed by diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and ketoprofen. An overall removal rate of all these pharmaceuticals was estimated in surface waters, under real-world conditions (in a lake), using field measurements and modeling. Carbamazepine and clofibric acid were fairly persistent. Phototransformation was identified as the main elimination process of diclofenac in the lake water during the study period. With a relatively high sorption coefficient to particles, ibuprofen might be eliminated by sedimentation. For ketoprofen and naproxen, biodegradation and phototransformation might be elimination processes. For the first time, quantitative data regarding removal rates were determined in surface waters under real-world conditions. All these findings are important data for a risk assessment of these compounds in surface waters.

Czech Republic was investigated. Resistance and/or sensitivity of selected isolates was tested to various antibiotics. The samples were collected in the Course of two years (1999-2000). The total counts of enterococci varied from 103 to 105 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml. Among 100 isolated strains 60 strains were identified as Enterococcus faecalis 10 as Ent. durans as well as Ent. hirae, 8 strains were allotted to Ent. faecium, 5 to Ent. mundtii, 3 to Ent. gallinarum, 2 to Ent. casseliflavus. one strain was identified as Enterococcus spp. and one strain was not specified as enterococcus. The susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by both, the agar disk diffusion method and the microdilution method. The majority of enterococci (95%) was resistant to more than one antibiotic tested, especially to clindamycin, penicillin, cephalotin, ofloxacin and tetracycline. No vancomycin-resistant strain was found. Our results confirm that agricultural and municipal waste waters might be an important source of antibiotic-resistant enterococci.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters is an emerging environmental issue. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are recognized as being the main point discharge sources of these substances to the environment. A monitoring campaign of STP effluents was carried out in four European countries (Italy, France, Greece and Sweden). More than 20 individual pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes were found. For six selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, clofibric acid, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and propranolol) present in the STP effluents, the persistence towards abiotic photodegradation was evaluated submitting them to solar experiments at 40degrees N latitude during spring and summer. Based on experimentally measured quantum yields for the direct photolysis in bi-distilled water, half-life times (t(1/2)) at varying seasons and latitude were predicted for each substance. In salt- and organic-free (bi-distilled) water carbamazepine and clofibric acid are characterized by calculated half-life times of the order of 100 days at the highest latitudes (50degrees N) in winter, whereas under the same conditions sulphamethoxazole, diclofenac, ofloxacin and propranolol undergo fast degradation with t(1/2) respectively of 2.4, 5.0, 10.6 and 16.8 days. For almost all studied compounds, except propranolol the presence of nitrate ions in aqueous solutions results in a reduction Of t(1/2). When present, humic acids act as inner filters towards carbamazepine and diclofenac, and as photosensitizers towards sulphamethoxazole, clofibric acid, oflaxocin and propranolol.

AB Investigations of agricultural nonpoint source pollution typically focus on a relatively narrow range of targeted toxic and biostimulatory compounds (e.g., specific pesticides, nutrients). Regular application of numerous other organic compounds to agricultural fields in pesticide formulations, irrigation water, soil amendments, and fertilizers may result in their transport into surface waters via runoff. We examined whether potentially toxic dissolved and particle-associated "nontarget" organic compounds were present in surface runoff from agricultural fields irrigated with disinfected tertiary recycled water or wastewater effluent-dominated streamwater. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of filtered runoff samples revealed the presence of numerous nontarget compounds of potential toxicological significance including pesticide transformation products, pesticide adjuvant chemicals, plasticizers, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, and personal care product ingredients. Although the toxicity of many of these compounds is poorly characterized, some may elicit subtle but profound toxicological effects. Agricultural runoff also represented a source of allochthonous natural organic matter to the stream system.

AB Ozonation of three different synthetic pharmaceutical formulation wastewater containing two human antibiotics and a veterinary antibiotic has been studied to enhance the their biodegradability. The effects of pH and initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) value as well as addition of hydrogen peroxide on ozonation process were investigated. Total organic carbon (TOC), COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and aromatic content (UV254) were the parameters followed to evaluate the performance of ozonation process. Comparison of the biodegradability of selected wastewaters containing different antibiotics confirmed that the variation of biodegradability was associated with the target compound. While BOD5/COD ratio of veterinary antibiotic formulation wastewater was increased from 0.077 to 0.38 with an applied ozone dosage of 2.96 g/l, this ratio for human antibiotic I and human antibiotic II was increased from 0 to 0.1 and 0.27 respectively. Moreover the results of this investigation showed that the ozonation process is capable of achieving high levels of COD and aromaticity removals at about their natural pH values.

AB Environmental analytical studies show that trace concentrations of antibacterial agents (antibiotics) occur in hospital and municipal wastewaters and in the aquatic environment. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides, two important human-use antibiotic classes, were studied in detail. The results are discussed regarding input sources and behavior in wastewater treatment and rivers. The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are substantially eliminated in wastewater treatment (80-90%) by sorption transfer to sewage sludge. In digested sludges the fluoroquinolones occur at mg/kg levels. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are further removed in the Glatt river by 66 and 48%, respectively. The most abundant macrolide clarithromycin was detected at 57 to 330 ng/l concentrations in treated wastewater effluents. Different compositions of the macrolides (clarithromycin and erythromycin-H2O) determined in treated effluents of three wastewater treatment plants can be explained by distinct consumption patterns, in one case due to an international airport located in the catchment area. Residual levels of clarithromycin in the Glatt river were up to 75 ng/l with no apparent removal in the river. These results provide important information on environmental exposures, which can be incorporated into environmental risk assessments of the particular chemicals.

AB Research activities at the plant protection chemistry group of the Federal Research Station in Wadenswil, Switzerland, are primarily focused on the environmental behavior of pesticides and, in some cases, other organic micropollutants. Many old and modern pesticides are chiral and there is growing interest from registration authorities and companies in the different biological activity and environmental behavior and impact of individual stereoisomers. The environmental behavior of chiral pesticides is thus one of our main areas of research. We use monitoring data (e.g. surface waters, wastewater) to establish regional mass balances of a chemical (e.g. in the catchment area of a lake). Mass balances often indicate possible sources and presence of elimination processes such as (bio)degradation, sorption/sedimentation, and volatilization. Elimination processes are further investigated in model systems in the laboratory, including batch incubations in soil and water under different regimes (light/dark, sterile/non-sterile), to distinguish between biotic and abiotic (photolysis, hydrolysis) processes. Environmental models are then used to rationalize the chemodynamics of micropollutants in natural systems, integrating data from monitoring and model systems. In some cases, it is possible to use the data for source apportioning of pollutants in the environment, and for monitoring (or prediction) of the effectiveness of pollution prevention measures. In the following report, three examples will be presented which illustrate the general approach outlined above to study the environmental occurrence and behavior of organic micropollutants. These examples include the chiral herbicide mecoprop and the chiral pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen, as well as the ubiquitous natural compound caffeine.

AB As water reuse becomes increasingly important to satisfy water demand, ensuring the quality of recycled wastewater becomes ever more vital. Pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEOs) metabolites are two groups of chemicals that are commonly present in treated effluent and have received attention for their demonstrated or potential biological effects. In this paper we present data on the effects of river transport, wetland treatment, and groundwater recharge on the attenuation of these emerging chemicals. Using data from three advanced water treatment plants, we also report on the efficiency of microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet oxidation in removing these compounds from advanced treated effluents. With respect to natural attenuation processes, decreases in pharmaceutical concentrations during river transport were likely attributed to sediment sorption and chemical and biological degradation or transformation. Wetland treatment was less efficient when compared to river transport. Groundwater recharge appeared to be an effective removal process (> 99% attenuation) for PhACs and APEO metabolites, although trace levels of the latter can travel substantial distances in the subsurface. With regards to the engineered treatment options, reverse osmosis was capable of almost complete rejection of all PhACs and APEO metabolites analyzed, whereas the performances of microfiltration and UV treatment were much less efficient and consistent.

AB The effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants contains trace concentrations of a variety of organic compounds. To assess the removal of these compounds in full-scale treatment systems and effluent-receiving waters, approaches are needed for quantifying removal rates and mechanisms. For processes that result in near complete removal of wastewater-derived contaminants, it is reasonable to measure concentrations entering and leaving the treatment system. However, for those compounds that are not completely removed, alternative methods are needed. This paper describes several examples of approaches that combine laboratory and field studies to assess the attenuation of wastewater-derived contaminants.

AB Sorption isotherms of Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC), pharmaceutical granules, PolyEtherBlocAmide (PEBA) membrane and sewage sludges were measured at various temperatures using three different experimental gravimetric methods: the saturated salt method, the Dynamic Vapor System (DVS) apparatus and a simultaneous gravimetric and calorimetric measurement techniques using a Setaram TGA-DSC111. A comparison between the salts method and DVS is proposed at ambient temperature for the MCC, the pharmaceutical granules and the PEBA membrane. The comparison between the static method and the DVS shows that the results are consistent as long as the apparent moisture content in the material is high. When the apparent diffusion coefficient becomes low, the difficulty to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium appears in the saturated salts method. Then, DVS and TGA-DSC apparatus were used to investigate the desorption isotherms for the MCC between the ambient temperature and 90degreesC. Finally, an application on biological products is proposed: the desorption isotherms for two sewage sludges coming from the same wastewater treatment plant were determined with the DVS and the TGA-DSC equipments at 45degreesC. The accuracy of the TGA-DSC is good as long as the apparent diffusion coefficient is above 10(-9) m(2)/s. When this threshold value is overstepped, the desorption isotherms are overestimated.

AB Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-Blockers) are frequently prescribed medications in the United States and have been identified in European municipal wastewater effluent, however no studies to date have investigated these compounds in United States wastewater effluent. Municipal wastewater effluent was collected from treatment facilities in Mississippi, Texas, and New York to investigate the occurrence of metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol. Propranolol was identified in all wastewater samples analyzed (n = 34) at concentrations less than or equal to 1.9 mug/l. Metoprolol and nadolol were identified in greater than or equal to 71% of the samples with concentrations of metoprolol less than or equal to 1.2 mug/l and nadolol less than or equal to 0.36 mug/l. Time course studies at both Mississippi plants and the Texas plant indicate that concentrations of propranolol, metoprolol, and nadolol remain relatively constant at each sampling period. This study indicates that beta-Blockers are present in United States wastewater effluent in the ng/l to mug/l range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distribution and behavior of selected pharmaceutical chemicals, including analgesics of the phenazone type and the most popular psychomotor stimulant, caffeine, have been determined in raw sewage and sewage effluents from treatment plants of several Croatian cities using gas chromatography with mass selective detection. The concentration of caffeine in untreated municipal sewage was rather high and relatively uniform (40-100 mug L-1). In contrast, the concentration of the most abundant phenazone compound, propyphenazone, was much lower and varied in a wider range (<0.1-1.0 mug L-1). Removal rate of caffeine during biological sewage treatment was very high (95-99%), while the elimination of propyphenazone was rather modest (<44%).

AB Activated sludge reactor is commonly employed for the secondary treatment of industrial wastewater, showing a high purification yield, operating simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, industrial wastewater generally contain numerous organic and inorganic compounds which are not biodegradable; heavy metals are often found in effluents from electroplating and metal-processing industries, manufacturing of paints, plastics, scientific instruments, salts are found in wastewater from production of pesticides, pharmaceutical and food industry, waste-dump percolating water. Primary treatments are often designed to reduce heavy metal and salt contents in wastewater, nevertheless trace concentrations persist and may reach the biological reactor, resulting in biomass inhibition and dramatic loss in purification efficiency. Respirometry through Oxygen Uptake Rate measurement is one of the most rapid and reliable methods to assess the inhibition of activated sludge. In previous studies toxicity tests for specific compounds have been performed following different procedures and attaining heterogeneous results. In this work a simple modification of the configuration is proposed, in order to assess in real time the toxicity and the inhibiting effect of the incoming wastewater before it reaches the reactor. A sample is drawn from the influent and a respirometric test is performed on mixed liquor collected from the reactor itself. If the inhibition exceeds the limit, the influent is sent to storage and to an alternative treatment. Preliminary experiments were carried out with bench-scale CSTR, supplied with synthetic wastewater. Copper sulphate and sodium chloride were chosen as inhibiting compounds, supplied separately to batch samples of activated sludge in shock load at different concentrations. Copper concentration in the mixed liquor was measured by atomic absorption and salt concentration was determined through conductance measures. Inhibition up to 90% was evaluated by OUR test with short response time, demonstrating the suitability of this tool to a real time toxicity bioassay for activated sludge reactor.

AB A multi-component screening analysis method for polar to medium-polar water pollutants was developed. Sample clean-up and group separation are performed by sequential solid-phase extraction ( SSPE) using automated SPE with C18 and polymeric sorbent materials. Analyses are performed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) using a single-quadrupole instrument. More than 90 priority compounds of environmental interest - comprising the most important chemical and substance classes: phenols, carboxylic acids, aromatic sulfonates, aromatic amines, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, dyes, and pesticides - have been chosen for the experiments. The compounds are divided by the SSPE procedure into 3 different polarity classes. The extraction recoveries were determined in the 3 fractions for every single substance, and were for most of the analytes in the range of 50-100%. A mixture of hexane - dichloromethane was used for the elution of nonpolar compounds like alkylphenols from C18. Methanol and acetone are well suited for the elution of more polar substances. The limits of detection (LODs) were determined for all compounds. Effluents from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treating waste water from textile industries, and the corresponding receiving waters ( rivers and lakes) have been analysed with the developed method. Urban and industrial pollution was observed in rivers and streams in the area north of Milan, Italy. In the water samples different phenols (nitrophenols, bisphenol A, nonylphenol), alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, their metabolites with endocrine disrupting potential, aromatic sulfonates, linear alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants, dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and a dichlorobenzidine compound were identified.

ID METHANOGENIC ACTIVITY
AB Effects of a chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater on performance of an anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), activity of acetoclastic methanogens and microbial composition were evaluated under various influent compositions. Initially, the CSTR was fed with glucose up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 6 kg COD/m(3) (.) d corresponding to an F/M ratio of 0.43 with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 days. A COD removal efficiency of 92% and a methane yield of 0.32 m(3) CH4/kg CODremoved were achieved whilst specific methanogenic activity (SMA) was found to be 336 mL CH4/gTVS (.) d. After the CSTR was fed with pre-aerated wastewater diluted by glucose in different dilution ratios of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v), 70% (w/v), and 100% (w/v) pre-aerated wastewater, gradual decreases in COD removal efficiency to 71%, methane yield to 0.28 m(3) CH4/kg CODremoved and SMA to 166 mL CH4/gTVS (.) d occurred whilst volatile fatty acid concentration reached to 1474 mg/L. After the raw wastewater diluted with the pre-aerated wastewater was fed into the CSTR in increasing ratios of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v), and 60% (w/v), there was a proportional deterioration in performance in terms of COD removal efficiency, methane yield and acetoclastic methanogenic activity. Epifluorescence microscopy of the seed sludge revealed that Methanococcus-like species, short, and medium rods were found to be equally dominant. The short and medium rod species remained equally dominant groups in the CSTR throughout the feeding regime whilst Methanococcus-like species and long rods were found to be in insignificant numbers at the end of the study. Changes in archael diversity were determined using molecular analyses such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and denaturent gradient gel clectrophoresis (DGGE). Results showed that overall archeal diversity did not change much whereas changes in composition of eubacterial population occurred.

AB The performance of a sequencing batch biofilter integrating anaerobic/aerobic conditions in one tank to treat a pharmaceutical wastewater effluent was studied. A pilot reactor, packed with a porous volcanic stone (puzzolane) was used in the study. The reactor operated as a sequencing batch biofilter, SBB, with reaction times varying for the anaerobic stage from 8 to 24 h and for the aerobic one from 4 to 12 h. The volume of exchange was from 16 to 88%. The pharmaceutical wastewater contained organic chemicals including phenols and o-nitroaniline, a concentration of organic matter that varied from 28,400 to 72,200 mg/L (as total COD), 280 to 605 mg N-NH4/L, and 430 to 650 mg SST/L. In order to acclimatize the microorganisms to the industrial wastewater, the organic load was increased stepwise from 1 to 7.7 kg COD/m(3)/d. The adequate time was obtained when the removal efficiency of COD reached 80% or more. Maximal removal loads, associated to high removal efficiencies (95-97% as COD), varied from 4.6 to 5.7 kg COD/m(3)/d. Under these conditions color removal was 80% as Pt-Co units. Microtox analysis was performed to the wastewater and to the anaerobic and aerobic stages. It was observed that the aerobic stage was the responsible for wastewater detoxification. Results showed that the anaerobic/aerobic SBB was able to treat efficiently initial concentrations of the raw effluent up to 28,400 mg COD/L.

AB Raw mixed pharmaceutical industry and domestic wastewater characteristics are such as BOD5 = 90-130 mg L-1, COD = 200-300 mg L-1, SS = 900 mg L-1, PH = 6.4-6.8, T = 20degreesC, NH3=26 mg L-1, PO43- = 8.5 mg L-1. In treatment plant, the parameters such as BOD5, NH3, PO43-, SS, MLVSS, pH, temperature, sludge volume and microorganisms predominance are studied, under constant sedimentation time (30 min) against variable aeration times. As a second step, the same parameters are studied under the constant aeration time (4 h) against variable sedimentation times. Effluent concentrations from sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are determined BOD5 = 13-18 mg L-1, COD = 25-37 mg L-1, SS = 9-21 mg L-1, pH = 7.3-7.6, TDF = 1-2, T = 23degreesC, NH3 = 1 mg L-1, PO43- = 8.1 mg L-1. At the end of 6 h of aeration time, the efficiency of BOD5 reaches to 83%. The efficiency of BOD5 reaches to 81% under a 4 h aeration time and at 90 min sedimentation time. As a result, the optimum treatment efficiency has been taken under 4 h of aeration time and of 60 min of sedimentation time.

AB In this overview chapter we will focus on the importance of emerging contaminants and their presence in the environment, as well as giving a description of this book. The environmental issue of emerging contaminants is tied to the analysis of wastewater samples using the new analytical methods of the last decade, especially LC/MS and LC/MS/MS. Thus, this book focuses on applications of LC/MS/MS to analyze unknowns in the aquatic environment. Emerging contaminants are defined as compounds that are not currently covered by existing regulations of water quality, that have not been previously studied, and that are thought to be a possible threat to environmental health and safety.. In particular the compounds that are addressed include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, and pesticide degradates. The book has three main sections that address these issues with special attention to the analytical methods of mass spectrometry (such as triple quadrupoles, ion-traps, and quadrupole time-of-flight analyzers). All the different important aspects on today's emerging contaminants have been covered throughout the chapters.

The methods include solid phase extraction (SPE) that acts as a cleanup and concentrates the sample a thousand-fold. The samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using two mass spectrometry techniques, MS/MS to confirm the presence of the pharmaceuticals in the samples and MRM to quantitate. Identification of nine out of ten compounds was found in both the city of Lawrence, KS influent and effluent wastewater samples. Kansas River water showed the presence of seven out of ten compounds and in tap water five out of ten compounds were detected. (C) 2003 American Chemical Society.

AB A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method for the determination of 11 selected acidic pharmaceuticals in sewage influent and effluent at trace levels has been developed. The drugs studied were salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, gemfibrozil, fenoprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, fenofibrate, and indomethacin, which are commonly used as analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents or lipid regulators. The antibacterial agent triclosan was also included in this study. A solid-phase extraction procedure using the Waters Oasis HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) cartridge was optimized for the extraction and elution of these compounds. The acids were then converted into their trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Final analysis was performed with a Mass Selective Detector in the EI/SIM (electron impact/selected ion monitoring) mode. Recoveries of the drugs in spiked distilled water samples at 1 and 0.1 mug/L levels were better than 80%. Similar recoveries of the drugs were obtained from fortified final effluent samples except for acetaminophen, which could not be recovered even if the extraction. was performed immediately. The detection limits for the drugs, based on a concentration factor of 1000, were between 10 and 20 ng/L. A stability study indicated that, except for salicylic acid and acetaminophen, the other acidic pharmaceuticals were better than 75% recovered after the samples had been stored at 4degreesC in the dark for up to seven days. This method has been applied to quantify acidic drugs in waste-water samples collected from several sewage treatment plants in Ontario. While clofibric acid, acetaminophen, fenoprofen, and fenofibrate have never been detected, the other eight compounds were found in nearly all the influent and effluent samples, from low mug/L to low ng/L levels. Eight sewage treatment plants removed from 0 to 98% of these drugs from the influent.

AB The impact of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the biotreatment of a chemical synthesis wastewater emerging from a pharmaceutical industry was studied. The aim of this addition was to decrease inhibitory and non-biodegradable organics. In the first step, PAC was directly added to activated sludge. In the next step, the wastewater was first contacted with PAC and then treated in an activated sludge reactor. COD, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral measurements were carried out for the evaluation of performance. Direct PAC addition and PAC pretreatment led to similar results, but direct PAC addition was considered more practical than pretreatment with PAC. With the addition of PAC, the level of non-biodegradable matter and the colour of the wastewater were significantly reduced. In any case, the addition of PAC increased the OUR of activated sludge, indicating that inhibition could be decreased. The combined evaluation of OUR, spectral parameters and COD gave a better insight into the processes taking place than the COD parameter alone.

AB CPKelco ApS, Denmark is the largest pectin plant in the world and the second largest refined carrageenan plant. The products are used for texturising purposes, primarily within the food industry, but also within the pharmaceutical industry. The products are extracted from imported natural raw materials, like dried citrus peel and special seaweed plants. In the production processes a considerable amount of water and energy are used. The excess water from the production processes is led to CPKelco's own WWTP, which is one of the largest industrial WWTPs in Denmark.
   In order to obtain higher process stability and lower energy consumption in the WWTP, CPKelco decided to change the nitrogen removal process from a conventional nitrification/denitrification process to a nitration/denitration process, which comprises an oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and a controlled reduction of nitrite to N-2. Theoretically this process will decrease the oxygen consumption for oxidation by 25% and the use of carbon source for the reduction will be decreased by 40% compared to the conventional process.
   This paper presents and discusses the experiences and results from three year's continuous operation of the nitration/denitration process in an activated sludge plant, and the overall performance results are discussed in relation to the previous results. Accordingly the implementation of the nitration/denitration process was done successfully, and today the plant operates with much higher process stability than obtained before, and even the most stringent effluent requirements for nitrogen can be obtained.

AB A reliable wastewater characterization is an integral part of treatment and management strategies for industrial effluents. This is especially true for the pharmaceutical industry, which exhibits significant differences in its line of activity, generating effluents of very specific and complex natures. Any hazard or risk assessment of wastewater and/or determination of its treatability must include an evaluation of its degradability. Usually various non-standardized laboratory or pilot-scale long-term tests are run by measuring summary parameters for several days to determine the biodegradation potential of the effluent. A complex approach, based on stabilization studies, was proposed to determine the hazardous impact of wastewaters in terms of biodegradable and persistent toxicity.
   The objective of our work was to carry out complex hazard evaluation of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Whole effluent toxicity was determined using two different toxicity tests. First we measured the inhibition of, oxygen consumption by activated sludge. The test indicated toxicity of the wastewater and thus we performed an additional acute toxicity test with luminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri. The next step was the determination of whole effluent ready biodegradability. It was determined with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption (ISO 9804) and carbon dioxide production (ISO 9439); in a closed respirometer, accompanied by DOC/IC measurements. The pharmaceutical wastewater degraded readily (83%, lag phase was 2 days, biodegradation rate was 0.339 day(-1)) on the basis of O-2 measurements. The biodegradation,calculated from the CO2 measurements, was comparable. We also applied mass balances of DOC/IC at the beginning and at the end of biodegradation experiments to confirm the extent and rate of biodegradation. The determination of hazardous impact and treatability of the effluent was concluded: with aerobic stabilization studies. Biodegradation of the wastewater during the study was followed by relevant biochemical analysis and DOC/IC mass balance.

AB An environmental assessment is presented for the 25 most used pharmaceuticals in the National Health Service (NHS) in England in 2000. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the aquatic environment were calculated using conservative assumptions and all PECs exceeded 1 ng l(-1). The calculation of predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) based on aquatic toxicity data from the literature was possible for eleven of the pharmaceuticals. PNECs were predicted with ECOSAR for 12 of the remaining 14 but no data was available for two of the compounds. The PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded one for Paracetamol, Amoxycillin, Oxytetracycline and Mefenamic acid. Comparisons of the predicted concentrations of the compounds in sewage sludge based on either calculated sludge-water coefficients (K-d), octanol water coefficients (K-ow), acid base constants (pKa) or environmental modelling revealed large variations. No toxicity data was available for the terrestrial environment and no assessment was made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The activated sludge specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) and BOD5/COD ratios of biologically pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater were analyzed and compared to assess relative changes in biotreatability during ozonation at a rate of 7.4 g/(L x h) for 4 h. An appreciable COD removal (41%) was achieved by the initial biological treatment process, whereas ozonation was more effective in reducing the UV-sensitive aromatic compounds present in the pretreated effluent. Sequential treatment using activated sludge + ozonation processes resulted in an average COD removal efficiency of 48%, and a proceeding biotreatment stage increased the overall COD removal to 53%. An optimum ozone dose in the range of 1,8543,708 mg/L corresponding to a specific ozone input rate of 0.23-0.46 mg O-3/mg CODo existed where SOUR (3.7 x 10(-3) mg O-2/[mg MLSS x min] for ozonation at pH 8) and BOD5/COD (0.57) as well as the proceeding biological COD removal yield Y-COD (average 8 mg COD/mg MLSS) exerted maximum values.

AB Residues of three phenazone-type pharmaceuticals have been identified in routine analyses of groundwater samples from selected areas in the north-western districts of Berlin, Germany. Phenazone, propiphenazone, and dimethyl-aminophenazone have been detected in some wells at concentrations up to the low mug/1-level. Additionally, three phenazone-type metabolites namely 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenyihydrazide (AMDOPH), 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-phenylhydrazide, and dimethyloxalamide acid-(N'-methyl-N-phenyl)-hydrazide have also been identified in these groundwater samples. The residues are suspected to originate from former production spills of a pharmaceutical plant located in a city north of Berlin. It was observed that with the exception of AMDOPH all other residues were efficiently removed during conventional drinking water treatment. The drug metabolite AMDOPH deriving from dimethylaminophenazone residues was found at concentrations of 0.9 mug/1 in finished drinking water. However, a following study on the toxicological relevance of the AMDOPH residues has shown that there is no toxicological harm for humans at the low concentrations of AMDOPH observed in Berlin drinking water.

AB Five natural, pharmaceutical, or xenobiotic chemicals [17beta-estradiol (E2), ethynylestradiol (EE2), diethystilbestrol (DES), methoxychlor (MXC), nonylphenol (NP)] were tested in two in vitro assays [yeast estrogen screen (YES), MCF-7 breast tumor cell proliferation (E-Screen)], and compared with previously reported results from two in vivo male sheepshead minnow vitellogenin (VTG) production studies The purpose of this investigation was to determine how accurately the two in vitro assays predicted responses observed in live animals. EC50 values for all five chemicals were approximately one order of magnitude less sensitive in the YES assay than ill the MCF-7 assay. Based on the EC50 values, DES was 1.1 (YES) to 2.5 (MCF-7) times more potent in these receptor binding assays than was E2, while EE2 was slightly less potent than E2 in the YES assay (0.7) and nearly twice as potent (1.9) as E2 in the MCF-7 assay. EE2 and DES were of approximately equal potency in the 13-day sheepshead minnow VTG production bioassay. Both MXC and NP were 107 times less potent than E2 in the YES assay, MXC was 10(5) times less estrogenic than E2 in the MCF-7 assay, while both were approximately 100 times less potent than E2 in the live animal bioassay. The in vitro tests were substantially less sensitive (at least 1000 times) than the sheepshead minnow VTG assay for estimating estrogenic potency of the two xenobiotic chemicals, which suggests that in vitro-based, large-scale screening programs could potentially result in many false negative evaluations.

AB In urban areas such as Berlin (Germany) with high municipal sewage water discharges and low surface water flows there is a potential risk of drinking water contamination by polar organic compounds when groundwater recharge is used in drinking water production. Thus, some pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are not eliminated completely in the municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) and they are discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. In terms of several monitoring studies carried out in Berlin between 1996 and 2000, PhACs such as clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, primidone and carbamazepine were detected at individual concentrations up to the mu/I-level in influent and effluent samples from STPs and in all surface water samples collected downstream from the STPs. Under recharge conditions, several compounds were also found at individual concentrations up to 7.3 mug/I in samples collected from groundwater aquifers near to contaminated water courses. A few of the PhACs were also identified at the ng/I-level in Berlin tap water samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FORECASTS; MODELS; RISK
AB The heavy civil engineering industry (railways, sewage-treatment, chemical and pharmaceutical facilities, oil and gas facilities, etc.) is one of the major contributors to the British economy and generally involves a high level of investment. Clients in this industry are demanding accurate cost estimates, proper analysis of out-turn cost and cost escalation, and a high quality risk analysis throughout the construction processes. Current practices in the industry have suggested that there is a lack of structured methodologies and systematic cost escalation approaches to achieve an appropriate cost analysis at the outset Of projects and throughout the construction processes. In this context the prime objective of this research work is to develop a structured cost escalation methodology for improving estimating management and control in the heavy engineering industry construction processes. The methodology is composed of a forecasting model to predict cost indices of major items in industry and a risk knowledge-base model for identifying and quantifying causes of cost escalations. This paper reviews and discusses a knowledge based model for applying a cost escalation factor The cost escalation factor is made up of market variation, a risk element, and a component for bias. A knowledge elicitation strategy was employed to obtain the required knowledge for the model. The strategy included questionnaires, interviews, and workshops, and deliverables came in the form of influences and their effect on project cost escalation. From these deliverables, a decision support system and specifications for applying cost escalation to base estimates are presented.

AB The mass flows of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) were investigated in the aqueous compartments of the Glatt Valley Watershed a densely populated region in Switzerland The major human use HIS consumed in Switzerland ciprofloxacin (CIP) and norfloxacin (NOR) were determined in municipal wastewater effluents and in the receiving surface water the Glatt River Individual concentrations in raw sewage and in final wastewater effluents ranged from 255 to 568 ng/L and from 36 to 106 ng/L respectively In the Glatt River the HIS were present at concentrations below 19 ng/L The removal of FQs from the water stream during wastewater treatment was between 79 and 87% During the studied summer period FQs in the dissolved fraction were significantly reduced downstream in the Glatt River (15-20 h residence time) (66% for CIP and 48% for NOR) Thus after wastewater treatment transport in rivers causes an additional decrease of residual levels of FQs in the aquatic environment Refined predicted environmental concentrations for the study area compare favorably with the measured environmental concentrations (MEC) obtained in the monitoring study Total measured FQ concentrations occurring in the examined aquatic compartments of the Glatt Valley Watershed were related to acute ecotoxicity data from the literature The risk quotients obtained (MEC/PNEC < 1) following the recommendations of the European guidelines or draft documents suggest a low probability for adverse effects of the occurring HIS either on microbial activity in WWTPs or on algae daphnia and fish in surface waters.

AB Concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects on reproductive health and immune status of farm animals following exposure to a range of natural and synthetic environmental compounds that disrupt normal hormonal actions. These compounds range from natural plant oestrogens (e.g. genistein, coumesterol) and mycoestrogens (e.g. Aflatoxins, zearalenone) to growth promoting pharmaceuticals (e.g. trenbolone acetate, melengastrol acetate) to chemicals spread in water, sewage sludge or the atmosphere such as detergents and surfactants (e.g. octylphenol, nonylphenol), plastics (e.g. bisphenol-A, phthalates), pesticides (e.g. methoxychlor, dieldrin, DDT) and industrial chemicals (e.g. PCB, TCDD). These compounds are commonly termed 'endocrine disrupting compounds' (EDCs) or 'endocrine disruptors' due to their ability to act as either hormone agonists or antagonists or the ability to disrupt hormone synthesis, storage or metabolism. A similar group of compounds are called 'immunotoxicants' and are thought to affect the immune system mainly by disrupting B and T cell homeostasis. As more studies are performed it is becoming clear that many compounds can directly or indirectly affect both the endocrine and immune systems. The susceptibility of target tissues is related to the stage of development, the cumulative exposure dose and the immune status of the individual. While some of the effects of the EDCs on the endocrine and immune systems are quite distinct, many are subtle and identifying the causative agent from the vast array of environmental challenges including EDCs, nutrition, temperature, etc. can be problematic. Identifying the causative agent is confounded by the possibility that effects that are observed in the adult may be due to exposure to EDCs during fetal life. This has major implications for the determination of universal end-point measurements to assess exposure to EDCs in farm animals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Most of the projected global population increases will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, the various water uses (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, environmental protection, and economics are key factors. More storage of water behind dams and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground as groundwater, its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and other sources and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. In irrigated areas, groundwater levels may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well systems to prevent waterlogging and salinization of soil. Salty drainage waters must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This "virtual" water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social, ecological, or economic returns or saved for the future. Climate changes in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emission are difficult to predict in space and time. Resulting uncertainties require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surpluses, water shortages, and weather extremes. Long-term storage behind dams and in aquifers may be required. Rising sea levels will present problems in coastal areas.

AB In military out of area missions of the Bundeswehr, it can be necessary to produce drinking water even from highly polluted surface waters containing a variety of organic, inorganic, and microbiological contaminants, Thus, mobile drinking water purification systems must be able to remove such contaminants as far as possible to meet the requirements of the German and European drinking water regulation/directive, Presently, two novel drinking water purification units applying membrane filtration undergo intensive long-term trials carried out by the Bundeswehr. If these trials positively proof the functionality of these units and their ability to remove all possible contaminants they shall substitute so far available devices which use large amounts of chemicals and charcoal filtration for water purification. In the course of a research project, the functionality of the new devices and their efficacy to remove high amounts of algae, microbes, and organic and inorganic pollutants are additionally tested in "worst-case" field studies. In September 2000, the first mobile drinking water purification unit was tested at the Teltowkanal in Berlin, Germany. This canal was chosen because it carries high burdens of municipal sewage effluents. The results from the fatigue test confirmed the ability of the water purification unit to reduce the concentrations of all contaminants meeting the maximum tolerance levels set by the German/European drinking water regulation, The pre-filtration device was very effective in removing algae and solid particles to protect the membranes from clogging and to enable an almost maintenance-free operation, Residues of pharmaceuticals and some other organic contaminants have almost totally been removed from the surface water where they were detected at individual concentrations up to the mug/L-level.

AB The bactericide triclosan and methyl triclosan, an environmental transformation product thereof, were detected in lakes and in a river in Switzerland at concentrations of up to 74 and 2 ng L-1, respectively. Both compounds were emitted via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), with methyl triclosan probably being formed by biological methylation. A regional mass balance for a lake (Greifensee) indicated significant removal of triclosan by processes other than flushing. Laboratory experiments showed that triclosan in the dissociated form was rapidly decomposed in lake water when exposed to sunlight (half-life less than 1 h in August at 47degrees latitude). Methyl triclosan and nondissociated triclosan, however, were relatively stable toward photodegradation. Modeling these experimental data for the situation of lake Greifensee indicated that photodegradation can account for the elimination of triclosan from the lake and suggested a seasonal dependence of the concentrations (lower in summer, higher in winter), consistent with observed concentrations. Although emissions of methyl triclosan from WWTPs were only approximate to2% relative to those of triclosan, its predicted concentration relative to triclosan in the epilimnion of the lake increases to 30% in summer. Passive sampling with semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) indicated the presence of methyl triclosan in lakes with inputs from anthropogenic sources but not in a remote mountain lake. Surprisingly, no parent triclosan was observed in the SPMDs from these lakes. Methyl triclosan appears to be preferentially accumulated in SPMDs under the conditions in these lakes, leading to concentrations comparable to those of persistent chlorinated organic pollutants.

AB Analyses were conducted on four pharmaceutical compounds, representing different therapeutic classes, to evaluate the presence and potential adverse human health effects of trace levels of these substances in aqueous environmental media. Acetylsalicylic acid, clofibrate, cyclophosphamide, and indomethacin have been detected in aqueous environmental media including sewage treatment plant effluent, surface water, drinking water, and groundwater. An extensive literature search and chemical-specific risk assessments were performed to assess the potential human health significance of each compound's individual presence in environmental media. Safe water quality limits were estimated for each pharmaceutical by following the USEPA Methodology for Deriving Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health and were compared to the concentrations found in the environment. The calculation of the provisional ambient water quality criteria involved estimation of human exposure to contaminated water, including intake via bioaccumulation in fish, and calculation of cancer risk and non-cancer hazard indices. Parameters detailing the toxicological and pharmacological nature, exposure assessment, and environmental fate and transport of each pharmaceutical were also considered. The overall conclusion was that based on available data, no,appreciable risk to humans exists, as the detected concentrations of each of these pharmaceutical compounds found in aqueous media were far below the derived safe limits.

AB The performance of an upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated under various operating conditions. During start-up, the UAF was initially fed by glucose till an organic loading rate (OLR) of approximately 7.5 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) with a hydraulic retention time of 2.3 days. A soluble COD removal efficiency of 98% was achieved before the addition of the wastewater. Initially, the filter inertia was acclimatized to the wastewater by sequential feeding of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v) and 70% (w/v) of the pre-aerated wastewater mixed with glucose followed by a 100% (w/v) pre-aerated wastewater. During the operation, the COD removal efficiency and methane yield decreased to 75% and 0.30 m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved respectively. As the UAF became accustomed to the pre-aerated wastewater, raw wastewater was fed in increasing ratios of 20% (w/v), 60% (w/v) and 80% (w/v) with the pre-aerated wastewater as the remaining part. During this stage of the operation, a COD removal efficiency in a range of 77-86% was achieved and the methane yield decreased to 0.24 m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved. Finally, 100% (w/v) raw wastewater was fed and a COD removal efficiency of 65% was achieved with a methane yield of 0.20m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved. At the end of the operation, acetoclastic methanogenic activity was only measured in the bottom section of the UAF, this showed a 90% reduction in comparison with activity of inoculation sludge. Microscopic examinations revealed that rod-shaped methanogens remained as the dominant species whereas Methanosarcina-like species and filaments were present only in insignificant numbers along the UAF.

AB The presence of carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepilectic drug, has been reported in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents as a result of its low biodegradability. In the present work, the persistence of CBZ in aquatic environment with respect to abiotic transformation processes along with its toxicity and capability of accumulating in single aquatic organisms (algae) are evaluated. The possibility of removing CBZ from STP effluents is studied by characterizing its ozonation process through the assessment of kinetics and the distribution of oxidation products.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the aquatic environment has been recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry. In some investigations carried out in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, England, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the U.S., more than 80 compounds, pharmaceuticals and several drug metabolites, have been detected in the aquatic environment, Several PhACs From various prescription classes have been found at concentrations up to the mug/l-level in sewage influent and effluent samples and also in several surface waters located downstream from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). The studies show that some PhACs originating from human therapy are not eliminated completely in the municipal STPs and are, thus, discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. Under recharge conditions, polar PhACs Such as clofibric acid, carbamazepine, primidone or iodinated contrast agents can leach through the subsoil and have also been detected in several groundwater samples in Germany. Positive findings of PhACs have, however, also been reported in groundwater contaminated by landfill leachates or manufacturing residues. To date, only in a few cases PhACs have also been detected at trace-levels in drinking water samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC; CAS 5466-77-3) were extrapolated for Switzerland, taking into consideration substance-specific environmental fate data and marketing estimates, by crude worst-case reckoning and by applying two environmental models (Mackay Level III; USES 3.0), both configured for Swiss hydrological and area data. By worst-case reckoning the summer PEC is 70.8-81.3 ng/l while for the remaining 8 months of the year the PEC is 13.1-15.1 ng/l. The Level III model results in concentrations of 2.4 ng/l during the summer and 0.44 ng/l during the rest of the year, while the USES 3.0 model gives an average PEC for the whole year of 7.6 ng/l. Pooling summer monitoring data (90 single analyses) from the River Rhine below Basel in the year 1997 (Water Protection Board of Basel) and From Lakes Zurich and Huttner in 1998 (Poiger et al., in preparation) allowed a derivation of a probabilistic median concentration of 4.6 ng/l, a 95th-percentile concentration of 18.6 ng/l and a 99th-percentile concentration of 33.5 ng/l. The 6-fold range from the median value to the maximum calls for caution in interpreting published monitoring concentrations. Comparison of modelled PECs with realistic median concentrations shows that crude reckoning overestimates actual concentrations by a factor of about 10, probably through insufficient consideration of (further) degradation of EHMC in sewage works, surface waters, sediments or river batiks. Both computer models, in contrast, are within the same order of magnitude as the actual summer concentrations. Based on the available data, both these environmental fate and distribution models give realistic PECs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Geo-referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for European Rivers (GREAT-ER) model was developed as an aquatic chemical exposure prediction tool for use within environmental risk assessment (ERA) schemes and river basin management. The GREAT-ER software calculates the distribution of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) Of consumer chemicals in surface waters, for individual river stretches, as well as representative average PECs for entire catchments. The system uses an ARC/INFO-ArcView ((R)ESRI) based Geographical Information System (GIS) for data storage and visualization, combined with simple mathematical models for prediction of chemical rate. Use Of GREAT-ER 1.03 to derive PECs is illustrated for Ethinyl Oestradiol, Paracetamol, Aspirin. Dextropropoxyphene, Clofibrate and Oxytetracycline in three river basins, i.e. Aire (UK), Lambro (Italy) and Rur (Germany). In contrast with household consumer chemicals the transformation of pharmaceuticals in the human body needs to be incorporated in the emission estimation. The 'PECinitial' of these pharmaceuticals in surface waters ranges from > 1 mug/l (Oxytetracycline and Paracetarnol) down to < 1 ng/l (Ethinyl Oestradiol). Risk characterization employing PECs or measured environmental concentrations (MECs) and predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PTNECs) from available ecotoxicity data is also reported.

AB Drugs, i.e. active ingredients of human medicinal products, may be introduced into the environment after use in patients by sewage effluent pathways and consequently are detected at low concentrations in sewage effluents and in surface waters. Legal requirements in a number of geographical regions (Europe, US, and intended in Canada) demand environmental risk assessments (ERA) for new drug substances. Existing regulatory concepts of ERA are based initially on a set of short-term ecotoxicological studies in three to four different species, environmental behavior and the application of assessment factors to correct for the ERA inherent uncertainty. Based on theoretical considerations and the experience with a very limited, but well investigated, number of examples while considering that drugs are highly biologically active compounds, the appropriateness of this risk assessment procedure for all drug substances might be questioned. Indeed, e.g. long-term effects may occur at much lower concentrations and follow different toxicodynamic mechanism than extrapolated from short-term studies., In such cases, the application of assessment factors for deriving chronic no-observed effect concentration (NOECs) appears to be problematic. Although long-term tests with a variety of organisms would provide a complete database for the evaluation of the environmental risks, this is unachievable for all drugs due to time, money and animal welfare constraints. In order to avoid unnecessary testing, a concept is presented, which makes use of pharmacological and toxicological, as well as pharmaco- and toxicokinetic information derived from mammals during drug substance development. Useful data for adoption in a case-by-case testing strategy can be obtained by evaluating (a) the pharmacological activity, which indicates specific targets in mammalian species and may allow for an analysis, whether a similar target is available in aquatic species; (b) the mammalian toxicity, which may indicate, which targets are most susceptible to adverse effects; (c) the difference between acute and chronic effects in mammals, since the magnitude of this difference may indicate, whether long-term effects are expected at significantly lower levels than acute effects; (d) the (pharmacologically and toxicologically) effective plasma levels in mammalian test organisms, which may be compared with the relevant exposure scenario for the environment. Additionally, activity classes of compounds may be established based on experience with specific substances, in order to develop an appropriate test strategy. The above preliminary considerations should support decisions on the selection of candidate substances for chronic effects studies and for the appropriate selection of test species and endpoints to monitor. Generally. ecologically relevant endpoints such as impairment of growth, development and reproduction should be used to assess the ecotoxicologic effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

DE pharmaceuticals; environmental risk assessment; European Union; tiered
   assessment; Draft Guideline 2001
AB Since 1993, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for a new drug application has been Stipulated by EU Directive 93/39/EEC amending Directive 65/65/EEC. In early 2001, after several unpublished draft versions for an ERA guideline, a draft guideline/discussion paper for an ERA for non-GMO-containing drugs was published by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The draft guideline describes a step-wise. tiered procedure for the ERA. The first tier consists of deriving a crude predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in the aquatic compartment for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or its major metabolites, based on predicted amounts used and specific removal rates in sewage treatment or surface waters. If this crude PEC is <0.01 mug/l and no environmental concerns are apparent, no further assessment is deemed necessary. Else, in the second tier, a crude predicted no-effect level (PNEC) for the aquatic compartment is to be extrapolated by dividing the lowest 50%-effect concentration from acute ecotoxicity tests with algae, daphnia or fish (EC50, LC50) by an assessment factor (usually 1000). If the ratio PEC/PNEC is < 1, no further assessment is deemed necessary. Lastly, in the third tier, further considerations on a case-by-case basis are needed. This may encompass refining the environmental fate information and thereby the PEC, considering further environmental compartments and their respective PECs (up to and including field studies), but also refining the PNEC. While the ERA addresses mainly the API, excipients of the formulated drug should be considered as well. In the case of medicinal products, the benefit for patients has relative precedence over environmental risks, meaning that even in the case of an unacceptable residual risk for new drugs after third-tier considerations, prohibition of a new API is not taken into consideration. Instead, possible mitigating or precautionary safety measures may consist of specific product labelling (i.e. package leaflets for the patients regarding returning and proper disposal of unused medicines), restricted use through in-hospital or in-surgery administration under supervision only, or the recommendation of environmental analytical monitoring up to ecological field studies.

AB An anaerobic immobilized fixed bed bioreactor system was studied for treatment of herbal-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The biofilm loss rate (R-S), shear stress (a), biofilm thickness (L-i) and biomass concentration (X-t) were investigated for various flow rates applied to the bioreactor during the experimental studies. Some relationships applicable to a fixed bed reactor were obtained between biofilm loss rate, shear stress, biofilm thickness and specific flow rate (Q) with good accuracy. It was evident that shear stress and biofilm loss rate increased with increase in biofilm thickness. A similar trend was also observed with an increase in flow velocity. It was found that shear stress plays a major role in the biofilm detachment mechanism, The biofilm. thickness determined in the present investigation was,in the range of 0.5 nun to 3.5 mm, and the biofilm. loss rate was estimated in the range of 1.7 x 10(-4) to 73 x 10(-4) kgCOD m(-2)d(-1) at flow rate ranging between 5.0 and 50 1 d(-1).

Compared with the strategy that started up the reactor directly using chloromycetin wastewater, the strategy that started up the reactor first using mixed wastewater and then using chloromycetin wastewater could save time by 23%. When the latter strategy was adopted the development of sludge activity fluctuated more largely and its final activity was lower, but the Sludge grew faster in the course of start-up.

AB Ramat Hovav is a major chemical industrial park manufacturing pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and various aliphatic and aromatic halogens. All wastewater streams are collected in large evaporation ponds. Salinity in the evaporation ponds fluctuates between 3% (w/v) and saturation and pH values range between 2.0 and 10.0. We looked for microorganisms surviving in these extreme environmental conditions and found that 2 yeast strains dominate this biotope. 18S rDNA sequence analysis identified the isolates as Pichia guilliermondii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Both isolates grew in NaCl concentrations ranging up to 3.5 M and 2.5 M, respectively, and at a pH range of 2-10. There was a distinct difference between the Rhodotorula and Pichia strains and S. cerevisiae RS16 that served as a control strain with respect to accumulation of osmoregulators and internal ion concentrations when exposed to osmotic stress. The Pichia and Rhodotorula strains maintained high glycerol concentration also in media low in NaCl. Utilization of various carbon sources was examined. Using a tetrazolium-based assay we show that the Rhodotorula and Pichia strains are capable of utilizing a wide range of different carbon sources including anthracene, phenanthrene, and other cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

AB To provide the first nationwide reconnaissance of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in water resources, the U.S. Geological Survey used five newly developed analytical methods to measure concentrations of 95 OWCs in water samples from a network of 139 streams across 30 states during 1999 and 2000. The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams susceptible to contamination (i.e. downstream of intense urbanization and livestock production). OWCs were prevalent during this study, being found in 80% of the streams sampled. The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential, industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 OWCs being found during this study. The most frequently detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid), cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent metabolite). Measured concentrations for this study were generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines, drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria. Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines established. The detection of multiple OWCs was common for this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs being found in a given water sample. Little is known about the potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of OWCs in the environment. In addition, results of this study demonstrate the importance of obtaining data on metabolites to fully understand not only the fate and transport of OWCs in the hydrologic system but also their ultimate overall effect on human health and the environment.

AB The success of the newly developed methodology to evaluate anaerobic biodegradability of organic compounds using the Micro Oxymax respirometer and TOC analyzer made this method potentially useful for a variety of investigations. Regarding the many parameters measured during the experiment in the liquid and gas phases, the method provides good insight into the kinetics of anaerobic process and accurate mass balance, which could be obtained at any time during the assay. This method was used for determining of anaerobic biodegradability of the waste from the pharmaceutical industry-waste fermentation broth, and for the proposal of operational parameters for the start-up of the continuous process. The tests were performed in 250 ml vials at a wide range of initial substrate loading ratios (0.05-4.6 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1)). The average biodegradability of the substrate was 92% at initial loading ratios between 0.05 and 1.7 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1). At higher initial loading ratios 2,3 g(TOC) g(VSS)(-1) and more, the inhibition of anaerobic biodegradation was detected. Retention times needed for a 70% and 85% degradation efficiency were evaluated and used as a proposal for the starting-up substrate loading rate of the continuous reactor operation. An optimum initial substrate mass concentration without an inhibition effect was estimated and the fraction of methane gas in produced biogas was calculated for each initial loading.

AB The stabilities of the bacterial community structures supported by seven full-scale biological reactors treating pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Effluent quality from this treatment process was consistently high with respect to BOD5 (<30 mg l(-1)), soluble COD (< 500 mg l(-1)). and total ammonia (<5 mg l(-1) as N) concentrations. Long-term community structure stability was studied by comparing the similarity of PCR-DGGE fingerprints from samples collected 87 days apart between which the influent wastewater characteristics were relatively stable. The Dice index (C-s) of similarity was moderately high for the first four reactors (C-s = 0.61-0.77) and very high for the last three reactors (C-s = 0.89-0.91). Short-term community structure stability was studied by comparing PCR-DGGE fingerprints from samples collected 15 days apart between which the influent wastewater characteristics changed significantly, while the effluent quality remained consistently high, The bacterial community composition of each of the seven bioreactors showed a moderate community shift (C-s = 0.70-0.76). Short-term variability in influent wastewater composition, therefore, affected a greater community shift than did long-term operation treating a wastewater of relatively consistent composition. These results indicate that functionally stable wastewater treatment bioreactors have stable microbial community structures under normal operating conditions but are able to adapt in response to perturbations to sustain high effluent quality.

AB Five acidic drugs (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac) were chosen in order to determine their behavior in a sewage treatment plant (STP). An analytical method using solid phase extraction (SPE) and a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used. The results show that four pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid and diclofenac) are not well removed by treatment in Swiss STPs. Maximum concentration in the effluent was determined for mefenamic acid up to 1.0 mug/L. This component seems to be relevant in Swiss STPs effluents and we can expect its presence in surface waters.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media are pharmaceuticals which are biologically inert and metabolically stable during their passage through the body and are excreted almost completely within a day into waste water. They are not readily biodegradable. However, in a test system simulating sewage treatment, we were able to show that the model compound iopromide (N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-5-methoxyacetylamino-N-methyliso-phthalamide) was amenable to primary degradation. The resulting degradation product (5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-N-methyliso-phthalamide) showed a faster photolysis than the parent compound. Additionally this product was further degraded in a test system simulating surface water conditions. Short-term toxicity of the primary degradation product was low, i.e. no effects on any of various aquatic species could be found even at concentrations of I g l(-1). Additionally no chronic toxicity of the degradation product was observed in an early-life stage test with zebrafish at the highest tested concentration of 100 mg l(-1). Based on the results from model systems a degradation pathway for iopromide is postulated. Though further work showing the transferability of the laboratory results to environmental conditions is necessary the presently available information on the environmental fate and effects of iopromide and its degradation products do not provide evidence of a risk for aquatic life caused by the introduction of this contrast medium into waste water.

AB The scope of this study was directed to examine different wastewater treatment technologies (activated sludge, trickling filter, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis) at full-scale facilities in Arizona and California leading to indirect potable reuse and their capability to remove pharmaceuticals Additionally, the fate of selected pharmaceuticals was studied during soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) at sites where secondary and tertiary treated effluents are used for subsequent groundwater recharge Facilities employing longer detention times during treatment (nitrifying and denitrifying plants) showed significant lower effluent concentration for analgesic drugs as compared to trickling filter or activated sludge facilities applying shorter detention times A similar trend was observed for the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, which was significantly removed in denitrified effluents, whereas a trickling filter treated effluent exhibited concentration of 1,235 ng/L Antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine and primidone, showed no dependency on the wastewater treatment applied None of the investigated drugs was detected in tertiary treated effluents after nanofiltration or reverse osmosis After SAT, analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs were efficiently removed after retention times of less than 6 months and remaining concentrations were near or below the detection limit of the analytical method A high potential for biodegradation was also observed for anti-inflammatory drugs in groundwater recharge systems The antiepileptics carbamazepine and primidone represented the most dominant of all investigated drugs in well treated domestic effluents (nitrifying/denitrifying plants) Removal of carbamazepine and primidone did not seem to occur during travel times of more than 6 years in the subsurface.

AB Recently, the occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the aquatic environment was recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry and as a matter of public concern Residues of PhACs have been found as contaminants in sewage, surface, and ground- and drinking water samples
   Since June 2000, a new long-term monitoring program of sewage, surface, ground- and drinking water has been carried out in Berlin, Germany Samples, collected periodically from selected sites in the Berlin area, are investigated for residues of PhACs and related contaminants The purpose of this monitoring is to investigate these compounds over a long time period to get more reliable data on their occurrence and fate in the different aquatic compartments Moreover, the surface water investigations allow the calculation of season-dependent contaminant loads in the Berlin waters In the course of the monitoring program, PhACs and some other polar compounds were detected at concentrations up to the mug/L-level in all compartments of the Berlin water cycle The monitoring is accompanied and supported by several other investigations such as laboratory column experiments and studies on bank filtration and drinking water treatment using conventional or membrane filtration techniques.

AB Investigations of agricultural chemicals in surface runoff typically target nutrients or specific pesticides; however, numerous other organic compounds are regularly applied to agricultural fields in pesticide formulations, irrigation water, soil amendments and fertilizers. Many of these compounds have toxicological significance. We conducted abroad spectrum analysis of surface runoff from individual irrigated agricultural fields in coastal southern California to characterize organic compounds amenable to analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and to estimate the mass flux of selected chemicals. Aqueous phase extracts contained several pesticides, as well as personal care product ingredients and pharmaceutically active compounds apparently derived from treated wastewater used for irrigation-Several compounds potentially associated with pesticide adjuvants were also present in aqueous phase extracts. Dissolved NOM constituents in water phase extracts included n-fatty acids, aliphatic alcohols and plant terpenoids. Tentatively identified compounds sorbed to suspended particles included pesticides, a fecal sterol, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes, and C(14) and C(16) n-fatty acids and fatty acid esters. Bicyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified in both aqueous and suspended p article phases. Constituent concentrations, including total suspended solids (TSS), varied over the course of the sampled events by up to an order of magnitude, and typically were not correlated with flow. Variation in sorbed organic compound concentrations often did not parallel those for TSS concentration. Mass load estimates were strongly influenced by the choice of sampling interval.

AB This paper describes the wastewater characterization and aerobic/anaerobic treatability (oxygen uptake rate and biogas production measurement) of chemical-synthesis based pharmaceutical industry effluents in a nearby baker's yeast industry treatment plant. Preliminary experiments by the industry had indicated strong anaerobic toxicity. On the other hand, aerobic treatability was also uncertain due to complexity and unknown composition of the wastewater. The work in this study has indicated that the effluents of the pharmaceutical industry can be treated without toxicity in the aerobic stage of the treatment plant. Methanogenic activity tests with anaerobic sludge from the anaerobic treatment stage of the wastewater treatment plant and acetate as substrate have confirmed the strong toxicity, while showing that 30 min aeration or coagulation with an alum dose of 300 mg/l is sufficient for reducing the toxicity almost completely. Powdered activated carbon, lime and ferric chloride (100-1,000 mg/l) had no effect on reduction of the toxicity. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry was recommended to treat its effluents in the anaerobic stage of the nearby baker's yeast industry wastewater treatment plan at which there will be no VOC emission and toxicity problem, provided that pretreatment is done.

AB The effect of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the biotreatment of an industrial wastewater taken from a chemical plant synthesising drugs for the pharmaceutical sector was studied. Industrial and domestic wastewaters were combined at laboratory scale and the effect of PAC addition was tested in aerobic reactors. The aim of this addition was to decrease inhibitory and nonbiodegradable organics. Two different procedures were applied in testing the effectiveness of PAC. First, PAC was directly added to activated sludge mixed liquor. In the second case, industrial wastewater was first contacted with PAC and then treated biologically. In the evaluation of performance, COD measurements, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurements and measurements in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were taken into consideration. Both direct PAC addition and PAC pretreatment led finally to similar results. In both cases, the concentration of non-biodegradable matter could be lowered. In particular, the colour of the wastewater was significantly reduced. Direct PAC addition appeared to be more practical and plausible. In any case, PAC addition to activated sludge increased the OUR of the sludge, indicating that inhibition could be decreased. The study also pointed out that in the assessment of PAC performance, the combined evaluation of OUR, spectral parameters and COD would be much more informative than the COD parameter alone.

AB The effect of temperature was studied on the efficiency of soluble COD removal and bacterial community development during the aerobic biological treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater. Using wastewater and bacterial inoculum obtained from the full-scale facility treating this wastewater, batch laboratory cultures were operated at 5 degreesC intervals from 30 degreesC to 70 degreesC. Following four culture transfers to allow for bacterial acclimation, residual soluble COD levels were measured and bacterial community fingerprints were obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Soluble COD removal efficiency declined as temperature increased from 30 degreesC (62%) to 60 degreesC (38%). Biological treatment of this wastewater failed to occur at temperatures higher than 60 degreesC. Gradual shifts in bacterial community structure were detected as temperature increased, including a concomitant reduction in the number of different bacterial populations. The impact of temperature on a two-stage biological treatment process was also compared. Better soluble COD removal was achieved when both reactors were operated at 30 degreesC compared to a system where the two stages were consecutively operated at 55 degreesC and 30 degreesC. These results indicate that operation of aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactors at elevated temperatures can have adverse effects on process performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A field survey indicated that the Elbe and Saale Rivers were contaminated with both clofibric acid and ibuprofen. In Elbe River water we could detect the metabolite hydroxy-ibuprofen. Analyses of the city of Saskatoon sewage effluent discharged to the South Saskatchewan river detected clofibric acid but neither ibuprofen nor any metabolite. Laboratory studies indicated that the pharmaceutical ibuprofen was readily degraded in a river biofilm reactor. Two metabolites were detected and identified as hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen. Both metabolites were observed to degrade in the biofilm reactors. However, in human metabolism the metabolite carboxy-ibuprofen appears and degrades second whereas the opposite occurs in biofilm systems. In biofilms the pharmacologically inactive stereoisomere of ibuprofen is degraded predominantly. In contrast, clofibric acid was not biologically degraded during the experimental period of 21 days. Similar results were obtained using biofilms developed using waters from either the South Saskatchewan or Elbe River. In a sterile reactor no losses of ibuprofen were observed. These results suggested that abiotic losses and adsorption played only a minimal role in the fate of the pharmaceuticals in the river biofilm reactors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In the cases in which the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data available in the literature only include pretreatment information, there is a need to use a model for waste treatment to estimate the post-treatment data. In other cases, it is desirable to back calculate pretreatment information from final environmental emissions. This paper presents treatment modules for Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Solvent Incinerator, and Solvent Recovery. The modules were developed based on design equations and average Literature data. The methodology and basis for the models are presented and results are shown for the three modules. The modules developed present an easy and scientifically-based method to obtain post-treatment LCI data. The modules are expected to be particularly useful in the instances when process design techniques are employed for the estimation of LCI data, especially in chemical, biochemical and pharmaceutical industries.

DT Article
DE upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor; specific methanogenic activity;
   pharmaceutical wastewater; optimum operating conditions
AB A 450dm(3) pilot-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used for the treatment of a fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The UASB reactor performed well up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 10.7kg COD m(-3) d(-1) at which point 94% COD removal efficiency was achieved. This high treatment efficiency did not continue, however and the UASB reactor was then operated at lower OLRs for the remainder of the study. Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests were, therefore, carried out to determine the potential loading capacity of the UASB reactor. For this purpose, the SMA tests were carried out at four different initial acetate concentrations, namely 500mg dm(-3), 1000mgdm(-3), 1500mgdm(-3) and 2000mgdm(-3) so that substrate limitation could not occur. The results showed that the sludge sample taken from the UASB reactor (OLR of 6.1kg COD m(-3) d(-1)) had a potential acetoclastic methane production (PMP) rate of 72 cm(3) CH4 g(-1) VSS d(-1). When the PMP rate was compared with the actual methane production rate (AMP) of 67cm(3) CH, g(-1) VSS d(-1) obtained from the UASB reactor, the AMP/PMP ratio was found to be 0.94 which ensured that the UASB reactor was operated using its maximum potential acetoclastic methanogenic capacity. In order to achieve higher OLRs with desired COD removal efficiencies it was recommended that the UASB reactor should be loaded with suitable OLRs pre-determined by SMA tests.

DE supercritical water oxidation; mobile unit; salt separation; mass and

AB Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) has been shown to be an appropriate technology for the treatment of water containing toxic and hazardous substances, because it provides high destruction efficiencies. This paper reports a study of alternatives, and optimisation of various parameters and conditions, which are applied to the design of a mobile treatment unit. Phenol was selected as a model organic compound present in the feed stream and NaCl was selected as a model polar compound for solid separation. Pilot plant results show that efficiencies above 99.9% in phenol destruction are reached, at an operation temperature of about 650 degreesC, with stoichiometric amounts of air. Feed streams with a wide range of heating values (lower limit 530 and upper limit 930kJkg(-1)) can be handled, because these values allow both thermal and mechanical energy recoveries, which are the key factor for economic feasibility. The unit is capable of handling wastewater containing toxic, recalcitrant or nonbiodegradable compounds that cannot be treated with global streams at the wastewater treatment plant of a factory. It is specifically proposed for use in industries in which wastewater contains solvent mixtures of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The concept of immobilization technology has been incorporated in this research study for biomethanation of high strength herbal based pharmaceutical wastewater. Accordingly, an investigation has been made on laboratory scale to assess the feasibility of an anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor system to pre-treat herbal-based pharmaceutical wastewater with recourse to energy recovery, including influence of operating conditions. The work was carried out with laboratory-scale upflow reactor, equipped with nylon scrubber as random support. The reactor was operated at 35 degreesC. COD removal efficiencies ranging from 76 to 98% were achieved for organic loading rates upto 10 kgCOD/m(3) d, while the highest organic loading rate (around 48 kg COD/m(3) d) led to efficiencies of 46-50%. The influences of hydraulic retention time and substrate concentration were also studied. The reactors did now show destabilization under impulse hydraulic and organic overloadings. Reactor stability was easily achieved under intermittent operation, with breaks, after which the reactors rapidly returned to their optimal performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent studies conducted in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere indicate that low-level concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites may be widespread contaminants in our aquatic environment. The persistence of pharmaceutical contaminants has been attributed to (1) human consumption of drugs and subsequent discharges from sewage treatment plants, and (2) veterinary use of drugs and nonpoint discharges from agricultural runoff. Contamination of water resources by these compounds, particularly endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is emerging as an international environmental concern. The long-term effects of continuous, low-level exposure to PPCPs is not well understood. Preliminary data for raw water samples collected from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, are summarized. Three PPCP compounds (clofibric acid, naproxen, and estrone) were analyzed using solid-phase extraction, derivatization, and GC/MS. Batch experiments also were conducted to determine equilibrium capacity of activated carbon for clofibric acid. Preliminary results indicate the occurrence of the selected PPCP contaminants In raw water samples at or near method-detection limits. For batch equilibrium experiments, preliminary results indicate that activated carbon potentially can be used to remove clofibric acid from water. More research is needed to develop rapid and reliable methods for PPCP analysis and to determine the effectiveness of treatment processes for removal of PPCP contaminants in water.

AB A practical test kit based on diazotization reaction of aromatic amines followed by coupling with 2-methyl-8-hydroxyquinoline has been developed to determine trace aniline in wastewater and surface water samples. The test kit consists of four tablets, which are added to the sample in sequence. The maximum absorption wavelength of the orange dye formed is 482 nm. Molar absorptivity and detection limit were found to be 2.5 x 10(4) mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.020 mg L-1, respectively. Linearity was excellent in the concentration range 0.10-3.5 mg L-1 aniline in water. The test kit has been used to analyze aniline in polluted river water and wastewater samples from a pharmaceutical factory. The recoveries of addition of aniline in real water samples were between 95-106% (n=5) and relative standard deviation was less than 5% for standard sample at a concentration of 2.0 mg L-1 aniline, It's a very sensitive and easy-to-operate method for in situ analysis of aniline in water.

AB Land application of coal combustion by-products (CCBs) mixed with solid organic wastes (SOWs), such as municipal sewage sludge, has become increasingly popular as a means of productively using what were once considered waste products. Although bulk chemical and physical properties of several of these CCB-SOW materials have been reported, detailed information about their synthesis and mineralogy of the CCB-SOW materials has not been reported. In this paper, chemical and mineralogical properties of a soil-like material obtained from composting a mixture of CCBs with a pharmaceutical fermentation by-product (FB) were investigated at the laboratory and field scale. All starting materials and products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and elemental analyses. The results showed that the FB was strongly bound to the CCBs and could not be removed by washing. Within 2 wit of the start of a composting study, there was a rapid drop in pH from 12 to 8, an increase in temperature to 70 degreesC, and a reduction in the dissolved oxygen content. attributed to the rapid establishment of a highly active microbial population. Composting produced a soil-like material with high levels of plant nutrients, a high nutrient retention capacity, and metal contents similar to median levels of those metals reported for soils. The levels of boron and soluble salts are such that sensitive plants may initially show toxicity symptoms. However, with adequate rainfall, leaching should rapidly remove most of the B and soluble salts. With care, the material produced is safe for use as a synthetic topsoil.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, emphasizing triiodinated benzene derivatives used as X-ray contrast media, in domestic effluents and their fate during subsequent groundwater recharge. Organic iodine measurements were used as a surrogate for triiodinated benzene derivatives. Seven wastewater treatment facilities in Texas, Arizona and California were studied and organic iodine concentrations at these facilities varied between 5 and 40 mug iodine/L. The highest concentrations were observed on weekdays reflecting the common practice of employing X-ray examinations between Monday and Friday. Organic iodine compounds in secondary treated effluents were not removed by advanced wastewater treatment using ozone. However, organic iodine was efficiently removed by reverse osmosis membrane treatment. Based on laboratory biodegradation experiments and field studies negligible removal occurred under aerobic redox conditions while anoxic conditions led to partial removal of organic iodine. However, a concentration range of 8-15 mug iodine/L was observed in groundwater recharge systems after travel times of 8 to 10 years. Beside appropriate redox conditions, bioavailable organic carbon seems to be a key factor for organic iodine biodegradation in the environment. No environmental risk is expected from the parent compounds of triiodinated contrast media, however, toxicological effects associated with the metabolites are unknown.

AB Surface waters are used for disposal of treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants. These effluents usually contain only small amounts of various contaminants but these harmful components accumulate overtime in the river, especially in sediments.
   An integrated approach for the evaluation of the impact of treated effluents was used to predict an ecological risk assessment to the Krka river beside Novo Mesto. The effluents from pharmaceutical and municipal wastewater treatment plants were discharged too closely into the receiving stream, so that separate impacts could not be distinguished. Biologically treated industrial effluents contained great amounts of barely biodegradable organic pollution, organic nitrogen, ammonia and phosphorus, and sometimes zinc. The toxicity of effluents was mostly dependent on their chemical composition. The municipal discharge contained greater amounts of organic pollution that was completely biodegraded but still had a great nutrient pollution load. The effluents were nontoxic. The harmful substances from the effluents were traced in the river. In the downstream site slightly higher concentration of organic pollutants, organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and zinc were detected due to discharges. The river water was over-saturated with oxygen, especially in the summer. In toxicity tests, samples of the river water were nontoxic. Sediments at the downstream site accumulated from discharged organic nitrogen, phosphorus, or zinc.
   The results of our study show that the main problem is eutrophication of the river Krka, so it is obvious we must reduce the quantity of nutrients in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants. In both effluents it wilt be necessary to reduce the polluting load of phosphorus, the limiting element for growth of algae and macrophytes in the receiving stream. In the industrial effluent it will be necessary to reduce substances which cause toxicity, such as zinc and nonbiodegradable organic compounds that may be accumulated in the water ecosystem over time.

AB In this paper, the practical implementation and validation of advanced control strategies, designed using model based techniques, at an industrial wastewater treatment plant is demonstrated. The plant under study is treating the wastewater of a large pharmaceutical production facility. The process characteristics of the wastewater treatment were quantified by means of tracer tests, intensive measurement campaigns and the use of on-line sensors. In parallel, a dynamical model of the complete wastewater plant was developed according to the specific kinetic characteristics of the sludge and the highly varying composition of the industrial wastewater. Based on real-time data and dynamic models, control strategies for the equalisation system, the polymer dosing and phosphorus addition were established. The control strategies are being integrated in the existing SCADA system combining traditional PLC technology with robust PC based control calculations. The use of intelligent control in wastewater treatment offers a wide spectrum of possibilities to upgrade existing plants, to increase the capacity of the plant and to eliminate peaks. This can result in a more stable and secure overall performance and, finally, in cost savings. The use of on-line sensors has a potential not only for monitoring concentrations, but also for manipulating flows and concentrations. This way the performance of the plant can be secured.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) are involved in both detrimental and beneficial consequences of microbial aggregates such as biofilms, flocs and biological sludges. In biofouling, they are responsible for the increase of friction resistance, change of surface properties such as hydrophobicity, roughness, colour, etc. In biocorrosion of metals they are involved by their ability to bind metal ions. In bloweathering, they contribute by their complexing properties to the dissolution of minerals. The EPSs represent a sorption site for pollutants such as heavy metal ions and organic molecules. This can lead to a burden in wastewater sludge; on the other hand, the sorption properties can be used for water purification. Other biotechnological uses of EPS exploit their contribution to viscosity, e.g., in food, paints and oil-drilling 'muds'; their hydrating properties are also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, EPSs may have potential uses as biosurfactants, e.g., in tertiary oil production, and as biological glue. EPSs are an interesting component of all biofilm systems and still hold a large biotechnological potential.

AB The pharmaceutical industrial effluents, which include several organic solvents and other toxic chemicals, are generally treated by aerobic process, which is cost intensive in nature. The alternative anaerobic route to degrade the toxic effluents is attractive due to the lower cost of treatment and the generation of gas, which can supplement the energy requirements. There are few reports on the anaerobic treatment of the pharmaceutical effluents. In the present investigation, the effluents from a bulk drug industry, which utilizes several organic chemicals, have been taken to assess their applicability for anaerobic treatment. The organic loading rates were varied from 0.25 kg/m(3)/day to 2.5 kg/m(3)/day and the COD reduction was found to be in the range of 60 to 80%. Long term operation of an anaerobic suspended film contact reactor carried out with 1.25 kg/m(3)/day was found to be optimum. The biogas generated during the degradation process was monitored and the methane content was found to be 60-70%.

AB Treating effluents - industrial as well as domestic - is an area which needs concerted effort and serious attention. We need to deepen our understanding of what membranes can do taking into consideration the extremes of operation and complex effluent characteristics. Nanofiltration has proved effective in color removal of textile effluents and in pharmaceuticals, where 90% removal is reported and widely practiced. Successful case studies are presented along with revamp projects. In the case of RO, which is the tightest of separation techniques for water and non-water streams, use of fouling resistant (FR) and high surface area elements is emphasized. Technological limitations on case by case basis vis-a-vis RO/NF/UF/MF/ED is widely discussed. Modularization technology leading to reduction in running and installation costs is strongly advocated. Newer membrane materials are touched upon driven more by application rather than system specific. Industrial effluents and sewage constitute a major chunk of recycle operations to the extent of 65% in some countries. In one such city sewage RO plant, the operational cost has been reduced to 31% by retrofitting the pre-treatment section. Some of the Mega SWRO plants in the Middle East have gone into demo-UF plants. The arsenic contamination in major available resources of third world countries has reached alarming proportions. Technoeconomic viable solutions vis-a-vis available membrane operations are suggested.

ID CHEMICALS
AB Increasingly, sewage effluent will be used for urban and agricultural irrigation, The main concern is the potential for infectious diseases in farm workers and city dwellers exposed to the effluent, as well as in people who consume crops irrigated with effluent, especially when those crops are eaten ran; or brought raw into the kitchen. Prevention requires adequate disinfection of the effluent. The effluent also must meet normal irrigation water requirements for parameters such as salt content, sodium adsorption ratio, trace elements, and so forth, Unfortunately, little or no attention is paid to long-term effects of sewage irrigation on underlying groundwater. Since most of the water applied for irrigation in dry climates evaporates, the concentrations of non-biodegradable chemicals in the drainage or deep-percolation water going down to the groundwater can be much higher than in the effluent itself (about five times higher for an irrigation efficiency of 80 percent), These chemicals comprise not only the salts, nitrates, and possible pesticide residues normally expected in irrigated agriculture, but also "sewage chemicals" like synthetic organic compounds, disinfection by-products, pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutically active chemicals Like endocrine disrupters, and fulvic and humic acids,These acids are known precursors of disinfection by-products that are formed when the drainage water ends up in drinking-mater supplies that are then chlorinated, Thus, groundwater below sewage-irrigated areas eventually may become unfit for drinking, which raises questions of liability, More research on long term effects of sewage irrigation on groundwater is urgently needed.

AB phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities supported by a seven-stage, full-scale biological wastewater treatment plant was studied. These reactors were operated at both mesophilic (28 to 32 degrees C) and thermophilic (50 to 58 degrees C) temperatures. Community fingerprint analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the PCR-amplified V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the domain Bacteria revealed that these seven reactors supported three distinct microbial communities. A band-counting analysis of the PCR-DGGE results suggested that elevated reactor temperatures corresponded with reduced species richness. Cloning of nearly complete 16S rRNA genes also suggested a reduced species richness in the thermophilic reactors by comparing the number of clones with different nucleotide inserts versus the total number of clones screened. While these results imply that elevated temperature can reduce species richness, other factors also could have impacted the number of populations that were detected. Nearly complete 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the thermophilic reactors mere dominated by members from the beta subdivision of the division Proteobacteria (beta-proteobacteria) in addition to anaerobic phylotypes from the low-G+C gram-positive and Synergistes divisions. The mesophilic reactors, however, included at least six bacterial divisions, including Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides, Synergistes, Planctolmycetes, low-G+C gram-positives, Holophaga-Acido-bacterium, and Proteobacteria (alpha-proteobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and delta-proteobacteria subdivisions). The two PCR-based techniques detected the presence of similar bacterial populations hut failed to coincide on the relative distribution of these phylotypes, This suggested that at least one of these methods is insufficiently quantitative to determine total community biodiversity-a function of both the total number of species present (richness) and their relative distribution (evenness).

AB Mercury is a longstanding concern in Maritime Canada due to high levels of contamination in a number of fish and bird species. The recycled component of past releases of anthropogenic mercury may be a significant source of ongoing pollution in many areas. Historical information on mercury releases can be used to quantify past and present anthropogenic contamination. We present an inventory of historical mercury emissions from anthropogenic sources in Maritime Canada for the years 1800-1995. Long-term trends in mercury emissions and the significance of the cumulative burden of mercury released from local sources are discussed. Emissions are calculated using both historical monitoring data and the application of emission factors. The nature of current anthropogenic sources of mercury is quite different than it was several decades ago when many of the existing policies governing mercury pollution were created. Our inventory illustrates that many of the most significant sources in the past such as the chlor-alkali industry, paint containing mercury additives, and pharmaceuticals, have been largely phased out with fossil fuel combustion and waste disposal remaining as the most significant modern sources. Atmospheric emissions in Maritime Canada peaked in 1945 (> 1750 kg year(-1)), and again between 1965 and 1970 (> 2600 kg year(-1)). Cumulative releases of mercury from anthropogenic sources for the years 1800-1995 were between 115 and 259 t to the atmosphere alone, and 327-448 t when discharges to wastewater and effluents were included. Assuming that only 0.2% (Nriagu, 1994.) of these releases become part of the recycled fraction of current fluxes, we estimate that between 570 and 900 kg Hg year(-1) is deposited in Maritime Canada from past anthropogenic sources. Modern sources within Maritime Canada contribute at least 405 kg year(-1) to the total annual deposition of 1.71 t over the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, leaving similar to 735 kg year(-1) from natural sources and long-range contamination. Further study is needed to verify these estimates and clarify the significance of natural and long-range sources of mercury in Maritime Canada. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An in vivo bioassay for vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis was developed to screen individual chemicals or mixtures of chemicals for potentially estrogenic effects in a marine teleost model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate VTG synthesis in male sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) exposed to five concentrations of the natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol), a synthetic, steroidal pharmaceutical estrogen (17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol), or a synthetic, non-steroidal, pharmaceutical estrogen (diethylstilbestrol) for 16 days. At an exposure concentration of 20 ng/l, only diethystilbestrol elicited a vitellogenic response. At all test concentrations greater than 100 ng/l, VTG appeared in the plasma in a dose-dependent manner for the three estrogen treatments. Liver VTG mRNA measurements were also made, exhibiting no clear correlations between quantities, nor temporal appearance of the message and mature protein were apparent. This assay is short-term relatively inexpensive, shows a direct response, and easily quantitated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Some pharmaceuticals such as antineoplastics are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and fetotoxic. Antineoplastics and their metabolites are excreted by patients into waste water. In laboratory testing the frequently used isomeric anti-tumour agents cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) were shown to be not biodegradable. They are not eliminated in municipal sewage treatment plants and therefore detected in their effluents. Structural related compounds are beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramidmustard (beta-D-Glc-IPM; INN = glufosfamide) and beta-L-glucosylisophosphoramidmustard (beta-L-Glc-IPM). beta-L-Glc-IPM has no antineoplastic effects whereas beta-D-Glc-IPM is active against tumours. In contrast to IF and CP and almost all other investigated antineoplastics beta-D-Glc-IPM is inherently biodegradable, Improved biodegradability of beta-D-Glc-IPM compared to IF shows that reducing the impact of pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment is feasible by changing the chemical structure of a given compound exerting a similar mode of action and therapeutic activity. Stereochemistry may be crucial for pharmaceutical activity of the compounds as well as for its biodegradability in the environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals were chosen according to human consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment like sewage plant effluents, rivers and groundwater to investigate their behavior during oxidative water treatment. Derived from data compilation in literature the lipid lowering agent clofibric acid and the analgesic agents ibuprofen and diclofenac were selected. Analyses of the acidic compounds were carried out after solid-phase extraction and online derivatization in the GC injector by means of single ion monitoring (SIM) GC/MS. Oxidation experiments with the aim to degrade the pharmaceuticals were carried out in bench scale using ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide (advanced oxidation process). Under the specific reaction conditions only diclofenac was degraded by ozone to about 3% of its initial concentration. The combined application of ozone and hydrogen peroxide leading to OH-radical formation improved the degradation efficiency of all investigated compounds. The application of increased oxidant concentration resulted in a better degradation of all compounds to more than 90% at a concentration of 3.7 mg l(-1) ozone and 1.4 mg l(-1) hydrogen peroxide and to more than 98% at a concentration of 5.0 mg l(-1) ozone and 1.8 mg l(-1) hydrogen peroxide. At the applied conditions no reaction products could be detected by GC/MS analyses after derivatization of acidic functional groups. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The feasibility of aerobic digestion for pharmaceutical and domestic sludges was studied in order to determine the best operational conditions for digestion and to assess the need for pH stabilisation. Sludge concentrations ranging from 1500 to 11000 m l(-1) and from 4500 to 22000 mg l(-1) were tested with representative domestic and pharmaceutical waste activated sludges, respectively. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), settled sludge volume, sludge volume index (SVI), stirred sludge volume index (SSVI), specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), sludge capillary suction time (CST), supernatant biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), supernatant chemical oxygen demand (COD), supernatant turbidity, sludge Roc morphology and biodiversity were all monitored. The reductions achieved in settled sludge volume, MLSS and MLVSS were higher for domestic than for pharmaceutical sludges. A significant improvement in domestic sludge settleability (due to a change in flee morphology) appeared between 14 and 21d of aerobic digestion, followed by an increase in supernatant turbidity and a decrease in sludge filterability Eventually, pH stabilisation at 6.5 improved sludge characteristics, leading to a clearer recycled supernatant and a better sludge filterability. No odour or foam problems were recorded. The aerobic digestion performance achieved was a reduction of 42-53% MLSS, 53-64% MLVSS. 66-93% SOUR, 53-81% settled sludge volume and full stabilisation for domestic sludges: while fur pharmaceutical sludges reductions of 4-18% MLSS, 6-25% MLVSS, and 64-79% SOUR were achieved with full stabilisation.

AB The quality of environmental waters such as rivers is often deteriorated by various kinds of trace and unidentified chemicals despite the recent development of sewage systems and wastewater treatment technologies. In addition to contamination by particular toxicants, complex toxicity due to multi-component chemicals could be much more serious. The environmental situation in bodies of water in Japan led us to apply bioassays for monitoring the water quality of environmental waters in order to express the direct and potential toxicity to human beings and ecosystems rather than determinating concentrations of particular chemicals. However, problems arose from the fact that bioassays for pharmaceutical purposes generally required complicated, time-consuming, expert procedures. Also, a methodology for feedback of the resultant toxicity data to water environment management has not been established yet. To this end, we developed a novel bioassay based on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake activity of human hepatoblastoma cells. The assay enabled us to directly detect the toxicity of environmental waters within 4 hours of exposure. This is a significantly quick and easy procedure as compared to that of conventional bioassays. The toxicity data for 255 selected chemicals and environmental waters obtained by this method were organized by a mathematical equation in order to make those data much more effectively and practically useful to the management of environmental waters. Our methodology represents a promising example of applying bioassays to monitor environmental water quality and generating potential solutions to the toxicity problems encountered.

AB Activated sludge treatment of highly foaming pharmaceutical wastewater was carried out with modified bubble columns equipped with a mechanical foam-breaker (MFRD). The geometry of the bubble column was modified based on the foam breaking mechanism of the MRFD in order to improve the foam breaking capacity and hence to enhance the treatment capacity. Four types of modifications were examined. The activated sludge treatment of the wastewater with the modified columns was successfully carried out with COD removal efficiency about 90% at BOD loading of 4 g/Ld. Little effect of the mechanical foam control on the sludge settling characteristics was observed. The column modification significantly reduced the power required for foam control. The maximum power decrement of 75% was attained. Furthermore, oxygen transfer was found to be facilitated in the modified bubble columns. The results are expected to be helpful for economic and effective treatment of highly foaming organic wastewater.

AB Submersed fixed-film reactors are ideal for the pretreatment of industrial effluents. The advantages lie not only in the investment costs, but also in the operating costs. The pretreatment plants can be subject to higher loads than are possible with the activated sludge process. Consequently, considerably less space is required. And, last but not least, it is also possible to treat normally non-degradable industrial effluents. The prerequisites are that system related general structural requirements are fulfilled and suitable materials are used for the fixed-film reactor.
   They also offer considerable advantages in terms of operation compared to the activated sludge process, since both a higher oxygen transfer rate and yield are achieved, less sludge is produced and fewer personnel are required. All in all, the upstream submerged fixed-film reactor has proven to be an extremely reliable process, requiring little maintenance, that can cope, to a far-reaching degree, with load fluctuations of all types and reduce these. As a result, the operation of downstream treatment stages is also stabilized.

AB A total of 99 Acinetobacter isolates from sewage, freshwater aquaculture habitats, trout intestinal contents and frozen shrimps was characterized phenotypically and antibiotic susceptibility patterns determined. One group of genomic species, including Ac. johnsonii, Ac. lwoffi and spp. 15TU, was detected in all sample types and represented the majority of the isolates (n = 54). Isolates belonging to the Acb complex (Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii and genomic species 3) were detected in sewage (n = 6) and frozen shrimps (n = 1), Ac. haemolyticus in frozen shrimps (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 2) and genomic species 11 in freshwater aquaculture habitats (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 1). Acinetobacter junii (n = 5), genomic species 10 (n = 2), 14BJ (n = 8) and 16BJ (n = 4) were only isolated from sewage. Acinetobacter isolates from sewage were generally more biochemically reactive and resistant to antimicrobial agents compared with isolates from other sample types. Different strains, often belonging to different genomic species, were isolated from sites situated upstream and downstream of the discharge point of a pharmaceutical plant. This finding supported the hypothesis that the waste effluent from the pharmaceutical plant was likely to cause a change in the distribution of Acinetobacter spp. by selecting and/or introducing antibiotic-resistant strains into the recipient sewers.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify firstly the extent of contamination both of the aquatic biota and of sediments and secondly any regional differences in the concentrations of these compounds. In 1996, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, including their coplanar congeners) were measured in 58 eel and 50 sediment samples. Furthermore, the veterinary pharmaceutical bromocyclene and the nitro musks were determined in 84 (1995) and 122 (1996) eel samples. Polycyclic musk fragrances were additionally determined in analyses carried out in;1996.
   The mean values obtained during the two measurement periods (1995 and 1996) were 24 and 12 mu g/kg fw. for musk xylene, 41 and 39 mu g/kg fw. for musk ketone, 14 and 7 mu g/kg fw. for bromocyclene and, in 1996, 592 mu g/kg fw, for HHCB (maximum: 4131 mu g/kg fw.). Decreasing contamination levels are seen for musk xylene and bromocylene but not for musk ketone. This tendency, and the high amounts of polycyclic musk fragrances in the edible parts of eel show that these musks are widely being used in place of nitro musks and that they reach the aquatic system via waste waters, especially those of sewage treatment plants.
   The mean levels of PCBs in the biota samples of a highly polluted area were 1227 mu g/kg fw. or 119 pgTEQ/g (sediment: 203 mu g/kg dw.) and of a slightly polluted area 340 mu g/kg fw. or 49 TEQ/g (sediment: 47 mu g/kg dw.). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds can reach detectable concentrations in rivers and lakes if production and use are sufficiently large and the compounds show some mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment. In this study, we report on the occurrence and on the enantiomer composition of the chiral pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen (IB) in surface waters and in samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Enantioselective gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry was used for analysis. IB was present in influents of WWTPs at concentrations of up to 3 mu g/L with a high enantiomeric excess of the pharmacologically active S enantiomer (S much greater than R), as from human urinary excretion. The principal human urinary metabolites of IB, hydroxy-IB and carhoxy-IB, were observed in WWTP influents at even higher concentrations. In contrast to other pharmaceutical compounds such as clofibric acid and diclofenac, IB and its meta bolites a re then efficiently degraded (>95%) during treatment in WWTPs. Laboratory incubation experiments confirmed this rapid degradation. In rivers and lakes, IB was detected at concentrations of up to 8 ng/L, generally with some excess of the S enantiomer; the IB metabolites were not detected (<1 ng/L). Incubation of lake water fortified with (rac)-IB indicated a faster dissipation of the S enantiomer, thus resulting eventually in residues with a reversed (R > S) enantiomer composition as compared to that from human metabolism. Inefficient WWTPs and direct discharges of untreated wastewater from storm events, however, can still he a source for increased levels of IB in surface Water.

AB An extensive and comprehensive literature review has been conducted for compounds which we hypothesise could be present in sludge and maintain their integrity following application to agricultural land. The following compounds have been selected for review; chlorinated paraffins, quintozene, brominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated naphthalenes, polydimethylsiloxanes, chloronitrobenzenes and a range of biologically active and pharmaceutical compounds. All have received interest as a result of their persistence and/or toxicity in environmental media. Physicochemical property information has also been compiled and/or calculated. In this way, an accompanying paper will attempt to predict compound fate in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and assess likely transfers from soil/plants to grazing livestock. These papers describe a first attempt to predict the fate of these classes of compounds in the environment and prioritise those of greatest concern. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Applications for ozone in the United States have evolved through a lengthy maturation process, which began with drinking water treatment (taste/odor/color removal) in the early 1900s, and grew slowly until acceleration began in the mid-1980s. Although deodorization became a stable market in the 1960s-1970s, these applications were small, for the most part. One of the largest uses for ozone is oxidation of process chemicals in the chemical industry, which began in the USA about the 1940s, and subsequently has spread worldwide. Today, thanks primarily to environmental regulatory pressures which began to impact ozone in the mid-1980s, ozone now is used increasingly in the USA for drinking water treatment and for some municipal and industrial wastewater applications. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized the growing importance of ozone (> 200 drinking water plants use ozone today), and has appointed IOA representatives to two of its regulatory development committees as stakeholders. Several U.S. cities have installed or are installing wastewater treatment processes for potable reuse purposes, which include the use of ozone. Three full-scale U.S, pulp bleaching plants use tons/day quantities of ozone. Smaller applications for ozone include water treatment for cooling tower waters (biofouling control), swimming pools and spas, marine aquaria, bottled water disinfection and maintenance of high purity waters in the pharmaceuticals and electronics industries. A new application for ozone is in commercial laundries to reduce energy costs and replace chemicals. In mid-1997, a public declaration was made by an expert panel that ozone is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for contact with foods. This declaration opens the door for ozone to be used in U.S. food processing industries. U.S. research scientists and engineers are at the forefront in studies which define the technical aspects of ozone technologies in a variety of applications employing advanced oxidation, including the treatment of hazardous wastes, groundwater remediation, and process water recovery and reuse in the semi-conductor industry.

ID CHEMICALS
AB Iodinated S-ray contrast media are diagnostic pharmaceuticals that are applied to enhance the contrast between organs or vessels examined and surrounding tissues during radiography. These substances are applied in doses up to ca, 200 g per person (corresponding to approx 100 g iodine) and are rapidly excreted. In the sewage system they contribute to the burden of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX). To assess the potential environmental impact of this release, studies on environmental fate and effects mere conducted for a risk assessment of the frequently used X-rag contrast medium iopromide (brand name: Ultravist). A screening test for biological degradation (OECD Screening Test 301 E) led to iopromide being classified as not readily biodegradable, Therefore, the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in surface mater was calculated in a first step. The resulting concentration of 2 mu g/liter was then compared in a second step with the predicted no-effect concentration as derived from a battery of ecotoxicity tests. In short-term toxicity tests with bacterial (Vibrio fisheri, Pseudomonas putida), algae (Scenedesmus subspicatus), crustaceans (Daphnia magna), and fish (Danio rerio, Leuciscus idus) no toxic effects were detected at the highest tested concentration of 10 g/liter, In a chronic toxicity test with D, magna no effect was observed at the highest tested concentration of 1 g/liter. Using an assessment factor of 100 the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) was calculated to be less than or equal to 0.0002. This low value indicates that no environmental risk has to be expected as a result of the release of iopromide into the aquatic environment, (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB This paper describes the performance characterization of the Extractive Membrane Bioreactor (EMB) when treating pharmaceutical industry process wastewater contaminated with Dichloromethane (DCM). EMB technology, which employs extraction and biodegradation in a single step, has proved a potential alternative for the treatment of harsh inorganic waste streams contaminated with organic compounds. It is particularly successful for the destruction of toxic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) such as DCM without incurring air-stripping. A mixed culture was enriched to achieve complete biodegradation of DCM and total mineralization was confirmed by measurement of stoichiometric chloride release. The laboratory scale EMB was fed the process wastewater without any pre-treatment or dilution and was operated for 16 days with removals >95% for the entire period of operation. The applicability of the EMB to treatment of a range of pharmaceutical industry wastewaters and its costs are discussed.

   This work comprises the ozone inactivation of 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, azathioprine and methotrexate, four nitrogen bases with cytostatic properties, dissolved in water. Results show that these compounds can be inactivated by ozonation. The composition of the reaction mixture was followed by HPLC and at the end of the reaction the Ames test performed showed that the reaction products were nonmutagenic.

AB The recent monitoring of drug residues in the aquatic environment has gained much interest as many pharmaceutical compounds can frequently be found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and river water at concentrations up to several mu g/l. This article describes the analysis of various water samples for 18 antibiotic substances, from the classes of macrolid antibiotics, sulfonamides, penicillins and tetracyclines. Samples were preconcentrated via lyophilization and quantified using HPLC-electrospray-tandem-mass spectrometry. The investigated STP effluents and surface water samples showed frequent appearance of an erythromycin degradation product, roxithromycin and sulfamethoxazole with concentrations up to 6 mu g/l. Neither tetracyclines nor penicillins could be detected at concentration levels above 50 and 20 ng/l, respectively. From the large number of ground water samples that were taken from agricultural areas in Germany, no contamination by antibiotics was detected except for two sites. This indicates that intake from veterinary applications to the aquatic environment is of minor importance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These residues are mainly derived from humans via excretion. The median concentrations in the effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) of most drugs investigated in this study ranged from 0.1 to 1 mu g/l. The removal rates of individual drugs during passage through a Brazilian STP varied from 12 to 90%. As a consequence of the incomplete removal of these residues during passage through a STP, rivers were also found to be contaminated.

AB Many pharmaceutical industry processes use halogenated aromatics, other than chlorinated, as solvents or starting materials, and these can often exhibit inhibitory effects affecting normal process operation of biological Wastewater TreatmentPlants (WWTPs). A mixed culture, initially selected for growth at the expense of chlorobenzene as the sole source of carbon and energy, was enriched with a mixture containing bromobenzene, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene and iodobenzene. After three weeks of continuous operation in a stirred tank bioreactor, none of these halogenated compounds were detected in the growth medium. The complete mineralization of each of the compounds with concomitant release of stoichiometric amounts of halide was then investigated individually in batch experiments. Mineralization of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene up to their maximum solubility level (in minimal salts media) was achieved, while fluorobenzene was not biodegraded but simply volatilized. The complete mineralization of iodobenzene up to 150 mgl(-1) (in 18 hours) with complete recovery of iodide is particularly interesting since published literature shows no previous report of similar results. Preliminary characterization has shown that the cultures responsible for iodobenzene and bromobenzene biodegradation are strains of Pseudomonas putida.

AB The aim of our research was to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry to some aquatic organisms. The toxicity of three 24h proportional samples of wastewater was determined with the acute toxicity tests using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and daphnid Daphnia magna. The inhibition of bacterial luminescence was measured after a 30 min exposure period and the immobility of daphnids was determined after 24 and 48h. The chronic effects on daphnid survival and reproduction were observed for three weeks.
   The toxicity tests indicated that all investigated samples were acutely toxic to the organisms, but in each sample the responses of bacteria and daphnids were quite different. Acute and chronic effects on daphnids were observed when testing the first sample of wastewater, but no influence on bacteria was determined. The second sample was acutely toxic to both organisms. The third sample was toxic only to bacteria, while no influence on daphnid survival and reproduction was found. The reason for the different toxicity of the samples lay in their compositions. The comparison between chemical analyses and toxicity data showed that for daphnids the main cause of toxic effects was zinc. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

AB Chemical synthesis processes of the pharmaceuticals industry produce wastewaters which are variable in character and highly strong. In-plant controls are important and highly effective in determining the final wastewater quality. At any rate several stages of treatment comprised of physical, chemical and biological are required to obtain a reasonable degree of treatment. The problem is further complicated in small-scale plants due to low volume of wastewaters and dilution requirements. In this study, a small-scale pharmaceuticals plant producing three common active materials was experimentally evaluated to assess the waste management alternatives. The processes were evaluated and a source-based pollution profile was prepared. Paracetamol wastewaters were found to be readily biodegradable. Omeprazole wastewaters could be biologically treated only after significant chemical treatment. Mephenoxalone wastewaters were in no case biologically degradable. Paracetamol and pretreated Omeprazole wastewaters could be biologically treated down to several hundreds of ppm COD at as high as 0.5 g COD/g VSS day F/M ratio after several fold dilution. Results of the study were evaluated and discussed. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATRAZINE
AB The pharmaceutical drug diclofenac (2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid) was detected in rivers and lakes in Switzerland. The data strongly suggest inputs of diclofenac from human medical use via wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, the concentrations in a major tributary to a lake (Greifensee) were significantly higher (up to 370 ng/L) than those in the outflow of this lake (up to 12 ng/L). It is estimated that more than 90% of the diclofenac entering the lake is eliminated in the lake, most likely by photolytic degradation. Diclofenac was not detected in the sediments of the lake, and in a laboratory experiment, it showed negligible adsorption onto sediment particles. Incubation of lake water, fortified with diclofenac, showed no degradation in the dark, suggesting minimal chemical and biological degradation. However, when the fortified water was exposed to sunlight, rapid photodegradation was observed with a (pseudo) first-order kinetic and a half-life of less than 1 h (October and 47 degrees N latitude). Modeling these experimental data for the situation of Greifensee, the data indicated that photodegradation can account for the rapid elimination of diclofenac in the lake. Several photoproducts were characterized in the laboratory experiments but were so far not detected under the natural conditions in the lake. Whereas photodegradation is often one among several degradation pathways for environmental contaminants, the photolysis experiments and the computer simulation suggested this process to be the predominant one for diclofenac in the lake.

The pharmaceuticals most frequently detected in the surface water samples include clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propihenazone, and two other drug metabolites. Additional investigations of groundwater wells of a drinking water plant have shown that polar contaminants such as drug residues or N-(phenylsulfonyl)-sarcosine easily leach through the subsoil into the groundwater aquifers when contaminated surface water is used for groundwater recharge in drinking water production.

The level of susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents was determined in 385 Acinetobacter strains isolated from samples collected upstream and downstream from the discharge points of the hospital and the pharmaceutical plant. Results indicated that while the hospital waste effluent affected only the prevalence of oxytetracycline resistance, the discharge of wastewater from the pharmaceutical plant was associated with an increase in the prevalence of both single- and multiple-antibiotic resistance among Acinetobacter species in the sewers.

AB Erioglaucine (CAS No. 3844-45-9) is a widely used acid aminotriphenylmethane dye of an intense blue color. Erioglaucine containing wastewater streams are not affected by activated sludge treatment plants. Therefore, pretreatment is necessary before discharging. In the industry the standard procedure is to use NaOCl for this purpose. Experiments showed that wastewater treated with this method could contain between 100 and 200 mg l(-1) of adsorbable organic chlorine (AOX) compounds of a questionable ecotoxicological relevance. Alternative treatment methods with reagents containing H2O2 have been investigated. The experimental results are assessed in terms of color and DOC reduction, H2O2 consumption, and enhancement of biodegradability. A combination of activated carbon and H2O2 proved not to be a viable alternative. Treatment with Fentons reagent (H2O2 and Fe2+) was found to be effective in terms of color removal as well as enhanced biodegradability. in the optimum operating range of pH and H2O2/Fe2+ ratio 5 mi of a 35% H2O2 solution are sufficient for the treatment of Ig Erioglaucine. Between 10 and 40 degrees C, the reaction is completed in less than 4h. The environmental effects of the Erioglaucine degradation with Fentons reagent are small compared with the NaOCl treatment. Therefore, oxidation of Erioglaucine containing wastewater with NaOCl should be replaced by a treatment with Fentons reagent. The assumption is that the results obtained for Erioglaucine also apply to other structurally related aminotriphenyl dyes.

AB Previous work revealed genotoxic effects in the wastewater of a large university hospital using a bacterial short-term genotoxicity assay, based on a umuC::lacZ fusion gene (umuC assay). These studies ruled out disinfectants and detergents as main causative agents of the genotoxic effects. This paper focuses on specific hospital-related drugs as the cause. The ratio of theoretical mean wastewater concentrations (derived from consumption data) and lowest observable effect concentrations of selected pharmaceuticals were used to calculate umuC induction probabilities. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics Ciproxin(R) and Noroxin(R) showed the highest induction probabilities and exceeded all other investigated drugs by at least one order of magnitude in significance. Antineoplastic drugs, originally thought to be the main effecters, were found to be of marginal significance using the umuC assay. These findings were further supported by investigation of urine samples of hospital patients with the umuC assay. The determination of ciprofloxacin in native hospital wastewater by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection revealed concentrations from 3 to 87 mu g/L. umuC induction factor and ciprofloxacin concentrations in 16 hospital wastewater samples showed a log-linear correlation (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the previously measured umuC genotoxicity in the wastewater of the hospital under investigation is caused mainly by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, especially by ciprofloxacin. On the basis of these findings, the role of the umuC assay as a screening tool for wastewater genotoxicity assessment is discussed.

ID CHEMICALS
AB Several classes of anthropogenic substances modulate endocrine pathways. To date, most of the research has focused on chemical classes such as chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants, pesticides, or degradation products of high-use industrial surfactants. However little is Known about the environmental impact of another important class of chemicals: hormonally active pharmaceutical products. This deficit of information is surprising, given the biological potencies of these widely used substances and their potential to enter the environment through sewage treatment effluents and runoff from agricultural applications. Estrogenic pharmaceutical products are used extensively in human estrogen-replacement therapy and oral contraceptive formulations. Estrogenic substances are also used as growth enhancement products in veterinary medicine. This report describes the potencies, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic pathways of such estrogenic products. The amounts of pharmaceutical-derived estrogens that reach the environment from doses and usage are estimated. Factors that affect environmental concentrations including metabolism and biodegradation are also considered. Finally, rue present both chemical and analytical data, as well as bioassay evidence, that suggest that biologically active concentrations of estrogenic compounds are being released into the aquatic environment.

AB A bacteria was isolated from the activated sludge of a pharmaceuticals wastewater treatment plant and identified as a Pseudomonas putida (To-5). Strain To-5 was capable of growth on toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy. Given the decrease in pH with toluene metabolism, studies were carried out to investigate a suitable buffering system for the growth medium in the presence of toluene. After selection of the suitable buffer, concentration of the buffer was optimized. Based on the stability of the strain To-5 to grow and pH control in the system, the 0.5 M buffer was selected to investigate the optimum pH of growth of the organisms when toluene was used as the sole carbon source and energy.

DE medical substances; pharmaceuticals; environmental fate; toxicity;

AB Medical substances (pharmaceuticals) are a group of substances that until recently have been exposed to the environment with very little attention. The reason why they may be interesting as environmental micropollutants, is that medical substances are developed with the intention of performing a biological effect. Especially antibiotics used as growth promoters, as feed additives in fish farms are anticipated to end up in the environment. Very little is known about the exposure routes of the medical substances to the environment. Only few investigations have reported findings of medical substances in other field samples than sediment or treated waste water samples. Several substances seem to be persistent in the environment. This paper outlines the different anticipated exposure routes to the environment, summarises the legislation on the subject and gives an outline of present knowledge of occurrence, fate and effect on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments of medical substances. Present knowledge does not reveal if regular therapeutic use may be the source of a substance carried by sewage effluent into the aquatic system even though clofibrate, a lipid lowering agent, has been identified in ground and tap water samples from Berlin. Further research would be necessary to assess the environmental risk involved in exposing medical substances and metabolites to the environment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE activated sludge; clarifiers; selection; sludge bulking; thicken
AB A full scale experiment with an activated sludge process in a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant showed that the-operation of two settling tanks in series, with the first tank full of sludge, resulted in selection of sludge particles which had a lower than average filament content for retention in the process. Series operation of the two clarifiers was very successful in controlling sludge bulking. The functioning of the settling tanks as selectors of sludge particles which settle and thicken well has not been considered to any great extent. Two laboratory-scale activated sludge plants fed with an artificial wastewater were operated to explore this selection function further. The SVI values were measured and assessed. At the start of operation, the SVI was about 60-80 ml/g in both of the parallel and the series plants. After eight days of the operation, the SVI started to increase rapidly in the parallel plant, and in twenty days of operation, the averaged values of SVI were 163 ml/g and 116 ml/g for the parallel and the series plants, respectively. On day 38, MLSS from two aeration tanks were interchanged. In a few days after that interchange, the SVI values in the parallel, which was originally in the series mode, rapidly increased from 130 ml/g to more than 350 ml/g(SV30 = 930 ml/g). This experiment clearly supports the hypothesis of a microorganism selection function of the settling tank and also corresponds to the results obtained from the field study.

AB The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical and baker's yeast industry effluents in a joint treatment system. Anaerobic treatability studies have been performed in a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBR). The experimental study has been carried out for 333 days. The influent COD's during the experimental study were about 10,000 mg/l. Pharmaceutical wastewater has a 5% of inhibition on the COD removals at the dilution rate of 1/100 or more in the joint anaerobic treatment with baker's yeast industry effluents. Maximum inhibition of 10% on the average was observed when the system was characterized with acclimation periods. The study has shown that, following the solvent extraction with pre-aeration process, a common anaerobic treatment can be applied to baker's yeast industry wastewater and to pharmaceutical industry effluents.

AB A combined anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor for the treatment of the industrial wastewater that contains nitrogen and complex organic compounds as well as its design procedure is presented.
   The purpose of our experiments was to find a simple methodology that would provide combined reactor design. The reactor is based on the combination pf anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic process in one unit only. It was found that the HRT even under 1 hour in the anaerobic zone Is long enough for the efficient transformation of complex organic compounds into readily biodegradable COD which is then used in dentrification process. In the N-NO3 concentration range 1.5-50 mg/l the denitrification rate could be expressed as half-order reaction when the CODrb was in excess. N-NO3 removal efficiency is controlled by the recycle flow from the aerobic to the anoxic zone. Nitrification rate can be expressed as first, half or zero-order reaction with respect to effluent N-NH4 concentration. Nitrification rate depends on the dissolved oxygen concentration and hydrodynamic conditions in the reactor.
   Case study for design of a pilot plant of the combined reactor for treatment of pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater is shown. Characteristics of pre-treated wastewater were: COD=200 mg/l, BOD5=20 mg/l, N-Kjeldahl=80 mg/l, N-NH4=70 mg/l, N-NOx<1 mg/l, P-PO4=5 mg/l. Legal requirements for treated wastewater were: COD=<100 mg/l, BOD5<5 mg/l, N-NH4=<1 mg/l, N-NOx=<10 mg/l. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a process for biological treatment of toxic wastewater from a pharmaceutical company was developed. By simulations on a laboratory scale, the contribution of organic material and toxicity in wastewater from different sources was determined and the degradability of specific compounds were studied. The information obtained from these tests was used to improve the treatability of the wastewater at the sources. As an example a persistent organic phosphorous compound could be degraded after pre-treatment with chemical hydrolysis. By further simulations on a laboratory scale it was possible to screen through a large number of process configurations to determine the best working biological treatment. A combination of fungal and bacterial treatment was found to remove toxicity from the wastewater more than a conventional bacterial treatment. The results from the laboratory studies were confirmed in pilot tests. A full scale treatment plant, which design is based on the results from these studies are presently under construction.

AB A portion of administered pharmaceuticals are excreted unmetabolised by patients and can be found in hospital effluent and municipal sewage. Some pharmaceuticals such as anti-tumour agents are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and fetotoxic. Little is known about their environmental impact. Therefore, the biodegradability of the widely used anti-tumour agent ifosfamide (IF) was assessed with the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B) and a test simulating biological sewage treatment. The biodegradation was monitored by DOC and GC/MS. The concentration of IF in hospital effluent, communal sewage and the effluent from a communal sewage treatment plant (STP) was analysed as well as calculated by the amounts of water and IF used in hospitals. The expected concentration of IF in German surface waters was calculated. IF was not biodegradable in the Zahn-Wellens test and the STP simulation test. It was not adsorbed by the sewage sludge. The concentrations measured in the hospital effluents, the STP influent and the STP effluent were of the same order of magnitude as the calculated ones, indicating that no adsorption, biodegradation or other elimination of IF took place to any noticeable extent.

AB Most anti-tumour agents are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, embryotoxic or fetotoxic. Only little is known about the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals. Unmetabolized active substances are excreted and will show up in municipal wastewater. Therefore, we examined the biodegradability of the widely used antitumour agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), also as an example for assessing the impact of hospital effluent on the biodegradation of a test compound. The biodegradability of the structurally similar anti-tumour agents cytarabine and gemcitabine was also examined. Test systems used were the closed bottle test (OECD 301 D) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B). 5-FU was not biodegradable in the closed bottle test (CBT) nor in the Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT). At the highest concentration of 5-FU, with hospital effluent an inhibition of the degradation of substances present in hospital effluent was observed, probably as a result of a synergistic effect by 5-FU with antibiotics present in hospital sewage. Gemcitabine was biodegraded 42% in the CBT. The prolongation of the test period to 40 days only improved the result to 45%. In the ZWT, the biodegradation of gemcitabine was 50%. Cytarabine was partially biodegraded in the CBT (50%), but only after an adaptation period of 20 days. After a test prolongation to 40 days, the degree of biodegradation was 80%. In the ZWT, the biodegradability was > 95% after only a few days.

AB A series of drugs and drug metabolites were found at concentrations up to the mu g/L-level in ground water samples taken from a drinking water treatment plant. These drugs were clofibric acid, phenazone, propyphenazone, diclofenac, ibuprofen and fenofibrate. Additionally, two metabolites N-methylphenacetin probably originating from phenacetin and also a derivative of clofibric acid were detected. These contaminants leach from the neighboring sewage contaminated surface water by bank filtration through the subsoil into the ground water of the water works.

TI New techniques for solvent recovery and elimination of wastewater
   emissions during vacuum process operations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB The pharmaceutical and chemical process industries are concerned with controlling volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for several reasons: to meet environmental regulations, for increased worker safety, and to minimize product losses. Various methods can be used including flaring and carbon adsorption. These techniques are end-of-the-pipe solutions and are not integral with the process operation itself
   An improved technique for the recovery of solvents during reaction, distillation, evaporation, drying, filtration, mixing, and other vacuum operations is the APOVAC vacuum/gas compressor system. The skid-mounted, engineered package is based upon a single stage liquid ring vacuum pump. The system allows for the recovery and reuse of clean solvent with minimum air emissions and zero liquid emissions. VOC and biological oxygen demand (BOD) regulations are met by this technology.
   The paper reviews the technical details of the system and presents test results and on-site operational data. Specific case histories involving methylene chloride recovery and acid/toxic gas neutralizations are also included.
   In the chemical processing industry (CPI) the generation of vacuum is a necessity. Many chemical processes take place more easily, more quickly and more efficiently under vacuum than tinder atmospheric pressure, thus allowing better product quality at lower production cost. If it is a "wet" process involving the use of solvents then solvent recovery becomes an important consideration because of cost savings associated with its recovery as well as environmental benefits.
   These objectives have stimulated the development of the APOVAC system concept which is based on the principle of closed loops or circuits. Since its development, the APOVAC system has enhanced today's chemical process technology through solvent recovery and recycling, elimination of wastewater effluent, and reduction of gas emissions thus contributing to a technically efficient and environmentally acceptable operation.

ID ELECTRODE
AB This is a preliminary investigation of a method for the timely monitoring of wastewater biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Many ecological and economic pressures support the use of BOD measurement methods fast enough to prevent process upsets. Since the standard laboratory procedure takes five days, and previously used fast tests are unsatisfactory for various reasons, tests were made on the Nissin Electric BOD-2000 instrument, which uses a yeast-based biosensor to measure soluble BOD in 30 min. It has been used successfully in the pharmaceutical and food industries. An initial attempt was made to place the instrument in field service. This attempt was unsuccessful, so the present study concentrated on comparing its operation in the laboratory with the results of the standard five-day BOD test (BOD,) procedure. The two types of tests were compared for samples from Terminal Island Treatment Plant (TITP), Bureau of Sanitation of the city of Los Angeles, using various combinations of filter porosities and wastewater sources in an attempt to establish a measurement routine that would not suffer from clogging problems that plagued the field test. Under these conditions the results from the instrument are excellent, and we briefly discuss further work needed to bring it into field use. This test is believed to be the first effort to assess the capability of this technology in a wastewater application in the United States.

AB By means of rigorously controlled lab-scale activated sludge systems operated in parallel, the affect of the addition of a nutritive supplement on the overall performance of these systems was verified. Nutriflok 50 S is a commercially available product. containing nutrients and flocculating agents. In a first series of tests by means of SCAS (semi-continuous activated sludge) reactors, fed with synthetic wastewater, the positive effect of the supplement (dosed at 5% of the chemical oxygen demand (GOD) load) on the sludge volume index (SVI) (39% improvement) and the residual COD (40% improvement) was demonstrated. In a second series, an industrial wastewater was used in a benchscale set-up according to the OECD procedure. The overall efficiency and sludge sedimentation characteristics were compared for two parallel activated sludge systems continuously fed with pharmaceutical wastewater. In the control no additive was given; the other reactor received on a daily basis a dose of Nutriflok 50 S corresponding to 10% of the COD load. The performance of the Nutriflok 50 S supplemented reactor was found to be statistically better in terms of sedimentation characteristics, nitrification and COD removal than the control. Especially when operated under winter conditions (10 degrees C) and at higher sludge loading rates (Bx = 0.26 kg COD/kg VSS.d) the COD removal efficiency was about 35% higher in the treated reactor. Moreover, nitrification could be maintained in the supplemented reactor at low temperatures, whilst it became minimal under those conditions in the control reactor. Also in the second series of tests, sludge sedimentation characteristics improved with Nutriflok 50 S. The SVI was 40% lower for the Nutriflok 50 S amended sludge and the recycled sludge was 27% more concentrated. When operated at higher temperatures (20-26 degrees C) the amended sludge was less sensitive to denitrification linked flotation in the settler. Microscopic examination of the sludge revealed a more diverse microbial community and the presence of higher trophic organisms in the supplemented reactor. These results indicate a potential for considerable improvement, not only of the overall conversion efficiency, but also of the sludge management characteristics when Nutriflok 50 S is dosed to the activated sludge.

ID SUBSTRATE INHIBITION; GROWTH; BIODEGRADATION; SYSTEM
AB Phenol and its homologues are aromatics containing hydroxyl, methyl, amide and sulphonic groups attached to the benzenoid molecules. These molecules are, both, anthropogenic and xenobiotics. Phenols are environmental pollutants discharged through wastewaters from fossil fuel refining processes, phenol manufacturing plants, pharmaceutical and a variety of other industries. Phenols are toxic to several biochemical reactions. However, biological transformation of phenols, to non-toxic entities exists in specialized microbes, having enzymes of aromatic catabolic pathways. Transformation of phenols is also inhibited by the presence of other toxic materials such as cyanides and sulphides that are present in the industrial wastes having phenols as the dominant carbonaceous material. Kinetics of the biotransformation of phenols using pure cultures isolated in the laboratory, mixture of a consortium of the pooled cultures and enriched activated sludge biomass in pure substrates, mixed substrates and actual phenolic waste has been estimated under varying input concentrations. Experimental results from these studies have been subjected to analysis by mathematical models using Monod's and Haldane's equations to test the validity of these models in interpreting the data on inhibitory substances under steady as well as unsteady state operations of wastewater treatment plants. Comparative evaluation of the kinetic parameters reveals that Monod's model can be employed for the estimation of the kinetic constant mu only while Haldane's model has to be used for the calculation of mu(max) and K-1.

AB The selection of a coagulant-flocculant agent which, based on the maximum chemical oxygen demand removal, warrants the best performance of the removal system for a very complex high-load chemical-pharmaceutical industry wastewater, is described. A total of 23 coagulants/flocculants was tested, including salts, poly-hidroxyaluminates, synthetic polymers as well as natural gums. In a second stage, some mixing aspects were studied. The effects of the specific impeller, the agitation speed during the coagulation and flocculation stages, and the absence or presence of baffles were evaluated in a six-Place agitation system. The conventional impellers were replaced by the following types of propellers: Rushton, marine, A310 (Lighting), three flat blades, 45 degrees inclined six blades, and conventional flat blade propeller. It was demonstrated that the appropriate coagulation-flocculation system is capable of diminishing the GOD, the apparent color and the dissolved solids up to 40.6, 25.6 and 39.4%, respectively. The best results were observed when using BL-5086, guar gum, Niad II-3, Niad II-4 and locus beam gum. The impeller performance was highly dependent on the agitation speed for each fixed system. With respect to the mixing aspects, it was shown that the selection of the right propeller for the coagulation and flocculation stages is crucial in determining the quality of the treated water, as well as the quantity and quality of the residual sludges generated in the process.

AB The focusing on the discharge of nitrogen compounds to aquifers has put pressure on power plants to look into removal of nitrogen compounds from the gas scrubbing liquors (DESOX and DENOX). The scrubber liquor has a high salinity, a high chloride content and a temperature of about 40 degrees. Initial laboratory tests to evaluate the possibility of performing biological nitrification and denitrification showed promise and a pilot-scale test unit was established at one of the Danish coal-fired combined heat and power plant (AVEDORE 1).
   The pilot plant was operated under varying conditions with regard to temperature and chloride concentration. Maximum nitrification and denitrification rates were measured. At 30 degrees C and 20 g Cl-/l, maximum nitrification and denitrification rates of 2 and 3 mg N/g VSS.h respectively were measured. In the effluent, concentrations of inorganic nitrogen were below 8 mg N/I.
   Twice during the test period, inhibition of the biomass activity was caused by high concentrations of heavy metals. The high content of heavy metals was due to malfunction of pH control in the heavy metal removal plant. The nitrification process was more sensitive to heavy metals than the denitrification process, and during the two toxic events the nitrification rate decreased to zero.
   The influence of rapid changes in the chloride and nitrite contents on nitrification was also examined. The results from the performed tests can be applied on other wastewaters with similar characteristics as these scrubber liquors i.e. with salinity. As an example fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries can be mentioned. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Using two samples of a pharmaceutical wastewater, the efficiency of three advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (H2O2/UV, O-3/UV and H2O2/Fe(II)) for the removal of adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were compared on a laboratory scale. The AOX contents of these samples ranged from 3 to 5 mg/L. Generally the results showed that all three methods are suitable for the degradation of AOX and COD. UV irradiation involved a high selectivity for the degradation of AOX compared to COD. On the other hand, processes based on hydroxyl radicals were less selective but considerably more effective in COD degradation. This explains why the combined methods H2O2/UV and O-3/UV lead both to a complete destruction of AOX and a large removal of COD. During ozone treatment - without UV radiation a decrease of AOX was also observed, although to a lower degree. Using Fenton's reagent both AOX and COD could be removed almost completely. The reaction time needed for this kind of treatment was very low compared to the other two AOPs. O-3/UV treatment showed the largest consumption of ''activated'' oxygen (AO) during COD degradation. H2O2/Fe(II) treatment required almost the same amount of AO as H2O2/UV. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI The Carver-Greenfield process: Dehydration/solvent extraction technology
   for waste treatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB A combination dehydration/solvent extraction treatment technology, the proprietary Carver-Greenfield (C-G) Process, can be wed to separate solid/liquid waste materials into three separate product streams convenient for reuse or disposal:
   (1) clean, dry solids suitable for fixation of nonhazardous landfilling;
   (2) water virtually free of solids and oils which can be processed in gn industrial or public wastewater treatment facility: and,
   (3) oil indigenous to the feed, a mixture of extracted hydrocarbon-soluble compounds which typically includes any hazardous contaminants which are present.
   As normally practiced, this dehydration/solvent extraction technology involves slurrying water-wet waste in a hydrocarbon solvent which extracts indigenous oil from contaminated solid particles and concentrates it in the solvent phase. Dehydration also takes place during the treatment; water is evaporated and condensed as a separate product. Dry solids are reslurried in fresh solvent one or more additional times depending on the degree of extraction required. Extracted solids are centrifuged away from the solvent and residual solvent in the centrifuge cake vaporized off the final product solids stream in a desolventizer, Indigenous oil from the waste is separated from the solvent by distillation with recovered solvent being recycled to the process.
   For commercial applications, this process is very flexible in its ability to be efficiently adapted to waste processability and treatment objectives. For example, if the contaminants are very heavy organics like PCB's, they may be further concentrated in a portion of the indigenous oil such that only a very small highly concentrated contaminant stream need be disposed of and uncontaminated oil may be recovered for a process credit. In some cases where the feed has a high water concentration, the dry solids need not be separated from the indigenous oil but they can be recovered/disposed of together.
   This dehydration/solvent extraction technology has been licensed to over 80 facilities over the past 30 years to solve waste disposal problems in a wide variety of fields. More than half of the plants were designed to dry and deoil slaughterhouse wastes Cin rendering plants). The other units are used to evaporate water and extract indigenous oil from a broad spectrum of other materials, including municipal and industrial sewage sludges, wool scouring wastes, petrochemical sludges, wood-pulp waste, pharmaceutical wastes, dairy and food products, textile wastes and animal manure.
   This paper discusses the C-G Process flexibility and economics as applied to various hazardous waste examples including PCB contaminated sediments, soils and sludges, spent drilling fluids (U.S. EPA SITE Program). refinery wastes, manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, etc.

AB The performance of anaerobic hybrid reactors treating an organic solvent-containing synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated under various wastewater volumetric loading rates and influent compositional changes. The biodegradation, toxicity and treatability of the target C-3 and C-4 solvents, tert-butanol isopropanol, isobutanol sec-butanol and ethyl acetate, were examined. At a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days and volumetric loading rates ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 kg COD m(-3) day(-1), the reactors achieved total and soluble COD removal efficiencies of 97-99% in less than five times the HRT. These removal rates were achieved following the introduction of target solvents not previously supplied to the reactors. However, inadequate removal of tert-butanol resulted in a decrease in the soluble COD removal efficiency to 58%. Bacterial enrichments from the reactor biomass using tert-butanol as the sole substrate proved unsuccessful, confirming that tert-butanol is poorly degradable anaerobically. Inclusion of a trace metal cocktail in the feed did not affect steady-state reactor performance, but was beneficial during changes in the influent composition. After 405 days of operation, the matrix-associated biomass contributed only a minor fraction (2-4%) of the total biomass present in both reactors. On takedown, the retained biomass present in the matrix-free section of both reactors was found to be granular in nature, despite the omission of trace elements from the influent to one of the AHRs. The specific methanogenic activity profile of the granular sludge from the trace element limited AHR was, however, significantly lower (alpha = 0.05) than that of the reference AHR.

AB Large volumes of wastewaters containing proteins (mainly sericin), salts and tensioactives are produced in the degumming process (washing) of both yam and tissues made from natural silk. These wastewaters bearing a COD above 6000 mg/l are generally treated in biological plants with increasing costs. Sericin represents, on the contrary, a valuable by-product that can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical production. To reduce treatment costs and at the same time to recover sericin and reuse process water, a hybrid membrane process is under study. Laboratory and field experiments show that ultrafiltration of the degumming waste solution with different membranes (with molecular weight cut-off in the 20-30,000 dalton range) allows recovery of more than 97% of the sericin but the permeate COD level exceeds 800 mg/l whose value is still too high for water reuse. A final reverse osmosis treatment on the ultrafiltration permeate allows reaching a low COD level (50 mg/l) and recovery of more than 70% of the wastewater for process reuse. Alternative process flow sheets for the silk degumming solution treatment are discussed on the basis of the obtained results.

AB A nitrification study was conducted in continuous flow stirred tank reactors using high strength nitrogenous wastewater (concentrated stream from a urea plant mixed with pharmaceutical wastewater). The reactors were operated at different solids retention times (SRT = 10-62.5 d) and hydraulic retention times (HRT = 1.5-2.1 d). Pharmaceutical wastewater was used as an organic carbon source to maintain a COD/TKN ratio of 1. The nitrification achieved at different SRTs varied from 87 to 99%. The nitrogen balance data show that ammonia assimilation and denitrification accounted for 4-53% of the total nitrogen removed. The yield coefficients and decay coefficients were Y-b = 0.5 (COD basis), k(db) = 0.07 d(-1) (COD basis) for heterotrophs and Y-n = 0.15 (TKN basis), k(dn) = 0.06 d(-1) (TKN basis) for nitrifiers respectively.

AB The C:N ratio of the pharmaceutical wastewaters is usually suitable for a combination of the anaerobic pretreatment with the high COD removal and aerobic posttreatment with the efficient biological N removal. This kind of anaerobic-aerobic process was tested in semipilot scale by using a UASB reactor and an activated sludge system with a predenitrification (total volume 1001). It was found that at a total HRT of 2.3 days an average of 97.5% of COD and 73.5% of total N was removed. The UASB reactor was operated at 30 degrees C with a volumetric loading rate of 8.7 kg.m(-3).d(-1), the efficiency of COD removal was 92.2%. The processes, which rake part in the biological removal of nitrogen, especially the nitrification, were running with lower rates than usually observed in aerobic treatment systems.

AB A pharmaceutical wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (GOD) concentration of 40,000 mg/l and a sulfate concentration of 5,000 mg/l was treated in a anaerobic baffled reactor. Treatment of the wastewater at 10% dilution was effective but at higher influent concentrations sulfide inhibition reduced efficacy of both COD conversion and sulfate conversion. A racycle line with an attached-film biological reactor was inserted into the anaerobic baffled reactor to facilitate biological sulfide oxidation. Recycling anaerobic effluent through a sulfide oxidizing biological system reduced inhibition in the anaerobic reactor by both reducing inhibitory sulfide concentrations within the reactor and by diluting the influent. The major product of the biological oxidation of sulfide by a Thiobacillus species appeared to be elemental sulfur. At an influent wastewater concentration of 40% and a HRT of 1 day, COD removal efficiencies were greater than 50% and the conversion of influent sulfate was greater than 95% with affluent sulfide concentrations of lass than 20 mg/l. The major product observed from degradation of isopropyl acetate was acetic acid. Coupled anaerobic/aerobic provided removal of sulfur from the wastewater stream and helped to stabilize the pH in the reactor system. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB This paper concerns the treatment of wastewaters produced during printing matrix washing and by dyestuff leakage in the silk and Lycra printing industry. The objective was to obtain effluent of a quality that would allow water reuse. The raw wastewaters contained a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen (from urea, ammonium sulphate and tartrate used for the dyestuff preparation together with organic compounds. A high BOD5/COD ratio determined the possibility of a biological treatment of the wastewaters by nitrification-denitrification. To achieve complete denitrification, however, it was necessary to add an external carbon source. A mixture of methyl and ethyl alcohols from pharmaceutical industry wastes was used to achieve a BOD5/N ratio of about 3.5. High temperature (23-26 degrees C) and low inhibition enabled good rates of treatment to be achieved in a single-sludge system, equal to 0.042 kgN/kg MLVSS x day and 0.12 kgN/kg MLVSS x day, respectively for nitrification and denitrification. After this stage the effluents were characterized by COD <120 mg/L, BOD5 <25 mg/L, N-NH4 <10 mg/L, N-NHO3 <12 mg/L, N-NO2 <0.3 mg/L values which meet Italian discharge standards. A subsequent quartz filtration and UV sterilization allowed the wastewaters to be reused for washing purposes within the factory. At the final stage of the wastewater treatment it was possible to economize by reusing industrial wastewaters by 30-40%. No problems connected with a gradual accumulation of the recalcitrant or toxic compounds were encountered in the reuse of treated wastewaters and their subsequent biological treatment during 10 months of full scale plant operation. Residual colour removal was however necessary if the wastewaters were also to be used for the preparing of dyes. Laboratory experiments to remove colour using ozone treatment were conducted. A dose of 20 mg/L of ozone was introduced prior to filtration. This step eliminated not only the residual colour but also the residual non-ionic surfactants. As the final result of the treatment it will be possible to use wastewaters not only for washing purposes but also for preparation of the printing colours; it is calculated that economies of 60-70% of process water will be possible.

AB A mathematical model has been developed and calibrated for a two-stage (A + B) activated sludge pilot plant treating wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical industry. Two series of simulations have been performed: (a) by using typical values for the parameters of the model from the bibliography, which remain constant with time, and (b) by using, for some parameters, values which are variable with time, and are determined following a specific methodology. The calibration is constrained to be exactly consistent with daily observations of COD from the effluent and reactor suspended solids (MLSS). Three internal parameters of the system were thus obtained in their daily variation: MLSS growth rate, specific substrate removal rate and concentration factor in: the settling tank. Mean values obtained for MLSS growth rate were 0.73 d(-1) and 0.022 d(-1) for reactors A and a respectively, and the average observed biomass yield coefficient was 0.38 (reactor A) and 0.21 (reactor B). The model infered the evolution of the COD and MLSS with a fairly good accuracy, proving that the method used to obtain the parameters does not have internal inconsistencies and may be used in other situations.

AB N-substituted aromatics are important priority pollutants entering the environment primarily through anthropogenic activities associated with the industrial production of dyes, explosives, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, Anaerobic treatment of wastewaters discharged by these industries could potentially be problematical as a result of the high toxicity of N-substituted aromatics. The objective of this study was to examine the structure-toxicity relationships of N-substituted aromatic compounds to acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria, The toxicity was assayed in serum flasks by measuring methane production in granular sludge, Unacclimated cultures were used to minimize the biotransformation of the toxic organic chemicals during the test. The nature and the degree of the aromatic substitution were observed to have a profound effect on the toxicity of the test compound. Nitroaromatic compounds were, on the average, over 500-fold more toxic than their corresponding aromatic amines. Considering the facile reduction of nitro groups by anaerobic microorganisms, a dramatic detoxification of nitroaromatics towards methanogens can be expected to occur during anaerobic wastewater treatment. While the toxicity exerted by the N-substituted aromatic compounds was closely correlated with compound apolarity (log P), it was observed that at any given log P, N-substituted phenols had a toxicity that was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of chlorophenols and alkylphenols. This indicates that toxicity due to the chemical reactivity of nitroaromatics is much more important than partitioning effects in bacterial membranes.

AB An experimental study for combined stabilization and dewatering of industrial wastewater was carried out by means of a microfiltration unit inside a bioreactor. The module type used was a hollow fiber membrane with a transport area of 0.3 m(2) and pore size of 0.1 mu m. The membrane material was polyethylene. Dewatering was accomplished by applying suction pressure across the membrane. Four suction pressures in short-term experiments with activated sludge from the Barceloneta Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (BRWTP) were studied. The objective here was to determine the membrane hydraulic characteristics and the best conditions for stable, long-term operation. The experiments showed that the flux through the membrane decreases with vacuum pressures greater than 60 kPa owing to rapid clogging of the membrane micropores. Long-term experiments of 62 days duration were carried out with a pharmaceutical wastewater at a suction pressure of 20 kPa. Parameters measured included COD, MLSS, and MLVSS. The operation mode was intermittent with cycle time of 20 min: 4 min of suction followed by 16 min without suction, with average hydraulic retention time of 10.5 h. This mode of operation gave better and more stable results than continuous operation. The MLSS concentration inside the reactor increased throughout the operation, but was always under 40,000 mg/l, the limit for stable operation without sludge wastage. The average COD removal efficiency during the long-term experiments was 63%, with a maximum value of 86%.

TI Biological treatability studies: New regulations require a new approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the past, biological treatability studies were directed toward defining effluent BOD and TSS. Recent regulations now require effluent limitations on volatile organic carbon, specific priority pollutants, aquatic toxicity and in many cases nitrogen for complex wastewaters. This, in turn, has changed the focus of biological treatability studies.
   It is assumed that a screening protocol has been employed to define biological treatment as a candidate process [1].
   (a) Priority Pollutants-If on or more priority pollutants are a permit issue, a fed batch reactor (FBR) is run using acclimated biosolids to determine the maximum degradation rate, q(m), and the half velocity constant, K-s. From these data, the required SRT to meet effluent limitations can be computed.
   (b) Aquatic Toxicity-If the wastewater exhibits aquatic toxicity in addition to priority pollutant requirements, bioassays are run on the biological units. Effluent toxicity and COD are tracked with time. Since effluent toxicity is frequently associated with soluble microbial products (SMP), the SMP is estimated from the effluent COD over time of aeration.
   (c) Nitrogen-Many organics including SMP are inhibitory to nitrification. The nitrification. rate should be determined on the effluents using seeded NH4Cl as a control. From these data, the required SRT can be computed.
   This paper reviews the required protocols and presents several case histories from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.

AB Wastewater from a pharmaceutical and chemical company provides the material of this study. The company produces drugs, diuretics, laboratory chemicals and others. The company is located 30 km north of Cairo, and discharges both industrial (1050 m(3)/d) and human wastewater (8400 m(3)/d) without treatment into a near-by evaporation pond. Reduction of pollutants in the wastewater down to permissible concentrations is necessary for the protection of ground water and the environment. Analysis of the combined wastes indicated that it is very acidic and contains high concentrations of organic compounds and total solids. Combined wastes were subjected to different treatment processes for final disposal into surface water, or reuse for irrigation purposes. Biological treatment of the combined wastes was carried out using both batch and continuous flow systems. The biological treatments included activated sludge process, fixed film reactor, and fixed film reactor followed by activated sludge process. Technical feasibility studies indicated that good quality effluent could be obtained using either extended aeration (20 hr aeration) or a fixed film reactor followed by activated sludge (11 hr detention time). Residual BOD5, COD, oil and grease concentrations in the treated effluent were complying with the National Regularity Standards. When constructional cost was considered extended aeration was the first choice. Engineering designs of the proposed treatment options are included. (C) 1996 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Treatment with ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide was tested in a laboratory scale reactor for removal of organics from four different industrial wastewaters: wastewaters of a paper-mill and of a biotechnical pharmaceutical process as well as two process waters from soil remediation by supercritical water extraction. Moreover, an aqueous solution of triethyleneglycoldimethylether and humic acid which was a model for a biologically treated oil reclaiming wastewater was also oxidized. The aim of the oxidation of the pharmaceutical wastewater was the removal of the preservative 1.1.1-trichloro-2-methyl-2-propanol (TCMP). Although TCMP could easily be removed from pure aqueous solutions by treatment with ozone/hydrogen peroxide, the oxidation of the wastewater failed to be effective in TCMP degradation because of competitive ozonation of other organic solutes in the wastewater. The ozonation of the paper-mill wastewater and of the soil remediation process waters decreased COD and TOC to some extent. The presence of organic wastewater solutes which contain C-C double bonds (ligninsulfonic acid in the treated paper-mill effluent and humic acid in the oil reclaiming model wastewater) were shown to yield hydrogen peroxide by the reaction with ozone. Therefore, these wastewaters are efficiently ozonated even without addition of hydrogen peroxide. Chemical Oxidation of paper-mill wastewater and of wastewaters resulting from soil remediation did not improve biological degradability of organic wastewater constituents.

AB Anaerobic processes have become increasingly important in the treatment of complex industrial wastewaters, which may not only have high concentrations of organics but may contain toxic, persistent/recalcitrant substances. The present paper reports an investigation into the start-up characteristics, feasibility and performance of the Upflow Anaerobic Biofilter Process (UABP) for treating a pharmaceutical effluent, which would be typical of such wastewaters, with an organic concentration of 20,000 mg L-1 COD and two branched-chain fatty acids believed to be persistent/recalcitrant, pivalic acid (PA) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA). In addition to these, there is a readily degradable component, acetic acid. The data from the start-up process beginning with biomass seeding to stable operation showed that the UABP could be satisfactorily started up in two months by using a multiple seeding protocol. Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) was found to be an important key parameter which can improve the removal rates of all targeted substances. Tracking results derived over a year indicated that the process was able to achieve stable performance at 15 days HRT. Increasing the HRT to 20 days substantially improved removal rates of COD and 2-EHA to 93% and 100%, respectively. This longer HRT particularly improved the removal of pivalic acid from 15% to 90%. The biofilter was then able to maintain this good performance when HRT was subsequently decreased in steps to 1.2 days HRT which brought it towards failure. This investigation demonstrated that the UABP could treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing persistent organics effectively.

TI COMPARISON OF 2 STRATEGIES FOR ASSESSING ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF
   COMPLEX WASTE-WATER FROM A CHEMICAL PHARMACEUTICAL PLANT
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENT; PHARMACEUTICALS; TOXICITY; BIOACCUMULATION
AB The potential environmental impact of wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical plant was evaluated by two different characterization strategies. The aim of the first strategy was to characterize the complex ef fluent before and after degradation by activated sludge. Chemical analyses (AOX, EOX, DOC, TOC, BOD, COD(Cr), N-total, N-NH4, N-NO2, N-NO3, P-total, and P-PO4) were performed on the undegraded and the degraded sample. Ecotoxicological tests were performed on the undegraded sample (acute toxicity, Microtox(R), inhibition of respiration of activated sludge, inhibition of nitrification of activated sludge) and on the degraded sample (acute toxicity, Microtox). Moreover, the concentration of potentially bioaccumulating substances was determined in the degraded sample. The tests were done according to the STORK Project (characterization of persistent organic compounds in industrial effluents) initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The second characterization strategy was concentrated on single substances in the effluent. The amount of all discharged chemicals was estimated using mass-balance calculations or by chemical analysis of the water phase. Ecotoxicological data for several of the substances were drawn from the reference literature. For those without any ecotoxicological information, a limited set of tests was performed (Microtox, octanol/water partition coefficient, biodegradation). All substances were classified on the basis of environmental effects using acute toxicity, biodegradation, and bioaccumulation criteria.
   The two different characterization strategies were useful when predicting environmental effects of wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical plant. From a practical and economical point of view, a stepwise approach including elements from both of the above strategies is recommended. A chemical-oriented strategy (discharged amount and ecotoxicological data for each compound) may be useful as a primary step for sorting out hazardous water phases from harmless ones. For less defined water phases, an extensive characterization program, including chemical analyses, acute toxicity testing, and ecotoxicological parameters, may give valuable information about environmental risks.

AB A process has been developed for reducing both the mass and volume of waste activated sludge generated by the biological treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater, As a result of the mixture rule the sludge is classified as a hazardous waste. Thus, treatment and disposal have traditionally been very costly. This study focused on optimizing an engineered hydrolysis operation in terms of solids reduction, environmental impact, practicality and cost. Dewaterability screening studies were also conducted in an attempt to transform the residual solids into a readily filterable material.
   The resultant hydrolysis/thickening/filtration process begins with room temperature sludge acidification using sulfuric acid. This results in 50 to 60 percent solubilization of suspended solids, thus sharply reducing the mass of solids to be handled. Also, carbon dioxide is liberated during the reaction phase, enabling solids separation and thickening to occur via flotation. Subnatant hydrolysate can then be recycled to enhance solids solubilization. Once properly conditioned with acid and cationic polymer, the residual solids are readily pressure filtered to cake dryness in excess of 50% solids. Results of laboratory studies indicate that the overall process is capable of substantially reducing sludge cake production.

TI THE ROLE OF CHEMICAL-ENGINEERING IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL AND THE BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Depending on which definition is chosen, biotechnology can be considered to be one of the oldest industrial technologies or one of the newest. For the chemical engineer, however, the major distinction is in terms of the scale of operation. The majority of products of the new biotechnology are extremely high value, low volume biochemicals. Thus recovery (separation) processes for such products may be relatively costly and energy intensive, because of the small quantities involved, but at the same time must be highly efficient in order to minimize loss of valuable product. This contrasts with the more traditional biotechnological processes of the food and beverage industries, antibiotic and medium value pharmaceuticals production, and wastewater treatment. Here, the problems for the chemical engineer are more like those in the chemical or process industries.
   In this paper a typical biological process is compared with its counterpart chemical process and the role of the chemical engineer in designing and developing such a process is examined through a series of examples. Just as the chemical industry for decades was dominated by the chemist, so the bioprocess industry is still dominated by the industrial microbiologist. There are consequently many areas in which improvements can be made to established industrial biological processes by the application of simple engineering concepts.

AB The activated sludge organisms of a pharmaceutical sewage plant heavily loaded with organic wastes were studied in a series of 11 samples collected monthly. High population densities of the microflora and microfauna indicate that the waste water contains no toxic compounds beyond tolerable limits. The organic substance on average amounts to 16 g dry mass/l; it consists of 96% prokaryotic (bacterial) and 4% eukaryotic (protozoan) biomass. Related to suspended solids the protozoan biomass constitutes 2%; 4 tons protozoa (wet mass, corresponding to 800 kg dry mass) are produced in 1400 m3 waste water daily. The high organic load (21 kg BOD5/m3.d), the short retention time (24 h), the high temperature (30-degrees-C) and the lack of distinct flocs favour few well adapted polysaprobic protozoan species. The morphology and ecology of 7 ciliate species found in fresh sludge are described, including Parastrongylidium oswaldi n. sp.

Four completely mixed, single-stage, activated sludge units, with a capacity of 80-litres were operated in parallel.  The effect of various concentrations of the test chemical on the sludge settleability, the sludge growth, and the plant performance in terms of BOD and COD removal were examined during the study.  It was concluded that a concentration of 0.1% ethylene glycol in the raw wastewater of the full-scale plant was treatable, as higher concentrations appeared to cause a deterioration in the floc structure and to enhance Nocardia scum formation on the surface of the aeration basin.

TI APPLICATION OF ELECTROACOUSTICS FOR DEWATERING PHARMACEUTICAL SLUDGE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Application of electro acoustic principles for dewatering has been developed by Battelle Institute.  The Department of Energy, Battelle Institute, and Ashbrook-Simon-Hartley, have jointly developed an Electro Acoustic Dewatering press (EAD press).  The EAD press applies a combination of mechanical pressure, electrical current and ultrasonics.  This press is utilized after conventional dewatering devices and can remove up to 50% water from filtered sludge cake at a fraction of the cost incurred in existing thermal drying devices.  The dominant mechanism of sludge dewatering by EAD press if electro-osmosis due to the application of a direct current field.  Electro-osmosis is caused by an electrical double layer of oppositely charged ions formed at the solid liquid interface, which is characterized by zeta potential.  The ultrasonic fields help electro-osmosis by consolidation of the filter cake and by release of inaccessible liquid.  The EAD press has been tested successfully on a variety of materials including apple pomace, corn gluten, sewage sludge, and coal fines.  A three week long full scale trial was conducted successfully at a pharmaceutical industry to determine the application of this technology for dewatering waste activated sludge.

AB Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR's) offer many advantages and few disadvantages to the wastewater treatment process selection. Due to the relatively recent surge of interest in SBR's, few plants have been on-line long enough for Engineers to have developed a thorough understanding of all design aspects and considerations. The author has been involved directly in the design, equipment supply, start-up and operation of almost 60 SBR's of all sizes. About two thirds of the installations are municipal and one-third of these installations are industrial sites involving wastes from food processors, dairies, distilleries, petro-chemical manufacturers, landfill leachate, tanneries, Government munition plants and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The control of filamentous bulking has also been excellent with SBR's.
   This paper will consider the mechanical, process and control aspects for design of an SBR. The mechanical aspects will include HRT and basin sizing, selection of aeration equipment and effluent decanters. The process parameters discussed will include loading rates and F:M considerations, MLSS concentration, oxygen requirements and D.O. uptake rate, flow proportional aeration, the benefits of an anoxic fill cycle, and finally, nutrient removal. Control considerations are briefly discussed.

AB Biological treatment, especially nitrogen removal, in an upflow packed bed reactor with immobilised biomass was studied. As a support material granulated activated carbon (GAC), ceramic material (crush brick), brown coal and cut polyethylene tubes were used. The size of the support material was 4 to 6 millimetres. In laboratory scale studies pharmaceutical wastewater was treated. Volumetric loading was from 6.8 to 7.6 g/l/day. Results of investigations showed us that aerated packed bed reactors are usable for nitrogen removal because in the reactor originates aerobic and anoxic conditions. In anoxic cones the denitrification of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia ions takes place. The most effective systems for nitrogen removal were reactors filled with granulated activated carbon and with ceramic material. In the reactor with granulated activated carbon also colour from wastewater was degraded.

AB Industrial drying techniques are successfully used processes.  They are usually used for the production of base materials for industries such as food, chemical and pharmaceutical.  These processes can be transferred without any difficulty for the drying of sewage sludge.
   Thermal drying as a process for the purpose of water removal is an important link in waste management between sludge production and sludge disposal.
   Two systems, convection and contact drying, are here compared.
   Contact drying in the thin film evaporation process is explained.
   Explanation and proposed uses of the single-and two-stage drying systems will be discussed.
   Finally a short review of incurred expenses will be given.
