AB The presence of detectable amounts of contaminants in treated sewage sludge (concentrations mu g/kg - mg/kg) has led to concerns that land applications of biosolids may result in an accumulation of contaminants in the soil and their subsequent translocation through the food chain. Despite advances in wastewater management (e.g., anaerobic, thermophilic, and mesophilic digestion), many compounds and their metabolites remain intact following treatment. This review looks at the main risk factors relating to the occurrence of "classic" (persistent organic pollutants [POPs]) and emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in biosolids. Relevant EU legislation and risk assessment strategies for the control of emerging contaminants are also considered. Organic pollutants regulated under the Stockholm Convention on POPs along with PPCPs were identified as contaminants of concern based on the risk factors: persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT). PPCPs were recognized as being of particular concern as their high transformation/removal rates are compensated by their continuous introduction into the environment. This study highlights the growing concern in relation to emerging contaminants in biosolids and highlights risk assessment strategies that can be used to characterize potential human/environmental risks.

TI Upgrading the performances of ultrafiltration membrane system coupled

AB The biological treatment of an hospital effluent has been monitored during 150 days in an activated sludge system followed by an ultrafiltration membrane (BBR-UF). After 75 days, support media was added into the bioreactor to develop a biofilm and to compare process performances of the two reactor configurations: activated sludge (AS-UF) or biofilm biological reactor (BBR-UF). The removal efficiencies of (chemical oxygen demand) COD, (total suspended solids) TSS, (volatiles suspended solids) VSS, and (total nitrogen) TN with the BBR-UF were 93.2%, 100%, 99.9% and 91.3%, respectively, compared to 87.9%, 99.6%, 97.5% and 91.1% with the AS-UF. Codeine, ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, roxithromycin, metronidazole, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, gemfibrozil, pravastatin, and iohexol were highly removed by BBR-UF, while low removal was observed for the same molecules in the AS-UF. This could be attributed (1) to the increase of biomass concentration, (2) to the increase of sludge resident time or (3) to sorption on the biofilms. During continuous reactor operation, (trans membrane pressure) TMP increase in BBR-UF was negligible whereas membrane module in AS-UF required a regular physical maintenance. In the last case, membrane fouling was attributed to the modification of the concentration of the produced exopolymeric substances like protein and polysaccharide. The addition of biofilm supports media improved the performances of AS-UF and also decreased the negatives effects of the biomass on the membrane for the treatment of hospital wastewaters.

AB We analyzed pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) in 36 samples taken from surface water, wastewater, ground-water, tap water and bottled water in Hanoi, Vietnam. We then compared the occurrence and fates of PMMoV with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which are known wastewater tracers. PMMoV was detected in 94% of the surface water samples (ponds, water from irrigated farmlands and rivers) and in all the wastewater samples. The PMMoV concentration ranged from 5.5 x 10(6)-72 x 10(6) copies/L in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents, 6.5 x 10(5)-8.5 x 10(5) copies/L in WWTP effluents and 1.0 x 10(4)-1.8 x 10(6) copies/L in surface water. Among the sixty PPCPs analyzed, caffeine and carbamazepine had high detection rates in surface water (100% and 88%, respectively). In surface water, the concentration ratio of PMMoV to caffeine remained unchanged than that in WWTP influents, suggesting that the persistence of PMMoV in surface water was comparable to that of caffeine. The persistence and the large concentration ratio of PMMoV in VVWTP influents to the method detection limit would account for its ubiquitous detection in surface water. In comparison, human enteric viruses (HEV) were less frequently detected (18-59%) than PMMoV in surface water, probably because of their faster decay. Together with the reported high human feces-specificity, our results suggested that PMMoV is useful as a sensitive fecal indicator for evaluating the potential occurrence of pathogenic viruses in surface water. Moreover, PMMoV can be useful as a moderately conservative fecal tracer for specifically tracking fecal pollution of surface water. PMMoV was detected in 38% of the groundwater samples at low concentrations (up to 19 copies/L). PMMoV was not detected in the tap water and bottled water samples. In groundwater, tap water and bottled water samples, the occurrence of PPCPs and HEV disagreed with that of PMMoV, suggesting that PMMoV is not suitable as an indicator or a tracer in those waters.

AB The degradation of seven compounds which are usually recalcitrant in classical activated sludge treatment (e.g., diclofenac, propranolol, iopromide, iohexol, iomeprol tebuconazole and propiconazole) was studied in a biofilm reactor (slow sand filtration). This reactor was used to treat real effluent-wastewater at different flow rates (hydraulic loadings) under aerobic conditions so removal and degradation kinetics of these recalcitrant compounds were calculated. With the hydraulic loading rate of 0.012 m(3) m (2) h(-1) the reactor removed 41, 94, 58,57 and 85% of diclofenac, propranolol, iopromide, iohexol and iomeprol respectively. For these compounds the removal efficiency was dependent on hydraulic residence-times. Only 59 and 21% of the incoming tebuconazole and propiconazole respectively were removed but their removal did not depend on hydraulic residence time. Biofilm reactors are thus efficient in removing micro-pollutants and could be considered as an option for advanced treatment in small wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The electrochemical degradation of six of the most widely used iodinated contrast media was investigated. Batch experiments were performed under constant current conditions using two DSA (R) electrodes (titanium coated with a proprietary and patented mixed metal oxide solution of precious metals such as iridium, ruthenium, platinum, rhodium and tantalum). The degradation removal never fell below 85% (at a current density of 64 mA/cm(2) with a reaction time of 150 min) when perchlorate was used as the supporting electrolyte; however, when sulphate was used, the degradation performance was above 80% (at a current density of 64 mA/cm(2) with a reaction time of 150 min) for all of the compounds studied. Three main degradation pathways were identified, namely, the reductive de-iodination of the aromatic ring, the reduction of alkyl aromatic amides to simple amides and the de-acylation of N-aromatic amides to produce aromatic amines. However, as amidotrizoate is an aromatic carboxylate, this is added via the decarboxylation reaction. The investigation did not reveal toxicity except for the lower current density used, which has shown a modest toxicity, most likely for some reaction intermediates that are not further degraded. In order to obtain total removal of the contrast media, it was necessary to employ a current intensity between 118 and 182 mA/cm(2) with energy consumption higher than 370 kWh/m(3). Overall, the electrochemical degradation was revealed to be a reliable process for the treatment of iodinated contrast media that can be found in contaminated waters such as hospital wastewater or pharmaceutical waste-contaminated streams.

AB In order to achieve high quality water reuse, a dual membrane hybrid system (combining microtiltration-granular activated carbon (MF-GAC)) adsorption hybrid system followed by nanofiltration (NE)) was used This system's performance was evaluated in terms of organic matter, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and removal of inorganic matter. Biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSF) collected from a water reclamation plant in Sydney, Australia was used as the water source. The removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of MF-GAC strongly depends on the dose of GAC and filtration flux. MF-GAC system effectively removed hydrophobic organics (45-80%) as well as hydrophilic organics (50-80%). The removal of various PPCPs ranged from 33% to 92%, and as expected, the amount of inorganic matter removed by the MF-GAC system was very small. Hence, the NF system, as a second membrane system, was employed to polish the effluent from the MF-GAC hybrid system. The NF system rejected most of DOC (> 95%), sulfates (99%) and a substantial amount of calcium (70%), and magnesium (60%) from ME-GAC effluent. Further, more than 90% of PPCPs were removed by the NE system. Overall the dual membrane hybrid system proved to be very effective in removing organics, PPCPs and inorganic matter. The MF-GAC followed by NE results in high quality water reuse and this system can serve as an effective treatment option for water reuse schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB A hydrophilic thin-film-composite (TFC) nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been developed through the interfacial polymerization (IP) of amino-functional polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trimesoyl chloride. The selective layer is formed on a polyethersullone (PES) support that is characterized using FTIR, XPS and SEM, and is dependent on monomer immersion duration, and the concentration of monomers and additives. The higher hydrophilicity alongside the larger pore size of the PEG-based selective layer is the key to a high water flux of 66.0 L m(-2) h(-1) at 5.0 bar. With mean pore radius of 0.42 nm and narrow pore size distribution, the MgSO4 rejections of the PEG based PA TFC NF membranes can reach up to 80.2%. The rejection rates for different salts of the novel membranes are in the order of R(MgCl2) > R(MgSO4) > R(NaCl) > R(Na2SO4); indicating a membrane with positive surface charges. The pore sizes and water permeability of these membranes are tailored by varying the molecular weight and molecular architecture of amino-functional PEG. These newly developed TFC NF membranes show great potential for water softening, wastewater treatment and separation and purification of active, pharmaceutical molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Once discharged into the sewage system, many pharmaceuticals may undergo degradation reactions in the presence of chemical disinfectants, generating by-products that may possess enhanced toxicity relative to the parent compounds. For this reason, the stability of the widely used cytostatic etoposide in chlorinated water has been investigated for the first time in the present work. Taking advantage of the high-resolution/accurate-mass capabilities of the hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer Q Exactive, two new oxidation by-products of etoposide were reliably identified. The time course of etoposide and its by-products was followed at different pH values, free chlorine concentrations and water matrices. Finally, the occurrence of etoposide and its major identified by-product (3'-O-desmethyl etoposide) was investigated in real water samples by on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a 4000QTRAP hybrid quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The etoposide by-product was found in various river and wastewater samples at levels between 14 and 33 ng L-1, whereas etoposide was not detected in any sample. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Immobilized TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays containing anatase phases were synthesized through electrochemical oxidation of TiO2 foil. At ultrasonic (US) frequencies of 28 and 1000 kHz, the feasibility of the use of TiO2 NTs was investigated in terms of the production of H2O2 and the degradation of acetaminophen (AAP) and naproxen (NPX), which are pharmaceuticals (PhACs) used for pain relief and which persist despite wastewater treatment. The degradation efficiencies of the PhACs, as well as the production of H2O2, were enhanced in the presence of TiO2 NTs. Furthermore, the reduction of TiO2 slurries after the reaction was achieved at 1000 kHz. The feasibility of the TiO2 NTs was clearly shown in US/Fenton/TiO2 NT process, exhibiting the highest degradation (85.3% for AAP and 96.0% for NPX) at low Fe2+:H2O2 ratio of 20:4 ratio at 1000 kHz. These results could be attributed to the accelerated cycling of Fe2+-Fe3+, assisted by electrons in the presence of TiO2 NTs under US irradiation. In the US/CCI4 process, the degradation rates of both PhACs were improved with an increased concentration of CCl4, implying that the scavenging(center dot)H leads to high concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and the accumulation of reactive chlorine species, while t-BuOH notably inhibited the degradation of the PhACs. In acidic conditions, high degradation efficiencies were observed because of the hydrophobicity of the PhACs, high (OH)-O-center dot activity, and high HOCl/OCI- ratio. Finally, we suggest possible process mechanisms of the US/Fenton/TiO2 NT and US/CCI4 processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contaminants that are becoming detected in the environment but are not yet generally regulated or monitored are known collectively as emerging contaminants. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of 42 emerging organic compounds (EOCs) were investigated in the Yangtze River Estuary and adjacent East China Sea coastal areas. Study compounds were mainly pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, hormones and sterols, and also included two industrial endocrine disruptors. Samples were analyzed using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF) and,ultra-performance liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Results revealed that chloramphenicols, sulfonamides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the dominant compounds in filtered samples with relatively high concentrations and detection frequencies. EOC levels varied with location, with the highest concentrations being observed around rivers discharging into the estuary, and near sewage outfalls. Colloids that were separated by CFUF tended to be a sink for EOCs with up to 60% being colloid-associated in the water phase. In addition, colloidal properties, including hydrodynamic size, zeta-potential and organic carbon composition, were found to be the main factors controlling the association of EOCs with aquatic colloids. Moreover, these colloidal properties were all significantly related to salinity, indicating the critical role played by increasing salinity in EOCs-colloids interaction in an estuarine system.

AB Many technologies are being developed for the efficient removal of micropollutants from wastewater and, among them, fungal degradation is one of the possible alternative biological treatments. In this article, some factors that might affect pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) removal in a fungal treatment of real wastewater were identified in batch bioreactor treating reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We found that degradation of PhACs by Trametes versicolor was enhanced by addition of external nutrients (global removal of 44%). Moreover, our results point out that high aeration might be involved in the increase in the concentration of some PhACs. In fact, conjugation and deconjugation processes (among others) affect the removal assessment of emerging contaminants when working with real concentrations in comparison to experiments with spiked samples. Moreover, factors that could affect the quantification of micropollutants at lab-scale experiments were studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been widely investigated as promising technologies to remove trace organic contaminants from water, but have rarely been used for the treatment of real waste streams. Anodic oxidation with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode was applied for the treatment of secondary effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant containing 29 target pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed from the contaminants decay, dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand removal. The effect of applied current and pH was evaluated. Almost complete mineralization of effluent organic matter and trace contaminants can be obtained by this EAOP primarily due to the action of hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface. The oxidation of Cl- ions present in the wastewater at the BDD anode gave rise to active chlorine species (Cl-2/HClO/ClO-), which are competitive oxidizing agents yielding chloramines and organohalogen byproducts, quantified as adsorbable organic halogen. However, further anodic oxidation of HClO/ClO- species led to the production of ClO3- and ClO4- ions. The formation of these species hampers the application as a single-stage tertiary treatment, but posterior cathodic reduction of chlorate and perchlorate species may reduce the risks associated to their presence in the environment.

AB The ecological threat associated with emerging pollutants detected in wastewater was estimated in country level. Treated wastewater was analyzed for pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs; whereas the concentrations of all emerging contaminants determined in Greek Sewage Treatment Plants were recorded through literature review. Toxicity data was collected after literature review or using ECOSAR and risk quotients (RQs) were calculated for treated wastewater and 25 Greek rivers, for 3 different aquatic organisms (fish, daphnia magna, algae). According to the results, monitoring data was available for 207 micropollutants belonging to 8 different classes. RQ > 1 was calculated for 30 compounds in secondary treated wastewater. Triclosan presented RQ > 1 (in algae) for all studied rivers; decamethylcyclopentasilane (in daphnia magna), caffeine (in algae) and nonylphenol (in fish) presented RQ > 1 in rivers with dilution factors (OF) equal or lower to 1910, 913 and 824, respectively. The class of emerging contaminants that present the greatest threat due to single or mixture toxicity was endocrine disrupters. The mixture of microcontaminants seems to pose significant ecological risk, even in rivers with DF equal to 2388. Future national monitoring programs should include specific microcontaminants that seem to possess environment risk to surface water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The cosmetics industry has been growing steadily for the past several years in China, yet very few researches exist on cosmetic wastewater treatment system. This study gave new insight to develop a combined anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and upflow biological aerated filter (UBAF) system for the treatment of cosmetic wastewater. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency in the cosmetic wastewater was mainly investigated in the front two compartments of ABR reactor, while it was treated by the same reactor with six compartments. When the influent COD load was set at 1.5 g COD/L.d, the COD removal efficiency reached a maximum in the No. 1 compartment. The highest COD removal efficiency achieved 2.0 g COD/L.d for the complete ABR reactor. The optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the ABR was 48 h. A UBAF reactor was applied to advanced treatment for ABR effluent. The coke powder with the diameter of 0.5-1.0mm and the gas-water ratio of 7:1 were chosen the optimal experimental conditions. Under the above-optimal experimental conditions, the COD removal efficiency of UBAF was 69.5-82.6%. After the combined treatment by ABR and UBAF, the cosmetic wastewater effluent can effectively supply the discharge standard in China.

AB Caffeine, a purine alkaloid drug, has been recognized as a contaminant of water bodies in various climatic regions, however, these environmental caffeine concentrations are the first to be reported in the tropical Caribbean. The major objective of this study was to develop an improved method to extract caffeine from surface and wastewaters in the warm Caribbean environment and measure caffeine concentrations in highly populated areas in Barbados. Caffeine was extracted from water via solid phase extraction (SPE); the acidified water samples were loaded onto C-18 cartridges and eluted with pure chloroform. The extracted caffeine was quantified using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy - multiple reaction monitoring (GC-MS/MS-MRM). Method detection limits of 0.2 ng L-1 from 1 L water samples were achieved. Caffeine was detected in all environmental water samples investigated. The concentrations of caffeine in surface waters were detected in the range 0.1 - 6.9 mu g L-1. The two wastewater treatment plants, primary and secondary treatment systems, significantly differed in their ability to eliminate caffeine in the raw sewage (38% and 99% caffeine removal efficiencies respectively). Thus, it may be essential to employ secondary treatment to effectively remove caffeine from wastewater systems in Barbados. Caffeine in water bodies are principally attributed to anthropogenic sources as caffeine-producing plants are not commonly grown on the island of Barbados. The study also shows the recalcitrance of caffeine to hydrolytic degradation.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are generally found at very low levels in aquatic environments, concern about their potential risks to humans and aquatic species has been raised because they are designed to be biologically active. To resolve this concern, we must know whether the biological activity of pharmaceuticals can be detected in waters. Nearly half of all marketed pharmaceuticals act by binding to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, we measured the physiological activity of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. We applied the in vitro transforming growth factor-a (TGFa) shedding assay, which accurately and sensitively detect GPCR activation, to investigate the agonistic/antagonistic activities of wastewater extracts against receptors for angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2, D4), adrenergic family members (alpha 1B, alpha 2A, beta 1, beta 3), acetylcholine (M1, M3), cannabinoid (CB1), vasopressin (V1A, V2), histamine (H1, H2, H3), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A, 5-HT2C), prostanoid (EP3), and leukotriene (BLT1). As a result, antagonistic activity against AT1, D2, alpha 1B, beta 1, M1, M3, H1, and V2 receptors was detected at up to several mu g/L for the first time. Agonistic activity against alpha 2A receptor was also detected. The TGFa shedding assay is useful for measuring the physiological activity of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

The optimal separation parameters were established based upon the experimental results obtained at the study of the feed phase pH influence upon the efficiency of the two compounds transport. These results can be closely correlated with the distribution diagram of chemical species in solution depending on the pH. When using a feed phase at pH similar to 2 and a receiving phase at pH similar to 12 the separation of salicylic acid through a chloroform membrane with efficiency higher than 80%, at a transport time of 3 h, was realized. The recovery degree from a mixture of salicylic acid and 5-aminosalicylic acid is over 90 %.

AB Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is increasingly used for municipal wastewater treatment and reuse and great concerns have been raised to some emerging trace pollutants found in aquatic environment in the last decade, notably the pharmaceuticals. As a consequence the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants by MBRs has been extensively investigated. But there is still a lack of knowledge on the effects of the current presence of pharmaceutical micropollutants in domestic wastewaters on MBR fouling. Among the different pharmaceuticals, it was decided to focus on carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug, because of its occurrence in domestic wastewaters and persistency in biological processes including MBRs. This paper focuses on the effects of continuous carbamazepine pollution on MBR fouling. A continuous introduction of CBZ into the MBR via the feed (about 90 mu g L-1 CBZ in the feed) provoked a TMP jump. It occurred just 1 day after the addition of CBZ in MBR and a significantly higher increase rate of TMP was also observed after 1 day after addition of CBZ in MBR, as compared to that before addition of CBZ. This indicates that the pharmaceutical stress induced by CBZ causes more severe membrane fouling. Addition of CBZ was shown to induce a significant increase of the concentration of proteins in the supernatant at the beginning several days then stabilized to original level whereas no significant change was found for polysaccharides. HPLC-SEC analysis showed that addition of CBZ induced a decrease of 100-1000 kDa protein-like SMPs and a more significant increase of 10-100 kDa protein-like SMPs in the supernatant. Moreover it was found that addition of CBZ in the MBR affected the sludge microbial activities, as a slight inhibition (about 20%) of the exogenous respiration rate was observed. The increased membrane fouling could be related to the change in biomass characteristics and supernatant quality after addition of CBZ in MBR. This study allows also suggesting that 10-100 kDa protein-like SMPs might accumulate inside the biocake that was formed on the membrane surface during MBR operation and play an important role in the TMP jump phenomenon.

AB A target screening method using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) was developed. The method was applied to 14 groundwater and 11 surface water samples of a former wastewater infiltration site, where raw wastewater was applied until 1985 and treated wastewater is applied since 2005. The measured data are compared with mass spectrometric data of over 2000 organic micropollutants (OMPs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, industrial chemicals and metabolites of these classes. A total number of 151 and 159 OMPs were detected in groundwater and surface water, respectively, of which 12 have not been reported before in these matrices. Among these 12 compounds were 11 pharmaceuticals and one personal care product. The identity of 55 of the detected OMPs (35%) was verified by analysis of standard compounds. Based on the distribution in the study area, two groups of OMPs were clearly distinguished: current OMPs introduced with treated municipal wastewater since 2005 and legacy OMPs originating from infiltration of untreated wastewater until 1985. A third group included OMPs contained in historic as well as in current wastewater. During infiltration, OMPs with molecular mass >500 g/mol and log Dow > 3.9 were preferentially removed. Speciation had a strong impact with cationic OMPs showing high, neutral OMPs medium and anionic OMPs lowest elimination during infiltration. This target screening method proved useful to study a wide range of compounds, even in retrospect and at sites with poorly documented history and with a complex and variable hydrological situation.

AB As part of our study on pharmaceutical waste management in Ghana, we investigated the biodegradability of the most widely used antituberculosis drug isoniazid in the aquatic environment. The experiment was conducted using three tests from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines (close bottle test (CBT) 301D, low bacterial density i.e. <1000 colony forming units (CFU) mL(-1), manometric respiratory test (MRT) 301F, i.e. <1000CFUmL(-1) and the Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT) 302B, i.e. <1000CFUmL(-1)) employing different concentrations. At the end of the study, the results showed that isoniazid at concentrations of 4.29mgL(-1) for the CBT and 25.7mgL(-1) for the MRT were found not to be readily biodegradable in accordance with the test guidelines. In the ZWT, at a concentration of 142.92mgL(-1) which allows evaluation of aerobic degradation at high bacterial density, the results provided evidence for biological degradation of isoniazid. Finally, the test samples after 28days analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet detector showed a complete primary elimination of the test substance in MRT and ZWT. The difference of the results obtained by HPLC and oxygen consumption in the MRT indicated the formation of stable transformation products, i.e. incomplete biodegradation, whilst there was no biodegradation at all in CBT.

AB Thiosulfate is generated from various process industries, such as petrochemical, metallurgical, photography processing, pharmaceutical, pigment and dye manufacturing units, etc. Thiosulfate-bearing wastewater is also produced during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater. In the present work, oxidative removal of thiosulfate in the presence of UV light from aqueous solution has been investigated. The effect of thiosulfate concentration, oxygen partial pressure, UV light intensity and air flow rate on the kinetics of thiosulfate removal has been explored, and suitable rate equations were developed for the oxidation processes. 67 % of thiosulfate was removed from the aqueous solution by carrying out aerial oxidation for one hour. Using photooxidation by UV light, 1,200ppm thiosulfate could be oxidized by one hour. Overall reaction by aerial oxidation followed the second-order kinetics, whereas by photooxidation, it followed third-order kinetics.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used in human and veterinary medicine, representing potential aquatic environmental contamination. This study aimed to perform an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of NSAIDs diclofenac (Dic) and ibuprofen (Ibu) in cities of the state of Parana, Brazil, over the course of three years, by using available data from the Brazilian Public Health System. The environmental risk (ER) was assessed by employing the European Medicines Agency (EMeA) approach, and predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated. The refined PECs considered the drug metabolism and the excretion data, and also the sewage treatment plant removal rates of biological filters and activated sludge processes to define environmental scenarios. References to the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for these pharmaceuticals were considered, and the PEC/PNEC ratio was calculated; ratio values >= 1 suggested an ER. Environmental risk was conducted on several cities, and the lack of an adequate sanitation system in the majority of Parana cities forecasts a significant concern with the exposure to possible environmental damages in those cities. The high PEC/PNEC ratios in several cities showed that current usage patterns of these drugs constitute an environmental issue in need of resolution by health and environmental authorities.

AB Estrogenic compounds have been monitored for one year at an urban sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Tunisia, to evaluate their fate and seasonal variations. The concentrations of these compounds were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC MS). Results showed that the highest removal of all estrogens (>= 80%) was observed in summer. Mass balance analysis revealed that biodegradation was the predominant removal mechanism. Moreover, the results showed that the removal efficiency of the studied emerging micropollutants and their concentrations in the solid phase of return sludge were much higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. These findings were closely related to microbial activity and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSSs). Finally, the findings can be used to help with the modifications that could be implemented in that STP for the improved removal of estrogenic contaminants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes in presence of UV light are successful to obtain complete mineralization of various pharmaceutical pollutants but no one has studied the photocatalytic removal of spiramycin under visible light irradiation. In this work, N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst active under visible light was used to evaluate the photodegradation of this antibiotic. Photocatalytic tests were carried out in a slurry photoreactor irradiated both with UV Black Light Tube and blue LEDs with spectrum emission in the visible region. Reaction products were monitored both in liquid-phase, by TOC analysis, and in gas-phase, by continuous analyzers, measuring CO and CO2 gaseous concentrations at the photoreactor outlet. The only product detected in gas-phase during UV and visible light irradiation was CO2, confirming that the photocatalytic process has been proven effective in the mineralization process of spiramycin, reaching very high values of TOC removal. A detailed mathematical modelling was performed, estimating a single value of reaction constant, able to predict the behavior of mineralization also for different initial concentrations of antibiotic. The system was effective in the removal of organic compounds present in a real pharmaceutical wastewater reaching high values of depollution in short times. It has been demonstrates the feasibility of photocatalytic visible treatment of streams containing spiramycin with N-doped TiO2, yielding in a promising method for wastewater treatment.

AB Anew photocatalyst based on nano-sized TiO2 supported on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored photocatalytic properties upon irradiation by both UV and solar simulated light was successfully employed for the degradation of a mixture of 22 organic pollutants in both ultrapure water and real secondary wastewater effluent. First-order degradation rates showed that under UV irradiation nanosized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs is much more effective than conventional Degussa P25 for degradation of iopamidol, iopromide, diatrizoic acid, diclofenac, triclosan and sulfamethoxazole in ultrapure water. For the remaining organics the degradation rates were comparable being in most of the cases Degussa P25 slightly more effective than nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs. Reactions performed in real secondary wastewater effluent showed a general reduction of degradation rates. Specifically, such a reduction was in the range 9-87% and 9-96% for the Degussa P25 and the nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs, respectively. Overall, the nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs under UV irradiation displayed comparable degradation rates with respect to convention Degussa P25. Under simulated solar irradiation the new prepared photocatalyst showed lower efficiency than Degussa P25 in ultrapure water. Such a gap was greatly reduced when the reactions were carried out in real secondary wastewater effluent. The nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs demonstrated to have the addition benefit to be easily removed from the aqueous solution by a mild centrifugation or a filtration step and, consequently, can be reused for a further photocatalytic treatment batch. Therefore, the obtained results showed that new photocatalyst based on nano-sized TiO2 supported on SWCNTs has proved to be a promising candidate to be used in a photocatalytic based-AOP and to be integrated with a biological step for the effective removal of emerging organic pollutants.

AB A double membrane system comprising a membrane bioreactor (MBR) combined with a nanofiltration (NF) membrane was investigated on a pilot scale for the treatment of antibiotic production wastewater over a three-month period at a pharmaceutical company in Wuxi, China. By recycling the NF concentrate, the combined MBR-NF process was shown to be effective for the treatment of antibiotic production wastewater, resulting in excellent water quality and a high water yield of 92 +/- 5.6%. The water quality of the pilot-scale MBR-NF process was excellent; e.g., the concentrations of TOC, NH4+-N, TP were stable at 5.52, 0.68, 0.34 mg L-1, respectively, and the values of turbidity and conductivity of the NF permeate were 0.15 NTU and 2.5 mS cm(-1), respectively; these values meet China's water quality standard requirements for industrial use (GB21903-2008). Not only were the antibiotic removal rates of spiramycin (SPM) and new spiramycin (NSPM) over 95%, the acute toxicity was also drastically reduced by the MBR-NF pilot system. The main organics in the MBR effluent were proteins, polysaccharides, and humic-like substances; they were almost completely retained by the NF membrane and further biodegraded in the MBR because the NF concentrate was recycled. The microbial community of the MBR did not significantly change with the recycling of the NF concentrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anticancer drugs are harmful substances that can have carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, genotoxic, and cytotoxic effects even at low concentrations. More than 50 years after its introduction, the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CP) is still one of the most consumed anticancer drug worldwide. CP has been detected in water bodies in several studies and is known as being persistent in the aquatic environment. As the traditional water and wastewater treatment technologies are not able to remove CP from the water, different treatment options such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are under discussion to eliminate these compounds. The present study investigated the degradation of CP by three different AOPs: UV/H2O2, UV/Fe2+/H2O2 and UV/TiO2. The light source was a Hg medium-pressure lamp. Prescreening tests were carried out and afterwards experiments based on the optimized conditions were performed. The primary elimination of the parent compounds and the detection of transformation products (TPs) were monitored with LC-UV-MS/MS analysis, whereas the degree of mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Ecotoxicological assays were carried out with the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. CP was completely degraded in all treatments and UV/Fe2+/H2O2 was the fastest process, followed by UV/H2O2 and UV/TiO2. All the reactions obeyed pseudo-first order kinetics. Considering the mineralization UV/Fe2+/H2O2 and UV/TiO2 were the most efficient process with mineralization degrees higher than 85%, whereas UV/H2O2 achieved 72.5% of DOC removal. Five transformation products were formed during the reactions and identified. None of them showed significant toxicity against V. fischeri. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence of five estrogens, including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water, sediment and biota in Northern Taihu Lake, were investigated and their ecological risk was evaluated. Most of the target estrogens were widely distributed in the eight studied sampling sites, and their levels showed a regional trend of Gong Bay < Meiliang Bay < Zhushan Bay. The average concentrations of E1, E2, E3, EE2 and BPA ranged from 3.86 to 64.4 ng l(-1), 44.3 to 64.1 lg k(-)1 dry weight and 58.6 to 115 lg kg(-1) dry weight in water, sediments and biota, respectively. In most cases, the average concentrations of BPA and E2 were higher than those of other estrogens. E1, E3 and EE2 were found to be accumulated in river snails with bioaccumulation factor values as high as 14,204, 35,327 and 20,127 l kg(-1), respectively. E3 was also considered to be accumulated in clams. The evaluation of environmental risk showed that the occurrence of E2 and EE2 in lakes might pose a high risk to aquatic organisms. These findings provide important information for estrogen control and management in the studied area.

AB For the photocatalytic removal of bisphenol A (BPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from water solution a new multiwall-carbon nanotubes and TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposites (MWCNT-TiO2-SiO2) were applied. Nano-composites with the addition of 0.15-17.8 wt% MWCNT show high potential for the removal of both pollutants. The starting concentration of each contaminant was halved during 20 min of UVA irradiation. The decomposition process of CBZ over investigated nanocomposites proceeded differently than it was observed for the classical photocatalyst P25. The kinetics of the removal followed as a pseudo-first order regime with the k(1) in range 0.0827-0.1751 min(-1) for BPA and 0.0131-0.0743 min(-1) for CBZ. Toxicity to Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna was significantly reduced indicating formation of non-toxic products of photooxidation of tested contaminants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Due to differences in stereostructure, enantiomeric compositions and enantiomeric ratios (ERs) of chiral compounds can be used to discriminate environmental processes such as abiotic and biotic degradation/transformation. In this study, the ERs of two chiral polycyclic musks, 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN), were investigated in the sediments of Zhujiang River and Dongjiang River in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), as well as in those of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai City. The results indicated that ERcis of HHCB varied significantly, ranging from 1.09 to 1.53 and 1.40 to 1.48 in the PRD and Suzhou Creek samples, respectively, whereas ERtrans of HHCB exhibited limited variation, ranging from 0.98 to 1.10 and 0.98 to 1.05 for Pearl River and Suzhou Creek samples, respectively. In addition, ERs of AHTN varied substantially from 1.10 to 1.34 and 1.17 to 1.28 in the PRD and Suzhou Creek, respectively. These results suggest that HHCB in the sediment in the study area underwent biotic degradation and the preferential biotransformation isomer was (4R,7S)-HHCB, while AHTN simultaneously underwent a certain degree of biotic degradation/transformation.

AB New, sustainable, and low-cost materials that can simultaneously remove a range of wastewater contaminants, such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical residues, are needed. In this work, modified biochars were produced by dip-coating hickory or bagasse biomass in carbon nanotube (CNT) suspensions with or without sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)-aided dispersion prior to slow pyrolysis in a N-2 environment at 600 A degrees C. The sulfapyridine (SPY) and lead (Pb) sorption ability of pristine hickory (HC) and bagasse (BC) biochars and the modified biochars with (HC-SDBS-CNT and BC-SDBS-CNT, respectively) and without (HC-CNT and BC-CNT) SDBS was assessed in laboratory aqueous batch single- and binary-solute system. The greatest removal of SPY and Pb was observed for HC-SDBS-CNT (86 % SPY and 71 % Pb) and BC-SDBS-CNT (56 % SPY and 53 % Pb), whereas HC-CNT, BC-CNT, and the pristine biochars removed far less. This can be attributed to the fact that surfactant could prevent the aggregation of CNTs and thus promote the distribution and stabilization of individual CNT nanoparticle on the biochar surface to adsorb the contaminants. The observation of no significant change in Pb sorption capacities of the surfactant-dispersed CNT-modified biochars in the presence of SPY, or vice versa, was indicative of site-specific sorption interactions and a lack of significant competition for functional groups by the two sorbates. These results suggest that products of hybrid technologies, such as biochars modified with CNTs, can yield multi-sorbents and may hold excellent promise as a sustainable wastewater treatment alternative.

AB The objective of this paper was to evaluate the efficiency of micropollutant removal, such as Cu, Zn, carbamazepine, and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), through the use of a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland system with ornamental plants. Zantedeschia aethiopica, Canna indica, Carex hirta, Miscanthus sinensis, and Phragmites australis were selected and planted in lysimeters filled up with gravel. The lysimeters were completely saturated with synthetic wastewater (N 280 mg L-1, P 30 mg L-1, Cu 3.6 mg L-1, Zn 9 mg L-1, carbamazepine 5 mu g L-1, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates 14 mg L-1), and the leaching water was collected for analysis after 15, 30, and 60 days in winter-spring and spring-summer periods. Nutrients (N and P) and heavy metals decreased greatly due to both plant activity and adsorption. C. indica and P. australis showed the highest metal content in their tissues and also the greatest carbamazepine and LAS removal. In these plants, the adsorption/degradation processes led to particularly high oxidative stress, as evidenced by the significantly high levels of ascorbate peroxidase activity detected. Conversely, Z. aethiopica was the less efficient plant in metal and organic compound removal and was also less stressed in terms of ascorbate peroxidase activity.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants that have been found ubiquitously in wastewater and surface waters around the world. A major source of these compounds is incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste, resulting in discharge into surface waters by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. One pharmaceutical found in particularly high abundance in recent WWTP effluent and surface water studies is metformin, one of the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drugs. Interactions between insulin signaling and steroidogenesis suggest potential endocrine-disrupting effects of metformin found in the aquatic environment. Adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were chronically exposed to metformin for 4 wk, at 40 mu g/L, a level similar to the average found in WWTP effluent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Genetic endpoints related to metabolism and endocrine function as well as reproduction-related endpoints were examined. Metformin treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption. The present study, the first to study the effects of environmentally relevant metformin exposure in fathead minnows, demonstrates the need for further study of the endocrine-disrupting effects of metformin in aquatic organisms.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plants and surface waters has been detected worldwide, constituting a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems. Adult zebrafish, of both sexes, were exposed to three common pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, ketoprofen and diclofenac) and their UV photolysis by-products over seven days. The results show that diclofenac was removed to concentrations < LOD after 5 min of UV irradiation. The oxidative stress response of zebrafish to pharmaceuticals and their photolysis by-products was evaluated through oxidative stress enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase) and lipid peroxidation. Results suggest that the photolysis by-products of diclofenac were more toxic than those from the other compounds tested, showing an increase in GST and CAT levels, which are also supported by higher MDA levels. Overall, the toxicity of waters containing atenolol and ketoprofen was reduced after the parent compounds were transformed by photolysis, whereas the toxicity increased significantly from the by-products generated through diclofenac photolysis. Therefore, diclofenac photolysis would possibly necessitate higher irradiation time to ensure that the associated by-products are completely degraded to harmless form(s). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) along with illicit drugs (IDs) are newly recognized classes of environmental pollutants and are receiving considerable attention because of their environmental impacts: frequent occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic life and humans. However, relatively little information is often available with regard to their possible biotic and abiotic transformation products (TPs). This lack of knowledge has resulted in a substantial amount of ongoing effort to develop methods and approaches that would assess their occurrence, degradability potential elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in sewage treatment plants as well as environmental and human health risks. In this article, an extensive literature survey was performed in order to present the current stage of knowledge and progress made in the occurrence of TPs of PPCPs and IDs in raw and treated wastewaters. Apart from the TPs resulting from structural transformations of the parent compound in the aquatic environment or in technological treatment facilities (e.g. sewage and drinking water treatment plants), free metabolites and drug conjugates formed during human metabolism have also been included in this review as they are also released into the aquatic environment through wastewaters. Their concentration levels were reported in influents and effluents of WWTPs, hospital effluents and their removals in the treatment plants were discussed. Finally, information on the toxicity of TPs has been compiled when available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern; thus, there is a growing interest in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment as well as the factors that contribute to their emergence. Aquatic ecosystems provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of ARGs due to the continuous pollution by antimicrobial compounds derived from anthropogenic activities. We investigated, therefore, the pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs released from hospital and urban wastewaters, their removal through a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and their presence in the receiving river. Several antimicrobial compounds were detected in all water samples collected. Among antibiotic families, fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in hospital effluent samples. Although good removal efficiency by treatment processes was observed for several antimicrobial compounds, most antibiotics were still present in WWTP effluents. The results also revealed that copy numbers of ARGs, such as bla(TEM) (resistance to beta-lactams), qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones), ermB (resistance to macrolides), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), were detected at the highest concentrations in hospital effluent and WWTP influent samples. Although there was a significant reduction in copy numbers of these ARGs in WWTP effluent samples, this reduction was not uniform across analyzed ARGs. Relative concentration of ermB and tetW genes decreased as a result of wastewater treatment, whereas increased in the case of bla(TEM), still and qnrS genes. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in WWTP severely affected the receiving river, where both types of emerging pollutants were found at higher concentration in downstream waters than in samples collected upstream from the discharge point. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotics and ARGs in urban and hospital wastewater and how these effluents, even after treatment, contribute to the spread of these emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB Human pharmaceuticals have been detected in the terrestrial environment at mu g to mg kg(-1) concentrations. Repeated application of sewage sludge (biosolids) and increasing reclaimed wastewater use for irrigation could lead to accumulation of these novel contaminants in soil systems. Despite this, potential phytotoxicological effects on higher plants have rarely been evaluated. These studies aimed to test effects upon germination, development, growth and physiology of two crop plants, namely radish (Raphanus sativus Spakler 3) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa All Year Around), after exposure to different, but structurally related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. A range of biological endpoints comprising biomass, length, water content, specific root and shoot length, root to shoot ratio, daily progress of stages of cell elongation and organ emergence (primary root, hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon emergence, cotyledon opening, and no change), as well as photosynthetic measurements were evaluated. Compounds from the fenamic acid class were found to affect R. sativus root endpoints (root length and water content), while ibuprofen affected early root development of L. sativa. In general, phytotoxicological effects on root endpoints demonstrated that impacts upon higher plants are not only compound specific, but also differ between plant species. It was found that the usage of a wide range of biological endpoints (all simple, cost-effective and ecologically relevant) were beneficial in detecting differences in plant responses to NSAID exposure. Due to paucity and discrepancy within the few previously available phytotoxicological studies with pharmaceuticals, it is now essential to allocate time and resources to consider development of suitable chronic toxicity tests, and some suggestions regarding this are presented.

AB Membrane fouling remains the major obstacle for development of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This paper aimed at investigating the effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) present in a discontinuous way at high concentration (peak injection) on fouling propensity of activated sludge from a MBR that treats domestic wastewater. Batch experiments with peak injection of CBZ (100 mu g L-1 in sludge for 3 h) were performed for sludges sampled from a MBR operated under different organic loading conditions. HPLC-SEC analysis with a fluorescence detector was employed to study the effects of CBZ on protein-like compounds in supernatant. With addition of CBZ in sludge, a significant increase of sludge fouling propensity was observed when using sludge sampled from the MBR operated under low organic loading rate (0.1 kg COD/ kg EVESS/d), which could be attributed to the increase in the quantity of protein-like substances with a 100-1000 kDa molecular size in supernatant. Whereas reduced CBZ effect was found for sludge sampled from the MBR operated under higher organic loading rate (0.2 kg COD/kg MLSS/d). Whatever the sludge, the injection of CBZ induced no significant change of the floc size distribution and of the polysaccharide concentration in supernatant. Moreover, it did not affect the sludge microbial activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB In this study the degradation of an aqueous solution of clofibric acid was investigated during catalytic ozonation and Fenton-like process with FeOOH - derived catalysts. From the different calcination temperatures tested, it has been observed that the most active catalyst is the commercial FeOOH calcined at 200 degrees C, when maghemite and hematite are the predominant phases obtained. The best result, at room temperature, for CFA mineralization was observed over 0.5 wt% Pd on FeOOH (calcined at 200 degrees C) among all tested catalysts, achieving 68% and 81% mineralization degree, in 2 h and 6 h, respectively, in catalytic ozonation and 66% and 71% of mineralization degree within 2 h and 6 h, respectively for Fenton process. The efficiency of the Fenton-like process is enhanced at higher temperature (40-60 degrees C), reaching a mineralization degree up to 82% in 6 h. Furthermore, Pd impregnation on FeOOH increased the catalyst stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Aerobic treatment of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in landfill
   leachate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Pharmaceuticals used in human medical care are not completely eliminated in the human body and can enter the municipal sewage sludge system and leachate water from landfill both as the parent compound and as their biologically active metabolites. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a large potential for unwanted effects on nontarget organisms in the environment. Leachates from active or old closed landfills are often treated with continuous stirring and simple aeration in a pond/lagoon before infiltration into the environment. The aim of this work was to simulate the reduction of five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine) and three of their metabolites (desmethylcitalopram, didesmethylcitalopram and norfluoxetine) during aerobic treatment of leachate from landfills. This landfill leachate-simulation experiment was performed to see what happens with the pharmaceuticals during aerated treatment and continuous stirring of landfill leachate for 120 h. It is important to establish whether different pollutants such as pharmaceuticals can be removed (oxidized or otherwise degraded) or not before infiltration into the environment.
   Results: All the SSRIs had a significant concentration reduction during the aeration treatment process. Total SSRI concentrations were reduced significantly during aerobic treatment, and the individual SSRIs were reduced by 89% to 100% after 120 h. Among the high-concentration samples, fluoxetine (10 mg L-1) was the least degraded with 93% concentration reduction. Among the low-concentration samples, paroxetine was the least degraded with 89% concentration reduction. Fluvoxamine and citalopram were most effectively eliminated and were completely removed from both the high- and low-concentration samples. The samples were also investigated for the metabolites desmethylcitalopram, didesmethylcitalopram and norfluoxetine but only norfluoxetine in the high-concentration fluoxetine sample was detected.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that aeration is an effective method for eliminating pharmaceuticals such as SSRIs from landfill leachate water. Comparing the results of all SSRIs with different treatment methods, paroxetine and fluvoxamine seem to be the easiest compounds to eliminate independent of method, while fluoxetine and sertraline seem to be the most stable.

AB The anaerobic degradation characteristics of estrone (E-1), estradiol (E-2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) under single and combined conditions were investigated in batch tests and the influence of initial estrogen and sludge concentrations on the biodegradation process was studied. The results indicated that the degradation process of three estrogens was biphasic. The first phase was fast and the second phase was slow. The two phases could be described by the first-order degradation kinetics. In the single degradation experiments, at the fast stage, E-2 degradation rate was the highest for the three estrogens, which was 2 and 5.17 times higher than E-1 and EE2, respectively. However, at the slow stage, EE2 almost could not be biodegraded, and the degradation rate constant of E-1 and E-2 was 0.18 and 0.34 times lower than that at fast degradation phase, respectively. Meanwhile, E-1 was accumulated in the process of E-2 degradation, which indicated that E-1 was a main intermediate product of the E-2 anaerobic biodegradation. In the combined degradation experiments, the degradation rate constants of estrogens had the order of E-1 > E-2 > EE2, and the contribution of fast degradation stage was crucial to the removal of estrogens under anaerobic conditions. The degradation rate constant of estrogens decreased linearly with the initial estrogen concentrations and increased linearly with the sludge concentrations, which indicated that the higher sludge concentrations benefited the removal of estrogens under anaerobic conditions in the real wastewater treatment practice.

AB The polycyclic musks tonalide (R) (acetyl hexamethyltetraline = 1-(3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-6,7-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone, AHTN), galaxolide (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyrane, HHCB) and the degradation product HHCB-lactone were determined in water samples and brown trouts (Salmo trutta fario) of the river Ammer, a small catchment in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, south-west Germany. The Ammer receives the effluent discharge of two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with 90,000 population equivalents. The wastewater contributes 14% of the total discharge of the river (average 1.0 m(3)/s). Water samples were collected monthly at 12 sampling points from June 2010 to May 2011. Downstream the WWTPs the median concentrations of HHCB, AHTN and HHCB-lactone were 0.26 mu g/L, 0.06 mu g/L and 1.0 mu g/L, respectively. The effluent of the WWTPs was identified as main source of the synthetic musks in the surface water. The ratio of HHCB-lactone/HHCB showed significant seasonal variations indicating the influence of the water temperature on the degradation of HHCB in the surface water.
   A total of 251 trout was caught in two campaigns in October 2010 at 12 sampling points. The median concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in the trouts downstream the WWTPs significantly increased to 10.8 mu g/g lipid weight (LW) and 3.7 mu g/g LW, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental analytical chemists face the challenge of investigating thousands of potential organic pollutants that may be present in the aquatic environment. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) hyphenated to chromatography offers the possibility of detecting a large number of contaminants without pre-selection of analytes due to its accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition at good sensitivity. Interestingly, large screening can be made even without reference standards, as the valuable information provided by HRMS allows the tentative identification of the compound detected. In this work, hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS was combined with both liquid and gas chromatography (using a single instrument) for screening of around 2000 compounds in waters. This was feasible thanks to the use of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source in GC. The screening was qualitatively validated for around 300 compounds at three levels (0.02, 0.1, 0.5 mu g/L), and screening detection limits were established. Surface, ground water and effluent wastewater samples were analyzed, detecting and identifying a notable number of pesticides and transformation products, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and illicit drugs, among others. This is one of the most universal approaches in terms of comprehensive measurement for broad screening of organic contaminants within a large range of polarity and volatility in waters.

AB We lack a clear understanding of how wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) process parameters, such as redox environment, impact pharmaceutical fate. WWTPs increasingly install more advanced aeration control systems to save energy and achieve better nutrient removal performance. The impact of redox condition, and specifically the use of microaerobic (low dissolved oxygen) treatment, is poorly understood. In this study, the fate of a mixture of pharmaceuticals and several of their transformation products present in the primary effluent of a local WWTP was assessed in sequencing batch reactors operated under different redox conditions: fully aerobic, anoxic/aerobic, and microaerobic (DO concentration, approximate to 0.3 mg/L). Among the pharmaceuticals that were tracked during this study (atenolol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and phenytoin), overall loss varied between them and between redox environments. Losses of atenolol and trimethoprim were highest in the aerobic reactor; sulfamethoxazole loss was highest in the microaerobic reactors; and phenytoin was recalcitrant in all reactors. Transformation products of sulfamethoxazole and desvenlafaxine resulted in the reformation of their parent compounds during treatment. The results suggest that transformation products must be accounted for when assessing removal efficiencies and that redox environment influences the degree of pharmaceutical loss.

AB Pharmaceuticals have recently been regarded as contaminants of emerging concern. To date, there is limited knowledge about antibiotic-degrading microorganisms in conventional activated sludge treatment systems and their characteristics toward antibiotic degradation especially in the presence of a pharmaceutical mixture. As such, antibiotic-degrading microorganisms were investigated and isolated from the activated sludge, and their degradation capabilities were evaluated. Two strains of cefalexin-degrading bacteria CE21 and CE22 were isolated and identified as Pseudomonas sp. in the collected activated sludge. Strain CE22 was able to degrade over 90% of cefalexin, while CE21 was able to remove 46.7% of cefalexin after incubation for 24h. The removal efficiency of cefalexin by CE22, different from that of CE21, was not significantly affected by an increase in cefalexin concentration, even up to 10 ppm, however the presence of 1 ppm of other pharmaceuticals had a significant effect on the degradation of cefalexin by CE22, but no significant effect on CE21. The degradation product of cefalexin by the two strains was identified to be 2-hydroxy-3-phenyl pyrazine. Our results also indicated that CE21 and CE22 were able to degrade caffeine, salicylic acid and chloramphenicol. Moreover, CE21 was found to be capable of eliminating sulfamethoxazole and naproxen.

AB Water reuse is becoming a common practice in several areas in the world, particularly in those impacted by water scarcity driven by climate change and/or by rising human demand. Since conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not able to efficiently remove many organic contaminants and pathogens, more advanced water treatment processes should be applied to WWTP effluents for water reclamation purposes. In this work, a pilot plant based on microfiltration (MF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) filtration was applied to the effluents of an urban WWTP. Both the WWTP and the pilot plant were investigated with regards to the removal of a group of relevant contaminants widely spread in the environment: 28 pharmaceuticals and 20 pesticides. The combined treatment by the MF RO system was able to quantitatively remove the target micropollutants present in the WWTP effluents to values either in the low ng/L range or below limits of quantification. Monitoring of water quality of reclaimed water and water reclamation sources is equally necessary to design the most adequate treatment procedures aimed to water reuse for different needs.

AB Palygorskite-montmorillonite (PM) was studied as a potential sewage treatment effluent filter material for carbamazepine. Batch sorption experiments were conducted as a function of granule size (0.3-0.6, 1.7-2.0 and 2.8 mm) and different sewage effluent conditions (pH, ionic strength and temperature). Results showed PM had a mix of fibrous and plate-like morphologies. Sorption and desorption isotherms were fitted to the Freundlich model. Sorption is granule size-dependent and the medium granule size would be an appropriate size for optimizing both flow and carbamazepine retention. Highest and lowest sorption capacities corresponded to the smallest and the largest granule sizes, respectively. The lowest and the highest equilibrium aqueous (C-e) and sorbed (q(e)) carbamazepine concentrations were 0.4 mg L-1 and 4.5 mg L-1, and 0.6 mg kg(-1) and 411.8 mg kg(-1), respectively. Observed higher relative sorption at elevated concentrations with a Freundlich exponent greater than one, indicated cooperative sorption. The sorption-desorption hysteresis (isotherm non-singularity) indicated irreversible sorption. Higher sorption observed at higher rather than at lower ionic strength conditions is likely due to a salting-out effect. Negative free energy and the inverse sorption capacity-temperature relationship indicated the carbamazepine sorption process was favorable or spontaneous. Solution pH had little effect on sorption.

AB The photochemical degradation of five pharmaceuticals was examined in two secondary wastewater effluents. The compounds, which included atenolol, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and primidone, were evaluated for both direct and sensitized photolysis. In the two wastewaters, direct photolysis did not lead to significant compound degradation; however, sensitized photolysis was an important removal pathway for the five pharmaceuticals. Upon solar irradiation, hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) was quantified using the hydroxylation of benzene and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) formation was monitored following the degradation of furfuryl alcohol. Degradation via sensitized photolysis was observed following five-day exposures for atenolol (69-91%), carbamazepine (67-98%), meprobamate (16-52%), phenytoin (44-85%), and primidone (34-88%). Varying removal is likely a result of the differences in reactivity with transient oxidants. Averaged steady state HO center dot concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 4.0 x 10(-16) M, whereas the concentrations of O-1(2) were 6.0-7.6 x 10(-14) M. Partial removal due to presence of HO center dot indicates it was not the major sink for most compounds examined. Other transient oxidants, such as O-1(2) and triplet state effluent organic matter, are likely to play important roles in fates of these compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A QExactive Orbitrap was used for the identification of phase I and II transformation products (TPs) of illicit drugs in raw sewage influents. Two operating modes (targeted MS2 and Data-dependent screening) were used for data acquisition. Even though, data-dependent scan is a faster route towards the potential identification of metabolites, it suffered from its limitation to provide enough data points across the chromatographic peak during the MS2 cycle in contrast to targeted MS2. Therefore, the later technique was implemented as the method of choice in this study for the positive confirmation and quantitation of TPs (n =54). The vast majority of the identified TPs were products of phase I transformation reactions, with the latter being more prevalent in the nature. Estimated mole fractions showed that for a large number of the analytes, TPs must also be monitored in order to fully understand their environmental fate and calculate potential consumption.

AB In response to water scarcity, strategies relying on multiple processes to turn wastewater effluent into potable water are being increasingly considered by many cities. In such context, the occurrence of contaminants as well as their fate during treatment processes is a major concern. Three analytical approaches where used to characterize the efficacy of UV and UV/H2O2 processes on a secondary wastewater effluent. The first analytical approach assessed bulk organic parameters or surrogates before and after treatment, while the second analytical approach measured the removal of specific indicator compounds. Sixteen trace organic contaminants were selected due to their relative high concentration and detection frequency over eight monitoring campaigns. While their removal rate ranges from approximately 10 to >90%, some of these compounds can be used to gauge process efficacy (or failure). The third analytical approach assessed the fate of unknown contaminants through high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry with advanced data processing and demonstrated the occurrence of several thousand organic compounds in the water. A heat map clearly evidenced compounds as recalcitrant or transformed by the UV processes applied. In addition, those chemicals with similar fate were grouped together into clusters to identify new indicator compounds. In this manuscript, each approach is evaluated with advantages and disadvantages compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the adsorption of pharmaceutically active compounds - salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol and diclofenac-Na onto activated carbons has been studied. Three different commercial activated carbons, possessing similar to 650, 900 or 1500 m(2) g(-1) surface areas were used as solid adsorbents. These materials were fully characterized - their textural, surface features and points of zero charge have been determined.
   The adsorption was studied from aqueous solutions at 303 K using batch adsorption experiments and titration microcalorimetry, which was employed in order to obtain the heats evolved as a result of adsorption. The maximal adsorption capacities of investigated solids for all target pharmaceuticals are in the range of 10(-4) mol g(-1). The obtained maximal retention capacities are correlated with the textural properties of applied activated carbon. The roles of acid/base features of activated carbons and of molecular structures of adsorbate molecules have been discussed. The obtained results enabled to estimate the possibility to use the activated carbons in the removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photocatalytic decomposition of cortisone 21-acetate (CA), a model compound for the commonly used steroid, cortisone, was studied. CA was photocatalytically decomposed in a slurry reactor with the initial rates between 0.11 and 0.46 mg L-1 min(-1) at 10 mg L-1 concentration, using the following heterogeneous photocatalysts in decreasing order of their catalytic activity: ZnO> Evonik TiO2 P25 >Hombikat TiO2 > WO3. Due to the lack of ZnO stability in aqueous solutions, TiO2 P25 was chosen for further experiments. The decomposition reaction was found to be pseudo-first order and the rate constant decreased as a function of increasing initial CA concentration. Changing the initial pH of the CA solution did not affect the reaction rate significantly. The decomposition reaction in the presence of the oxidizing sacrificial agent sodium persulfate showed an observed decomposition rate constant of 0.004 min(-1), lower than that obtained for TiO2 P25 (0.040 min(-1)). The highest photocatalytic degradation rate constant was obtained combining both TiO2 P25 and S2O82- (0.071 min(-1)) showing a synergistic effect. No reactive intermediates were detected using LC-MS showing fast photocatalytic decomposition kinetics of CA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The youth festival as we refer to Spring Scream, a large-scale pop music festival, is notorious for the problems of drug abuse and addiction. The origin, temporal magnitudes, potential risks and mass inputs of emerging contaminants (ECs) were investigated. Thirty targeted ECs were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Sampling strategy was designed to characterize EC behavior in different stages (before and after the youth festival), based on multivariate data analysis to explore the contributions of contaminants from normal condition to the youth festival. Wastewater influents and effluents were collected during the youth festival (approximately 600?000 pop music fans and youth participated). Surrounding river waters are also sampled to illustrate the touristic impacts during peak season and off-season. Seasonal variations were observed, with the highest concentrations in April (Spring Scream) and the lowest in October (off-season). Acetaminophen, diclofenac, codeine, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin-H2O, and gemfibrozil have significant pollution risk quotients (RQs > 1), indicating ecotoxicological concerns. Principal component analysis (PCA) and weekly patterns provide a perspective in assessing the touristic impacts and address the dramatic changes in visitor population and drug consumption. The highest mass loads discharged into the aquatic ecosystem corresponded to illicit drugs/controlled substances such as ketamine and MDMA, indicating the high consumption of ecstasy during Spring Scream.

AB De facto potable reuse occurs when treated wastewater is discharged into surface waters upstream of potable drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intakes. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges may pose water quality risks at the downstream DWTP, but additional flow aids in providing a reliable water supply source. In this work de facto reuse is analyzed for 2056 surface water intakes serving 1210 DWTPs across the U.S.A. that serve greater than 10 000 people, covering approximately 82% of the nations population. An ArcGIS model is developed to assess spatial relationships between DWTPs and WWTPs, with a python script designed to perform a network analysis by hydrologic region. A high frequency of de facto reuse occurrence was observed; 50% of the DWTP intakes are potentially impacted by upstream WWTP discharges. However, the magnitude of de facto reuse was seen to be relatively low, where 50% of the impacted intakes contained less than 1% treated municipal wastewater under average streamflow conditions. De facto reuse increased greatly under low streamflow conditions (modeled by Q95), with 32 of the 80 sites yielding at least 50% treated wastewater, this portion of the analysis is limited to sites where stream gauge data was readily available.

AB Population size is crucial when estimating population-normalized drug consumption (PNDC) from wastewater-based drug epidemiology (WBDE). Three conceptually different population estimates can be used: de jure (common census, residence), de facto (all persons within a sewer catchment), and chemical loads (contributors to the sampled wastewater). De facto and chemical loads will be the same where all households contribute to a central sewer system without wastewater loss. This study explored the feasibility of determining a de facto population and its effect on estimating PNDC in an urban community over an extended period. Drugs and other chemicals were analyzed in 311 daily composite wastewater samples. The daily estimated de facto population (using chemical loads) was on average 32% higher than the de jure population. Consequently, using the latter would systemically overestimate PNDC by 22%. However, the relative day-to-day pattern of drug consumption was similar regardless of the type of normalization as daily illicit drug loads appeared to vary substantially more than the population. Using chemical loads population, we objectively quantified the total methodological uncertainty of PNDC and reduced it by a factor of 2. Our study illustrated the potential benefits of using chemical loads population for obtaining more robust PNDC data in WBDE.

AB The occurrence and sources of 21 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs: C4-C14, C16, C18 carboxylate, C4, C6-C8 and C10 sulfonates and C8 sulfonamide) were determined in water, sediment, and biota of the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). Analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and determined by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-QqQ-MS). All samples were contaminated with at least one PFAS, being the most frequently found perfluorobutanoate (PFBA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS). In general, mean PFAS concentrations measured in sediments (0.01-3.67 ng g(-1)) and biota (0.79-431 mu g kg(-1)) samples were higher than those found in water (0.01-233 ng L-1). L-PFOS presented very high levels in biota and water, particularly in the Anoia River where a maximum concentration of 2.71 mu g L-1 was related to important industrial activities. However, this pollution does not extend down the Llobregat River according to cumulated values. None of the hazard quotients (HQ) calculated indicate potential risk for the different tropic levels considered (algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). According to Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) proposed by the European Commission (L-PFOS) and to Provisional Health Advisory (PHA) values (PFOA, L-PFOS) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), only two water samples exceeded PHA concentration for L-PFOS.

AB The environmental presence of chemicals capable of affecting the endocrine system has become a matter of scientific and public concern after certain endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs) have been detected in the aquatic environment.
   In this work, 31 different EDCs and related compounds (suspect EDCs) belonging to different contaminant classes were studied: 10 estrogens, natural and synthetic, 8 alkylphenolic compounds, bisphenol A, triclosan and tridorocaraban, 4 parabens, 2 benzotriazoles, 3 organophosphorous flame retardants and the chemical marker caffeine, in river water and sediment of four Iberian rivers (Ebro, Llobregat, Jucar and Guadalquivir). An extensive sampling has been undertaken in two monitoring campaigns (2010 and 2011). A total of 77 samples of water and 75 sediments were collected.
   For this propose two different multiresidue analytical methods were applied, using the automated online EQuan/TurboFlo (TM) liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection in tandem.
   In terms of concentrations the compounds found at the highest average concentrations were: nonylphenol monocarboxylate (NP1EC), tolyltriazole (TT), tris(chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCPP) found at average concentrations above 100 ng/L, followed by 1H-benzotriazole and tris(butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP) found at average concentration higher than 50 ng/L. Natural and synthetic hormones were found at low levels not exceeding 16 ng/L and 7 ng/g for water and sediment, respectively, however they contributed to more than 80% of the total estrogenicity of the samples (expressed as the equivalents of estradiol EEQ, ng/L). Regarding the spatial distribution of these contaminants, the Llobregat river was found to be the most contaminated river basin, having sites near the mouth of the river the ones with the highest contaminant load. In the Ebro river basin several hot spots were identified and Jucar showed to be the least contaminated. Overall, the study confirmed the presence of complex mixtures of unregulated contaminants, thus raising concern about their potential interactive effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multitude of pharmaceuticals enter surface waters via discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and many raise environmental and health concerns. Chemical fate models predict their concentrations using estimates of mass loading, dilution and in-stream attenuation. However, current comprehension of the attenuation rates remains a limiting factor for predictive models. We assessed in-stream attenuation of 75 pharmaceuticals in 4 river segments, aiming to characterize in-stream attenuation variability among different pharmaceutical compounds, as well as among river segments differing in environmental conditions. Our study revealed that in-stream attenuation was highly variable among pharmaceuticals and river segments and that none of the considered pharmaceutical physicochemical and molecular properties proved to be relevant in determining the mean attenuation rates. Instead, the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) influenced the variability of rates among river segments, likely due to its effect on sorption to sediments and suspended particles, and therefore influencing the balance between the different attenuation mechanisms (biotransformation, photolysis, sorption, and volatilization). The magnitude of the measured attenuation rates urges scientists to consider them as important as dilution when aiming to predict concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sewage sludge disposal onto lands has been stabilized previously but still many pollutants are not efficiently removed. Special interest has been focused on pharmaceutical compounds due to their potential ecotoxicological effects. Nowadays, there is scarce information about their occurrence in different sludge stabilization treatments. In this work, the occurrence of twenty-two pharmaceutically active compounds has been studied in sludge from four sludge stabilization treatments: anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, composting and lagooning. The types of sludge evaluated were primary, secondary, anaerobically-digested and dehydrated, composted, mixed, aerobically-digested and dehydrated and lagoon sludge. Nineteen of the twenty-two pharmaceutically active compounds monitored were detected in sewage sludge. The most contaminated samples were primary sludge, secondary sludge and mixed sludge (the average concentrations of studied compounds in these sludges were 179,310 and 142 mu g/kg dm, respectively) while the mean concentrations found in the other types of sewage sludge were 70 mu g/lcg dm (aerobically-digested sludge), 63 mu g/kg dm (lagoon sludge), 12 mu g/kg dm (composted sludge) and 8 mu g/kg dm (anaerobically-digested sludge). The antibiotics ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were found at the highest concentration levels in most of the analyzed sludge samples (up to 2660 and 4328 mu g/kg dm, respectively). Anaerobic-digestion treatment reduced more considerably the concentration of most of the studied compounds than aerobic-digestion (especially in the case of bezafibrateand fluoroquinolones) and more than anaerobic stabilization ponds (in the case of acetaminophen, atenolol, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, naproxen and salicylic acid). Ecotoxicological risk assessment, of sludge application onto soils, has also been evaluated. Risk quotients, expressed as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration and the predicted non-effect concentration, were lower than 1 for all the pharmaceutically active compounds so no significant risks are expected to occur due to the application of sewage sludge onto soils, except for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol when chronic toxicity was considered.

Much of it is due to the rapid development of the surrounding artificial landscapes, where socio-economic factors lead to alterations in the nearby environment, affecting the quality of natural and agricultural systems. This work analyses interconnections among landscapes under the hypothesis that urban-artificial impacts could be detected on soils and waters of an agro-ecological protected area, L'Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, located in the vicinity of the City of Valencia, Spain. The methodological framework developed addresses two types of anthropogenic pressure: (1) direct, due to artificialisation of soil covers that cause soil sealing, and (2) indirect, which are related to water flows coming from urban populations through sewage and irrigation systems and which, ultimately, will be identified by the presence of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants in waters of the protected area. For soil sealing, a methodology based on temporal comparison of two digital layers for the years 1991 and 2011, applying Geographical Information Systems and landscapes metrics, was applied. To determine presence of emerging contaminants, 21 water samples within the Natural Park were analysed applying liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of 17 pharmaceutical compounds. Results showed that both processes are present in the Natural Park, with a clear geographical pattern. Soil sealing and presence of pharmaceuticals are more intensive in the northern part of the study area. This is related to population density (detection of pharmaceuticals) and land cover conversion from agricultural and natural surfaces to artificial ones (soil sealing). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The feasibility of treating of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing rich organic sulfur compounds and sulfate using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) was investigated. The initial COD/SO42- ratio of 8 in the wastewater varied from 5 to 1.5 after adding sulfate. Of interest that under the condition of COD/SO42- at 8 and 5, despite the simultaneous generation of sulfide and hydrogen sulfide, the sulfate concentration in the effluent was higher than in the influent. This is due to the sulfur release in the form of sulfate during the degradation of these organic sulfur compounds in this reactor. Conversely, at COD/SO42- of 1.5, influent sulfate was higher than effluent sulfate due to reduction of more sulfates in the reactor. At COD/SO42- of 8, for practical application, the optimum OLR was found to be 8 kg COD/m(3)/d, where a nearly 70% COD reduction occurred with biogas containing 63% methane. In this stage, the distribution of the archaea and bacterial community varied greatly with altered OLR (accompanied with prolonged operation time). Some species, such as Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Clostridium cellulovorans were expected to be partly responsible for S release from some organic sulfur compounds in the reactor. By increasing the sulfate loading at a COD/SO42- ratio up to 1.5 resulted in a light inhibition of methanogenesis due to the high sulfide concentration (1212 SO42- - S mg/L) with no obvious suppression of sulfidogenesis.

AB In this Article, we demonstrate the influence of effluent particles (in the range of <50 mu m) on ozone degradation of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) and effluent-quality parameters. Secondary effluent was filtered through different pore-size filters and ozonated at various ozone doses. Degradation of both ozone-reactive and ozone-refractory contaminants improved following ozonation of effluent filtered with smaller pore size filters, indicating that particles in this range may adversely affect ozonation. The inhibitory effect of particles was attributed to their reaction with ozone, reducing available ozone and HO center dot<bold> </bold>radicals. In addition, increasing filtration level decreased the effluent's (instantaneous) ozone demand and increased removal of effluent UV absorbance (UVA254), further establishing that ozone reacts with effluent particles, in competition with dissolved matter. Moreover, ozone was shown to react with particles even during the first seconds of the process, suggesting a high rate of some ozone-particle reactions, comparable to ozone reaction with highly reactive dissolved organic matter moieties. Particle image analysis revealed that particle formation/aggregation and particle disintegration occurs simultaneously during wastewater (WW) ozonation. Our study implies that particles could affect the efficiency of WW ozonation, by increasing the effluent's ozone demand and decreasing contaminant degradation.

AB The present work describes the development and validation of a sensitive method for the determination of traces of diverse groups of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors in surface water. Thirty-seven substances have been selected, including 10 pesticides, 6 hormonal steroids and assimilates, 12 pharmaceuticals, 5 alkylphenols, 1 chlorophenol and 3 other well-known human contaminants, 1 UV filter and 2 plasticisers. An automated online solid-phase extraction (SPE) is directly coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Different SPE columns have been tested, and the injection volume has been optimised. The developed analytical methodology is based on the direct injection of 2.5mL of water sample acidified at pH 1.6 on an Oasis HLB loading column (20x2.1mm) with 5-mu m particles. Then, the chromatographic separation is achieved on a Kinetex XB C18 (100x2.1mm; 1.7 mu m) column, and the quantification is realised in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The online SPE step warrants minimal sample handling, low solvent consumption, high sample throughput, saving time and costs. This method allows the quantification of the target analytes in the lower ng/L concentration range, with limits of quantification (LQs) between 100pg/L and 10ng/L, 26 compounds having LQ lower than 1ng/L. The monitoring of two selected MS/MS transitions for each compound allows the reliable confirmation of positive findings even at the LQ level. The developed and validated methodology has been applied to the analysis of various real samples from two French rivers. Twelve target compounds have been detected in the environmental samples, and the major pollutants are pharmaceuticals usually used by humans (paracetamol, carbamazepine, oxazepam, ketoprofen, trimethoprim). The pesticides atrazine and carbendazim have been ubiquitously detected in real samples too. Metronidazole, sulfamethoxazole and diuron were also frequently quantified in the water samples.

AB At the beginning of the 1970s, the time of the first UN Conference on the Human Environment, most of the major rivers in the developed world were in a parlous state with their natural purification capacity far exceeded by the volume of effluents that they were receiving from both industrial and domestic discharges. Since then there have been radical changes both in environmental governance and our understanding of the issues. During the last 40 years many of the problems of the 1970's caused by effluent discharges have been resolved and a dramatic improvement in the aquatic environment has occurred. However, both incremental advances and step changes in scientific knowledge will continue to create new challenges for effluent management in the decades to come.

AB A series of sodium bentonite and thiamine were used as raw materials to prepare a new adsorbent - thiamine-modified bentonite. The adsorbent was applied in the pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. The optimum preparation conditions of thiamine-modified bentonite were studied. The experiments showed that the removals of COD (chemical oxygen demand) reached 47.98 % under optimal condition. The FTIR results indicated that bentonite has been modified by thiamine. The X-ray diffraction result showed that the inter-planar distance of modified bentonite was increased by intercalating thiamine. From the analyses of the SEM photographs, it can be clearly observed that the bentonite, after thiamine insertion reaction, loses its foliated structure and exhibits a rougher surface. Among several isotherm equations, Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were investigated. They were widely used to describe equilibrium data for water and wastewater treatment applications. Adsorption isotherms correlate well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Detailed isothermal and kinetic studies show that the modified bentonite removes organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater by physical adsorption processes.

AB In this paper, supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is applied to treat analgin pharmaceutical wastewater. The results show that temperature, residence time and oxidant excess (OE) can improve X-COD (COD removal). The OE and residence time markedly influences X-COD at higher reaction temperatures (>510 degrees C). Increasing the preheating rate for the X-COD improvement in SCWO is significant. X-COD and X-TN. (total nitrogen removal) are 99.53 and 87.81%. More than 93.1 wt.% total organic carbon (TOC) and 87.81 wt.% total nitrogen in the analgin pharmaceutical wastewater are converted into CO2 and N-2 under the above conditions, respectively.

AB This article is focused on optimization of derivatization of acidic drugs from the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID): salicylic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac. Derivatization is a necessary step for analysis of pharmaceuticals by GC. MSTFA (N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) and BSTFA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) were used as a derivatization reagents and tested under different conditions: volume, temperature and time of derivatization. Results of optimization were compared and optimized conditions were successfully applied for analysis of real samples of wastewater. Wastewater samples were collected from influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The whole analytical procedure involved solid phase extraction (SPE), optimized derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF MS. Limits of detection (LOD) ranged between 8.9 - 71.6 ng.L-1 and limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 29.5 - 238.7 ng.L-1 depending on the specific compound. Concentration of selected drugs in real samples of wastewater varied from 0.1 to 30 mu g.L-1 in influent and from 0.05 to 2 mu g.L-1 in effluent, depending on the compound.

AB Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) have been detected in drinking water sources for several years, raising concerns due to their potential risks to public health. The main contributor of TOrCs to drinking water is through wastewater discharges. However, there are several hundred TOrCs currently known with numerous new organic chemicals being released daily, making it unfeasible to monitor each one in water. This study used a detailed literature review and scoring system to establish a list of twenty priority indicator TOrCs in US wastewaters. Next, a rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS method for analysis of these compounds was developed without the need for an extraction step and only 80 mu L sample volume while providing method reporting limits of 3-39 ng L-1 for all but one TOrC (sucralose: 302 ng L-1). The elimination of an extraction step reduced matrix effects considerably making the method suitable for wastewater analysis. Method validation including matrix spike recoveries, linearity of calibration curve and inter- and intra-day variability was successfully performed. Finally, the twenty indicator TOrCs were evaluated in four different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents through four sample campaigns spread across a year. The occurrence data indicated that all indicator TOrCs were detected in at least three out of the four WWTP effluents. Sucralose, iohexol, TCPP, acesulfame and gemfibrozil were detected in all samples at the four WWTPs indicating they could be used as indicators of wastewater influence in receiving waters. DEET, caffeine, triclosan, iopromide and others are effective indicators at showing seasonal variations, treatment process efficacy, and consumption patterns. Overall, the impact of this study will help develop more effective monitoring programs for TOrCs in water reuse schemes.

TI Human health risk associated with direct potable reuse - evaluation
   through quantitative relative risk assessment case studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Quantitative relative risk assessment (QRRA) evaluations were conducted for two hypothetical direct potable reuse (DPR) case studies. The goal of a risk assessment is to estimate the severity and likelihood of harm to human health or the environment occurring from exposure to a risk agent. Each case study compares a No Project Alternative (raw water that has undergone drinking water treatment) with a potential DPR Alternative (treated wastewater that has undergone advanced water treatment and drinking water treatment). Neither DPR scenario accounts for blending with raw drinking water prior to drinking water treatment, blending after drinking water treatment in the potable distribution system, or blending via directly distributing the purified reclaimed water into a drinking water distribution system. The QRRA focuses on chemicals that are currently regulated and chemicals that are not yet regulated but are of broad interest, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Pathogen risk evaluation was not conducted but could follow a similar approach. The results illustrate how QRRA can inform water supply decisions that are made with respect to industrial pretreatment/source control, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, and advanced treatment for DPR. In these case studies, the DPR alternatives are projected to provide protection from regulated constituents and constituents of emerging concern that are comparable to or better than the No Project Alternatives. The results also indicate that future QRRA studies would benefit from specific information that could be obtained through targeted research.

AB Realized and potential threats of water scarcity due in part to global climate change have increased the interest in potable reuse of municipal wastewater. Recalcitrant trace organic compounds (TOrCs), including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in wastewater are often not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Ozone application has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient oxidation process to attenuate TOrCs. However, operation of ozone oxidation can be challenging in wastewater due to variations in water quality that can impact critical control points through fluctuations in ozone demand/decay. Therefore, this study implemented three explanatory modeling techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neutral network (ANN), and PC (principal component)ANN to predict TOrCs removal by ozone oxidation in a secondary wastewater effluent. All the developed models displayed good agreements between the predicted TOrCs removal and the observed TOrCs removal with the explanatory variables (input variables) of ozone dose, total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, and rate constants of ozone and. OH. PC-ANN displayed the highest predictive power in the external validation step (R-2 = 0.934) successively followed by ANN (R-2 = 0.914) and MLR (R-2 = 0.758). Based on the MLR model equation and the result of sensitivity analysis of the ANN model, TOC was found to have negligible effects on the TOrCs removal in a given water quality. Despite the predictive power of the ANN model, possible overfitting remains to be solved since the cross validation coefficient (q(2)) value calculated by the leave-one-out cross validation was not sufficient to ensure model predictive power. In contrast, the PC-ANN model was found to be robust across the scenarios applied. This study provides a guideline for software sensors to control ozone treatment processes in regards to TOrC oxidation and likely can be adapted to monitor disinfection as well.

AB Environmentally friendly gallic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles (GA-MNP) have been synthesized and evaluated as a novel photocatalyst for degradation of meloxicam; a commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The synthesized GA-MNP were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. Results showed the formation of core-shell MNP with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 160.55 +/- 5.02 nm and zeta potential of -42.4 +/- 1.6 mV. A validated RP-HPLC stability-indicating assay was developed for monitoring of meloxicam concentration in the presence of its degradation products and for determination of the kinetics of degradation. Full factorial design (24) was employed in order to investigate the effects of pH, irradiation time, GA-MNP loading and initial meloxicam concentration on the efficiency of the process. The irradiation time was found to be the most significant parameter followed by initial meloxicam concentration and GA-MNP loading, respectively. At the optimized conditions, increasing GA-MNP loading to 5.00 mg mL(-1) demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity when compared to bare MNP and TiO2NP. Meloxicam degradation was found to follow pseudo first order rate kinetics with K-obs and t(0.5) of -0.0029 min(-1) and 239 min, respectively. The protocol was successfully applied for treatment of incurred water samples collected during various cleaning validation cycles. A percentage degradation of 89.10 +/- 0.13% was achieved upon irradiation of samples containing 64.57 +/- 0.09 mu g mL(-1) with UV light (1012 mu W cm(-2), 8 h) in the presence of 5 mg mL(-1) GA-MNP at pH 9.0 +/- 0.05. It could be suggested that treatment of wastewaters collected during the cleaning validation of each pharmaceutical product, before pooling into the general waste pool, should improve the efficiency and economics of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical substances and their residues are increasingly present in the environment. Therefore, attempts at their removal are made by using different processes. Increasingly important among these processes are those modeled on natural phenomena which occur in wetland ecosystems, called technical scale constructed wetlands. Microbial degradation is an important process in these constructed wetlands. The biodegradation of chemicals often involves a complex series of biochemical reactions and usually varies with the microorganisms involved. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and other parameters of wastewater in the microcosm of down- flow constructed wetlands. The Spearman correlation coefficient attained negative values in the case of comparison of the Shannon biodiversity index and the parameters of purified wastewater. This dependence was pronounced. In the case of pharmaceutical substances dosed with wastewater, the Spearman correlation coefficient assumed positive values. The highest value assumed by the Spearman correlation coefficient (0.9) was for the removal of diclofenac and Shannon index values for the planted columns, with a very high relationship. For unplanted columns, this value equaled 0.6. For sulfamethoxazole, the value for planted columns was 0.7, and for unplanted - 0.7. The presence of plants did not have an impact on the Shannon biodiversity index.

AB This review covers selected 2014 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due in part to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB Magnetically separable catalysts with high solar photocatalytic ozonation activity were successfully synthesized. First maghemite and then titania (anatase) nanoparticles were deposited onto the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by co-precipitation and sol-gel methods. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption/desorption, TEM, XPS and VSM, and were applied for the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) existing in urban wastewater through photocatalytic ozonation. Ozone alone can completely remove a mixture of the four ECs in water, but the mineralization degree was very low (44.9%). Photocatalytic oxidation led to a higher level of mineralization (48.3% TOC removal) in the experimental conditions, but some intermediate products such as phenolic compounds and carboxylates which are toxic and difficult to degrade were generated during the photocatalytic oxidation process. Photocatalytic ozonation led to the highest removal efficiency for TOC (65.7%), which suggested a lower concentration of intermediate products accumulated during photocatalytic ozonation, the integration of ozonation and solar photocatalytic oxidation improved the mineralization efficiency.

AB The pre-treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation with Fe2+ was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The influence of different crucial parameters such as temperature, reaction time, Fe concentration, hydrogen peroxide excess (HE) and initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) have been evaluated. The optimum conditions for degradation led to COD reductions of up to 80% in only 1 h of treatment. The results showed that WHPO is an effective process for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Fe2+ addition improved COD removal. When reaction temperature is 440 degrees C, reaction time is 4 h, hydrogen peroxide excess is 0.8 and initial COD is 60 000 mg/l, and COD removal increased 11%.

AB Surfactants are used in almost all branches of industry, in everyday life as home and industrial cleaning compounds, in cosmetics, in pharmaceuticals, in foods, in crop protection, etc. Their waste belongs to the most widespread organic pollutants, representing a global environmental problem, giving thus a great importance for their monitoring in the environment. The existing methodology for the monitoring of anionic and nonionic surfactants in effluents is based on the time-consuming extraction-spectrophotometric procedures connected with numerous drawbacks: considerable chemicals consumption, use and disposal of toxic organic solvents, etc. Potentiometric methods with surfactant sensors (surfactant-selective electrodes) sensitive to the surfactants overcome almost all of these disadvantages offering an attractive alternative to the existing methods. The biggest challenge in surfactant analysis is the determination of low levels in environmental samples.
   This review outlines the principles of response mechanisms of these sensors and their application for the determination of anionic and nonionic surfactants in surface waters and effluents. Advantages of the use of surfactant-selective electrodes vs. classical methods and their limitations are also outlined. The potentiometric methods mentioned can be used for simple determination of anionic and nonionic surfactants in the Sava River in Zagreb and downstream, at inflow of wastewater from the treatment plants.

AB The combination of systems containing biopolymers surfactants is found in diverse formulated products such as wastewater treatment, food, drugs (pharmaceuticals), cosmetics, paints, detergents, pesticides and also in processes such as polymer synthesis, wastewater treatment and enhanced oil recovery. In this work, we examine the effect of surfactant: sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on solutions containing biopolymer: xanthan gum, alkali and oil by interfacial tension (IFT), conductometric and rheological measurements. To this end, the method of experiments planning was adopted. Previous study on the conductivity profiles of SDS/Xanthan gum and salt systems had shown the existence of interaction and the curves presented linearity as expected. The results show an important effect on surface tension, IFT, conductometric and rheological properties on the studied systems; also, they indicate an important action of surfactant SDS, oil and biopolymer greatly influences IFT.

AB Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater is a promising technology for clean analgin pharmaceutical wastewater utilisation. In this paper, hydrogen production by non-catalytic partial oxidation of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater was systematically investigated in supercritical water (SCW) with a continuous reactor for the first time. The influences of the main operating parameters including residence time, temperature and oxidant equivalent ratio (ER) on the gasification characteristics of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated. The experimental results showed that H-2 yield and carbon gasification efficiency (CE) increased with increasing temperature. CE increased with increasing ER, and H2 yield peaked when ER equaled 0.2. CE increased quickly within 180 s and then tended to be stable between 240 and 300 s.

AB This study investigates the electrochemical oxidation of caffeine under various operating parameters (current density, initial caffeine concentration, electrode material (BDD, PbO2, and Pt), and sample matrix). According to cyclic voltammetric analysis, the oxidation of caffeine on BDD was found to be electrochemically irreversible. The degradation efficiency of caffeine increased with increasing current density but noticeably decreased as initial caffeine concentration increased. Superior to the PbO2 and Pt electrodes for caffeine degradation and total organic carbon abatement, the BDD anode exhibited the highest maximum value of caffeine mineralization current efficiency. At 200 mA/cm(2) and 25 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of caffeine oxidation were 7.6 x10(-4) and 6.9x10(-4) 1/s in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and secondary (municipal) wastewater treatment plant effluent, respectively.

AB Global fresh water resources are under increasing pressure from rapidly growing demands and changing climatic conditions. Wastewater reclamation is becoming an important alternative for sustainable water resources management and building climate change resiliency in many regions around the world. Public acceptance and trust of consumers in the quality of reclaimed water is considered by many to be the most important factor determining the outcomes of water reclamation projects. Knowledge of the urban water cycle and water reuse perceptions of student, faculty and staff at Western University were investigated. Results showed that members of the university community are more likely to accept reclaimed wastewater for applications that do not involve drinking or close personal contact. Knowledge of the urban water cycle and water resources in Canada is modest among the university community with a moderate (G = 0.303, p< 0.05) positive relationship between 'water knowledge' and 'close contact acceptability'. The majority of the university community (75.8%) thinks that reclaiming water to provide an alternate source of water in southwestern Ontario is a good idea, but there are still concerns about the presence of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals from reclaimed water and the long-term effects on human health from exposure to these contaminants.

AB Little information is available on pharmaceutical trace compounds degradation pathways in wastewater. The potential of the proteomics approach has been evaluated to extract information on activated sludge microbial metabolism in degrading a trace concentration of a pharmaceutical compound (ibuprofen). Ibuprofen is one of the most consumed pharmaceuticals, measured in wastewater at very high concentrations and, despite its high removal rates, found in different environmental compartments. Aerated and completely mixed activated sludge batch tests were spiked with ibuprofen at 10 and 1,000 mu g L-1. Ibuprofen concentrations were determined in the liquid phase: 100% removal was observed and the kinetics were estimated. The solid phase was sampled for proteomics purposes. The first objective was to apply proteomics to evaluate protein profile variations in a complex matrix such as activated sludge. The second objective was to determine, at different ibuprofen concentrations, which proteins followed pre-defined trends. No newly expressed proteins were found. Nonetheless, the obtained results suggest that proteomics itself is a promising methodology to be applied in this field. Statistical and comparative studies analyses provided, in fact, useful information on biological reproducibility and permitted us to detect 62 proteins following coherent and plausible expected trends in terms of presence and intensity change.

AB The improved activity of alga is critical for the biological enhanced treatment to remove contamination. Organisms usually perform compensatory responses, resulting from unfavorable conditions. This study investigates the effect of the artificially controlled culture before the treatment, which provoked the possible algal compensatory response and helped the algae to perform a better removal capability of the antibiotic ceftazidime in the subsequent treatment process. The removal efficiency could be improved up to 99.15% in 6 h when the algae were under the artificial controlled light conditions before the treatment process. In addition, higher removal efficiency of N and P (98.57% and 99.98%) was obtained after the artificial control. This suggests that the algae displayed a sequence of response during the exposure to the antibiotic after the artificial controlled culture in three steps: compensatory response, adsorption-consumption acceleration and acclimation. It might be the first time that the artificial conditions changing were controlled to improve the removal efficiency. Our study pointed out a new method for biological enhancement technologies in the antibiotic wastewater treatment.

AB The presence of microconstituents (MCs) in the environment has become an emerging concern to scientists and engineers. Sorption is one of the important removal mechanisms for MCs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) since there is significant sludge production. The purpose of this study is to explore sorption kinetics and isotherms of MCs onto primary sludge. Three MCs, bisphenol-A (BPA), 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and triclosan (TCS), were chosen for this study. They are hydrophobic and have low vapor pressure, which makes sorption a potential removal mechanism. Both sorption kinetics and isotherm experiments were conducted using primary sludge collected from a local municipal WWTP. The time to equilibrium was around 7 h for all chosen MCs. A pseudo second-order rate model was better at describing the sorption rate than a pseudo first-order rate model. Linear sorption isotherm models were found to fit the experimental data, and the solid-liquid partitioning coefficients for BPA, EE2 and TCS were 81, 728 and 6,407 L/kg.

AB The high-concentration pharmaceutical intermediate wastewater treatment was studied experimentally by using a coupled membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system, which included ozone oxidation as pretreatment, MABR biochemical method, and improved coagulation-flocculation technology as post-treatment. First, the influence of ozone production rate and reaction time on chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/COD (B/C) ratio was explored. 53% COD reduction and an increase of B/C ratio from 0.22 to 0.46 were achieved under the conditions of 6 g h(-1) of dose and 30 min of reaction time. Subsequently, multi-group continuous experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT), aeration pressure, and flow velocity on C and N removals in MABR system. With 24 h HRT, aeration pressure of 0.15 MPa, and flow velocity of 0.08 m s(-1), 95% COD removal and 92% total nitrogen (TN) reduction were obtained simultaneously in the MABR process. Finally, the improved coagulation-flocculation was applied using polyaluminium chloride (PAC, 1.2 g L-1) combined with polyacrylamide (PAM, 2 mg L-1) and magnetic powder (8-10 g L-1) to generate excellent effluent quality for industrial reuse in China (GB/T 19923-2005). In conclusion, O-3-MABR-improved coagulation/flocculation technology was feasible for treating pharmaceutical intermediate wastewater for reuse.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the algal contribution in a combined UV-algae treatment to remove the commonly used antibiotic cefradine. We evaluated the removal capacity of the individual alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), UV activated and combined UV-algae treatments. The toxic effect of the effluents treated by the above process on the standard test organismrotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) was also investigated. Our results showed that the individual algae treatment was inefficient at removing the antibiotic. Although the UV treatment decreased the antibiotic concentration efficiently (26.93% residue), it also increased the toxicity of the effluent (1.04 times of the parent compound). However, the relatively high removal efficiency (22.01% residue) and the reduced toxicity of the effluent (nearly half of that by the individual UV treatment) were obtained synchronously after the UV-algae combined treatment. The contribution of the algae was also confirmed by investigating the corresponding properties of the combined UV-activated sludge treatment and the combined UV-activated sludge-algae treatment. Our present study supported our hypothesis that (1) the performance of the individual algae treatment was inferior to the individual UV irradiation; (2) the algae treatment was necessary in a UV-algae combined treatment system to control the toxicity of the effluent after the UV treatment process.

AB Phenolic compounds are ubiquitous environmental pollutants generated in the manufacture of many industrial products such as papers, metals, resins, plastics, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Because they are frequently discharged into lakes, rivers and oceans in large quantities by industries, these toxic pollutants have adversely affected our environment and ecology. Therefore, removal of these aromatic pollutants from industrial effluents has been a critical issue. A novel, practical and inexpensive method has been used for treatment of phenolic wastewater. In this study, the influence of alkali on the gasification of phenolic wastewater with K2CO3 as catalyst at 530 degrees C, 24 MPa was investigated. The results showed that presence of K2CO3 increased H-2 fraction and decreased CO fraction in the gas product via promoting water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and it also increased the gas yield. The precipitated alkali in the reactor still showed high catalytic effect on the subsequent gasification of phenolic wastewater without further alkali addition. The catalytic activity was slightly reduced because K2CO3 is transformed to KHCO3.

AB The efficacy of three different wastewater treatment configurations, conventional activated sludge (CAS), nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) and biological nutrient removal (BNR) for removal of selected micropollutants from authentic wastewater was investigated. The processes were also characterized based on their proficiency to reduce the estrogenic activity of the influent wastewater using the in vitro recombinant yeast assay. The removal efficiency of trimethoprim improved with the complexity of the three treatment process configurations. Ibuprofen, androstendione, sulfamethoxazole, nonylphenol, estrone and bisphenol-A had moderate to high removals (> 65%) while carbamazepine and meprobamate remained recalcitrant in the three treatment process configurations. The removal of gemfibrozil was better in the NAS than in BNR and CAS treatment configurations. The yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay analyses showed an improvement in estrogenicity removal in the BNR and NAS treatment configurations as compared to the CAS treatment configuration. Comparing the estrogenic responses from the three treatment configurations, the removal efficiencies followed the order of BNR = NAS > CAS and all were greater than 81%.

AB Amoxicillin (AMO) degradation was investigated using electrolysis, ozonation, and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process. The E-peroxone process was found to be the most effective for AMO degradation. 67.8% total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization was obtained after 60 min by the E-peroxone process. In comparison, only 47.3% and 3.1% TOC mineralization were obtained using individual ozonation and electrolysis processes, respectively. It was found that hydroxyl radical production and O-3 utilization were both enhanced in the E-peroxone process. The effect of pH on the E-peroxone process was investigated, and the highest AMO removal rate was obtained at pH = 9, indicating pH control was crucial in the E-peroxone process. In addition, more oxidation typical intermediates were identified in the E-peroxone process than the ozonation process using UPLC-MS/MS. Different pathways of AMO degradation were proposed, involving the hydroxylation of the benzoic ring and N, the four-membered beta-lactamic ring opening, the oxidation of S, and other bond cleavage reactions. All these results above indicated that the introduction of electrolysis in ozonation has enhanced AMO cleavage and hence its degradation.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter ecosystems, which causes changes to microbial community structure and development of resistant genes. Anaerobic treatments can be an alternative application for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters, which has high organic content. This study aims to develop an understanding of the effects of sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline (ETS), sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST), erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) and erythromycintetracycline (ET) combinations on the anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The results of this investigation revealed that bacteria have a competitive advantage over archaea under all antibiotic combinations. The ET reactor showed a better performance compared to other reactors; this could be due to antagonistic effects of sulfamethoxazole. Acute inhibition in the microbial community was also strongly affected by antibiotics concentrations. This indicated that the composition of the microbial community changed in association with anaerobic sequencing batch reactor performances. The results of this research support the idea that an acute test could be used to control and improve the anaerobic treatment system.

AB The present work was conducted to optimize operating parameters for electrocoagulation treatment of a pharmaceutical effluent. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity removals were monitored for each experiment since they are good indicators of wastewater quality The effects of three parameters such as pH (4-10), current density (i=20-80 mA/cm(2)), and time of reaction (t=10-30 min) were evaluated using a response surface methodology (RSM) and in particular a full factorial central composite face-centered (CCF) design. The obtained experimental data were fit to a second-order polynomial equation using multiple regressions and were also analyzed by variance analysis (ANOVA). The contour plots derived from the mathematical models were applied to determine the optimal conditions (pH of 5.31, current density of 46.83 mA/cm(2), and electrolysis time of 17.99 min). Under these conditions, the experimental COD and turbidity removals were found equal to 75.64 and 96.34%, respectively, which were in agreement with the values predicted by the models. The electrocoagulation mechanism was modeled using Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. The obtained results showed that the Freundlich isotherm correctly predicted the experimental data. Operating costs included energy and electrode consumption as performed for the process of treatment. It was noted that the general cost varied from 0.1053-2.8289 US$ for current densities ranging from 20-80 mA/cm(2) and electrolysis times from 10-30 min. Under optimal conditions, the general cost was found equal to 0.8113 US$/m(3).

AB Water scarcity driven by population growth, lack of conventional supplies, and climate change impacts have resulted in increasing interest worldwide in drinking water augmentation using treated wastewater effluents. Potable reuse can occur indirect or direct, but is also practiced in many places as 'de facto reuse', where upstream wastewater discharge occurs to drinking water supplies. With this increasing recognition of potable reuse, there is very limited guidance and standardization for proper design and operation of potable reuse schemes that is protective of public health. This study provided guidance on contemporary approaches for the design, operation, and monitoring of potable reuse schemes, including source water characterization and source control approaches; linking water quality treatment performance goals to health risks; risk mitigation strategies including the design principles of multiple barriers for microbial and chemical contaminants; assessing system reliability and fail-safe design approaches; and, finally, monitoring strategies for process performance and compliance.

AB Ten low-order streams draining headwater catchments within the East Fork Little Miami Watershed were evaluated throughout one year for the presence of six steroidal hormones, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban, and the artificial sweetener sucralose. The wastewater management practices in the catchments included septic systems, sanitary sewers, a combination of both, and a parkland with no treatment systems. The concentrations and detection frequencies of sucralose showed a significant positive correlation with the septic density in each catchment. A similar relationship was found for sulfamethoxazole. Both sucralose and sulfamethoxazole are hydrophilic and unlikely to be removed effectively by sorption during septic treatment. The concentrations and detection frequencies of the antimicrobials were also positively correlated with septic density. The presence of the antimicrobials in the streams indicates that although they are hydrophobic, removal during septic treatment was incomplete. The target analytes that correlated with septic density were also detected in stream samples collected below a wastewater treatment plant located within the same watershed. The steroidal hormone estrone was the most frequently detected analyte at all sites. However, the estrone concentrations and detection frequencies did not correlate with the septic density due to multiple non-point sources.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from anaerobic biological processes of organic waste and wastewater were investigated in four sites in North China, including a biogas well of landfill, a fermentation workshop of pharmaceutical residues, an anaerobic digestion workshop of pharmaceutical wastewater, and an anaerobic digester of petrochemical wastewater. 108 VOC species were qualified and quantified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system with canister sampling. Results showed that the total amounts of analyzed VOCs varied from 8503 +/- 1320 mu g/m(3) to 727 +/- 109 mu g/m(3) in summer with the order as municipal landfill > pharmaceutical residues >pharmaceutical wastewater > petrochemical wastewater. The most abundant types of VOCs in the municipal landfill were halogenated hydrocarbons (41.9%), followed by acetates (22.0%), aromatic hydrocarbons (13.0%) and alcohols (10.5%). For the pharmaceutical residues, alkenes (51.4%) dominated, followed by aromatic hydrocarbons (22.5%) and alkanes (16.0%). For the pharmaceutical wastewater, aromatic hydrocarbons (27.1%) dominated, followed by ketones (24.9%), acetates (20.71%) and halogenated hydrocarbons (11.4%). For the petrochemical wastewater, aromatic hydrocarbons were highest, accounting for 28.3% of the total species, they were followed by alkanes (25.9%), halogenated hydrocarbons (19.9%) and methyl tert-butyl ether (14.8%). These results implied that the types and levels of airborne VOCs species from the four biological degradation processes exist significant differences, which were mainly caused by the type of waste and wastewater, operational characteristics of the treatment plant, and environmental conditions. In the other hand, the reactivity of VOCs species from the four sources was also assessed by OH loss rate, due to the impact of VOCs on the production of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).

AB The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a well-known sentinel of environmental contamination, yet no studies have traced pharmaceuticals through the water-fish-osprey food web. A screening-level exposure assessment was used to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of 113 pharmaceuticals and metabolites, and an artificial sweetener in this food web. Hypothetical concentrations in water reflecting wastewater effluent dominated or dilution dominated scenarios were combined with pH-specific bioconcentration factors (BCFs) to predict uptake in fish. Residues in fish and osprey food intake rate were used to calculate the daily intake (DI) of compounds by an adult female osprey. Fourteen pharmaceuticals and a drug metabolite with a BCF greater than 100 and a DI greater than 20 mu g/kg were identified as being most likely to exceed the adult human therapeutic dose (HTD). These 15 compounds were also evaluated in a 40 day cumulative dose exposure scenario using first-order kinetics to account for uptake and elimination. Assuming comparable absorption to humans, the half-lives (t(1/2)) for an adult osprey to reach the HTD within 40 days were calculated. For 3 of these pharmaceuticals, the estimated t(1/2) in ospreys was less than that for humans, and thus an osprey might theoretically reach or exceed the HTD in 3 to 7 days. To complement the exposure model, 24 compounds were quantified in water, fish plasma, and osprey nestling plasma from 7 potentially impaired locations in Chesapeake Bay. Of the 18 analytes detected in water, 8 were found in fish plasma, but only 1 in osprey plasma (the antihypertensive diltiazem). Compared to diltiazem detection rate and concentrations in water (10/12 detects, <method detection limits [MDL]-173ng/L), there was a lower detection frequency in fish (31/233 detects, <MDL-2400ng/L); however when present in fish, all values exceeded the maximum diltiazem concentration found in water. Diltiazem was found in all 69 osprey plasma samples (540-8630ng/L), with 41% of these samples exceeding maximum concentrations found in fish. Diltiazem levels in fish and osprey plasma were below the human therapeutic plasma concentration (30000ng/L). Effect thresholds for diltiazem are unknown in ospreys at this time, and there is no evidence to suggest adverse effects. This screening-level exposure model can help identify those compounds that warrant further investigation in high-trophic level species. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2015;11:118-129. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB Glycerolysis of sunflower oil was studied using acetone as the solvent. Reactions were carried out at 200 to 250 degrees C without the need of conventional catalyst. The use of acetone in glycerolysis of oil allowed the reaction to be carried out at 250 degrees C and 1.8 MPa, resulting in a product that comprises 4.5% solketal, 5.8% FFA, 49.2% MG, 33.5% DG and 7% TG in 2 h. The important parameters investigated in this study were acetone addition, stirring and reactor loading. This new approach in the synthesis of partial glycerides (monoglycerides and diglycerides) avoids the use of chemical catalyst, thus avoiding unnecessary wastewater production. The partial glycerides produced may be utilized in may areas of food and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover the use of acetone as solvent allows the process to be carried out at lower operating pressures compared to other non-catalytic glycerolysis and at the same time co-produces solketal, having a wide application in fuels, pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis.

AB Although potential risk of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and trihalomethanes to humans is small or unconfirmed, it is advisable to remove these wastewater-related contaminants to increase public confidence and acceptance as a precautionary principle and consequently their elimination or reduction during drinking water treatment is warranted. Experiments were conducted using the dual train pilot-scale conventional treatment plant with ozone and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) with three different raw water sources. Reductions of trihalomethanes-formation potentials (THM-FPs) were 8-52%. Ozone was found to decrease THM-FPs while UV/H2O2 was found to increase THM-FPs in most of the experiments under experimental conditions. Conventional treatment poorly removed the selected PPCPs and EDCs while ozone + conventional treatment provided excellent removal. Conventional + UV/H2O2 treatment also demonstrated effective removal. However, removal of PPCPs and EDCs by conventional + UV/H2O2 treatment provided lower efficacy for Sites B and C, likely due to the presence of scavengers such as organics, bicarbonates, carbonates and particles.

AB In this study, we aimed to develop an understanding of the triple effects of sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline (ETS) and the dual effects of sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST), erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) and erythromycin-tetracycline (ET) on the anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater throughout a year of operation. Concentrations of the antibiotics in the influent were gradually increased until the metabolic collapse of the anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), which corresponded to ETS (40 + 3 + 3 mg/L) and ST (25 + 2.5 mg/L), ET (4 + 4 mg/L) and ES (3 + 40 mg/L). Acetate accumulation in the anaerobic SBRs, acetoclastic activity of the anaerobic sludge taken from different antibiotic feeding stages and also expression of acetyl-coA synthetase from the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway on the mRNA level were assessed. The results indicated that, while acetate accumulation and decrease of acetoclastic activity were observed after stage 3 in the ST and ES reactors, and stage 7 in the ETS and ET reactors, the expression of acetyl-coA synthetase was mostly decreased in the last stages in all SBRs, in which antibiotic mixture feeding was terminated. It might be speculated that acetoclastic methanogens have an important role in acetate degradation by expressing acetyl-coA synthetase.

AB Even though the methodology used for the determination of beta-blockers and beta-agonists in environmental samples is basedmainly on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, the available literature data on the applied SPE procedures is rather sparse. In this paper such comparison is presented. Moreover, the usefulness of the eight SPE cartridges for the determination of five beta-blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol) and two beta-agonists (salbutamol and terbutaline) in environmental aqueous samples using GC techniques is tested. Among them, three (the trifunction sorbent Strata Screen C, the copolymers LiChrolut EN, and the functionalized copolymer Isolute ENV+) were used for the first time for this purpose. It was confirmed that polystyrene-divinylbenzene-N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers (PS-DVB-VP, Strata-X, and Oasis HLB cartridges) have a better potential than a cation-exchange sorbent for the extraction of the target drugs from environmental water samples. However, it should be stressed out that the direct application of the tested SPE conditions for the analysis of real environmental water samples is not possible, and such parameters, like volume of loading sample, appropriate solvents for washing and elution steps, and so forth, must be optimized again in order to achieve satisfactory recovery values for the target compounds.

AB Seventeen pharmaceutically active compounds and 22 other trace organic pollutants were analysed regularly in the influent and permeate from a semi-real plant treating municipal wastewater. The plant was operated during 29 months with different configurations which basically differed in the type of biomass present in the system. These processes were the integrated fixed-film activated sludge membrane bioreactor (IFAS-MBR), which combined suspended and attached biomass, the moving bed membrane bioreactor (MBMBR) (only attached biomass) and the MBR (only suspended biomass). Moreover, removal rates were compared to those of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operating nearby with conventional activated sludge treatment. Reverse osmosis (RO) was used after the pilot plant to improve removal rates. The highest elimination was found for the IFAS-MBR, especially for hormones (100% removal); this was attributed to the presence of biofilm, which may lead to different conditions (aerobic-anoxic-anaerobic) along its profile, which increases the degradation possibilities, and also to a higher sludge age of the biofilm, which allows complete acclimation to the contaminants. Operating conditions played an important role, high mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and sludge retention time (SRT) being necessary to achieve these high removal rates. Although pharmaceuticals and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates showed high removal rates (65-100%), nonylphenols and phthalate could only be removed to 10-30%. RO significantly increased removal rates to 88% mean removal rate.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are generated through complex manufacturing processes that contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents, and are usually characterized by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. Therefore, it must be treated. The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) using the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) method was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The effects of H2O2 dosage, reaction time, temperature, initial COD, and concentration of ethylene glycol on COD removal were studied with laboratory bench-scale experiments. The results indicated that the removal process was more effective under experimental conditions. Adding ethylene glycol accelerates the destruction of pharmaceutical wastewater. The best COD removal of pharmaceutical wastewater reached 97.8%. This investigation will provide a fundamental method for developing a pretreatment method of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater with flexibility, simplicity and high activity.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are generated through complex manufacturing processes that contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents, and are usually characterized by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. In this paper, wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) was adopted to treat pharmaceutical wastewater. Central composite design, an experimental design for response surface methodology (RSM), was used to create a set of 30 experimental runs needed for optimizing operating conditions. The experimental results show that WPO could effectively reduce COD by 97.5% at optimum conditions: temperature is 260 degrees C, H2O2 excess (HE) is 0, the initial concentration of pharmaceutical wastewater is 45,000 mg/L, and reaction time is 10 mm. WPO process is possibly suitable for a primary treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater. Response surface methodology (RSM) could be effectively adopted to optimize the operating multifactors in a complex WPO process.

AB Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesised, characterised, and used as a peroxidase mimetic to accelerate levofloxacin sono-degradation in an ultrasound (US)/H2O2 system. The Fe3O4 MNPs were in nanometre scale with an average diameter of approximately 12 to 18 nm. The introduction of Fe3O4 MNPs increased levofloxacin sono-degradation in the US/H2O2 system. Experimental parameters, such as Fe3O4 MNP dose, initial solution pH, and H2O2 concentration, were investigated by a one-factor-at-a-time approach. The results showed that Fe3O4 MNPs enhanced levofloxacin removal in the pH range from 4.0 to 9.0. Levofloxacin removal ratio increased with Fe3O4 MNP dose up to 1.0 g.L-1 and with H2O2 concentration until reaching the maximum. Moreover, three main intermediate compounds were identified by HPLC with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry, and a possible degradation pathway was proposed. This study suggests that combination of H2O2, Fe3O4 MNPs and US is a good way to improve the degradation efficiency of antibiotics.

AB Emerging contaminants are a wide group of chemical products that are found at low concentrations in the environment. These contaminants can be either natural, e. g., estrogens, or synthetics, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, which can enter the environment through the water and sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The growth of Trametes versicolor on membrane biological reactor (MBR) sludge in bioslurry systems at the Erlenmeyer scale was assessed and its capacity for removing pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) was evaluated. The ability of the fungus to remove hydrochlorothiazide (HZT) from liquid media cultures was initially assessed. Consequently, different bioslurry media (complete nutrient, glucose and no-nutrient addition) and conditions (sterile and non-sterile) were tested, and the removal of spiked HZT was monitored under each condition. The highest spiked HZT removal was assessed under non-sterile conditions without nutrient addition (93.2%). Finally, the removal assessment of a broad set of pharmaceuticals was performed in non-spiked bioslurry. Under non-sterile conditions, the fungus was able to completely degrade 12 out of the 28 drugs initially detected in the MBR sludge, achieving an overall degradation of 66.9%. Subsequent microbial analysis showed that the microbial diversity increased after 15 days of treatment, but there was still some T. versicolor in the bioslurry. Results showed that T. versicolor can be used to remove PPCPs in bioslurry systems under non-sterile conditions, without extra nutrients in the media, and in matrices as complex as an MBR sludge.

AB Many of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products occurring in municipal sewage are ionizing substances, and their partitioning behaviour is affected by ionic interactions with solid matrices. In activated sludge systems, such interactions have currently not been adequately understood and described, particularly for zwitterionic chemicals. Here we present an assessment of the effects of pH and iron salt dosing on the sorption of ciprofloxacin onto activated sludge using laboratory experiments and full-scale fate modelling. Experimental results were described with Freundlich isotherms and showed that non-linear sorption occurred under all the conditions tested. The greatest sorption potential was measured at pH = 7.4, at which ciprofloxacin is speciated mostly as zwitterion. iron salt dosing increased sorption under aerobic and, to a lesser extent, anoxic conditions, whereas no effect was registered under anaerobic conditions.
   The activated sludge model for xenobiotics (ASM-X) was extended with Freundlich-based sorption kinetics and used to predict the fate of ciprofloxacin in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Scenario simulations, using experimental Freundlich parameters, were used to identify whether the assessed factors caused a significant increase of aqueous ciprofloxacin concentration in full-scale bioreactors. Simulation results suggest that a pH increase, rather than a reduction in iron salt dosing, could be responsible for a systematic deterioration of sorption of ciprofloxacin in the WWTP.

AB Pollution with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, especially when combined with low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia), is a threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is commonly detected in wastewater effluents, and has potential to accumulate in the bile of fish. Diclofenac has been shown to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which induces transcription in the metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450 1a (cyp1a). Previously, crosstalk has been shown to occur between AHR and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). In addition, both of these transcription factors interact with the proteins regulating circadian (24-h) rhythms in vertebrates. Yet little is known about the significance of these interactions during simultaneous exposure to chemicals and hypoxia in fish in vivo. We exposed wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to diclofenac (1 mu g/L, 14 days), hypoxia (2.0 mg/L, up to 24 h) and the combination of both. We then analyzed markers of chemical biotransformation (EROD activity, cyp1a and ahr mRNA levels), glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity, ldh and enolase la mRNA levels), and the transcription of core circadian clock genes clock and period 1 in liver tissue. Samples were taken at three time points during the light period in order to address disturbances in the circadian variation of metabolic processes. The results show that mRNA levels and LDH activity tended to be lowest before the dark period, but this pattern was disturbed by hypoxia and diclofenac. Diclofenac and hypoxia co-exposure induced EROD activity more strongly than diclofenac exposure alone, while cypla mRNA level was increased also by hypoxia and diclofenac alone. LDH activity and mRNA expression showed a clear time-dependent response during hypoxia, which is consistent with the previously suggested decreased accumulation of HIF-1 during the dark period. Furthermore, LDH activity and transcription was disturbed by diclofenac, indicating important effects of environmental pollutants in disturbing natural acclimation. This study demonstrates the need for more studies to understand the potential disturbances in endogenous rhythms caused by environmental pollution in natural populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Six boreholes were drilled during the course of a year to a depth of 2 m beneath the water table, located at a depth of about 28 m, under agricultural land sprinkler irrigated with treated sewage effluents in the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel to determine the extent of penetration of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into the unsaturated zone. The fields were planted to turf and had different histories of effluent irrigation. From each borehole, 7 to 21 samples were taken for analysis of PPCPs, as was the underlying groundwater. Nine PPCPs (carbamazepine and its metabolite 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine, acridone and acridine, venlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, oxcarbazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and caffeine) were detected in the vadose zone of the study area to a depth of 27 m. For example, the detected concentrations of carbamazepine were up to 109 ng/kg, of caffeine up to 36,700 ng/kg, and of venlafaxine up to 50 ng/kg. Only five of the compounds (carbamazepine, acridone, venlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, and caffeine) were found in the underlying groundwater with concentrations in the nanogram per liter range. The results of this work show that significant amounts of PPCPs can penetrate even a thick vadose zone of 27 m with sections containing up to 50% clay and up to 0.40% soil organic C. Venlafaxine, for example, penetrated the vadose zone at an average velocity of 2.8 to 4 m/yr. Irrigation with treated sewage effluents or contaminated water should be carefully considered if the penetration of PPCPs into groundwater is undesirable.

AB The cosmopolitan species-complex Capitella, a deposit-feeding polychaete, is widely used as an indicator of organic pollution and plays an important role in sewage waste cycling in marine and estuarine ecosystems. The antidepressant fluoxetine can be accumulated in sewage effluents and it could pose a hazard to infauna inhabiting surrounding areas. The study aimed to assess effects of fluoxetine on juveniles and adults of Capitella teleta and Capitella sp A. Sediments were spiked with four fluoxetine concentrations (0.001, 0.03, 0.3 and 3.3 A mu g/g dry wt. sediment). Chronically exposed worms of C. teleta showed delay of maturity, delay or inhibition of copulation and morphological abnormalities (genital spines in males and juveniles) with adverse physiological consequences. Alternatively, in C. teleta fluoxetine enhanced proteroginous individuals that may be beneficial for the population. Worms of Capitella sp A only showed delay or inhibition of copulation. Observed fluoxetine adverse effects could have important ecological implications in natural populations of aquatic invertebrates due to the possible alteration or even inhibition of reproductive processes.

AB Pharmaceutical fate in surface water depends on a combination of physical and chemical processes, but currently, little information is available on cumulative dissipation rates in effluent-dominated receiving waters. In this study, dissipation rates were calculated for pharmaceutical compounds in two streams receiving municipal wastewater effluents using results from passive samplers. Seventeen pharmaceuticals were detected at the two sampling locations, and first-order dissipation rates were found to range between 0.03 and -0.02 h-(1), indicating that some compounds were conserved, while others rapidly dissipated over several kilometers downstream of the source.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical drug, and its presence in a trace amount in waste water makes severe environmental pollution. The degradation of DCF was investigated by a photocatalytic process in presence of ultra violet irradiation at room temperature using titania and titania-zirconia nanocomposite catalysts in a batch reactor. The composite catalyst was prepared by sol-gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy as well as BET surface area analyzer. The effect of various process parameters such as catalyst loading, initial concentration of DCF and pH of the experimental solution was observed on the degradation of DCF. The titania-zirconia nanocomposites exhibited reasonably higher photocatalytic activity than that of anatase form of titania without zirconia. The maximum removal of DCF of about 92.41 % was achieved using Zr/Ti mass ratio of 11.8 wt% composite catalyst. A rate equation was proposed for the degradation of DCF using the composite catalyst. The values of rate constant (k (c)) and adsorption equilibrium constant (K (1)) were found to vary with the catalyst content in the reaction mixture.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of hospital laundry wastewaters generated from a regional hospital located in Rio Pardo Valley in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Physicochemical, microbiological, ecotoxicological, and genotoxic analyses were performed, and the results indicate that some parameters were not in accordance with the limit concentrations established by Brazilian and international guidelines for urban wastewaters. Daphnia magna (EC50 2.01 %) and Danio rerio (LC50 29.25 %) acute toxicity was detected, and sublethal effects were identified in Lactuca sativa (IC25 12.50 %) and Allium cepa (IC25 51.25 %). Cytotoxicity was observed at the five wastewater concentrations used yielding statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the meristematic cells of A. cepa compared with the negative control. The results obtained here warn about the necessity to develop treatment methods that can mitigate the environmental impacts caused by the ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of hospital laundry wastewaters.

AB Concentrations of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated for the first time in sewage effluents and receiving waters of the "Rio de la Plata" estuary and neighboring areas by means of LC-MS/MS. E2 and EE2 were ubiquitous in the evaluated sewage effluent samples showing concentrations ranging between 122-631 and 65-187 ng/L, respectively. In surface waters, these estrogens were only detected in the "Girado" stream (ChascomA(0)s) at 369 and 43 ng/L, respectively. No significant relationship was found among the size of the served population and the concentration of the estrogens in the sewage effluent. The detection of these estrogens in receiving waters was dependent on the dilution capacity of the system. The studied estrogens were undetectable at the La Plata City water supply station. Conversely, concentrations found at the "Girado" stream indicate a potential ecotoxicological risk of these estrogens to the local aquatic biota.

AB Water quality characteristics and emerging organic pollutants were sampled along the San Pedro-Guayllabamba-Esmeraldas River and its main water pollution streams in the summer of 2013. The annual flow rate of the stream is 22 000 Mm(3) y(-1) and it collects the wastewater of Quito-Ecuador in the Andes and supplies drinking water to the city of Esmeraldas near the Pacific Ocean. The most persistent emerging pollutants were carbamazepine and acesulfame, which were found to be stable along the San Pedro-Guayllabamba-Esmeraldas River, whereas the concentration of most other organic emerging pollutants, such as caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and steroidal estrogens, was degraded to a large extent along the 300 km flow. The mass rate of the sum of cocaine and benzoylecgonine, its metabolite, was increased along the stream, which may be attributed to coca plantations and wild coca trees. This raises the possibility of using river monitoring as an indirect way to learn about changes in coca plantations in their watersheds. Several organic emerging pollutants, such as venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulphamethoxazole, and benzoylecgonine, survived even the filtration treatment at the Esmeraldas drinking water system, though all except for benzoylecgonine are found below 20 ng L-1, and are therefore not likely to cause adverse health effects. The research provides a way to compare drug consumption in a major Latin American city (Quito) and shows that the consumption of most sampled drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, sulphamethoxazole, ethinylestradiol) was below their average consumption level in Europe, Israel, and North America.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been universally detected in rivers, lakes and coastal waters that are affected by effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, the biological effects and bioaccumulation of PhACs were assessed in crucian carp (Carassius auratus) caged in an effluent-receiving river for 21 days. Compared with control fish in the laboratory and at a reference site, a significant reduction in hepatosomatic index (HSI) and increase in the biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were observed in the fish that was caged downstream from the STP outfall. In general, the total concentrations of PhACs detected in fish tissues were in the order as follows: liver > brain > gill > muscle > bile. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for PhACs were between 195 and 2782 in the major storage tissue liver. The corresponding results for both risk quotient (RQ) and enhanced integrated biomarker response (EIBR) based on laboratory and field studies, respectively, indicated that environmental risk for adverse effects to aquatic organisms were clearly higher at the downstream of the STP outfall than at the upstream.

AB Combined sewer systems collect surface runoff as well as wastewater of industrial and domestic origin. During periods of heavy rainfall the capacity of the sewer system is exceeded and the overflow is discharged into receiving waters without any treatment. Consequently, combined sewer overflow (CSO) is considered as a major source of water pollution. This study investigates the effectiveness of a retention soil filter (RSF) for the removal of micropollutants as well as facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria from CSO. The removal of organic group parameters like total organic carbon was excellent and the removal efficiency for micropollutants of the RSF and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which treats wastewater of the same origin during dry and normal weather conditions, was comparable. Compounds of high environmental concern like estrogens or certain pharmaceuticals, e.g. diclofenac, were completely eliminated or removed to a high degree during RSF passage. RSF treatment also reduced the number of E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci by 2.7, 2.2 and 2.4 log-units (median values), respectively. Obviously, some Staphylococcus species can better adapt to the conditions of the RSF than others as a shift of the abundance of the different species was observed when comparing the diversity of staphylococci obtained from the RSF influent and effluent. RSF treatment also decreased the absolute number of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The percentage of antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci isolates also decreased during passage of the RSF, whereas the percentage of resistant enterococci did not change. For E. coli ampicillin and for enterococci and staphylococci erythromycin determined the antibiotic resistance level. The results demonstrate that RSFs can be considered as an adequate treatment option for CSO. The performance for the removal of micropollutants is comparable with a medium sized WWTP with conventional activated sludge treatment. The number of facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria was considerably decreased during RSF passage. However, as RSF effluents still contained antibiotic resistance genes and traces of micropollutants; receiving waters may still be at risk from negative environmental impacts.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are a major source of micropollutants to the aquatic environment. Despite intense research on the fate and effects of PPCPs in temperate climates, there is a paucity of data on their presence in polar environments. This study reports the presence of selected PPCPs in sewage effluents from two Antarctic research stations, the adjacent coastal seawater, sea ice, and biota. Sewage effluents contained bisphenol-A, ethinylestradiol, estrone, methyl triclosan, octylphenol, triclosan, and three UV-filters. The maximum sewage effluent concentrations of 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor, benzophenone-1, estrone, ethinylestradiol, and octylphenol exceeded concentrations previously reported. Coastal seawaters contained bisphenol-A, octylphenol, triclosan, three paraben preservatives, and four UV-filters. The sea ice contained a similar range and concentration of PPCPs as the seawater. Benzophenone-3 (preferential accumulation in clams), estradiol, ethinylestradiol, methyl paraben (preferential accumulation in fish, with concentrations correlating negatively with fillet size), octylphenol, and propyl paraben were detected in biota samples. PPCPs were detected in seawater and biota at distances up to 25 km from the research stations WWTP discharges. Sewage effluent discharges and disposal of raw human waste through sea ice cracks have been identified as sources of PPCPs to Antarctic coastal environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Activated carbon is investigated as adsorptive barrier for organic micropollutants (OMP) within the Berlin water cycle. In a pilot plant using granular activated carbon (GAC) as upper layer in dual-media filtration, OMP concentrations in treated wastewater could be reduced without any negative impact on filtration efficiency. OMP breakthroughs occurred after shorter runtimes than estimated according to isotherm experiments with powdered activated carbon (PAC). Batch adsorption tests comparing the used GAC to new GAC showed that the capacity of the used GAC was not exhausted, indicating that besides direct site competition, pore blocking is also responsible for the poor GAC performance. A pilot plant application of PAC of the same type as GAC showed significantly higher OMP removals at lower dosages, taking advantage of immobilization of PAC particles in the filters. Both PAC and GAC applications can be integrated into tertiary wastewater treatment without significant constructional changes.

AB Acute and chronic effect as well as biodegradation potential at different sludge retention times (SRTs) of a priority pollutant, diclofenac on denitrification process was assessed. The continuous amendment of the culture for 6 months with 1 mu g/L diclofenac resulted in 30% decrease in gas production. The average diclofenac removal observed in the diclofenac-acclimated culture was less than 15%. Batch tests showed that nitrate was removed in diclofenac free-control reactor at a higher rate compared to diclofenac amended reactor. Although, SRT did not have any progressive effect on diclofenac degradation, the system operated at low SRT was more sensitive to diclofenac and resulted in an increase in N2O emission. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operated at higher SRTs may tolerate and recover from the adverse effects of such micropollutants. The study can lead to other researchers to understand the fate and effect of other emerging pollutants in the anoxic unit of WWTPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversities can differ substantially among different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) communities. Whether differences in biodiversity translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services, however, is under active debate. Theoretical considerations predict that WWTP communities with more biodiversity are more likely to contain strains that have positive effects on the rates of particular ecosystem functions, thus resulting in positive associations between those two variables. However, if WWTP communities were sufficiently biodiverse to nearly saturate the set of possible positive effects, then positive associations would not occur between biodiversity and the rates of particular ecosystem functions. To test these expectations, we measured the taxonomic biodiversity, functional biodiversity, and rates of 10 different micropollutant biotransformations for 10 full-scale WWTP communities. We have demonstrated that biodiversity is positively associated with the rates of specific, but not all, micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, one cannot assume whether or how biodiversity will associate with the rate of any particular micropollutant biotransformation. We have further demonstrated that the strongest positive association is between biodiversity and the collective rate of multiple micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, more biodiversity is likely required to maximize the collective rates of multiple micropollutant biotransformations than is required to maximize the rate of any individual micropollutant biotransformation. We finally provide evidence that the positive associations are stronger for rare micropollutant biotransformations than for common micropollutant biotransformations. Together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in biodiversity can indeed translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services by full-scale WWTP communities.

AB A methodology based on headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) determination was developed for the monitoring and evaluation of the removal efficiency of 16 common fragrance allergens and two polycyclic musks in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). An experimental design with a full factorial model was applied to evaluate the effects of the experimental parameters on the extraction (e.g., salt content, time and extraction temperature). After determining the optimum conditions (2.4 g NaCl, 45 mm at 90 degrees C), an external calibration was performed and quality parameters of the proposed method were evaluated. Method detection limits in the range of 0.01-1.7 mu g L-1 were obtained. Satisfactory inter-day precision values between 4% and 23% (n = 5) were obtained for most compounds. The method was applied to the monitoring of the target analytes in samples from two WWTPs. Seven target compounds were detected at the primary effluent of both plants at mu g L-1 levels. Limonene, linalool and eugenol were quantitatively eliminated during the secondary treatments of both WWTPs, while lilial, benzyl salicylate, galaxolide, and tonalide were still detected at the effluent waters.

AB Increasing evidence indicates that pharmaceutical bioaccumulate in fish collected downstream from municipal wastewater effluent discharges. However, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation by other aquatic organisms, including primary producers (e.g., periphyton) and grazers (e.g., snails), are lacking in wadeable streams. Here, we examined environmental occurrence and bioaccumulation of a range of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern in surface water, a common snail (Planor-bid sp.) and periphyton from an effluent-dependent stream in central Texas, USA, during a historic drought, because such limited dilution and instream flows may represent worst-case exposure scenarios for aquatic life to pharmaceuticals. Water and tissue samples were liquid-liquid extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization. Target analytes included 21 pharmaceuticals across multiple drug classes and 2 pharmacologically active metabolites. Several pharmaceuticals were detected at up to 4.7 mu g kg(-1) in periphyton and up to 42 mu g kg(-1) in Planorbid sp. We then identified limitations of several bioconcentration factor and bioaccumulation factor models, developed for other invertebrates, to assist interpretation of such field results. Observations from the present study suggest that waterborne exposure to pharmaceuticals may be more important than dietary exposure for snails. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the regulation on bisphenol A (BPA) in several industrialized countries, the demand for other bisphenol analogues (Bps) as substitutes for BPA is growing. Eight BPs were determined in sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. Total concentrations of BPs (Sigma BP) in sludge ranged from <LOQ to 25700 ng g(-1). The highest concentrations of Sigma BP were found in sludge collected from WWTPs that received discharges from the paper and textile industries. The profiles of BPs were dependent on the proportions of industrial wastewater treated at each of the WWTPs. The sludge from industrial WWTPs contained elevated proportions of BPA, whereas sludge from domestic WWTPs was dominated by bisphenol F (BPF), suggesting use of BPF in certain industrial products in Korea. No significant correlations were found between BPs and the WWTP characteristics. The average per-capita emissions of BPs ranged from 0.04 (BPP) to 886 g capita(-1) d (BPA) through WWTP discharges. The emission fluxes of Sigma BP through industrial WWTPs were 2-3 orders of magnitudes higher than those calculated for domestic WWTPs, indicating that industrial discharges are the major source of BPs into the Korean environment. This is the first nationwide survey of BPs in sludge from Korean WWTPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work investigates, for the first time, the occurrence and sources of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water of Beijing, one of most densely populated cities in the world, in three sampling events representing different seasonal flow conditions. The detection frequencies of most PPCPs were in the range of 50-100%. The median concentrations of the selected PPCPs ranged from not detected to 4200 ng L-1 (caffeine). Generally, higher PPCP levels were observed in early spring, indicating both low flow condition and cold-water temperature might enhance their persistence. Source apportionment showed freshly discharged untreated sewage (67%) significantly contributed to the PPCP burden in the Beiyun River, which provides important information for environmental management.

AB Anthropogenic contamination of surface waters in Asia is on the increase. While polar organic contaminants are gradually recognized for their impacts on aquatic ecosystems in the Western World, less is known about the situation in Asia. In developing countries like China, water resources are particularly vulnerable. We investigated the occurrence, elimination, and per capita loads of a wide range of pharmaceuticals, household chemicals and pesticides in five Beijing WWTPs representative for megacities in China, and compare the efficiency of different treatment processes. Based on initial screening for 268 micropollutants using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 33 compounds were examined in detail. Pollutant concentrations in raw wastewater ranged from <0.02 mu g L-1 for pesticides to >20 mu g L-1 for caffeine and the contrast agent iopromide. Concentrations in the WWTP effluents were generally <1 mu g L-1, except for some pharmaceuticals, iopromide (1.2-18 mu g L-1), caffeine (0.025-2.3 mu g L-1), and the artificial sweetener sucralose (2.7-3.5 mu g L-1). Elimination efficiencies varied greatly from <1% to close to 100%, with macrolides, some sulfonamides, metronidazole, iopromide, and 4-acetamidoantipyrine being the most persistent compounds. Total per capita loads of the investigated micropollutants were lower than in communal wastewater of Europe, amounting to 7.9-12.2 and 2.0-6.5 g d(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) in the influents and effluents, respectively, with an average release of similar to 100 kg d(-1) by the 11.4 million people and 2.3 million m(3) of wastewater treated per day. Since the wastewater effluents are often used for agricultural irrigation, residual organic pollutants pose a threat to food safety, the development of antibacterial resistance, and combined effects of micropollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB Irrigation with reclaimed water is becoming a common practice in arid- and semi-arid regions as a consequence of structural water resource scarcity. This practice can lead to contamination of the vadose zone if sewage-derived contaminants are not removed properly. In the current work, we have characterized soils from the Guadalete River basin (SW Spain), which are often irrigated with reclaimed water from a nearby wastewater treatment plant and amended using sludge. Physico-chemical, mineralogical and hydraulic properties were measured in soil samples from this area (from surface up to 2 m depth). Emerging contaminants (synthetic surfactants and pharmaceutically active compounds, or PhACs) were also determined. Synthetic surfactants, widely used in personal care products (PCPs), were found in a wide range of concentrations: 73-1300 mu g kg(-1) for linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), 120-496 mu g kg(-1) for alkyl ethoxysulfates (AES), 19-109 mu g kg(-1) for alcohol polyethoxylates (AEOs), and 155-280 mu g kg(-1) for nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs). The presence of surfactant homologues with longer alkyl chains was predominant due to their sorption capacity. A positive correlation was found between LAS and AEOs and soil organic carbon and clay content, respectively. Out of 64 PhACs analyzed, only 7 were detected occasionally (diclofenac, metoprolol, fenofibrate, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, famotidine and hydrochlorothiazide), always at very low concentrations (from 0.1 to 1.3 mu g kg(-1)).

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are two groups of emerging pollutants the significance of which rests on their persistent detection in the aquatic environment and their possible adverse effects. Wastewater treatment plants are one of the major ways for transporting such chemicals in the aquatic environment. Chlorination is usually the last stage of treatment before wastewater being disposed to the aquatic environment. This work focuses on the evaluation of the effect of chlorine dose and specific wastewater characteristics (pH, total suspended solids and humic acids) on the removal of target EDCs and NSAIDs through chlorination. Another objective of this study is the identification of chlorination by-products of specific EDCs and NSAIDs and their dependence on contact time. Based on the results it is concluded that the effect of chlorine dose and humic acids concentration on the degradation of target compounds during chlorination is minimal. On the contrary, pH is a critical parameter which highly affects process performance. Moreover, it is concluded that not only the free available chlorine species, but also the properties of EDCs and NSAIDs under different pH conditions can affect chlorination process performance. The effect of TSS on the degradation of the target compounds during chlorination is more profound for chemicals with high Kow values and therefore higher affinity to partition to the particulate phase (i.e. nonylphenols, triclosan). Several degradation by-products were identified through chlorination of nonylphenol, bisphenol A and diclofenac. The dependence of these by-products on chlorination contact time is also demonstrated.

AB Through systematic research a novel analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography magnetic sector mass spectrometry was developed for the measurement of 43 pharmaceuticals in wastewater. A thorough method validation quantified the contribution of both the extraction recovery and matrix effects in the overall method process efficiency, and a detailed uncertainty analysis was performed to elaborate a quality labelling strategy to be used in data interpretation. Compounds for which a precise (relative standard deviation <20%) process efficiency between 60% and 140% was determined, were labelled as 'quantitative' whereas the results for other compounds should be interpreted as 'indicative'.
   Method application on influent and effluent samples of (i) a conventional active sludge system and (ii) a parallel membrane bioreactor/conventional active sludge wastewater treatment plant in Belgium revealed the occurrence of 22 pharmaceuticals. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the antidepressant venlafaxine were measured in the effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 mu g L-1 and 0.2 to 0.5 mu g L-1, respectively, which indicated to be of high potential environmental risk for the receiving river Dender, Belgium.

AB The treatment of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ibuprofen (IBU) in test solutions by ferrate(VI) was investigated in this study. A series of jar test was performed in bench-scale at pH 6-9 and ferrate(VI) dose of 1-5 mg L-1. Results demonstrated that ferrate(VI) removed CIP from test solutions efficiently, with above 70% of reduction under study conditions. In contrary, the removal rates of IBU were very low, less than 25% in all conditions. Raising ferrate(VI) dose improved the treatment performance, while the influence of solution pH was not significant at pH 6-9 compared with that of ferrate(VI) dose. In addition, kinetic studies of ferrate(VI) with both compounds were carried out at pH 8 and pH 9 (20 degrees C). Ferrate(VI) had a much higher reactivity with CIP than IBU at pH 8 and pH 9, with CIP's apparent second-order rate constants of 113.7 +/- 6.3 M-1 s(-1) and 64.1 +/- 1.0 M(-1)s(-1), respectively. The rate constants of ferrate(VI) with IBU were less than 0.2 M-1 s(-1) at 8 and pH 9. Furthermore, seven oxidation products (OPs) were formed during CIP degradation by ferrate(VI). The attack on the piperazinyl ring of the CIP by ferrate(VI) appeared to lead to the cleavage or hydroxylation of the rings, and the attack on the quinolone moiety by ferrate(VI) might lead to the cleavage of the double bond at the six-member heterocyclic ring. No OPs of IBU were detected during ferrate(VI) oxidation due to very small part of IBU was degraded by ferrate(VI). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen is one of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the world. It was measured at different concentration levels in environmental water. Since naproxen can be exposed to UV light during water and wastewater treatment, an investigation was conducted to identify photolysis rate and transformation product formation during photolysis in the presence of photosensitizers. Different experiments were carried out to identify the effect of dissolved organic matter and NO3- to photolysis reactions of naproxen. Naproxen was measured and transformation products were detected using liquid chromatograph coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. MassBank libraries were used to propose transformation product molecular structures. During direct photolysis experiments pseudo first order degradation kinetic constant k(obs) was found as 0.121min(-1). k(obs) decreased to 0.068min(-1) during indirect photolysis experiments. While presence of dissolved organic matter decreases photolysis rate, NO3- accelerates the degradation of naproxen. Benzyl succinic acid and caffeic acid were proposed as potential transformation products of naproxen along with an unidentified transformation product having 177m/z. All potential transformation products of naproxen proposed in this study were identified for the first time in the literature.

AB High-pressure membrane processes, including nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, allow for the removal of a wide range of organic micropollutants (including pharmaceutical compounds) from water streams. Those processes also may be an effective method for in-depth treatment of water containing pharmaceutical compounds. The paper presents a comparison of retention of selected pharmaceuticals from the group of non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs, ie ibuprofen and diclofenac and psychotropic drugs carbamazepine, present in various aqueous matrices in the nanofiltration process. Deionized water based solutions as well as model and real wastewater effluents after biological treatment processes were subjected to the filtration process. The nanofiltration process was carried out in a cross-flow tubular membrane filtration system. Three polyamide membranes AFC30, AFC40 and AFC80 from PCI Membrane System Inc were used. It has been found, that the retention of pharmaceutical compounds increased with the membrane filtration time, regardless of the composition of the treated aqueous matrix. Moreover, the presence of inorganic compounds and high-molecular organic substances had a positive effect on the membrane separation process of micropollutants.

AB The very wide range of activities performed in hospitals (care, diagnosis, hygiene, maintenance, research) require the use of a large variety of potentially ecotoxic substances such as surfactants, metals, disinfectants and pharmaceuticals. This study aimed to determine oxidative stress in the common carp Cyprinus carpio induced by hospital wastewater (HWW) in Mexico. The median lethal concentration (LC50) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed to the latter value (0.5 %) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxide content (HPC), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, protein carbonyl content (PCC) and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Significant increases in HPC, MDA content and PCC were observed in exposed specimens, particularly in gill, liver and brain. SOD and CAT activity also increased in liver and brain.

AB Various cathodes (Ti/RuO2, stainless steel, WC/TiC) and anodes (Ti/RuO2, stainless steel) were used to find appropriate catalytic material applicable at room temperature for wastewater electrolysis. Performance of Ti/RuO2 as a cathode for hydrogen production from contaminated water at low current density having pharmaceutically active compounds was found to be competitive. Stability of Ti/RuO2 as an anode as well as a cathode was found to be satisfactory. Use of kaolin seems to apparently increase the hydrogen production, which is not documented in any previous research.

AB Fate and occurrence of 4 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, one serotonin-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor and one noradrenergic-dopamineric reuptake inhibitor and their human metabolites were determined in a German municipal wastewater treatment plant as well as in the Rhine River and selected tributaries. The enantiomeric fractions of venlafaxine and its metabolites were not altered during wastewater treatment and were similar in all river samples underlining that no appreciable biodegradation occurs. In the Rhine catchment area highest concentrations were detected for venlafaxine, citalopram and their human metabolites. Projected future climate change would lead to an increased portion of treated wastewater in rivers due to reduced discharges during low flow situations by the end of the 21st century. However, the effect of climate change on the pattern and concentrations of antidepressants is predicted to be of minor importance in comparison to altered consumption quantities caused by demographic developments and changes in life styles.

AB The occurrence, fate, geographical and seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of eleven of the most consumed pharmaceuticals in Portugal were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) influents and (WWI) and effluents (WWE). WWI and WWE samples, from two sampling campaigns (spring and summer), in 2013, were evaluated in 15 different WWTPs across the country, by solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (LC-MS-MS).
   Lipid regulators were the most frequently found in WWI and WWE (184.1 and 22.3 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), followed by anti-inflammatories (1339.4 and 15.0 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), and antibiotics (330.7 and 68.6 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). Anxiolytics were the least detected with 3.3 and 3.4 mg/day/1000 inhab. in WWI and WWE, respectively.
   The mass loads, both in WWI and WWE, were higher in summer than those found during the spring season, being remarkable the high values registered in a region where population triplicates in this time of the year. The mean removal efficiency achieved was of 94.5%, nonetheless, between the different therapeutic groups, as well as within each group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100%. In the summer higher efficiencies were observed regarding lipid regulators and antibiotics.
   Furthermore, an important outcome was the evaluation, by means of risk quotients (RQs), of the potential ecotoxicological risk posed by the selected pharmaceuticals to different aquatic organisms, exposed to the effluents studied. Ciprofloxacin, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, simvastatin and diclofenac showed RQs higher than one, being expected that these pharmaceuticals might pose a threat to the three trophic levels (algae, daphnids and fish) evaluated. These results highlight the importance of these monitoring studies, as required by the Directive 2013/39/EU, in order to minimize their aquatic environmental contamination and support future prioritization measures.

AB We investigated the ozonation of the antineoplastic drugs cyclophosphamide (CP), ifosfamide (IF), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and of the vasodilator pentoxifylline (PEN) in distilled water, in pharmaceutical wastewater, and in hospital effluent at pH 5-11. Under an alkaline pH of 11, all of the target compounds rapidly degraded through the attack of hydroxyl radicals, which resulted in their complete removal within 5 min at an ozone supply rate of 3 g O-3/h. Under acidic pH conditions, such as pH 5.6, CP and IF exhibited slower removal rates; however, compounds with unsaturated C-C bonds, such as 5-FU and PEN, were still removed at rapid rates under acidic conditions. Although the parent compounds were removed within minutes, the resulting ozonation byproducts were resistant to further ozonation and possessed increased Microtox acute toxicity. In distilled water, the resulting ozonation products exhibited minimal mineralization but high acute toxicity, whereas in naturally buffered pharmaceutical and hospital effluents, the byproducts were more amenable to removal and detoxification.

AB From a list of the top prescribed drugs in Canada, 11 pharmaceuticals and two metabolites were selected for study in municipal sewage treatment plant effluents and receiving waters. Wastewater samples were collected from 16 wastewater treatment plants across Southwest Nova Scotia including the Annapolis Valley, South Shore, and Metropolitan Halifax. Samples were also collected between 100 and 200 m downstream of effluent outflows. Seven pharmaceuticals were found above mu g/L levels with their highest concentrations as follows: metformin (10.6 mu g/L), acetaminophen (28.9 mu g/L), paraxanthine (18.2 mu g/L), cotinine (3.10 mu g/L), caffeine (115 mu g/L), naproxen (29.1 mu g/L), and venlafaxine (2.65 mu g/L). Metformin, paraxanthine, caffeine, naproxen, ramipril, and venlafaxine were detected in every wastewater effluent sample. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in pharmaceutical occurrence by treatment methods, weak dependence of pharmaceutical concentrations on populations, and the co-occurrence of some pharmaceuticals. Experimental results might indicate the limitation of primary only treatment methods in breaking down pharmaceuticals.

AB An experimental study of the homogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton degradation of 4-amidophenol (paracetamol, PCT) is presented. For all the operation conditions evaluated, PCT degradation is efficiently attained by both Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. Also, photonic efficiencies of PCT degradation and mineralization are determined under different experimental conditions, characterizing the influence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Fe(II) on both contaminant degradation and sample mineralization. The maximum photonic degradation efficiencies for 5 and 10 mg L-1 Fe(II) were 3.9 (H2O2 = 189 mg L-1) and 5 (H2O2 = 378 mg L-1), respectively. For higher concentrations of oxidant, H2O2 acts as a "scavenger" radical, competing in pollutant degradation and reducing the reaction rate. Moreover, in order to quantify the consumption of the oxidizing agent, the specific consumption of the hydrogen peroxide was also evaluated. For all operating conditions of both hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II) concentration, the consumption values obtained for Fenton process were always higher than the corresponding values observed for photo-Fenton. This implies a less efficient use of the oxidizing agent for dark conditions.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as one of the most important sources of antibiotics in the environment. The occurrence, seasonal variation and removal efficiency of 21 antibiotics and 10 metabolites, including five sulfonamides and three of their metabolites, six quinolones, two macrolides, two beta-Lactams and five tetracyclines and seven of their metabolites, were investigated in five WWTPs in different seasons in the Jiulongjiang River Region, South China. 16 antibiotics and 6 metabolites in summer and 14 antibiotics and 6 metabolites in winter were found, respectively. The most frequently detected antibiotics were sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, n-acetyl sulfamethazine, n-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, cephalexin monohydrate and cephradine; of these, the concentration of cephradine was the highest in most of the influent and effluent samples. The highest level of total antibiotics was found in Longyan City WWTPs, where there are more population and swine farms. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in wastewater samples was also studied. The concentrations of antibiotics in winter were higher than those in summer. The antibiotics could not be removed completely by the WWTPs, and the mean removal efficiency ranged from -71.6 to 56.3%. Of all the antibiotics, the tetracyclines were removed comparatively more efficiently, probably due to their adsorption to sludge. The low removal efficiency of antibiotics in WWTPs could be one of the important reasons for the presence of antibiotics in the environment in Jiulongjiang Region.

AB The occurrence, fate and environmental impact of 30 pharmaceuticals including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, b-blockers, antiepileptics, lipid regulators, and stimulants were studied in two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in Wuxi City, East China. A total of 23 pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater samples, with a maximum concentration of 16.1 mg L-1 (caffeine) in the influent and 615.5 ng L-1 (azithromycin) in the effluent; 19 pharmaceuticals were detected in sludge samples at concentrations up to 12.13 mg kg(-1), with ofloxacin, azithromycin and norfloxacin being the predominant species. Mass balance analysis showed that biodegradation primarily accounted for the removal of sulfonamides, most of the macrolides, and other miscellaneous pharmaceuticals, while adsorption onto the sludge was the primary removal pathway for fluoroquinolones, tetracylines, and azithromycin during biological treatment. The total mass loads of target pharmaceuticals per capita in the two WWTPs were in the ranges of 2681.84333.3, 248.0-416.6 and 214.6-374.5 mg per day per inhabitant in the influent, effluent and dewatered sludge, respectively. The upgraded Plant A adopting the combined anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and moving bed biofilm process exhibited a much higher removal of target pharmaceuticals than the conventional Plant B adopting the C-Orbal oxidation ditch process. The concentration levels of sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin in the effluent, ofloxacin in the sludge, and the mixture of all target pharmaceuticals in both effluent and sludge posed a high risk to algae in aquatic environments.

AB Sewage sludge sorption and desorption measurements were conducted for nine diverse contaminants of varying polarity: caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, atrazine, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, diclofenac, and, for the first time desethylatrazine and norethindrone. Two types of sorption behaviour were observed. Compounds with a log octanol-water partition coefficient, log K-ow, below 3 showed little or no sorption over 48 hours of shaking, while compounds with log K-ow over 3 showed 30 to 90% sorption within the first few minutes. After 6 hours of shaking, mass loss through suspected biotransformation became evident for some compounds. At the pH range considered (5.7-6.7), diclofenac (p(Ka) 4.0, log K-ow 4.5) was the only compound in which pH dependent sorption could be quantified. The log sewage sludge-water distribution coefficients, log K-d, ranged from 0.2 to 2.9, and, as expected, increased with increasing log K-ow of the compound and organic carbon (OC) content of the sewage sludge. A sewage sludge precipitated with alum had a substantially lower K-d values, as well as lower OC content, compared to alum-free sludge. Desorption was studied by sequentially replacing supernatant water. With each water replacement, log K-d values tended to either remain similar (following a linear isotherm) or in some cases increase (following a Freundlich-type isotherm). The length of time required to restore equilibrium increased with each rinsing step. A literature review of reported K-d values compared well with the alum-free sludge data, but not the alum-sludge data. Sewage sludge K-d across the literature appear more consistent with increasing K-ow.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 22 antibiotics, including eight fluoroquinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, were investigated in the urban surface waters in Beijing, China. A total of 360 surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area of Beijing monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely used and extensively distributed in the surface water of Beijing, and sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were the predominant antibiotics with the average concentrations of 136 and 132 ng L-1, respectively. A significant difference of antibiotic concentrations from different sampling sites was observed, and the southern and eastern regions of Beijing showed higher concentrations of antibiotics. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in the urban surface water was also studied, and the highest level of antibiotics was found in November, which may be due to the low temperature and flow of the rivers during the period of cold weather. Risk assessment showed that several antibiotics might pose high ecological risks to aquatic organisms (algae and plants) in surface water, and more attention should be paid to the risk of antibiotics to the aquatic environment in Beijing.

AB The results of a characterisation study of water samples collected from an Advanced Water Recycling Plant (AWRP) operating in Perth, Western Australia are presented. The AWRP treats secondary wastewater by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) to produce recycled water for groundwater replenishment. Water samples collected after RO and UV treatment were characterised by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, using an established protocol for target screening. The target screening of 291 compounds detected a total of 13 chemicals in post-RO and post-UV water, including 2 corrosion inhibitors (4+5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, benzotriazole), 3 pesticides (metolachlor, propiconazol, prosulfocarb), 3 pharmaceuticals (lamotrigin, metformin, tramadol), 1 personal care product (galaxalidone), 3 artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame, sucralose) and 1 flame retardant (triethyl phosphate). The corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and 4+5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, and the pharmaceutical metformin were detected in hundreds of ng L-1, while the other compounds were present in low ng L-1 concentrations. Analysis of UV treated water samples showed that UV treatment also helped to reduced UV degradable compounds such as the corrosion inhibitors (>50% removal), triethyl phosphate (similar to 50% removal) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (similar to 95% removal). Overall, the detection of 13 chemicals through target screening analyses did not account for the residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in post RO water, the majority of which is still an intriguing unknown. However, the target screening did show that there were no obvious "known" anthropogenic contaminants contributing to the majority of the DOC in post-RO and post-UV treated water. Calculated risk quotients (RQ) for all detected chemicals in UV treated water were 2 to 6 order of magnitude below 1, implying an high degree of safety associated with human consumption of recycled water. Overall the chemicals screening provided further evidence of the overall safety of the use of recycled wastewater treated by RO and UV as a potable water source.

AB Dyes are synthetically aromatic compounds used in various industries such as textile, plastics, pharmaceutical, paper, paint and food. The quality and quantity of wastewaters from these industries are a matter of concern for human health and environmental pollution.
   Different conventional methods have been developed for dye removal. However, due to the complex structure and recalcitrant nature of dyes, these methods appear to be ineffective in their complete removal.
   Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been considered as a promising alternative to treat wastewater containing dye residues. These processes are based on the production of highly reactive radicals, especially hydroxyl radicals, which promote destruction of the target pollutant until mineralization.
   This chapter addresses AOPs for removal of dyes from aqueous media by presenting background on advanced oxidation processes. The AOPs will be investigated in two categories: Nonphotochemical and Photochemical Processes. Among these processes, the main focus will be on ozonation, Fenton's reagent oxidation, wet air oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation, with only brief information given on electrochemical oxidation, ultraviolet irradiation and hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and photocatalytic ozonation (UV/O-3) processes.

AB Rotating biological contactors (RBC) are effective for treating wastewater, while they are rarely reported to be used for treating antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater (APW). The current study investigates treatment of APW using an RBC. The effects of influent concentration, number of stages, and temperature on the remediation of APW were studied. The results indicated, even at low ambient temperature, 45% COD and 40% NH4+-N removal efficiencies. Moreover, the BOD5 removal efficiency was 85%. Microscopic observations illustrated that there were various active microorganisms displayed in the biofilms and their distribution changed from stage to stage. Compared with activated sludge, the biofilms in this study have higher content of dry matter and are easier to dehydrate and settle. Compared with current commercial incineration processes or advanced oxidation processes, RBC can greatly reduce the treatment cost. This research shows RBC is effective for such an inherently biorecalcitrant wastewater even at low ambient temperature.

AB Despite efforts to upgrade sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the last decades, STPs are still a major source for the contamination of surface waters, including emerging pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Because many of these substances are not completely removed in conventional STPs they are regularly detected in surface waters where they have the potential to affect local macroinvertebrate communities. The objective of the current work was to investigate the impact of an estrogenic wastewater effluent on the key life-history traits of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex. G. pulex was exposed in artificial indoor flow-channels under constant conditions to different wastewater concentrations (0%, 33%, 66%, 100%). In parallel the estrogenic activity of wastewater samples was determined using the yeast estrogen screen (YES). Estrogenic activities in the STP effluent were up to 38.6ng/L estradiol equivalents (EEQ). Amphipods exhibited an increasing body length with increasing wastewater concentrations. Furthermore, we observed a shift of the sex ratio in favour of females, a significantly increased fraction of brooding females and increased fecundity indices with increasing wastewater concentrations. The increased body length is likely to be attributed to the additional nutrient supply while the occurrence of EDCs in the wastewater is the probable cause for the altered sex ratio and fecundity in exposed Gammarus cohorts.

AB Purpose - Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and phosphorus are pollutants that can cause a wide array of negative environmental impacts. Phosphorus is a regulated pollutant in many industrial countries, while PPCPs are widely unregulated. Many technologies designed to remove phosphorus from wastewater can remove PPCPs, therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of these technologies to also reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through meta-analysis, the authors use the PPCPs' risk quotient (RQ) to measure and compare the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment technologies. The RQ data are then applied via a case study that uses phosphorus effluent regulations to determine the ability of the recommended technologies to also mitigate PPCPs.
   Findings - The tertiary membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration processes recommended to remove phosphorus can reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 71 and 81 percent, respectively. The ultrafiltration technology was estimated to reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 28 percent with no cost in addition to the costs expected under the current phosphorus effluent regulations. RQ reduction is expected with a membrane bioreactor and the cost of upgrading to this technology was found to be $11.76 per capita/year.
   Practical implications - The authors discuss the management implications, including watershed management, alternative PPCPs reduction strategies, and water quality trading.
   Originality/value - The evaluation of the co-management of priority and emerging pollutants illuminates how the removal of regulated pollutants from wastewater could significantly reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.

AB The residual effluent from the corn tortilla industry, referred to as Nejayote in Mexico, causes serious pollution problems because of its high chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, as this effluent contains valuable corn phytochemicals, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives, it also represents an opportunity to produce high-added-value biocompounds. In this work, we addressed environmental and biosynthetic approaches by applying laccase oxidative treatment in the presence of chitosan to reduce the environmental impact of the effluents from the tortilla industry. A central composite design pattern was used to understand the relationship between several variables (pH, temperature, reaction time, and enzyme quantity) and two responses (removal of ferulic acid derivatives and COD decrease). The optimum conditions for maximizing both responses were pH 6, 35 degrees C, 24 h, and 0.3025 nmoles laccase, which resulted in 70 and 78% decreases in phenolics and COD, respectively. UV-vis, fluorescence and FTIR analyses revealed enzymatic grafting of chitosan with phenolics from the effluent. Grafted chitosan presented a higher capacity to scavenge DPPH radicals (EC50 1.9 mg/mL) than neat chitosan (EC50 2.5 mg/mL) and higher viscosity values. The obtained results indicate that a process involving a single enzymatic step could be adequate to decrease the effluent COD and to generate polymers with potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

AB The fate of trace tetracycline, tetracycline resistant bacteria (TRB) and tetracycline resistant genes (TRGs) in an improved anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was investigated in this study. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and conventional heterotrophic plate count method were used to measure eight tet genes (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetE, tetM, tetO, tetS and tetX) and TRB, respectively. The TRB percent of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) is about 1.31-24.1% in WWTP influent. Tet gene abundance in the WWTP varied greatly among the gene types. The concentrations of TRGs in effluent samples ranged from 7.11 x 10(-9) to 1.53 x 10(-4) copies/copy 16S rRNA gene. TRB and THB, tetM and tetO, tetE and tetX, but not the others, showed a significant correlation with each other (p < 0.01). The relationships between ribosomal protection protein genes, enzymatic modification gene and corresponding concentrations of antibiotics were found to be considerably significant (R-2 = 0.898, p < 0.01 for ribosomal protection protein genes and R-2 = 0.872, p < 0.05 for enzymatic modification gene).

AB Diclofenac represents one of the most common pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. To enhance the removal of diclofenac from water, a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was introduced into a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF)-67. CTAB is added originally to minimize the use of ligands during the synthesis of ZIF-67; however CTAB present in ZIF-67 also increases the surface charge and thus enhances the adsorption capacity up to 10 times compared to CTAB-free ZIF-67. Factors influencing the diclofenac adsorption are investigated, including CTAB loading, temperature and pH. A loading of 0.274 mol-CTAB/mol-Co2+ is suggested as an optimal loading to prepare a relatively efficient CTAB-ZIF-67, while over loading of CTAB could not fully incorporate CTAB into ZIF-67. In view of the diclofenac adsorption kinetics and isotherm, the adsorption of diclofenac to CTAB-ZIF-67 was considered to involve a strong affinity between diclofenac and CTAB-ZIF-67 owing to the electrostatic attraction between the carboxylic acid of diclofenac and the quaternary amine of CTAB. Considering that the removal of diclofenac from urine is of great interest, separation of diclofenac from urine using CTAB-ZIF-67 was evaluated and also employed to investigate the effect of co-existing ions. We also determined the desorption behavior of diclofenac from CTAB-ZIF-67 to provide insight for the recyclability of CTAB-ZIF-67 for diclofenac adsorption.

AB In the twenty-first century, energy is considered as the most important issue for human sustainability. The world's dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater effluents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of biofuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i.e., high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of biofuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable. The integration of genomics, metabolic engineering, nanotechnology, and other areas to the aforementioned issues shall lead to a wide range of benefits for the tasks demanded by the forthcoming bioenergy industries.

AB This annual review covers the literature published in 2014 on topics related to the occurrence and fate of emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater. Due to the vast amount of literature published on this topic, I have discussed only a fraction of the quality research publications, up to maximum 15 relevant articles per section, due to limitation of space. The abstract search was carried out using Web of Science, and the abstracts were selected based on their relevance. In few cases, full-text articles were referred to better understand new findings. This review is divided into the following sections: biological agents, disinfection by-products (DBPs), halogenated compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other emerging contaminants.

AB The occurrence of 43 pharmaceuticals and 2 metabolites of ibuprofen was evaluated at the inlet and the outlet of a pressure sewer pipe in order to asses if in-sewer processes affect the pharmaceutical concentrations during their pass through the pipe. The target compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few mu g/L, which are in the range commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i.e. from -10 to 10%. A higher decrease in concentrations (25-60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (-66 +/- 15%) and irbesartan (-58 +/- 25%), which may be due to the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer. The results show that microbial transformation of pharmaceuticals begins in sewer, albeit to different extents for different compounds. Therefore, the in-sewer transformation of pharmaceuticals should be assessed especially when their concentrations are used to estimate and refine the estimation of their per capita consumption in a catchment of interest in the sewage epidemiology approach.

AB Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption of 30 environmentally relevant micro-pollutants (MP) from four surface waters was investigated at the pilot-scale with empty bed contact times (EBCTs) of 7 and 15 min. An increase in background dissolved organic matter resulted in more and earlier MP breakthrough. Compared to an EBCT of 7 min, MP breakthrough at an EBCT of 15 min demonstrated 52% later breakthrough on average for five MPs on a throughput basis. A regression model was developed with data from three waters to predict MP throughput in bed volumes to 10% breakthrough (BV10%) based on the influent dissolved organic carbon concentration and the MP pH-dependent octanol-water partition coefficient, polarizability, and molecular volume. The regression model over predicted full-scale BV10% values when applied to a wastewater-water impacted water source and to GAC with a larger particle diameter, for which a particle size adjustment was able to account for most of the difference.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as units designed for the efficient removal of organic matter and nutrients from polluted wastewaters, avoiding their discharge into the environment. Despite these benefits, they have also been found to be highly energy intensive, with consequent increased emissions in terms of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. Therefore, it has become imperative to monitor thoroughly the overall functioning of WWTPs from an integrated perspective with the aim of understanding how these can improve their eco-efficiency. In this case study, a group of 113 WWTPs located in regions across Spain were analysed using the methodology that combines life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The aim of this work was to determine the operational efficiency of each unit in order to obtain environmental benchmarks for inefficient plants. Thereafter, the environmental gains linked with the inputs reduction proposed for the DEA model for each unit were computed in order to verify eco-efficiency criteria. The operational complexity of WWTPs resulted in several identified factors affecting their efficiency which are discussed in depth, including the size of the facility, the climatic influence, the influent load and the over- or underuse of the plant.

AB This research was carried out on a full-scale pure oxygen thermophilic plant, operated and monitored throughout a period of 11 years. The plant treats 60,000 t y(-1) (year 2013) of high-strength industrial wastewaters deriving mainly from pharmaceuticals and detergents production and landfill leachate. Three different plant configurations were consecutively adopted: (1) biological reactor i final clarifier and sludge recirculation (2002-2005); (2) biological reactor + ultrafiltration: membrane biological reactor (MBR) (2006); and (3) MBR + nanofiltration (since 2007). Progressive plant upgrading yielded a performance improvement chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was enhanced by 17% and 12% after the first and second plant modification, respectively. Moreover, COD abatement efficiency exhibited a greater stability, notwithstanding high variability of the influent load. In addition, the following relevant outcomes appeared from the plant monitoring (present configuration): up to 96% removal of nitrate and nitrite, due to denitrification; low-specific biomass production (0.092 kg(VSS) kgCOD(removed)(-1)), and biological treatability of residual COD under mesophilic conditions (BOD5/COD ratio = 0.25-0.50), thus showing the complementarity of the two biological processes.

AB An analytical method was developed and validated for the target screening of triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC) and its lesser and higher chlorinated congeners namely, 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (3-Cl-TCC) and 2,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (2-Cl-TCC) in river sediment. Sediment samples were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction and quantification and identification of target compounds were carried by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The overall method recoveries were 89% with relative standard deviations below 6%. Method detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 ng/g. The usefulness of the method was demonstrated on sediment samples collected downstream of three wastewater treatment plants in an attempt to provide with a set of occurrence data of these biocides in France and for a better understanding of their fate in river. Major results are the following: TCC, DCC and 3-Cl-TCC were ubiquitously detected demonstrating that these emerging contaminants have been probably overlooked in France. Reductive dechlorination of TCC into DCC was also ubiquitous but predominated in anoxic sediment. 3-Cl-TCC is probably more persistent than TCC and LC-HRMS enabled the detection and identification of a suite of other chlorinated biocides in river sediment.

AB The aim of this study was the development of analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, metabolites, and pesticides, belonging to the various chemical classes, in river sediments and their corresponding surface and ground water with the purpose of monitoring the contamination levels. The methods were based on the solid-phase extraction as the sample preparation method for water samples, and the ultrasonic solvent extraction for the sediment samples, followed by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High recoveries were achieved for extraction from both water and sediment samples for the majority of analytes. Low limits of detection were achieved for all investigated compounds in the water sample (1-5 ng L-1) as well as in the sediment (1-3 ng g(-1)). Applicability of the developed methods was demonstrated by determination of pharmaceutical and pesticide residues in 30 surface water, 44 groundwater, and 5 sediment samples from the Danube River Basin in Serbia. Sixty percent of target compounds were detected in environmental samples. The most frequently detected analytes in river sediments were the pesticides dimethoate and atrazine, while carbamazepine and metamizole metabolites 4-AAA and 4-FAA were the most frequently found in water samples.

AB The environmental fate of organic waste-derived trace organic contaminants is a recent focus of research. Public awareness of this issue and concern about the potential risks are increasing, partly as a result of this research. Knowledge remains sparse but, due to growing waste volumes and contaminant concentrations, situations are arising where decisions are urgently needed and the stakes are high. We present an approach to provide stakeholders with the soundest possible information on relevant risks in specific situations where local experimental data are scarce or inexistent. With accuracy taking precedence over precision in such situations, the quantitative fate assessment aspect of the approach considers uncertainty at all levels in order to estimate best-to-worst-case (cumulative uncertainty) fuzzy fate ranges. The approach was applied to conditions that prevail on the island of Reunion. Contrasting possible organic residue recycling scenarios are considered in which trace organic contaminants originate either from pig slurry or sewage sludge. The stakeholders' concerns targeted are leaching, soil persistence and crop (sugarcane) shoot translocation. The fate assessment results in soil removal dynamics that vary over a wide range, even for a particular chemical in a particular scenario. For 3 out of 27 chemicals residual soil concentrations after one sugarcane crop cycle could possibly exceed the 100 ng/g dry weight mass fraction range, only in a worst case situation. Substances predicted to be of the highest mobility (erythromycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) might produce appreciable leaching only in the event of substantial rainfall shortly after a high rate decadal application. And only the higher bound sugarcane shoot concentration estimates of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and tris(chloropropyl)phosphate are significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic UV filters are common ingredients of personal care products (PCPs), but little is known about their distribution in and potential impacts to the marine environment. This study reports the occurrence and risk assessment of twelve widely used organic UV filters in surface water collected in eight cities in four countries (China, the United States, Japan, and Thailand) and the North American Arctic. The number of compounds detected, Hong Kong (12), Tokyo (9), Bangkok (9), New York (8), Los Angeles (8), Arctic (6), Shantou (5) and Chaozhou (5), generally increased with population density. Median concentrations of all detectable UV filters were <250 ng/L. The presence of these compounds in the Arctic is likely due to a combination of inadequate wastewater treatment and long-range oceanic transport. Principal component analysis (PCA) and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to explore spatiotemporal patterns and difference in organic UV filter levels in Hong Kong. In general, spatial patterns varied with sampling month and all compounds showed higher concentrations in the wet season except benzophenone-4 (BP-4). Probabilistic risk assessment showed that 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) posed greater risk to algae, while benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) were more likely to pose a risk to fishes and also posed high risk of bleaching in hard corals in aquatic recreational areas in Hong Kong. This study is the first to report the occurrence of organic UV filters in the Arctic and provides a wider assessment of their potential negative impacts in the marine environment.

AB The partitioning of pharmaceuticals in the environment can be assessed by measuring their adsorption coefficients (K-d) between aqueous and solid phases. Measuring this coefficient in sewage sludge gives an indication of their partitioning behaviour in a wastewater treatment plant and hence contributes to an understanding of their subsequent fate. The regulatory approved method for measuring K-d in sewage sludge is the US Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) guideline 835.1110, which is labour intensive and time consuming. We describe an alternative method for measuring the K-d of pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge using a modified solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique. SPE cartridges were packed at different sludge/PTFE ratios (0.4, 6.0, 24.0 and 40.0% w/w sludge) and eluted with phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The approach was tested initially using three pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, diclofenac and oxytetracycline) that covered a range of K values. Subsequently, the sorption behaviour of ten further pharmaceuticals with varying physico-chemical properties was evaluated. Results from the SPE method were comparable to those of the OPPTS test, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 between the two approaches. SPE cartridges packed with sludge and PTFE were stable for up to one year; use within one month reduced variability in measurements (to a maximum of 0.6 log units). The SPE method is low-cost, easy to use and enables the rapid measurement of K-d values for a large number of chemicals. It can be used as an alternative to the more laborious full OPPTS test in environmental fate studies and risk assessments. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Atenolol is a beta-blocker that can be found in urban wastewaters and which is not removed efficiently by conventional wastewater treatments. In the present study, electro-Fenton (EF) process was used to assess the degradation and mineralization of pharmaceutical atenolol in aqueous solutions. Electrolyses of 250 mL of atenolol solution (0.17 mM), at initial pH 3, were carried out in an undivided electrolytic cell in galvanostatic mode. Influence of material cathode (graphite, stainless steel, and platinized titanium), applied current (100-500 mA), sulfate dosage (0.01-0.5 M), and catalyst ferrous ions concentration (1-10 mM), on the oxidation efficiency was studied. Atenolol mineralization was monitored by COD dosage. Kinetic analysis indicated that atenolol mineralization followed a pseudo-first order model and the rate constant increased with rising current, ferrous ions concentration (up to 5 mM) and electrolyte concentration. Results showed that graphite cathode, 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, 0.3 A and 5 mM FeSO4 catalyst were the best conditions for atenolol mineralization. In these optimal conditions, after 240 min more than 87% of the initial COD was removed. The corresponding current efficiency (CE) and specific energy consumption (SEC) were 22.33% and 0.194 kWh/kg COD, respectively. This latter corresponds to 0.078 kWh/m(3) of treated wastewater.

ID COOLING PROCESS; LAYOUT; DECOMPOSITION
AB Vacuum distillation techniques are widely used in food, biological, pharmaceutical, and wastewater treatment industries. Because of its operation at low temperatures, vacuum distillation prevents the thermal decomposition of materials and alleviates corrosion processes; however, condenser size can be dramatically increased because of reductions in mean temperature differences under the vacuum operation. In batch vacuum distillation processes, vapor generation rate and mean temperature differences are changed with time. In view of these characteristics of batch operation, this paper suggests a novel methodology to minimize the condenser size in batch vacuum distillation processes. The target process is a sulfuric acid recycling system in semiconductor manufacturing plants. In this paper, an equation-oriented dynamic model is established and optimization problem is formulated. By solving the nonlinear programming problem, the condenser size is dramatically reduced when operation time is fixed. In contrast, operation time is greatly shortened when the installed condenser surface area is fixed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Amoxicillin degradation with and without high frequency ultrasound waves of 2.4 MHz has been investigated. The concentration of amoxicillin was selected to be similar to that of outlet wastewater effluent concentration in pharmaceutical industry namely 50 and 100 ppm. The application of ultrasound waves together with the addition of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 increased the rate of degradation of antibiotic amoxicillin. The doses of H2O2 used were 5, 2, 1, and 0.1 ml in a solution of 50 ml of amoxicillin. The study showed that ultrasound waves and H2O2 had improved amoxicillin degradation. The ultrasound has improved the degradation rate more than two times in comparison to amoxicillin solution without ultrasound waves. This degradation rate has been achieved within 90 minutes.

AB Sertraline ("Zoloft") is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) suspected of causing developmental abnormalities in some aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. SSRIs have been detected downstream from wastewater treatment plants, but the risks associated with environmental exposure have not been well documented. We tested the effects of sertraline on development of Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) larvae. Tadpoles hatched from wild-collected egg masses were exposed to concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mu g/L of sertraline through metamorphosis. We tracked tadpole development using image analysis (452 digital images) to estimate mass periodically during the tadpole stage, and we also recorded mass at metamorphosis. Time to metamorphosis did not differ between treatments, but sertraline-exposed tadpoles grew less when raised among conspecifics. However, this effect was not detected when the study was repeated with tadpoles raised individually. This indicates that the effects of sertraline and other SSRIs may be enhanced when tadpoles are raised under more stressful conditions.

However, they could partially reduce the turbidity associated with the cake layer formation by particulate materials on the membrane surfaces. Furthermore, most of water contaminants were completely removed by the RO membranes. Although the CC-DF process could remove approximately 20% of turbidity, the aluminium concentrations considerably increased after the CC-DF process due to the residual coagulants complexed with both carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups of EfOM. Those aluminium-EfOM complexes had a lower negative charge and higher molecular weight (>0.1 mu m pore size of the MF membranes) compared to non-complexed EfOM. These results indicate that the control of the formation of the aluminium-EfOM complexes should be considered as a key step to use the CC-DF process as a pre-treatment of the MF and RO membranes for mitigation of membrane fouling in the tested pilot plant.

AB The disposal of microfine marble sawdust contained in marble slurry waste, currently represents an additional economic burden for dimension stones companies. This is because the sawdust is considered less important in comparison with the crushed calcareous aggregate produced in stone processing plants. In addition, the sludge is mistakenly viewed as waste that has to be disposed of in landfill. State of the art in recovery and utilisation of calcareous sawdust is mainly aimed in uses as substitute for more expensive ingredient in the building sector. Moreover limestone dust, recovered from marble sawing and processing slurry, has not yet found real economically feasible industrial usage. Due to the high market value of micronised CaCO3, we study the use of limestone sawdust as functional filler in industrial products having higher added value, such as paper, rubber, paints, pharmaceuticals. Standard requirements of CaCO3 for this kind of products are very tight, especially those relating to purity level, particle size distribution and brightness. The high Calcium limestone deposit and the factories in Orosei Marble producing area (Sardinia, Italy) allow the production of high quality microfine dust. To evaluate the properties of the sawdust, several analysis were carried out to compare the results with the standard requirements of CaCO3 for paper, rubber and tyre production. The assessment concerns five different factories and it highlights the possible usage of the sawdust produced in Orosei by carrying out simple and inexpensive changes in both stone-working process and wastewater treatment. Finally, a commentary on environmental laws pertaining to the recycle of this kind of waste is also made in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the current analytical processes that are not able to measure all the pharmaceutical molecules and to the high costs and the consumption of time to sample and analyze PhACs, models to calculate Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs) have been developed. However a comparison between MECs and PECs, taking into account the methods of calculations and peculiarly the parameters included in the calculation (consumption data, pharmacokinetic parameters, elimination rate in STPs and in the environment), is necessary to assess the validity of PECs. MEC variations of sixteen target PhACs [acetaminophen (ACE), amlodipine (AML), atenolol (ATE), caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CAR), doxycycline (DOX), epoxycarbamazepine (EPO), fluvoxamine (FLU), furosemide (FUR), hydrochlorothiazide (HYD), ifosfamide (WO), losartan (LOS), pravastatin (PRA), progesterone (PROG), ramipril (RAM), trimetazidine (TRI)] have been evaluated during one hydrological cycle, from October 2011 to October 2012 and compared to PECs calculated by using an adaptation of the models proposed by Heberer and Feldmann (2005) and EMEA (2006). Comparison of PECs and MECS has been achieved for six molecules: ATE, CAR, DOX, FUR, HYD and PRA DOX, FUR and HYD present differences between PECs and MECs on an annual basis but their temporal evolutions follow the same trends. PEC evaluation for these PhACs could then be possible but need some adjustments of consumption patterns, pharmacokinetic parameters and/or mechanisms of (bio)degradation. ATE, CAR and PRA are well modeled; PECs can then be used as reliable estimation of concentrations without any reserve. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-residue analysis method was developed for the determination of penicillins in wastewater of WWTP, surface water and groundwater in Spain. The procedure involves a solid phase extraction (SPE) and the subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-QqQ-MS/MS). The SPE processes were optimized by test of cartridges, sample pH and elution solvents. ENV+ cartridge was chosen for the extraction of penicillins from different environmental samples. The best conditions for the extraction efficiency of the targets were observed at sample pH 6, by eluting solvents of methanol and acetonitrile respectively. The method has been validated by calibration curve, corresponding regression coefficient, limit of quantification and recoveries. The results showed that the recoveries of more than 90 % were presented in all the compounds, except AMOX and AMPI, which had special amino-group in the molecular structure different with others. The matrix effect was also considered in the experiment and it was concluded that different matrix effect could be found between three kinds of waters, and the low retention of AMOX and AMPI on the cartridges was attributed to the matrices interference. The real sample detection showed that the penicillins degraded fast and only AMOX appeared in the studied environmental samples. The results of toxicology test on two compounds (AMOX and AMPI) showed that bacteria V. fischeri was proved to be relatively insensitive to both targets. The decreasing order of toxicity in three environmental waters for AMOX and AMPI was: wastewater > groundwater > surface water.

AB The present study reports on the occurrence and chiral behavior of the anti-inflammatory drug (S)-naproxen (NAP)(S)-2-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propionic acidin an aquatic environment under both field and laboratory conditions. In influents and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Tama River basin (Tokyo), (S)-NAP was detected at concentrations of 0.03 mu gL(-1) to 0.43 mu gL(-1) and 0.01 mu gL(-1) to 0.11 mu gL(-1), respectively. The concentrations of a major metabolite, 6-O-desmethyl NAP (DM-NAP) were up to 0.47 mu gL(-1) and 0.56 mu gL(-1) in influents and effluents, respectively. (R)-naproxen was not detected in STP influents, although it was present in effluents, and the enantiomeric faction (= S/[S+R]) of NAP ranged from 0.88 to 0.91. Under laboratory conditions with activated sludge from STPs, rapid degradation of (S)-NAP to DM-NAP and chiral inversion of (S)-NAP to (R)-NAP were observed. During river die-away experiments, degradation and chiral inversion of NAP were extremely slow. In addition, chiral inversion of (S)-NAP to (R)-NAP was not observed during photodegradation experiments. In the river receiving STP discharge, NAP and DM-NAP concentrations reached 0.08 mu gL(-1) and 0.16 mu gL(-1), respectively. The enantiomeric faction of NAP in the river ranged from 0.84 to 0.98 and remained almost unchanged with the increasing contribution of rainfall to the river water. These results suggest that the absence and decrease of (R)-NAP in river waters could indicate the inflow of untreated sewage. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2671-2678. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB We aimed to assess the quality of a midsize river that receives agricultural and urban wastewater. Nuclear abnormalities (NA), comet assays of blood and gills, and gill histopathology were evaluated in fish Astyanax aff. paranae during the summer and winter 2011 at three sites in Parana State, Brazil: (1) a biological reserve (Rebio-reference area); (2) an agricultural site; (3) a downstream site that accumulates agricultural and urban effluents. We found the highest effects of pollutants in fish at the downstream site during the summer. The agricultural site showed an intermediate damage rate, and fish at Rebio generally had the least damage, with the exception of NA. Despite conflicting results from the biomarkers used, we observed an increase in damage associated with the accumulation of pollutants. Pesticides are probable xenobiotics in the agricultural area. Additionally, metals and substances such as pharmaceuticals and ammonia may be present at the downstream site.

AB Some organic contaminants can accumulate in organisms and cause irreversible damages in biological systems through direct or indirect toxic effects. In this study the feasibility of the electrokinetic (EK) process for the remediation of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and triclosan (TCS) in soils was studied in a stationary laboratory cell. The experiments were conducted using a silty loam soil (S2) at 0, 10 and 20 mA and a sandy soil (S3) at 0 and 10 mA. A pH control in the anolyte reservoir (pH > 13) at 10 mA was carried out using S2, too. Photo and electrodegradation experiments were also fulfilled. Results showed that ER is a viable method for the remediation of these contaminants, both through mobilization by electroosmotic flow (EOF) and electrodegradation. As EOF is very sensible to soil pH, the control in the anolyte increased EOF rate, consequently enhancing contaminants mobilization towards the cathode end. The extent of the mobilization towards the electrode end was mainly dependent on compounds solubility and octanol-water partition coefficient. In the last 24 h of experiments, BPA presented the highest mobilization rate (ca. 4 mu g min(-1)) with NP not being detected in the catholyte. At the end of all experiments the percentage of contaminants that remained in the soil ranged between 17 and 50 for S2, and between 27 and 48 for S3, with no statistical differences between treatments. The mass balance performed showed that the amount of contaminant not detected in the cell is similar to the quantity that potentially may suffer photo and electrodegradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work aims at decontaminating biologically treated domestic wastewater effluents from organic micropollutants by sulfate radical based (SO4 center dot-) homogeneous photo-Fenton involving peroxymonosulfate as an oxidant, ferrous iron (FeII)) as a catalyst and simulated solar irradiation as a light source. This oxidative system was evaluated by using several probe compounds belonging to pesticides (bifenthrin, mesotrione and clothianidin) and pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) classes and its kinetic efficiency was compared to that to the well known UV-Vis/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. Except for carbamazepine, apparent kinetic rate constants were always 10 times higher in PMS/Fe(II)/UV-Vis than in TiO2/UV-Vis system and more than 70% of total organic carbon abatement was reached in less than one hour treatment. Hydroxyl radical (OH) and SO4 center dot- reactivity was investigated using mesotrione as a probe compound through by-products identification by liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry and transformation pathways elucidation. In addition to two center dot OH based transformation pathways, a specific SSO4 center dot- transformation pathway which first involved degradation through one electron transfer oxidation processes followed by decarboxylation were probably responsible for mesotrione degradation kinetic improvement upon UV-Vis/PMS/Fe(II) system in comparison to UVVis/TiO2 system.

AB This study aims to investigate the performance of anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for removing five polycyclic musks (PCMs), which are common active ingredients of personal care and household cleaning products. A laboratory scale AnMBR system was used in this investigation. Concentrations of the PCMs in both the liquid and biosolids phase were measured to conduct a mass balance analysis and elucidate their fate during AnMBR treatment. The AnMBR was effective for removing PCMs from the aqueous phase by a combination of biotransformation and sorption onto the biosolids. However, biotransformation was observed to be the dominant removal mechanism for all five PCMs. Enantioselective analysis of the PCMs in influent, effluent and biomass samples indicated that there was negligible enantioselectivity in the removal of these PCMs. Accordingly, all enantiomers of these PCMs can be expected to be removed by AnMBR with similar efficiency.

AB This study investigated the removal of salicylic acid (SA) from aqueous solution by electro-Fenton (EF) and EF-like processes using graphite-graphite electrolytic system. Fe-0, Fe2+, Fe3+ ions were used as the Fenton reagent in the EF process and in the EF-like reactions, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ were used as the same. The effect of various operating conditions on the effectiveness of EF process was investigated. The contribution of adsorption and electro-sorption in the removal of SA was also investigated. According to the results, EF method can be used efficiently for the removal of SA by maintaining proper operating conditions. Fe2+ was confirmed to be the most efficient catalyst among the metal ions that were tested. Maximum removal efficiency of 75.13% was obtained under optimal operating conditions after 8 h of electrolysis. Even though EF-like processes are also effective for the removal of SA from aqueous solutions, EF removal of SA was observed to be more efficient for the same. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of SA solutions electrolyzed at optimal conditions was carried out. Degradation pathway was proposed from GC-MS.

AB In order to establish the environmental impact of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), good information on the level of exposure in surface waters is needed. Exposure concentrations are typically estimated using information on the usage of an API as well as removal rates in the patient, the wastewater system and in surface waters. These input data are often highly variable and difficult to obtain, so model estimates often do not agree with measurements made in the field. In this paper we present an approach which uses inverse modelling to estimate overall removal rates of pharmaceuticals at the catchment scale using a hydrological model as well as prescription and monitoring data for a few representative sites for a country or region. These overall removal rates are then used to model exposure across the broader landscape. Evaluation of this approach for APIs in surface waters across England and Wales showed good agreement between modelled exposure distributions and available monitoring data. The use of the approach, alongside estimates of predicted no-effect concentrations for the 12 study compounds, to assess risk of the APIs across the UK landscape, indicated that, for most of the compounds, risks to aquatic life were low. However, ibuprofen was predicted to pose an unacceptable risk in 49.5% of the river reaches studied. For diclofenac, predicted exposure concentrations were also compared to the Environmental Quality Standard previously proposed by the European Commission and 4.5% of river reaches were predicted to exceed this concentration. While the current study focused on pharmaceuticals, the approach could also be valuable in assessing the risks of other 'down the drain' chemicals and could help inform our understanding of the important dissipation processes for pharmaceuticals in the pathway from the patient to ecological receptors.

AB In this study, the COD removal of Azithromycin from synthetic wastewater (produced to have a composition similar to industrial wastewater) using a Fenton-like (Fe-center dot/H2O2) system in combination with coagulation has been investigated. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was selected as the main parameter to assess treatment efficacy in the current study (COD center dot = 390mg/Lequivalent to 200mg/LAzithromycin). First, the coagulation process was carried out on the synthetic wastewater and the optimum conditions were determined and calculated. According to the results of this experiment, Poly Aluminum Chloride (PAX-18) was selected as the most appropriate coagulant. The results of the coagulation process indicated that COD removal efficacy under the optimum conditions of PAX-18 100mg/Land pH 7.0 was 82.14%. Then, a Fenton-like oxidation process was performed on the effluent of the coagulation process. The optimum conditions were determined and calculated for the Fenton-like process: [Fe-center dot] = 0.36 mM/l, [H2O2]= 0.38 mM/l, and [pH]= 7.0. Finally, in combined treatment (coagulation and the Fenton-like process together), the COD removal rose to 96.89% under optimum conditions. The findings of this study demonstrate that the combined processes of coagulation and Fenton-like oxidation under optimum conditions can play an important role in the COD removal of Azithromycin from industrial wastewater.

AB This paper demonstrates how occurrence, transport and fate of pharmaceuticals at trace levels can be assessed when modelling wastewater treatment systems using two case studies. Firstly, two approaches based on: 1) phenomenology; and, 2) Markov Chains, are developed to describe the dynamics of pharmaceuticals with or without clear administration patterns. Additional simulations also show that sewer conditions might have an important effect on the behaviour of the generated compounds and their metabolites. The results demonstrate that different operating conditions in wastewater treatment plants can have opposite effects on the studied pharmaceuticals, especially when they present co-metabolic or inhibitory behaviour in the presence of biodegradable substrate. Finally, the paper ends with: i) a critical discussion of the presented results; ii) a thorough analysis of the limitations of the proposed approach; and, iii) future pathways to improve the overall modelling of micropollutants.

AB The present work aims at evaluating the ability of the River Tiber natural microbial community to degrade naproxen in water samples collected downstream from a wastewater treatment plant. For this purpose, different water microcosms were set up (microbiologically active vs sterile ones) and treated with naproxen (100 mu g/L) alone or in the co-presence of gemfibrozil in order to evaluate if the co-presence of the latter had an influence on naproxen degradation. The experiment was performed in the autumn and was compared with the same experimental set performed in spring of the same year to highlight if seasonal differences in the river water influenced the naproxen degradation. Pharmaceutical concentrations and microbial analysis (total cell number, viability, and microbial community composition) were performed at different times in the degradation experiments. The overall results show that the natural microbial community in the river water had a key role in the naproxen degradation. In fact, although there was a transient negative effect on the natural microbial community in all the experiments (3 h after adding the pharmaceutical), the latter was able to degrade naproxen within about 40 days. On the contrary, no decrease in the pharmaceutical concentration was observed in the sterile river water. Moreover, the co-presence of the two drugs lengthened the naproxen lag phase. As regards the natural microbial community composition detected by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization, Alpha and Gamma-Proteobacteria increased when the pharmaceutical halved, suggesting their role in the degradation. This study shows that with the concentration studied, naproxen was degraded by the natural microbial populations collected from a river chronically contaminated by this pharmaceutical.

AB The occurrence and removal of 13 antibiotics were investigated in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced wastewater treatment processes in Beijing, China. Most of the target antibiotics were detected in the secondary and tertiary effluents, with the concentrations of 4.8-1106.0 and 0.3-505.0 ng.L-1. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics showed relatively high concentrations in all samples (782-1814 ng.L-1). Different tertiary treatment processes showed discrepant antibiotics removal performances. Ozonation process was found more effective in removing target antibiotics compared to the coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation process and sand filtration process. Investigation of the target antibiotics in three typical urban rivers in Beijing was carried out to understand antibiotics occurrence in surface water environment. Eight antibiotics were detected in the studied rivers, with highest concentration of antibiotics in the river which was mainly replenished by reclaimed water. This study showed the necessity of employing more effective advanced treatment facilities to further reduce the discharge amount of antibiotics.

AB A novel poly-Al-Fe coagulant containing zinc (PAZF) was prepared from a solid waste of galvanized-aluminum slag and its hydrolysis performance was studied. The coagulation behavior by PAZF was investigated in treating different wastewater samples compared to that by poly-aluminum-chloride (PAC). The results showed that PAZF hydrolysis could be seen as a hydrolysis process of complex salt and appeared to be characteristics of different types of salt at various concentrations. PAZF showed the nature of "strong acid and weak base salt" or "strong base and weak acid salt" at lower or higher PAZF level, respectively. For different types of wastewaters, PAZF yielded better removal of color and organic matters than PAC. For dyeing, papermaking, sugar, pharmaceutical and simulated wastewater samples, the removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr ) by PAZF were up to 60.3%, 97.3%, 60%, 78.3% and 98.5%, and 32.5%, 48.1%, 41.6%, 45.4% and 82%, respectively. PAZF gave more 23%, 5%, 5%, 19% and 4%, and 8.1%, 6%, -1%, 7.2% and 18.4% than PAC in removing color and CODCr , respectively. The best pH for removing color by PAZF was different for different wastewater samples. PAZF could withstand great impact load of wastewater qualities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) is a crucial and non-renewable resource, while it is excessively discharged via sewage, significant amounts originating from human urine. Recovery of P from source-separated urine presents an opportunity not only to recover this precious resource but also to improve downstream sewage treatment works. This paper proposes a simple and economic method to recover urine derived P by using seawater as a low-cost precipitant to form struvite, as Hong Kong has practised seawater toilet flushing as an alternative water resource since 1958. Chemical reactions, process conditions and precipitate composition for P precipitation in urine have been investigated to develop this new urine P recovery approach. This study concluded that ureolysis extent in a urine-seawater mixture determines the reaction pH that in turn influences the P recovery efficiency significantly; 98% of urine P can precipitate with seawater within 10 min when 40-75% of the urea in urine is ureolysed; the urine to seawater ratio alters the composition of the precipitates. The P content in the precipitates was found to be more than 9% when the urine fraction was 40% or higher. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) was confirmed to be the predominant component of the precipitates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is a promising agent for the adsorptive removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Reliable and predictive test methods are required for the selection and for the quality control of PAC. In the present investigation, a pragmatic test method using indicative target OMP and photometric analyses was developed. Eight different PAC were compared according to the test method and according to removals of individual OMP in WWTP effluent. The test method allowed identification of the PAC with the highest and the lowest removals of benzotriazole and elucidated differences of the PAC with regard to removals of individual OMP. In WWTP effluent both positive and negative correlations between OMP removals with different PAC were observed: Some PAC removed diclofenac, carbamazepine and metoprolol to a comparatively greater extent while other PAC are comparably more efficient for benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazole and acesulfame adsorption.

AB Wastewater is increasingly being used to irrigate agricultural land in many countries around the world. However, limited research has examined the occurrence of antibiotics in soil irrigated with wastewater and their accumulation in plants. This study aimed to determine the distribution of various types of antibiotics in different environmental matrices in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region and to evaluate their accumulation and translocation in edible crops. Samples were collected from six sites in the PRD where either domestic wastewater or fishpond water was used for irrigation. Results showed that fishpond water irrigated soils had higher concentrations of antibiotics than wastewater-irrigated soils. Different trends were observed in the accumulation of antibiotics in the different edible parts of various crops. Despite the low human annual exposure to antibiotics through the consumption of edible crops (1.10 to 7950 mu g/y), the potential adverse effects of antibiotics along the food chain should not be neglected.

AB Many wildlife species forage on sewage-contaminated food, for example, at wastewater treatment plants and on fields fertilized with sewage sludge. The resultant exposure to human pharmaceuticals remains poorly studied for terrestrial species. On the basis of predicted exposure levels in the wild, we administered the common antidepressant fluoxetine (FLUOX) or control treatment via prey to wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) for 22 weeks over winter. To investigate responses to fluoxetine, birds were moved from their group aviaries into individual cages for 2 days. Boldness, exploration and activity levels showed no treatment effects but controls and FLUOX birds habituated differently to isolation in terms of the concentration of corticosterone (CORT) metabolites in faeces. The controls that excreted higher concentrations of CORT metabolites on day 1 lost more body mass by day 2 of isolation than those which excreted lower levels of CORT metabolites. CORT metabolites and mass loss were unrelated in FLUOX birds. When we investigated the movements of birds in their group aviaries, we found the controls made a higher frequency of visits to food trays than FLUOX birds around the important foraging periods of sunrise and sunset, as is optimal for wintering birds. Although individual variability makes interpreting the sub-lethal endpoints measured challenging, our data suggest that fluoxetine at environmentally relevant concentrations can significantly alter behaviour and physiology.

AB The natural range of fish species in our rivers is related to flow, elevation, temperature, local habitat and connectivity. For over 2000 years, humans have altered to varying degrees the river habitat. In the past 200 years, we added to the environmental disruption by discharging poorly treated sewage, nutrients and industrial waste into our rivers. For many rivers, the low point arrived during the period of 1950s-1970s, when rapid economic development overrode environmental concerns and dissolved oxygen concentrations dropped to zero. In these more enlightened times, gross river pollution is a thing of the past in the Developed World. However, persistent legacy chemical contaminants can be found in fish long after their discharge ceased. Changes in habitat quality and morphology caused and continue to cause the disappearance of fish species. The range of fish stressors has now increased as temperatures rise, and non-native fish introductions bring new diseases. The threat from pharmaceuticals to fish populations remains hypothetical, and no studies have yet linked change in fish populations to exposure.

AB Most amphibians breed in water, including the terrestrial species, and may therefore be exposed to water-borne pharmaceuticals during critical phases of the reproductive cycle, i.e. sex differentiation and gamete maturation. The objectives of this paper were to (i) review available literature regarding adverse effects of hormonally active pharmaceuticals on amphibians, with special reference to environmentally relevant exposure levels and (ii) expand the knowledge on toxicity of progestagens in amphibians by determining effects of norethindrone (NET) and progesterone (P) exposure to 0, 1, 10 or 100 ng l(-1) (nominal) on oogenesis in the test species Xenopus tropicalis. Very little information was found on toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals on amphibians. Research has shown that environmental concentrations (1.8 ng l(-1)) of the pharmaceutical oestrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) cause developmental reproductive toxicity involving impaired spermatogenesis in frogs. Recently, it was found that the progestagen levonorgestrel (LNG) inhibited oogenesis in frogs by interrupting the formation of vitellogenic oocytes at an environmentally relevant concentration (1.3 ng l(-1)). Results from the present study revealed that 1 ng NET l(-1) and 10 ng P l(-1) caused reduced proportions of vitellogenic oocytes and increased proportions of previtellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, thereby indicating inhibited vitellogenesis. Hence, the available literature shows that the oestrogen EE2 and the progestagens LNG, NET and P impair reproductive functions in amphibians at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations. The progestagens are of particular concern given their prevalence, the range of compounds and that several of them (LNG, NET and P) share the same target (oogenesis) at environmental exposure concentrations, indicating a risk for adverse effects on fertility in exposed wild amphibians.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide Characterization Factors (CFs) for the toxicity related impact categories in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). The CFs already available were updated whereas others were implemented for the first time by means of USEtox and USES-LCA 2.0 methodologies. The list of PPCPs includes human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity for both models whereas terrestrial and marine ecotoxicity were assessed with USES-LCA 2.0. Moreover, all the available emission compartments were considered for the calculation. The resulting CFs were subjected to a sensitivity analysis and results determined that human toxicological and ecotoxicological effects (ED50 and avlogEC50, respectively) as well as degradation rate in water were the most sensitive parameters. The calculated CFs were used in the environmental assessment of a Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen removal Over Nitrite (CANON) pilot plant. PPCPs were found to have a major impact on freshwater ecotoxicity, accounting for 81% or 97% of the total impact with USES-LCA 2.0 and USEtox, respectively. Moreover, a more precise determination of human toxicity was obtained after updating CFs values calculated with USEtox, with contributions up to 50% of the total impact. Therefore, the provision of new and updated CFs allows a more accurate environmental assessment of processes where PPCPs are present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals constitute a well-known group of emerging contaminants with an increasing significance in water pollution. This study focuses on three pharmaceuticals extensively used in Finland and which can be found in environmental waters: ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Biodegradation experiments were conducted in a full-scale Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and in laboratory-scale Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs). The SBRs were operated at 12 degrees C, with a sludge retention time (SRT) 10-12 d and organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0.17, 0.27 and 0.33 kg BOD7 m(-3)d(-1). Ibuprofen was found to biodegrade up to 99%. The biodegradation rate constants (k(biol)) for ibuprofen were calculated for full-scale and laboratory processes as well as under different laboratory conditions and found to differ from 0.9 up to 5.0 l g(ss)(-1) d(-1). Diclofenac demonstrated an unexpected immediate drop of concentration in three SBRs and partial recovery of the initial concentration in one of the reactors. High fluctuating in diclofenac concentration was presumably caused by removal of this compound under different concentrations of nitrites during development of nitrifying activated sludge. Carbamazepine showed no biodegradation in all the experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degradation kinetics and pathways of ronidazole (RNZ) by chlorination (Cl-2), UV irradiation and combined UV/chlorine processes were investigated in this paper. The degradation kinetics of RNZ chlorination followed a second-order behavior with the rate constants calculated as (2.13 +/- 0.15) x 10(2) M-2 s(-1), (0.82 +/- 0.52) x 10(-2) M-1 s(-1) and (2.06 +/- 0.09) x 10(-1) M-1 s(-1) for the acid-catalyzed reaction, as well as the reactions of RNZ with HOCl and OCl-, respectively. Although UV irradiation degraded RNZ more effectively than chlorination did, very low quantum yield of RNZ at 254 nm was obtained as 1.02 x 10(-3) mol E-1. RNZ could be efficiently degraded and mineralized in the UV/chlorine process due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The second-order rate constant between RNZ and hydroxyl radical was determined as (2.92 +/- 0.05) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). The degradation intermediates of RNZ during the three processes were identified with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry and the degradation pathways were then proposed. Moreover, the variation of chloropicrin (TCNM) and chloroform (CF) formation after the three processes were further evaluated. Enhanced formation of CF and TCNM precursors during UV/chlorine process deserves extensive attention in drinking water treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The competitive impacts of different fractions of wastewater treatment plant effluent organic matter (EfOM) on organic micro-pollutant (OMP) adsorption were investigated. The fractionation was accomplished using separation by nanofiltration (NF). The waters resulting from NF were additionally treated to obtain the same dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations as the initial water. Using size exclusion chromatography (LC-OCD) it could be shown that the NF treatment resulted in an EfOM separation by size. Adsorption tests showed different competitive effects of the EfOM fractions with the OMP. While large EfOM compounds that were retained in NF demonstrated a reduced competition as compared to the raw water, the NF-permeating EfOM compounds showed an increased competition with the majority of the measured OMP. The effects of small size EfOM are particularly negative for OMP which are weak/moderate adsorbates. Adsorption analysis was carried out for the differently fractionized waters. The small sized EfOM contain better adsorbable compounds than the raw water while the large EfOM are less adsorbable. This explains the observed differences in the EfOM competitiveness. The equivalent background compound (EBC) model was applied to model competitive adsorption between OMP and EfOM and showed that the negative impacts of EfOM on OMP adsorption increase with decreasing size of the EfOM fractions. The results suggest that direct competition for adsorption sites on the internal surface of the activated carbon is more substantial than indirect competition due to pore access restriction by blockage. Another explication for reduced competition by large EfOM compounds could be the inability to enter and block the pores due to size exclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cometabolism is the ability of microorganisms to degrade non-growth substrates in the presence of primary substrates, being the main removal mechanism behind the biotransformation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants. In this paper, a cometabolic Monod-type kinetics, linking biotransformation of micropollutants with primary substrate degradation, was applied to a highly enriched nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) reactor operated under different operational conditions (hydraulic retention time (HRT) and nitrifying activity). A dynamic model of the bioreactor was built taking into account biotransformation, sorption and volatilization. The micropollutant transformation capacity (T-c), the half-saturation constant (K-sc) and the solid liquid partitioning coefficient (K-d) of several organic micropollutants were estimated at 25 degrees C using an optimization algorithm to fit experimental data to the proposed model with the cometabolic Monod-type biotransformation kinetics.
   The cometabolic Monod-type kinetic model was validated under different HRTs (1.0-3.7 d) and nitrification rates (0.12-0.45 g N/g VSS d), describing more accurately the fate of those compounds affected by the biological activity of nitrifiers (ibuprofen, naproxen, erythromycin and roxithromycin) compared to the commonly applied pseudo-first order micropollutant biotransformation kinetics, which does not link biotransformation of micropollutants to consumption of primary substrate. Furthermore, in contrast to the pseudo-first order biotransformation constant (k(biol)), the proposed cometabolic kinetic coefficients are independent of operational conditions such as the nitrogen loading rate applied. Also, the influence of the kinetic parameters on the biotransformation efficiency of NAS reactors, defined as the relative amount of the total inlet micropollutant load being biotransformed, was assessed considering different HRTs and nitrification rates.

AB Granular mesoporous silica SBA-15 (GMS) synthesized by a new and facile one step method was investigated to remove a series of pharmaceutical compounds from aqueous solutions. Characterization results obtained from TEM, XRD, and surface and porosity analyzer reveal that GMS synthesized by using inorganic and organic binder has similar pore properties with the powder-type mesoporous silica SBA-15 and does not severely reduce the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume by preventing destruction of the pores after granulation step through new synthesis method. Evaluation of GMS as an adsorbent based on adsorption kinetic, isotherm, and effect of pH shows the great adsorption capacity for selected 12 selected pharmaceuticals removal in aqueous solution. In addition, the adsorption and regeneration efficiency of GMS was maintained for given adsorption-regeneration cycles. Moreover, the column experiment to remove pharmaceuticals in industrial pharmaceutical wastewater revealed that GMS has a great potential for its real field application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB TiO2/HNTs were modified by metal ions with the impregnation method. The as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results demonstrated that TiO2/HNTs were successfully synthesized, and anatase TiO2 was formed after calcination. Moreover, after modification, the as-prepared TiO2/HNTs still kept crystalline structure. Furthermore, a red-shift was obviously observed fromUV-vis DRS, and the band gap energy was narrowed. ICP-AES proved that compared with TiO2/HNTs, metal ions were existed in metal ion@TiO2/HNTs. The photocatalytic activity was studied by the degradation of antibiotics aqueous solution under the visible light irradiation. The results showed that Fe3+@TiO2/HNTs had the strong ability to degrade tetracycline, and the optimum adding concentration of Fe3+ was 0.2 g/L. In addition, the degradation effect of tetracycline was better. The photodegradation rate of 40 mg L-1 tetracycline simulated wastewater could reach 76.54%. The binary system was also investigated, which showed that the degradation rate of co-doped TiO2/HNTs was lower than Fe3+@TiO2/HNTs.

AB Anaerobic processes have been successfully used in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater. However, the effect of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus on specific methanogenic activity (SMA) in anaerobic treatment of wastewaters containing phenol has not been systematically investigated. Phenol is present in industrial effluents like coal gasification, coke production, pharmaceutical, pesticide, fertilizer, dye manufacturing, synthetic chemical, and pulp and paper. This paper presents experimental study on determination of SMA using phenol as a sole substrate and the present work is being compared with the studies carried out by various researchers using different substrates. SMA test was carried out immediately after seeding the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor with sludge in order to determine the initial phenol biodegradation during the start-up phase of the reactor. Anaerobic degradation of phenol to methane takes place via benzoate and then to acetate. Therefore, the SMA was determined by taking benzoate as well as acetate as substrates. The SMA of acetate was found less than that of benzoate. Therefore, for the SMA in case of phenol biodegradation the conversion of phenol to benzoate has been shown to be rate liming step. Based on the SMA test and COD removal the optimum COD:N:P ratio for anaerobic treatment of phenolic wastewater is proposed to be 300:1:0.1. Also, to increase the performance of the system and to achieve stable conditions an organic loading rate of 0.40 kg COD/m(3) d was tested and resulted in 98% COD removal. This study will be very helpful in maintaining optimum organic load and COD:N:P ratio for enhanced removal of phenol from wastewater.

AB Adsorbed polymers show stabilization-flocculation properties of colloidal suspension and they are widely used in technological applications (chemical and pharmaceutical industries, food processing, drinking water purification and wastewater treatment). Thus, the influence of polyacrylic acid (PM) addition on the stability of synthesized alumina suspension as a function of solution pH was studied. The changes of the examined systems stability in time were monitored using the turbidimety method. It was shown that the alumina suspension without the polymer is the most stable at pH 3 (electrostatic stabilization), whereas at the pH values 6 and 9 the systems are unstable (coagulation). The addition of PM with the lowest molecular weight (i.e. 2000) at pH 3 causes large deterioration of the system stability (destabilization by charge neutralization), whereas at the pH values 6 and 9 significant improvement of analogous system stability is observed (electrosteric stabilization). PAAs with higher molecular weights (100 000 and 240 000) cause stabilization of the alumina suspension in the whole range of studied pH. At pH 3 it is rather steric stabilization. On the other hand, at the pH values 6 and 9 the steric mechanism of stabilization is combined with the electric one, leading to electrosteric interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous antibiotics such as sulfonamides have been found in effluents from drug manufacturers. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange comprise some of the most promising techniques for the retention of these compounds from wastewaters due to their low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This article studies the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), the most common sulfonamide antibiotics detected in municipal sewage. Lewatit MP500 (Lanxess Chemical) ion exchange resin was used to remove SMX, SMZ present in solutions. Batch experiments were carried out in cylindrical stirred tanks. Binary system solutions of equal mass concentration were prepared containing 30-250 mg/L of each compound, SMX and SMZ, and tested with an L/S ratio (mL solution/g resin) = 1000 obtained in previous experiments. Also, the adsorption of SMX mixed with trimethoprim (TMP) in batch experiments was analyzed due to the fact that both compounds are usually administered together. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied in order to characterize the operation. The adsorption equilibrium constants for SMX and SMZ were determined using a modified extended Langmuir model for multicomponent equilibrium sorption. Kinetics was analyzed using the pore diffusion model. Finally, several loading and elution cycles were carried out in fixed bed to obtain the breakthrough curves, comparing the experimental data to predicted values from a fixed bed model.

AB The degradation of a mixture of four pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacin and trimethoprim) in distilled water and in a synthetic solution simulating a typical secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant by ozonation, solar TiO2-photocatalytic oxidation and a sequence of both methods has been investigated. Degradation by ozone led to the complete removal of the selected emerging compounds (EC) but an accumulation of ozonation by-products (e.g., phenolic intermediates and carboxylic acids) in solution was observed. The presence of ozone-consuming substances in the synthetic effluent had not a negative impact on the removal of the pharmaceuticals but on their mineralization (TOC removal <8%). By photocatalytic oxidation, the pharmaceutical compounds were completely removed with UVA radiation doses lower than 0.3 kJ per mg EC while about 70% TOC conversion was achieved with a UVA radiation dose of I kJ per mg EC. The presence of organic and inorganic matter in the secondary effluent had a negative impact on the mineralization of pharmaceuticals. Thus, initial TOC removal rate was five times lower when treating the pharmaceuticals in the synthetic effluent compared to distilled water. The application of a sequential ozone - TiO2 solar photocatalytic oxidation treatment allowed complete removal of pharmaceuticals by ozonation and further mineralization of ozonation by-products by the photocatalytic treatment.

AB Paracetamol oxidation by ozonation and H2O2/UV processes was investigated. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of paracetamol with ozone was determined at pH 7.2 (k(o3)/(PRC) = 2.57 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)). The rate constant of the elementary reaction of ozone with the ionized form of PRC was then calculated and the pH dependence of the ozonation reaction of PRC was estimated. The second-order rate constant of the reaction of paracetamol with Ha radicals was also determined at pH 5 through the H2O2/UV oxidation system (k(HO)(center dot)/(PRC) = 4.94 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)). In the light of the high rate constants obtained, two conclusions on the kinetics of paracetamol ozonation in real water were drawn: (i) hydroxyl radicals do not have any impact on the removal of paracetamol during ozonation of real waters; (ii) a half-life of 0.03 s can be estimated for paracetamol, for a residual ozone concentration of 0.4 mg L-1. Hydroquinone and two other ozonation transformation products were identified by LC/UV, LC/MS and MS/MS analyses. In parallel, for the first time, toxicity was measured in ozonated paracetamol solutions with the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri test. The results showed an increase in toxicity as paracetamol degraded. This toxicity could not be assigned to hydroquinone formation only. One or several other transformation products more toxic than paracetamol might be formed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of corticosteroid signaling disruptors in wastewaters and rivers in the Czech Republic and in Switzerland. 36 target compounds were detected using HPLC-MS/MS, with up to 6.4 mu g/L for azole antifungals that indirectly affect corticosteroid signaling. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated activity was determined using the GR-CALUX bioassay with dexamethasone equivalent concentrations ranging from <LOD-2.6, 19-37, and 78-542 ng/L for river water, treated, and untreated wastewater, respectively. For most samples, the chemically predicted GR-mediated response was higher than that determined by the bioassay. Correspondingly, antiglucocorticoid activity was observed in some fractions. The fish plasma model (FPM), which predicts plasma concentrations, was applied to evaluate the potential of detected pharmaceuticals to cause receptor-mediated effects in fish. With one exception, medroxyprogesterone, the FPM applied to individual compounds predicted fish plasma concentrations to be below the level of human therapeutic plasma concentrations. To account for the activity of the sum of GR-active compounds, we introduce the "cortisol equivalents fish plasma concentration" approach, through which an increase in fish glucocorticoid plasma levels comparable to 0.9-83 ng/mL cortisol after exposure to the analyzed river waters was estimated. The results suggest that these chemicals may impact wild fish.

TI Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Swiss National Policy on Reducing
   Micropollutants in Treated Wastewater

AB Contamination of freshwater with micropollutants (MPs) is a growing concern worldwide. Even at very low concentrations, MPs can have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and possibly also on human health. Switzerland is one of the first countries to start implementing a national policy to reduce MPs in the effluents of municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). This paper estimates the benefits of upgrading STPs based on public's stated preferences. To assess public demand for the reduction of the environmental and health risks of MPs, we conducted a choice experiment in a national online survey. The results indicate that the average willingness to pay per household is CHF 100 (US$ 73) annually for reducing the potential environmental risk of MPs to a low level. These benefits, aggregated over households in the catchment of the STPs to be upgraded, generate a total annual economic value of CHF 155 million (US$ 113 million). This compares with estimated annual costs for upgrading 123 STPs of CHF 133 million (US$ 97 million) or CHF 86 (US$ 63) per household connected to these STPs. Hence, a cost benefit analysis justifies the investment decision from an economic point of view and supports the implementation of the national policy in the ongoing political discussion.

AB Diclofenac, ibuprofen and ketoprofen are anti-inflammatory drugs intensively used both in human and animal treatment. Due to their high stability these compounds are partially removed by wastewater treatment plants and from this reason the development of some alternative treatments such as advanced oxidative processes are necessary. The main problems in the optimization of an advanced oxidative process rise from the difficulties which appear in the identification of degradation by-products necessary for the establishment of degradation pathway. In this paper a developed method for the simultaneous identification of Fenton degradation by-products of the three above mentioned pharmaceuticals is presented. The obtained results show the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry as a proper method for the analysis of the complex mixture of compounds resulted from the Fenton degradation process. Moreover, some compounds never mentioned in the scientific literature were identified.

AB A recently developed, staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (SAF-MBR) system has demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional activated sludge systems at similar hydraulic residence times. The low biosolid generation rate, small footprint, and energy-positive potential (from captured methane) suggest the possible advantages of using the SAF-MBR upstream of advanced treatment for decentralized water reuse. Previous research conducted on laboratory-scale systems indicated that the SAF-MBR system is capable of removing pharmaceutical compounds. The purpose of this study was to compare the removals of disinfection byproduct precursors as well as pharmaceuticals by parallel pilot-scale SAF-MBR and full-scale aerobic systems treating municipal wastewater. Significantly better removals of antivirals (acyclovir and lamivudine), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol), a beta-blocker aerobic biotransformation product (metoprolol acid), an anticonvulsant (carbamazepine), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim), N-nitrosomorpholine, and the precursors of N-nitrosodimethylamine were obtained by the SAF-MBR system. Concentrations of trihalomethane precursors were lower in the SAF-MBR effluent in two of the three samplings.

AB The agricultural use of wastewater biosolids is a common practice in many countries, but concerns exist regarding the presence of organic wastewater contaminants that remain in the land-applied biosolids. The objective of this study was to determine if contaminants present in biosolids are detectable in soil following land application. A suite of organic contaminants were monitored by gas chromatograph with mass spectrometer in agricultural soil samples from a site amended with increasing rates of alkaline-treated biosolids. Triclosan, a common antimicrobial agent, was detected at levels greater than the reporting limit in an environment-controlled incubation study and validated through in situ field samples from soils receiving the same alkaline-treated biosolid. A rapid decrease in triclosan concentration was observed during the first few weeks of the incubation study, with concentrations decreasing from 92 +/- 26 to 20 +/- 2 ng g(-1) (average 78% decrease) after 4 mo. The field results indicate that triclosan in fall-applied may persist overwinter. However, a rapid decrease in triclosan concentration during the spring and summer months led to levels lower than predicted following the spring application, and levels below our reporting limit (up to 85% decrease) by the end of the study. Removal is posited to be through aerobic microbial degradation.

AB Functionalized Granular Activated Carbons (FACS) are used as adsorbents for treating pharmaceutical wastewaters containing Chlorhexidine Gluconate. Chemical modifications of Granular Activated Carbons (GACs) using functionalizing agents like HCl and HF produce FACs. The adsorption capacity of each of FAC-HCl and FAC-HF is found to be higher than GAC. The modelled maximum adsorption capacity for FAC-HCl is 1.02 g/g of adsorbent, 3.49 g/g of adsorbent for FAC-HF and 0.0682 g/g of adsorbent for GAC. This is mainly due to the additional chemisorptions by surface complexation at the functionalized surface sites of the modified GACs. This is also supported by the well-known pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Formation of surface complexes with the functional groups and weakly polar Chlorhexidine Gluconate is well supported by the physical characterization using Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET) test and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis after adsorption. The adsorption capacity of GAC and the FACs increases in the order of FAC-HF > FAC-HCl > GAC conforming to the proportion of the total acidity of the carbon surfaces. Intra-particle diffusion is not the sole rate-controlling factor. An agreement to pseudo-second-order kinetic model, Elovich kinetic model and Boyd's film diffusion model proves that chemisorption is the rate-controlling parameter in this adsorption study.

AB Hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) is a favorable technique for the pertraction of metal ions, especially at very low metal concentration. In this work, the pertraction of silver ions from acidic pharmaceutical wastewater via HFSLM was investigated. Pharmaceutical wastewater containing 30 mg/dm(3) of silver ions and 120 mg/dm3 of ferric ions was subjected to HFSLM as a feed solution. LIX 84-I dissolved in organic solvent together with Na(2)S(2)0=O-3.5H(2)O solution was selected for use as a liquid membrane and a receiving solution, respectively. The influence of ferric ions on the pertraction of silver ions was studied firstly using wastewater with normal ferric ion concentration and secondly using wastewater with ferric ion precipitation by phosphoric acid solution. The highest pertraction of silver ions was achieved by using 0.1 M of LIX 84-I and 0.5 M of Na2S2O3.5H(2)O solution at pH of feed and receiving solutions of 3.5 and 2. The flow rates of feed and receiving solutions were 0.2 dm(3)/min. 0.6 mg/dm(3) of silver ions that remained in the wastewater was below the mandatory discharge limit. No effect of normal ferric ion concentration in the wastewater on silver ion pertraction was observed. The crucial parameters were defined to confirm the efficiency and reliability of the system. Finally, the controlling transport regime of silver ion pertraction across HFSLM was determined by the diffusion flux and reaction flux models. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The photodegradation of cloramphenicol (CAP) in ultrapure water (UW), untreated surface water (USW), and treated effluent from sewage treatment plant (TESTP) in laboratory scale and pilot scale, was evaluated using solar and artificial radiation. The results show, in all cases, that the CAP degradation occurs according to pseudo-first order kinetics, with the apparent degradation rate constants (k(app)) following the order UW = USW > TESTP. The k(app) and half-life were strongly influenced by the radiation source. Mono-and di-hydroxyl transformation products were identified in UW after 40 min of solar irradiation, while the acute toxicity to Artemia salina increased from 35% to 100%, respectively after 180 and 1440 min of artificial and solar irradiation (94 and 132 kJ L-1), when 99.2 and 97.7% of CAP degradation occurred. The transformation products did not present antimicrobial activity.

AB This study presents the treatment of a high strength pharmaceutical wastewater by sono-Fenton-sorption (SFS). Better results were observed with SFS compared to individual processes and the maximum chemical oxygen demand reduction observed after 180min of treatment with SFS, sono-Fenton, and sono-sorption was 71.9, 48.4, and 43.75%, respectively. The effect of parameters such as initial concentration, dosage of Fenton's reagent, sorbent dosage, and pattern of addition of iron on the performance of SFS was analyzed. The sonosorption and SFS were found to fit well with Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. Fourier transformed IR studies of effluent and sorbent before and after treatment confirmed the oxidative degradation of pharmaceutical effluent. Toxicity of the effluent was considerably reduced after the treatment and the electrical energy consumption was significantly reduced, when sonolysis was coupled with sorption and Fenton's process (SFS).

AB Electrodegradation of simulated pharmaceutical wastewaters was performed and optimized according to response surface methodology. To this end, carbamazepine (CBZ) was used as a model compound and a design of experiments was planned for evaluating the influence of two main variables in the electrochemical process: initial CBZ concentration (in logarithm terms) and the current density. Target variable was an apparent first-order kinetic constant (k) designed ad hoc. Interaction of variables was confirmed and an optimum k constant of 0.72min(-1) was obtained. CBZ was also removed from real wastewater matrices, such as urban wastewater or surface water from river and lake.

AB Newly available prescription data has been used along with census data to develop a localised method for predicting pharmaceutical concentrations in sewage influent and effluent for England, and applied to a case study: the steroid estrogens estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in a selected catchment. The prescription data allows calculation of the mass consumed of synthetic estrogens, white use of highly localised census data improves predictions of naturally excreted estrogens by accounting for regional variations in population demographics. This serves two key purposes; to increase the accuracy of predictions in general, and to call attention to the need for more accurate predictions at a localised and/or catchment level, especially in light of newly proposed regulatory measures which may in the future require removal of steroid estrogens by sewage treatment facilities. In addition, the general lack of measured sewage works data necessitated the development of a novel approach which allowed comparison of localised predictions to average national measurements of influent and effluent. Overall in the case study catchment, estrogen predictions obtained using the model described herein were within 95% confidence intervals of measured values drawn from across the UK, with large improvements to predictions of EE2 being made compared with previous predictive methods.

AB Solar photo-Fenton process has been extensively reported to be highly efficient in the remediation of complex industrial wastewater containing several families of pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, pesticides, derivatives of wine, etc. Moreover, solar photo-Fenton mathematical modelling regarded as a powerful tool for scaling-up and process control purposes is hindered by the complexity and variability of its reaction mechanism which depends on the particular wastewater under study. In this work, non-biodegradable cork boiling wastewater has been selected as a case study for solar photo-Fenton dynamic modelling by using MATLAB (R) software. First of all physic-chemical pretreatment was applied attaining chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions between 43 and 70% and total suspended solid (TSS) reductions between 23% and 59 %. After solar photo-Fenton treatment, COD decreased between 45 and 90 % after consumptions of H2O2 varying around 1.9 and 2.4 g/L. Individual calibration of the semi-empirical model by using experimental results made it possible to perfectly predict hydrogen peroxide variations throughout the treatment. It must be highlighted that slight deviations between predictions and experimental data must be attributed to important changes in wastewater characteristics.

AB Developing advanced treatment technologies for improving the removal of micropollutants in water/wastewater is important. A suitable treatment is more likely to be used as the polishing step in the treatment scheme. Advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are relevant for removing micropollutants. The ability of direct UV photolysis and selected AOTs to degrade pharmaceuticals, endocrine-disrupting compound and herbicide has been studied and compared. The tested methods resulted in the degradation of the studied micropollutants; however, none of the methods was preferred for the removal of all tested compounds. The UV-active processes have strong potential for removal of the studied micropollutants. The utilisation of a moderate hydrogen peroxide admixture resulted in a more reliable treatment.

AB This study describes a comprehensive strategy for detecting and elucidating the chemical structures of expected and unexpected transformation products (TPs) from chemicals found in river water and effluent wastewater samples, using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), with post-acquisition data processing and an automated search using an in-house database. The efficacy of the mass defect filtering (MDF) approach to screen metabolites from common biotransformation pathways was tested, and it was shown to be sufficiently sensitive and applicable for detecting metabolites in environmental samples. Four omeprazole metabolites and two venlafaxine metabolites were identified in river water samples. This paper reports the analytical results obtained during 2 years of monitoring, carried out at eight sampling points along the Henares River (Spain). Multiresidue monitoring, for targeted analysis, includes a group of 122 chemicals, amongst which are pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and PAHs. For this purpose, two analytical methods were used based on direct injection with a LC-ESI-QTOF-MS system and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) with bi-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with a time-of-flight spectrometer (GCxGC-EI-TOF-MS).

AB Trace amounts of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in waters across the United States. Many compounds are released as the result of human ingestion and subsequent excretion of over-the-counter and prescription medications, and illicit drugs. This research utilized columns (30 x 30 cm) of sand and undisturbed fine-grained sediments to simulate injection of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and an illicit drug, such as would be found in a septic system, leaky sewer, or landfill. The columns were placed in a temperature-controlled laboratory and each was injected with natural groundwater containing known concentrations of caffeine, methamphetamine, and acetaminophen. Natural attenuation of each chemical was observed in all columns. The highest amount removed (approximately 90%) occurred in the undisturbed column injected with methamphetamine, compared with little reduction in the sand column. When the suite of drugs was injected, loss of methamphetamine was less than when methamphetamine was injected alone. The subsurface sediments exhibit the ability to remove a substantial amount of the injected pharmaceuticals and illicit drug; however, complete removal was not achieved. There was little attenuation of injected pharmaceuticals in the sand column which demonstrates a concern for water quality in the environment if pharmaceuticals were to contaminate a sandy aquifer. Understanding the transport of pharmaceuticals in the subsurface environment is an important component of protecting drinking water supplies from contamination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, pharmaceuticals are found in every compartment of the environment. Hospitals are one of the main sources of these pollutant emissions sent to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that are poorly equipped to treat these types of compounds efficiently. In this work, for each pharmaceutical compound found in hospital wastewater (HWW), we have calculated a hazard quotient (HQ) corresponding to the highest concentration measured in HWW divided by its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Thus we have assessed the contribution of each compound to the ecotoxicological threat of HWW taken as a whole. Fifteen compounds are identified as particularly hazardous in HWW. In future more attention should be given to their analysis and replacement in hospitals, and to their elimination in WWTPs. This work also highlights the lack of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of certain pharmaceutical compounds found in HWW at high concentrations (mg L-1). In order to extend this study, it is now necessary to investigate ecotoxic risks linked to various emission scenarios, focusing in particular on dilution in the aquatic environment and the production of metabolites, especially during transit inside WWTPs.

AB To better understand pharmaceutical fate during wastewater treatment, analysis in both aqueous and particulate phases is needed. Reported herein is a multi-residue method for the determination of ten pharmaceutical drugs and the personal care product triclosan in wastewater matrices. Method quantitation limits ranged from 7.6 to 76.6 ng l(-1) for aqueous phases and from 7.0 to 96.7 ng g(-1) for particulate phases. The analytical method was applied to attain a complete process mass balance of a pilot-scale activated sludge plant (ASP) operated under controlled conditions. The mass balance (inclusive of aqueous and particulate concentrations at all sample points) was used to diagnose removal, revealing pharmaceuticals to be separable into three fate pathways: (a) biological degradation, (b) sorption onto activated sludge and (c) resistant to removal from the aqueous phase. These differences in fate behaviour explained a broad range of secondary removal observed (-8 to 99%). The ASP was also simultaneously compared to a full-scale trickling filter (TF) works whilst receiving the same influent wastewater. Performance of the ASP and TF was similar, achieving total pharmaceutical removals of 253 and 249 mu g g(-1) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removed, respectively. This corresponded with reductions in total pharmaceutical load of 91 and 90% (ANOVA, p-value > 0.05). Interestingly, despite low suspended solid concentrations final effluents of both the ASP and TF contained significant concentrations of some chemicals in the particulate phase. Individually, triclosan and the antibiotics ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were within the particulate phase of effluents at concentrations ranging from 26 to 296 ng l(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a bio-entrapped membrane reactor (BEMR) and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) were evaluated to study the organic treatment performance of pharmaceutical wastewater. The influences of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and salinity were also studied. The conventional biomass in the BEMR cannot tolerate well of the hypersaline conditions, resulting in total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 54.2-68.0%. On the other hand, microorganisms in the SMSMBR, which was seeded from coastal shore, strived and was able to degrade the complex organic in the presence of salt effectively, achieving 74.7-90.9% of TCOD removal efficiencies. Marine microorganisms able to degrade recalcitrant compounds and utilize hydrocarbon compounds were found in the SMSMBR, which resulted in higher organic removal efficiency than the BEMR. However, specific nitrifying activity decreased and inhibited due to the saline effect that led to poor ammonia nitrogen removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This first report describes the purification and identification of an orange-red pigment produced by Achromobacter denitrificans strain SP1 (isolated from sewage sludge heavily contaminated with plastics) during its growth in a simple basal salt medium supplemented with the hazardous di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) blended in PVC blood bag (in situ) or free DEHP (ex situ) as carbon source. The cell-bound pigment was elucidated, characterized at molecular level, and described as an unusual 25C prodigiosin analog for the first time. At laboratory conditions (in flasks), the dry cell mass was 75.2 mg/g blood bag, which upon extraction yielded 7.1 mg prodigiosin; at this stage the pH of the medium was dropped from 7.2 to 3.5. Considering its pharmaceutical importance, taking 10 known prodigiosins as controls, this 25C prodigiosin was subjected to molecular docking studies, showed comparable and promising binding efficiencies with the crucial molecular human targets like cycloxygenase-2, ZAP-70 kinase and Jak-3 kinase.

AB Toxicity in natural ecosystems is usually not due to exposure to a single substance, but is rather the result of exposure to mixtures of toxic substances. Knowing the effects of contaminants as a mixture compared to their effects in isolated form is therefore important. This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced by binary mixtures of diclofenac with paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid and by these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in isolated form, using Hyalella azteca as a bioindicator. The median lethal concentration (LC50) and the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of each NSAID were obtained. Amphipods were exposed for 72 h to the latter value in isolated form and as binary mixtures. The following biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and activity of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Significant increases in LPX and PCC with respect to the control group (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) were induced by NSAIDs both in isolated form and as binary mixtures. Changes in SOD, CAT, and GPx activity likewise occurred with NSAIDs in isolated form and as binary mixtures. In conclusion, NSAIDs used in this study induce oxidative stress on H. azteca both in isolated form and as binary mixtures, and the interactions occurring between these pharmaceuticals are probably antagonistic in type.

AB A methodology was developed for the assessment and comparison of the environmental impact of two alternative pharmaceutical prescriptions. This methodology provides physicians with the opportunity to include environmental considerations in their choice of prescription. A case study with the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin at three locations throughout Europe showed that the preference for a pharmaceutical might show spatial variation, i.e. comparison of two pharmaceuticals might yield different results when prescribed at different locations. This holds when the comparison is based on both the impact on the aquatic environment and the impact on human health. The relative impacts of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin on human health were largely determined by the local handling of secondary sludge, agricultural disposal practices, the extent of secondary sewage treatment, and local food consumption patterns. The relative impacts of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin on the aquatic environment were mostly explained by the presence of specific sewage treatment techniques, as effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the most relevant emission pathway for the aquatic environment.

AB The occurrences of pharmaceuticals and personal care products as emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) have been reported in several countries of the world except from African countries. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the occurrence of nine antibiotics, five antipyretics, atenolol, bezafibrate, and caffeine in wastewater and surface water samples from the Umgeni River. The water samples were extracted with solid-phase extraction using hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and C-18 cartridges for the acidic and neutral drugs, respectively. The quantification was carried out with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) using the standard addition method. The method limits of detections were in the range of 0.14-0.97 mu g/L while the recoveries were between 53.8 and 108.1 %. The wastewater had 100 % occurrence of the analytes studied, with caffeine having the highest concentration at 61 +/- 5 mu g/L and nalidixic acid being the most observed antibiotic at 31 +/- 3 mu g/L. The waste treatment process reduced the influent concentrations by 43.0-94.2 % before discharge except for atenolol removal that is lower. The concentrations of the analytes were lower in the surface water with most compounds having concentrations below 10 mu g/L except acetaminophen and atenolol. The estuary mouth and Blue Lagoon had the highest concentrations of some of the compounds in surface water which depict downstream load. The factors governing the fate and mobility of these compounds in this environment are not fully understood yet and will require further studies.

AB In the current study, 43 pharmaceuticals and 18 transformation products were studied in the river Meuse at the Belgian-Dutch border and four tributaries of the river Meuse in the southern part of the Netherlands. The tributaries originate from Belgian, Dutch and mixed Dutch and Belgian catchments. In total, 23 pharmaceuticals and 13 transformation products were observed in samples of river water collected from these rivers. Observed summed concentrations of pharmaceuticals and transformation products in river water ranged from 3.5 to 37.8 mu g/L. Metformin and its transformation product guanylurea contributed with 53 to 80% to this concentration, illustrating its importance on a mass basis. Data on the flow rate of different rivers and demographics of the catchments enabled us to calculate daily per capita loads of pharmaceuticals and transformation products. These loads were linked to sales data of pharmaceuticals in the catchment. Simple mass balance modelling accounting for human excretion and removal by sewage treatment plants revealed that sales could predict actual loads within a factor of 3 for most pharmaceuticals. Rivers that originated from Belgian and mixed Dutch and Belgian catchments revealed significantly higher per capita loads of pharmaceuticals (16.0 +/- 2.3 and 15.7 +/- 2.1 mg/inhabitant/day, respectively) than the Dutch catchment (8.7 +/- 1.8 mg/inhabitant/day). Furthermore, the guanylurea/metformin ratio was significantly lower in waters originating from Belgium (and France) than in those from the Netherlands, illustrating that sewage treatment in the Belgian catchment is less efficient in transforming metformin into guanylurea. In summary, the current study shows that consumption-based modelling is suitable to predict environmental loads and concentrations. Furthermore, different consumption patterns and wastewater treatment efficiency are clearly reflected in the occurrence and loads of pharmaceuticals in regional rivers.

AB The main objective of the current study was to estimate the potential environmental risks associated with human consumption of antimicrobials in Greece. Consumption data was collected for the 24 most often used antimicrobials for the years 2008-2010, and their predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in raw and treated wastewater were calculated using mass balances and literature data on human excretion and elimination efficiency during wastewater treatment. The ecotoxicological risk was estimated by calculating the ratio of PEC to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for three categories of aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids, and fish). PNEC values were calculated based on experimental ecotoxicity data and data originated from the Ecological Structure Activity Relationship (ECOSAR). PEC values in raw sewage ranged between 0.02 mu g L-1 (erythromycin) and 27 mu g L-1 (amoxicillin), while in treated wastewater, the highest concentration was predicted for cefuroxime axetil (6.6 mu g L-1). Based on acute toxicity data for algae, risk quotient (RQ) values higher than 1 were obtained for 7 out of the 24 target antimicrobials in raw and treated wastewater, while no significant risk was estimated for daphnids and fish. Regarding the possible risk due to the chronic toxicity of antimicrobials, RQ values higher than 80 were obtained for amoxicillin and clarithromycin in algae. The use of baseline toxicity data from ECOSAR showed that the environmental risk from exposure to mixtures of antimicrobials was low for all three aquatic species. However, further studies on toxicity of mixtures should be performed as calculation of toxicity ratio (TR) values showed that 90 % of the target antimicrobials seem to exhibit a specific mode of toxic action when present in mixtures rather than baseline toxicity. As a result, an underestimation of toxicity based on the ECOSAR model is possible for the mixture of target antimicrobials. For Greek rivers where low (dilution factor, D < 10) and medium (D = 10-100) dilution of wastewater occurs, moderate to high risk is expected due to the existence of individual antimicrobials such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and levofloxacin in discharged treated wastewater.

AB Monitoring sublethal effects of pharmaceuticals on nontarget species in aquatic environments has become an important topic in ecotoxicology, yet few studies have been conducted concerning the effects of beta-blockers on aquatic organisms. The present study investigated the effects of the beta-blocker sotalol (SOT) at 3 environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history traits of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of SOT, the authors hypothesized reduced numbers of embryos in the brood pouches, decelerated growth of adult snails, and smaller size of neonates, but no effect on mortality rates of adults. Contrary to the hypothesis, the total number of embryos was significantly higher after 56 d of exposure at nominal concentrations of 0.05 mu g/L and 1.0 mu g/L by 107% and 73%, respectively. No differences in embryo numbers were observed at earlier time-points. Therefore, the mode of action seems to be an extension of the reproductive period rather than an increase of the embryo production. Furthermore, our results indicate a hormetic dose-response relationship, because no effects were observed at the highest test-concentration (6.5 mu g/L). Mortality, growth of adult snails, and neonate sizes were not affected by the beta-blocker. Given the strong influence on reproduction, the effects of sublethal concentrations of SOT and other beta-blockers deserve better consideration in ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB Wastewater irrigation is often performed by flood irrigation, leading to changes in redox potential (Eh) of irrigated soils. In addition to soil organic matter, Fe-(hydr) oxides are important sorbents for pollutants, and biotransformation of pollutants can be accelerated under reducing conditions. Here, the influence of reducing conditions on the release of sorbed pharmaceuticals from soil and their potential accelerated dissipation was investigated in a microcosm study. Samples of a soil from the Mezquital Valley (Mexico) irrigated for 85 yr with untreated wastewater were incubated under oxidizing (Eh of 500 +/- 20 mV), weakly reducing (Eh of 100 +/- 20 mV), and moderately reducing (Eh of -100 +/- 20 mV) soil conditions for 30 to 31 d. The concentrations of nine pharmaceuticals (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, enrofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, and naproxen) were extracted via solid-phase extraction from soil slurries and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Low Eh did not lead to a release of formerly sorbed pharmaceuticals from the wastewater irrigated soil. High pH values (> 8) of the examined soil resulting from denitrification under reducing conditions prevented the dissolution of Fe-(hydr) oxides and, hence, the potential release of pharmaceuticals. A trend of decreasing concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate with time under moderately reducing conditions supports previous findings of a transformation of these compounds under anaerobic conditions.

AB Application of subcritical and supercritical water technology for destruction of pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole) was investigated. The experiments were conducted inside batch reactor at a temperature ranging from 473 to 773 K and with different residence times of 5 to 50 min. The results show that carbamazepine, metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole are destructed by 90.27%, 99.99% and 98.84% after a 20 min exposure to 623 K, 673 K and 573 K, respectively. In comparison with the conventional methods of pharmaceutical waste treatment, the current technology provides a higher destruction efficiency (approximately 90-100%) which is achievable in shorter durations. NaOH and CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O were also applied as catalysts in the temperature range of 473 K to 723 K. Comparing these catalysts, CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O demonstrates a higher destruction efficiency, especially at lower temperatures. Based on the proposed pathway, the products of destructioncan be classified as environmentally-friendly compounds. The results show that this technology can be used as a green alternative for efficient removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater streams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns about cytostatic anticancer drugs in the environment are increasing, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the fate and impact of these cytotoxic compounds in the water cycle. In this context, the present work investigated the occurrence of 13 cytostatics and 4 metabolites in wastewater samples from various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from a large hospital from Spain. The target compounds belong to five different classes according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC), namely, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, plant alkaloids and other natural products, cytotoxic antibiotics and related substances, and other antineoplastic agents. Some of them have been classified as carcinogens in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). These compounds were determined by an automated on line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method. Results showed the presence of methotrexate (MET), ifosfamide (IF), cyclophosphamide (CP), irinotecan (IRI), doxorubicin (DOX), capecitabine (CAP), tamoxifen (TAM) and the metabolites endoxifen (OH-D-TAM), hydroxytamoxifen (OH-TAM) and hydroxypaclitaxel (OH-PAC) at levels ranging from 2 ng L-1 (for MET) to 180 ng L-1 (for TAM). Some of these compounds were found to be efficiently removed after wastewater treatment, e.g. MET, DOX and IRI, whereas other compounds, such as TAM, CP and IF remained largely unaltered. The behaviour of the target compounds during the common filtration step of the water samples was also investigated with the finding that some compounds are strongly adsorbed to nylon filters, while cellulose acetate appears as the best choice for the filter material. The aquatic environmental risk associated to the detected compounds was also assessed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of the metabolites OH-D-TAM and OH-TAM in the water cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Siloxanes are widely used in various industrial applications as well as in personal care products. Despite their widespread use and potential toxic effects, few studies have reported on the occurrence of siloxanes in the environment. In this study, we determined the concentrations of 5 cyclic and 15 linear siloxanes in sludge collected from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. Total concentrations of 20 siloxanes (Sigma siloxane) in sludge ranged from 0.05 to 142 (mean: 45.7) mu g/g dry weight, similar to the concentrations reported in European countries but higher than those reported in China. The concentrations of siloxanes in sludge from domestic WWTPs were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those from industrial WWTPs, indicating higher consumption of siloxanes in various personal care products (e.g. shampoos and conditioners). The major siloxane compounds found in sludge were decamethylcyclopentasilane (D5), docosamethyldecasiloxane (L10) and dodecamethylcyclohexasilane (D6), which collectively accounted for, on average, 62% of the Sigma siloxane concentrations. Non-parametric multidimensional scaling ordination of the profiles of siloxanes indicated the existence of different usage patterns of siloxanes between industrial and household activities. Multiple linear regression analysis of siloxane concentrations and WWTP characteristics suggested that D5, D6 and linear siloxane concentrations in sludge were positively correlated with population served by a WWTP. Environmental emission fluxes of cyclic and linear siloxanes through sludge disposal in Korea were 14,800 and 18,500 kg/year, respectively. This is the first report describing occurrence and environmental emission of siloxanes through sludge in Korea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atenolol is a highly prescribed anti-hypertensive pharmaceutical and a member of the group of beta-blockers. It has been detected at concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 in waste and surface waters. The present study aimed to assess the sub-lethal effects of atenolol on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and to determine its tissue-specific bioconcentration. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed for 21 and 42 days to three concentration levels of atenolol (1 mu g L-1 environmentally relevant concentration, 10 mu g L-1, and 1000 mu g L-1). The fish exposed to 1 mu g L-1 atenolol exhibited a higher lactate content in the blood plasma and a reduced haemoglobin content compared with the control. The results show that exposure to atenolol at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mu g L-1 significantly reduces both the haematocrit value and the glucose concentration in the blood plasma. The activities of the studied antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were not significantly affected by atenolol exposure, and only the highest tested concentration of atenolol significantly reduced the activity of glutathione reductase. The activities of selected CYP450 enzymes were not affected by atenolol exposure. The histological changes indicate that atenolol has an effect on the vascular system, as evidenced by the observed liver congestion and changes in the pericardium and myocardium. Atenolol was found to have a very low bioconcentration factor (the highest value found was 0.27). The bioconcentration levels followed the order liver > kidney > muscle. The concentration of atenolol in the blood plasma was below the limit of quantification (10 ng g(-1)). The bioconcentration factors and the activities of selected CYP450 enzymes suggest that atenolol is not metabolised in the liver and may be excreted unchanged. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of 8 drugs of abuse and metabolites in the influent and effluent of the 3 Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) that treat wastewater from Valencia was studied in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Target drugs except 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-ACMOR) were detected in 100% of the influents. The WWTPs eliminate cocaine (COC), amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MAMP) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). Benzoylecgonine (BECG) was also efficiently eliminated (93-98%), whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) presented removal rates of 32-57% and ketamine (KET) was not eliminated. The most consumed illicit drugs, according to the estimated concentrations of each compound in the studied WWTPs, were cannabis and COC followed by KET, AMP, MAMP, MDMA and heroin. Environmental risk assessment was evaluated by calculating Risk Quotient (RQ). MDMA and KET could pose a medium risk and low risk, respectively, to the aquatic organisms. Although short-term environmental risk is not worrisome, long-term effects cannot be known exactly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance and effectiveness of sonophotolytic process, aerobic activated sludge (AS) process, and their combination in reduction of total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) from a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater (SPWW) are evaluated. Batch mode experiments are performed to obtain optimal experimental operating conditions of the sonophotolytic process. An ultrasonic power of 140 W, initial pH solution of 2, and air flow rate of 3 L min(-1) are found to be optimal operating conditions. The initial optimum molar ratio of H2O2/TOC was found to be 13.77 for the sonophotolytic process operated in batch mode. In continuous mode, a 90% TOC reduction was obtained in the sonophotolytic process after 180 min retention time, whereas only 67% in an aerobic AS process for retention time of 48 h. However, combined sonophotolytic and aerobic AS processes improved the biodegradability of the SPWW with 98% TOC and 99% COD removal while reducing the retention time in sonophotoreactor and aerobic AS bioreactor to 120 min and 24 h, respectively. Besides, the consumption of H2O2 was reduced significantly in the combined processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, membrane technologies (nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO)) have received much attention for micropollutant separation from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluents. Practically all micropollutants are retained in the concentrate stream, which must be treated. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been demonstrated to be a good option for the removal of microcontaminants from water systems. However, these processes are expensive, and therefore, are usually combined with other techniques (such as membrane systems) in an attempt at cost reduction. One of the main costs in solar photo-Fenton comes from reagent consumption, mainly hydrogen peroxide and chemicals for pH adjustment. Thus, in this study, solar photo-Fenton was used to treat a real MWTP effluent with low initial iron (less than 0.2 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (less than 2 mM) concentrations. In order to work at neutral pH, iron complexing agents (EDDS and citrate) were used in the two cases studied: direct treatment of the MWTP effluent and treatment of the concentrate stream generated by NF. The degradation of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) spiked in the effluent at low initial concentrations (mu g L-1) was monitored as the main variable in the pilot-plant-scale photo-Fenton experiments. In both effluents, pharmaceuticals were efficiently removed (>90%), requiring low accumulated solar energy (2 kJ uv L-1, key parameter in scaling up the CPC photoreactor) and low iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations (reagent costs, 0.1 and 1.5 mM, respectively). NF provided a clean effluent, and the concentrate was positively treated by solar photo-Fenton with no significant differences between the direct MWTP effluent and NF concentrate treatments.

AB Determining optimal ozone doses for organic micropollutant elimination during wastewater ozonation is challenged by the presence of a large number of structurally diverse micropollutants for varying wastewater matrice compositions. A chemical kinetics approach based on ozone and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) rate constant and measurements of ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures is proposed to predict the micropollutant elimination efficiency. To further test and validate the chemical kinetics approach, the elimination efficiency of 25 micropollutants present in a hospital wastewater effluent from a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) were determined at pH 7.0 and 8.5 in bench-scale experiments with ozone alone and ozone combined with H2O2 as a function of DOC-normalized specific ozone doses (gO(3)/gDOC). Furthermore, ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures, (OH)-O-center dot yields, and (OH)-O-center dot consumption rates were determined. Consistent eliminations as a function of gO(3)/gDOC were observed for micropollutants with similar ozone and (OH)-O-center dot rate constants. They could be classified into five groups having characteristic elimination patterns. By increasing the pH from 7.0 to 8.5, the elimination levels increased for the amine-containing micropollutants due to the increased apparent second-order ozone rate constants while decreased for most micropollutants due to the diminished ozone or (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Increased (OH)-O-center dot quenching by effluent organic matter and carbonate with increasing pH was responsible for the lower (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Upon H2O2 addition, the elimination levels of the micropollutants slightly increased at pH 7 (<8%) while decreased considerably at pH 8.5 (up to 31%). The elimination efficiencies of the selected micropollutants could be predicted based on their ozone and (OH)-O-center dot rate constants (predicted or taken from literature) and the determined ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Reasonable agreements between the measured and predicted elimination levels were found, demonstrating that the proposed chemical kinetics method can be used for a generalized prediction of micropollutant elimination during wastewater zonation. Out of 67 analyzed micropollutants, 56 were present in the tested hospital wastewater effluent. Two-thirds of the present micropollutants were found to be ozone-reactive and efficiently eliminated at low ozone doses (e.g., >80% for gO(3)/gDOC = 0.5). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The tetracycline, antibiotic considered as a recalcitrant pollutant, was successfully depleted from model aqueous solutions by immobilized laccase from Trametes versicolor in an enzymatic membrane reactor. The results obtained show that tetracycline is depleted from water solutions at room temperature and without adding any extra chemicals. The degradation of tetracycline in aqueous solutions at 20 mg L-1 during 24 h, with equivalent amounts of free or immobilized biocatalyst, allowed reaching a tetracycline degradation yield of 56% with an enzymatic membrane whereas it was only of 30% with free laccase. This result highlights the good reactivity and stability of the immobilized enzyme for the degradation of tetracycline. Moreover, the enzymatic membrane reactor was able to reach a constant degradation rate of 0.34 mg of tetracycline per hour during 10 days. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A number of important rivers of Romania were investigated for pharmaceutical and antifungal residues. In a post target approach analysis, a single-stage, high-resolution mass spectrometry was successfully applied for the screening of 43 pharmaceuticals and fungicides in water, using U-HPLC-Exactive Orbitrap MS at 50,000 full width at half maximum resolution. Detection was based on accurate masses and retention times. The study confirmed the presence of pharmaceuticals and antifungals such as diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, thiabendazole, and clotrimazole, in water. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were the most frequently detected (eight samples); concentrations ranged from 5 to 50 ng L-1. Low concentrations of griseofulvin were detected in the Prut River. Further monitoring studies should be carried out in order to fill the gaps of knowledge concerning the presence of pharmaceutical residues in Romanian water environment and to improve public understanding regarding the environmental risk of pharmaceutical contamination.

AB The sonophotocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical industry wastewater was studied with a TiO2 slurry mode process with UV 125 W medium-pressure mercury lamp coupled with ultrasound (100 W, 33 +/- 3 kHz). The degradation of wastewater was investigated in terms of reduction in COD that confirmed the apparent first- order degradation kinetics. The rate constant was greatly affected by catalyst dose, variation in pH, and concentration of oxidant (H2O2).The catalyst concentration was optimized at 1.0 g L-1, pH at 4, and the oxidant concentration at 0.075 g L-1. The first-order rate constants obtained from coupled sonophotocatalysis were two-folds than those obtained from photocatalysis and approximately ten-folds than sonolysis. The COD reduction follows the trend, sonophotocatalysis > photocatalysis > sonocatalytic > sonolysis. The study demonstrates better efficiency of coupled sonophotocatalysis over independent treatment processes.

AB Ozonation is one of the common methods for pollutant removal and disinfection in water treatment. The reaction between the ozone and organic pollutants involves complex oxidation pathway which may lead to the formation of various ozonation by-products. In some cases, toxic ozonation by-products may be produced. In this study, the ozonation by-products of acebutolol, one of the common B-blockers, were identified. The mechanisms for the transformation of acebutolol during ozonation were elaborated.
   In this study, ozonation was carried out at pH 2 (with the presence of radical scavenger), 7 and 12, in order to study the role of the ozone (O-3) and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) in the transformation of acebutolol. Structure elucidation of the ozonation by-products was carried out using HPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry. Sixteen ozonation by-products were identified, of which fifteen have never been reported elsewhere. Based on the detected ozonation by-products, acebutolol can be degraded by both O-3 and (OH)-O-center dot. When the O-3 itself becomes a reactive species, the transformation of the acebutolol proceeded via the reaction between the O-3 and the aromatic ring of the acebutolol to form the aromatic ring hydroxylated and aromatic ring opening by-products. Without the radical scavenger, ozonation at pH 7 and 12 showed that the transformation of the acebutolol proceeded via the involvement of the (OH)-O-center dot and different aliphatic chain degraded and hydroxylated by-products were detected.

AB Pharmaceutical pollutants are commonly detected in surface waters and have the potential to affect non-target organisms. However, there is limited understanding of how these emerging contaminants may affect macroinvertebrate communities. The pharmaceutical carbamazepine is ubiquitous in surface waters around the world and is a pollutant of particular concern due to its recalcitrance and toxicity. To better understand the potential effects of carbamazepine on natural macroinvertebrate communities, we related stream macroinvertebrate abundance to carbamazepine concentrations. Macroinvertebrate and water samples were collected from 19 streams in central Indiana in conjunction with other stream physiochemical characteristics. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to relate macroinvertebrate richness to carbamazepine concentrations. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively correlated with increasing concentrations of carbamazepine. From the SEM we infer that carbamazepine influences macroinvertebrate richness through indirect pathways linked to Baetidae abundance. Baetidae abundance influenced ephemeropteran abundance and FBOM percent organic matter, both of which altered macroinvertebrate richness. The pharmaceutical carbamazepine may alter freshwater macroinvertebrate species composition, which could have significant consequences to ecosystem processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are persistently exposed to pharmaceutical pollutants, including carbamazepine. Despite the ubiquity and recalcitrance of carbamazepine, the effects of this pharmaceutical on freshwater ecosystems and communities are unclear. To better understand how carbamazepine influences the invertebrate community and ecosystem dynamics in freshwaters, we conducted a mesocosm experiment utilizing environmentally relevant concentrations of carbamazepine (200 and 2000 ng/L). Mesocosms were populated with four gastropod taxa (Elimia, Physa, Lymnaea and Helisoma), zooplankton, filamentous algae and phytoplankton. After a 31 d experimental duration, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to relate changes in the community structure and ecosystem dynamics to carbamazepine exposure. Invertebrate diversity increased in the presence of carbamazepine. Additionally, carbamazepine altered the biomass of Helisoma and Elimia, induced a decline in Daphnia pulex abundance and shifted the zooplankton community toward copepod dominance. Lastly, carbamazepine decreased the decomposition of organic matter and indirectly altered primary production and dissolved nutrient concentrations. Changes in the invertebrate community occurred through both direct (i.e., exposure to carbamazepine) and indirect pathways (i.e., changes in food resource availability). These data indicate that carbamazepine may alter freshwater community structure and ecosystem dynamics and could have profound effects on natural systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work we studied the thermophilic biological treatability of high strength liquid wastes from a pharmaceutical industry (rich in organic matter - COD: Chemical Oxygen Demand, nutrients and salinity). Different mixtures (with concentrations of COD, phosphorus and chloride up to 57,000 mg L-1, 2000 mg L-1 and 9000 mg L-1, respectively) were tested. The pilot plant used in this work was designed and built with dimensions comparable to a semi-industrial unit. The results are therefore representative for full-scale applications. During four months of experimentation, the pilot plant (TAMR - Thermophilic Aerobic Membrane Reactor) was operated at 49 +/- 1 degrees C and the organic loading rate was 1.5-5.5 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1) with a hydraulic retention time of 5-10 days.
   Main results are the following: a) extremely high COD removal rate (up to 98%); b) very low sludge production (similar to 0.016 kg(VSS produced) kg(COD removed)(-1)); suitability as a pre-treatment to a conventional (e.g. activated sludge) biological treatment (the studied pharmaceutical industrial wastewaters are discharged into the sewer system for final polishing in a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant) and d) high phosphorus removal (up to 99%).

AB Metoprolol (MTP) is a compound of concern, considered as an emerging contaminant due to its high consumption, pseudopersistence and potential ecotoxicity. Activated sludge batch experiments were performed to evaluate the biological transformation of MTP and the formation of transformation products under different treatment conditions. Total MTP removal was obtained in aerobic conditions, and the formation of MTP known metabolites (metoprolol acid (MTPA), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha-HMTP) and O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP)) and unknown transformation products (TPs) was investigated. The three known metabolites and two new TPs generated along the experiments were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. For the two new TPs plausible structures were proposed based on the tentative identification. MTPA had the major ratio formation for the TPs identified along the experiments (up to 40% of initial MTP concentration after 96 h treatment) and its persistence through biological treatment was proven. Ecotoxicity studies using Vihriofischeri bioluminescent bacteria in an acute toxicity test showed that MTP and its known TPs are not toxic with the exception of o-DMTP. Finally, MTP and its TPs were monitored in a full scale membrane bioreactor and in a full scale conventional urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the results were compared with those obtained in batch experiments. alpha-HMTP was detected for the first time in a WWTP influent whereas MTPA was detected in influent and effluent WWTP samples at much higher levels (up to 100 folds higher) than MTP itself remarking its high persistence.

AB Electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) treatment of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen aqueous solution was investigated in this study. The E-peroxone process combined conventional zonation with electrolysis processes, and used a carbon-polytetrafluorethylene cathode to electrochemically generate H2O2 from O-2 in the sparged ozone generator effluent (O-2 and O-3 mixture). The in-situ generated H2O2 then reacted with the sparged O-3 to produce aqueous center dot OH, which can in turn oxidize pollutants effectively in the bulk solution. The E-peroxone process overcomes several intrinsic limitations of conventional zonation and electrolysis processes for pollutant degradation such as the selective oxidation with O-3 and mass transfer limitations of pollutants to the electrodes, and thus significantly enhanced both ibuprofen degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization. Results show that ibuprofen could be completely degraded much more rapidly in the E-peroxone process (e.g., 5-15 min under all tested reaction conditions) than in zonation (>= 30 min) and electrolysis (several hours) processes. In addition, thanks to the powerful and non-selective oxidation capacity of center dot OH, toxic intermediates formed during ibuprofen degradation could be completely mineralized in the E-peroxone process. The E-peroxone effluent (2 h) thus exhibited much lower toxicity (5% inhibition of bioluminescence of Vibrio fisheri) than the ozonation and electrolysis effluents (22% and 88% inhibition, respectively). The results of this study indicate that the E-peroxone process may provide a promising technology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global water shortage is placing an unprecendent pressure on water supplies. Treated wastewater is a valuable water resource, but its reuse for agricultural irrigation faces a roadblock the public concern over the potential accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into human diet. In the present study, we measured the levels of 19 commonly occurring pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in 8 vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater under field conditions. Tertiary treated wastewater without or with a fortification of each PPCP at 250 ng/L, was used to irrigate crops until harvest. Plant samples at premature and mature stages were collected. Analysis of edible tissues showed a detection frequently of 64% and 91% in all vegetables from the treated wastewater and fortified water treatments, respectively. The edible samples from the two treatments contained the same PPCPs, including caffeine, meprobamate, primidone, DEET, carbamazepine, dilantin, naproxen, and triclosan. The total concentrations of PPCPs detected in edible tissues from the treated wastewater and fortified irrigation treatment were in the range of 0.01-3.87 and 0.15-7.3 mg/g (dry weight), respectively. Annual exposure of PPCPs from the consumption of mature vegetables irrigated with the fortified water was estimated to be only 3.69 mu g per capital. Results from the present study showed that the accumulation of PPCPs in vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater was likely limited under field conditions.

AB Levels of flame retardants in house dust and a transport pathway from homes to the outdoor environment were investigated in communities near the Columbia River in Washington state (WA). Residential house dust and laundry wastewater were collected from 20 homes in Vancouver and Longview, WA and analyzed for a suite of flame retardants to test the hypothesis that dust collecting on clothing and transferring to laundry water is a source of flame retardants to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and subsequently to waterways. Influent and effluent from two WWTPs servicing these communities were also analyzed for flame retardants. A total of 21 compounds were detected in house dust, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB or EH-TBB), bis(2-ethylhexyl) 3,4,5,6-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), 1,2-bis(2,4,6,-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD or HBCDD), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and three chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (ClOPFRs), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP or TDCIPP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP or TCIPP), and tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP). Levels ranged from 3.6 to 82,700 ng g(-1) (dry weight). Of the 21 compounds detected in dust, 18 were also detected in laundry wastewater. Levels ranged from 47.1 to 561,000 ng Lc. ClOPFRs were present at the highest concentrations in both dust and laundry wastewater, making up 72% of total flame retardant mass in dust and 92% in laundry wastewater. Comparison of flame retardant levels in WWTP influents to estimates based on laundry wastewater levels indicated that laundry wastewater may be the primary source to these WWTPs. Mass loadings to the Columbia River from each treatment plant were by far the highest for the ClOPFRs and ranged up to 114 kg/yr for TCPP.

AB Nowadays, monitoring focuses on the primary compounds and does not include degradation products formed during various biological and chemical processes. Transformation products may have the same effects to human health and the environment or sometimes they can be more toxic than the parent compound. Unfortunately, knowledge about the formation of degradation products is still limited, however, can be very important for the environmental risk assessment. Firstly, the photodegradation kinetic of amlodipine was investigated in two experimental conditions: during the exposure to solar radiation and during the exposure to the light emitted by the xenon lamp. In all cases degradation of amlodipine followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. In the next step, identification of transformation products of amlodipine formed during the exposure to xenon lamp irradiation was performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). As a result sixteen photoproducts were identified, their structures were elucidated and ultimately the transformation pathway was proposed. Fifteen compounds (out of 16 photoproducts) were newly identified and reported here for the first time; some of those compounds were formed from the first photoproduct, amlodipine pyridine derivative. Several analytes were formed only in acidic or basic conditions. Furthermore, the occurrence of amlodipine and its identified degradation products was investigated in environmental waters. Only one out of 16 compounds was found in wastewater effluent. The possibility of the sorption of examined analytes to sewage sludge particles was discussed based on QSAR.

AB Naproxen-C14H14O3 is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which has been found at detectable concentrations in wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. Naproxen is relatively hydrophilic and is in anionic form at pH between 6 and 8. In this study, column experiments were performed using an unconsolidated aquifer material from an area near Barcelona (Spain) to assess transport and reaction mechanisms of Naproxen in the aquifer matrix under different pore water fluxes. Results were evaluated using HYDRUS-1D, which was used to estimate transport parameters. Batch sorption isotherms for Naproxen conformed with the linear model with a sorption coefficient of 0.42 (cm(3) g(-1)), suggesting a low sorption affinity. Naproxen breakthrough curves (BTCs) measured in soil columns under steady-state, saturated water flow conditions displayed similar behavior, with no apparent hysteresis in sorption or dependence of retardation (R, 3.85-4.24) on pore water velocities. Soil sorption did not show any significant decrease for increasing flow rates, as observed from Naproxen recovery in the effluent. Sorption parameters estimated by the model suggest that Naproxen has a low sorption affinity to aquifer matrix. Most sorption of Naproxen occurred on the instantaneous sorption sites, with the kinetic sorption sites representing only about 10 to 40% of total sorption.

AB Synthetic dyes are extensively used in textile dyeing, paper printing, color photography, and the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and leather industries. Most synthetic dyes are toxic and highly resistant to removal due to their complex chemical structures. There is a need for investigation of the biological treatment of synthetic dyes at a low cost and in the shortest possible time; synthetic dyes are used especially in the dye and textile industries and are an important polluting agent in the wastewater dumped into the environment by these industries. White rot fungus contains a variety of extracellular enzymes, and these enzymes are used for biological degradation of organic matter. The aim of the present work is to evaluate removal of the textile dye Turquoise Blue HFG by Coprinus plicatilis. Coprinus plicatilis was able to enzymatically decolorize 100% of the dye (dye concentration 10.0 and 25.0mg L-1). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric analyses, before and after decolorization, suggest that decolorization was due to biodegradation. There was an attempt to identify metabolites with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the end of the decolorization process. These results indicate that the samples did not include any detectable metabolite. Therefore, this fungus can be used as an economical and eco-friendly tool to minimize the pollution by industries to a significant extent.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of eleven selected organic micropollutants (OMPs) occurring in municipal wastewater in a 1-100 mu g L-1 concentration range during the treatment in two( planted and unplanted) pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in order to elucidate (i) the role of plants on the mass removal and (ii) to understand the removal behavior of the micropollutants at different sampling locations along the flow path. The research was conducted in Langenreichenbach (Saxony), Germany, over a period of one year. The high organic load was chosen for both constructed wetlands (CWs) to study the removal of OMPs, because it is often occurring in the "real" world, but seldom investigated as a research objective.
   The concentration of the OMPs in the treated inflow wastewater varied more strongly (by a factor of 10) than the total organic and nitrogen loads (by a factor of 4). A wide range of removal efficiencies were found. Higher removals were observed in the pilot-scale CW planted with Phragmites australis than in the unplanted one. The stimulant caffeine was the investigated OMP which showed the highest removal with an average efficiency of 66%. The average removal efficiency of the other OMPs was below 30%. The plants in the CWs supported not only the removal of the fragrances galaxolide and tonalide but also the removal of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, even under the conditions of high organic load. The endocrine disruptors bisphenol A and nonylphenol, and the antibacterial triclosan showed on average the lowest removal efficiencies. Under the studied operating conditions of high load, a positive correlation between the internal removal behavior of naproxen and diclofenac and concentration of sulfide was found.

AB This study shows the evaluation of the possible use of the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha for the removal of some recalcitrant contaminants, namely many pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse that are not sufficiently removed from civil wastewaters. This mollusk has an enormous filtering capability and is highly resistant to natural and anthropogenic stresses and to a significant bioaccumulation of lipophilic contaminants. All these characteristics may be particularly useful for the removal of compounds not easily eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment processes. To verify this hypothesis an experimental study was conducted at the pilot scale using a pilot plant installed in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Milan (Milano-Nosedo, Italy). First, we presented results obtained in several preliminary tests in order to evaluate the capability of zebra mussel specimens to survive in different wastewater mixtures, its filtering capacity and the possible influence of bio- and photo-degradation in the abatement of the molecules of interest. Finally, data obtained in the final tests demonstrated a capacity of this filter-feeder to reduce the concentrations of several pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse higher than that obtained by the simple natural sedimentation, suggesting a possible implementation of the bio-filtration process in wastewater management.

AB In the current work, an environmentally friendly chitosan-based flocculant (carboxyethyl chitosan, denoted CEC) was prepared to flocculate copper(II) and tetracycline (TC) simultaneously for the first time. The effects of flocculant dosage, pH, and initial contaminant concentration were systematically studied For a single contaminant system, CEC demonstrates the desired flocculation perforamance for copper(II) removal, whereas its TC removal efficiency is poor. However, it is notable to find that the removal of TC can be significantly enhanced when copper(II) coexists in the binary contaminant system. Compared to the commercial flocculants polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide, CEC enjoys the advantages of lower dosage requirement, higher removal efficiency, and better floc properties. The flocculation mechanism was investigated via pH monitoring, zeta potential, and floc property measurements. The results indicate that charge neutralization predominates for single contaminant copper(II) removal, while for binary contaminant removal, TC can be embedded in copper(II) hydroxides through coordination with the metal and finally synergistically eliminated with copper(II) This work gives a new approach to treating livestock wastewater and extends the application fields of flocculation.

AB The photodegradation rate of the anti-histamine cetirizine (Zyrtec (R)) was investigated in various water matrices. The average observed first-order photodegradation rate coefficient (k(obs)), obtained by linear regression of the logarithmic-transformed cetirizine concentrations versus irradiation time in simulated sunlight, was 0.024 h(-1) (n=6; standard deviation +/- 0.004) in deionized water corresponding to a half-life of approximately 30h. There was no statistical difference in the k(obs) of cetirizine photodegradation in coastal seawater compared with deionized water or deionized water amended with dissolved chromophoric organic matter. The quantum yield of cetirizine photodegradation decreased dramatically with increasing wavelength and decreasing energy of incoming radiation, with the average value ranging from 5.28x10(-4) to 6.40x10(-3) in the ultraviolet wavelength range (280-366nm). The activation energy of cetirizine photodegradation was 10.3kJmol(-1) with an observed increase in cetirizine photodegradation as temperature increased. This is a significant environmental factor influencing half-life and an important consideration, given that cetirizine has been detected in wastewater and receiving waters from different locations globally.

AB Sorption-desorption behavior of the antibiotic tetracycline (TET) and the synthetic estrogen hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) with wastewater sludge and sludge-derived humic substances [humic acid (HA) and humin] was investigated. From acidic functional group capacity and elemental analyses, HA had higher polarity, aromaticity, and acidity than humin; humin contained aliphatic chains with high mineral content. The different physicochemical properties of the pharmaceuticals and sludge components yielded different kinds of sorption-desorption interactions. Partitioning coefficients (K-d) of TET to sludge were higher (1,552 +/- 41-4,667 +/- 41 L/kg) than EE2 (534 +/- 52-609 +/- 47 L/kg). TET sorption was highly pH-dependent and maximal at pH 9. Ca2+ ions enhanced sorption, emphasizing the role of polyvalent metal ions in forming TET-sludge complexes. Humin was the dominant component for TET sorption due to its high inorganic matter content. In contrast, EE2 sorption was independent of solution pH, forming mostly hydrophobic interactions with sludge organic matter. EE2 had a high affinity for HA due to its chemical structure. Desorption of the two pharmaceuticals differed as well. The amount of desorbed TET (18.7 +/- 1.3-29.8 +/- 2 %) was lower than that of EE2 (60.6 +/- 3-62.3 +/- 2 %), and the hysteresis index was higher for TET than EE2. While TET desorption tended to be delayed in the solid matrix, EE2 desorbed easily and in accordance with the aqueous equilibrium concentration. The conclusions emphasize the need for further research into frequently used pharmaceuticals with different physicochemical properties and the recognition of sludge application as an important source of distribution for these contaminants in the environment.

AB Synthetic progestogens represent a class of pharmaceuticals widely used in oral contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapies. They reach the aquatic environment through wastewater effluents; however, environmental concentrations and effects on non-target organisms are poorly known. Given the important role of progestogens regulating fish spawning processes, this study aimed at assessing the in vitro interference of four currently used progestogens-drospirenone (DRO), levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone (NOR) and cyproterone acetate (CPA) - with key enzymatic activities involved in the synthesis of active steroids in carp (Cyprinus carpio). The enzymatic pathways investigated were (a) CYP17 (C17,20-Iyase) and CYP11 beta involved in the synthesis of androgens, (b) CYP19 that catalyses the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, and (c) 2013-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (2013-HSD) responsible for the synthesis of maturation-inducing hormones. All tested progestogens significantly inhibited the synthesis of androgens: DRO (IC50: 3.8 mu M) was the strongest inhibitor of CYP17 followed by CPA (IC50s: 183 mu M). Moreover, NOR (IC50: 0.4 mu M), DRO (IC50: 1.8 mu M) and CPA (IC50s: 87 mu M) inhibited CYP11 beta. An inhibition by NOR of ovarian CYP19 activity, and by DRO and CPA of 2013-HSD was also observed, but at rather high concentrations (500 mu M). Overall, this study highlights the potential of synthetic progestogens, and particularly DRO and NOR, to interfere with the biosynthesis of androgens in carp gonads. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biologically based wastewater treatment systems are considered a sustainable, cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment systems. These systems have been used and studied for the treatment of urban sewage from small communities, and recently, it has been reported that they can also effectively remove emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). EOCs are a new group of unregulated contaminants which include pharmaceutical and personal care products, some pesticides, veterinary products, and industrial compounds among others that are thought to have long-term adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. This review is focused on reporting the ability of biologically based wastewater treatment systems to remove EOCs and the main elimination mechanisms and degradation processes (i.e., biodegradation, photodegradation, phytoremediation, and sorption) taking place in constructed wetlands, ponds, and Daphnia and fungal reactors.

AB In a research project on risk management of harmful substances in water cycles, clindamycin and 12 further antibiotics were determined in different sewage samples. In contrast to other antibiotics, an increase of the clindamycin concentration in the final effluent in comparison to the influent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) was observed. A back transformation from the main metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin during the denitrification process has been discussed. Therefore, the concentration of this metabolite was measured additionally. Clindamycin sulfoxide was stable in the STP and the assumption of back transformation of the metabolite to clindamycin was confuted. To explain the increasing clindamycin concentration in the STP, the ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin was observed. The ratio increased in dry spells with concentrated samples and with long dwell time in the sewer system. A short hydraulic retention in waste water system and diluted samples in periods of extreme rainfall lead to a lower ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin concentration. A plausible explanation of this behavior could be that clindamycin was adsorbed strongly to a component of the sewage during this long residence time and in the STP, clindamycin was released. In the common sample preparation in the lab, clindamycin was not released. Measurements of clindamycin and clindamycin sulfoxide in the influent and effluent of STP is advised for sewage monitoring.

AB Six pharmaceuticals of different categories, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), and anti-microbial (trimethoprim), were investigated in wastewater of the urban areas of Ghaziabad and Lucknow, India. Samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction (SPE) and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The SPE-HPLC method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. All the six drugs were detected in wastewater of Ghaziabad, whereas naproxen was not detected in Lucknow wastewater. Results suggest that levels of these detected drugs were relatively higher in Ghaziabad as compared to those in Lucknow, and diclofenac was the most frequently detected drug in both the study areas. Detection of these drugs in wastewater reflects the importance of wastewater inputs as a source of pharmaceuticals. In terms of the regional distribution of compounds in wastewater of two cities, higher spatial variations (coefficient of variation 112.90-459.44 %) were found in the Lucknow wastewater due to poor water exchange ability. In contrast, lower spatial variation (162.38-303.77 %) was observed in Ghaziabad. Statistical analysis results suggest that both data were highly skewed, and populations in two study areas were significantly different (p < 0.05). A risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotient (RQ) in six different bioassays (bacteria, duckweed, algae, daphnia, rotifers, and fish) showed that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) posed high (RQ > 1) risk to all the test species. The present study would contribute to the formulation of guidelines for regulation of such emerging pharmaceutical contaminants in the environment.

AB The fate and transport of estrogen compounds in the environment is of increasing concern due to their potential impact on freshwater organisms, ecosystems and human health. The behavior of these compounds in batch experiments suggests low mobility, while field studies indicate the persistence of estrogen compounds in the soil with the possibility of migration to surface water as well as groundwater. To better understand the movement of these chemicals through soils, we examined their transport in three different Hawaiian soils and two aqueous matrices. The three different soils used were an Oxisol, a Mollisol and a cinder, characterized by different mineralogical properties and collected at depths of 60-90 cm and 210-240 cm. Two liquid matrices were used; deionized (DI) water containing calcium chloride (CaCl2), and recycled water collected from a wastewater treatment facility. The experiments were conducted in packed and structured columns. Non-equilibrium conditions were observed during the study, especially in the structured soil. This is believed to be primarily related to the presence of macropores in the soil. The presence of macropores resulted in reduced contact time between soil and estrogens, which facilitated their transport. We found that the organic carbon content and mineralogical composition of the soils had a profound effect on the transport of the estrogens. The mobility of estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was greater in cinder than in the other soils. In column experiments with recycled water, earlier breakthrough peaks and longer tails of estrogens were produced compared to those observed using DI water. The use of recycled water for agricultural purposes and the siting of septic tanks and cesspools should be critically reviewed in light of these findings, especially in areas where groundwater is the primary source of potable water, such as Hawaii.

AB This is a comparative study of photolytic degradation under exposure to UV254 nm and solar-simulator irradiation of a mixture of eight equally concentrated micropollutants in the presence of H2O2 and Fe(II) in ultra-pure water, Lake Geneva water, and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
   The electron spin resonance experiments point to a low singlet oxygen formation efficiency by the micropollutant mixture. This finding corroborates the micropollutants' chemical stability under UVC irradiation (in decreasing order: gabapentin, metformin, metoprolol, atenolol, clarithromycin, primidone, methylbenzotriazole, and benzotriazole). The oxidation rate increased in the presence of low-concentration H2O2 and Fe(II), except for metformin and gabapentin. Gabapentin and metformin were the most persistent compounds, with less than 24% being removed after 60 min of UV254/H2O2/Fe(II) treatment. The low removal rates were observed in WWTP effluent and lake water, and using sunlight simulation.
   Guanylurea, phenol, oxalic acid, tartronic acid, glycolic acid, oxamic acid, and maleic acid, could also be detected as fragmental oxidation products. Furthermore, up to 300 mu g/L of nitrate and ammonia were identified as final degradation products. Ecotoxicological tests showed that the degradation products are more toxic for algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii than the parent compounds themselves. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The antidepressant venlafaxine is detected at parts per billion levels in tertiary-treated municipal wastewater effluent. However, the impact of this serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) on non-target aquatic animals is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that environmentally relevant levels of venlafaxine disrupt the highly conserved cortisol and glucose response to stress in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile trout were exposed to venlafaxine (0, 0.2 and 1.0 mu g/L) in a static system with daily renewal for seven days. The fish were then subjected to an acute handling disturbance and sampled either prior to (0 h) or 1,4 and 24h after stressor exposure. Venlafaxine exposure did not affect the handling disturbance-mediated transient elevation in plasma cortisol levels or target tissue glucocorticoid receptor expression. The drug exposure disrupted the interrenal steroidogenic capacity, including altered handling stressor-mediated changes in mRNA abundances of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage. The handling stressor-induced transient elevations in plasma glucose levels were significantly reduced in the venlafaxine-exposed fish. This was not accompanied by changes in liver glycogen content, glucose transporter 2 mRNA abundance or the glycolytic capacity, whereas the capacity for gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism were enhanced. Venlafaxine also brought about changes in the gill of trout, including enhanced lactate dehydrogenase activity and Na+-K+ ATPase protein expression, while the Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity was reduced. Collectively, our results demonstrate that venlafaxine at levels detected in the aquatic environment impacts tissue metabolic capacities and may compromise the adaptive responses to an acute stressor in rainbow trout.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern, particularly endocrine active compounds (EACs), have been identified as a threat to aquatic wildlife. However, little is known about the impact of EACs on lakes through groundwater from onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). This study aims to identify specific contributions of OWTS to Sullivan Lake, Minnesota, USA. Lake hydrology, water chemistry, caged bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) exposures were used to assess whether EACs entered the lake through OWTS inflow and the resultant biological impact on fish. Study areas included two OWTS-influenced near-shore sites with native bluegill spawning habitats and two in-lake control sites without nearby EAC sources. Caged bluegill sunfish were analyzed for plasma vitellogenin concentrations, organosomatic indices, and histological pathologies. Surface and porewater was collected from each site and analyzed for EACs. Porewater was also collected for laboratory exposure of larval fathead minnow, before analysis of predator escape performance and gene expression profiles. Chemical analysis showed EACs present at low concentrations at each study site, whereas discrete variations were reported between sites and between summer and fall samplings. Body condition index and liver vacuolization of sunfish were found to differ among study sites as did gene expression in exposed larval fathead minnows. Interestingly, biological exposure data and water chemistry did not match. Therefore, although results highlight the potential impacts of seepage from OWTS, further investigation of mixture effects and life history factor as well as chemical fate is warranted.

AB The removal performances of nitrogen and trace levels of endocrine-disrupting pesticides (cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos) were studied in the enhanced biofilm pretreatment system at various substrates concentrations and dissolve oxygen (DO) niches. No significant change of EDPs removal occurred with the increased feed of ammonia nitrogen in aerobic batch tests or nitrate in anaerobic batch reactors, but significantly enhanced via reed addition both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Simultaneously enhanced denitrification and EDPs removal were achieved in the anoxic niche with reed addition. The results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) indicated that new bands appeared, and some bands became more intense with the reed addition. Sequences analysis showed that the dominant species belonged to Methylophilaceae, Hyphomicrobium, Bacillus and Thauera, which were related to the nitrogen or EDPs removals. In addition, the growth of functional heterotrophic microbes may be promoted via reed addition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of solids retention time (SRT) on estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal in an activated sludge plant (ASP) was examined using a pilot plant to closely control operation. Ex situ analytical methods were simultaneously used to enable discrimination of the dominant mechanisms governing estrogen removal following transitions in SRT from short (3 d) to medium (10 d) and long (27 d) SRTs which broadly represent those encountered at full-scale. Total estrogen (Sigma(EsT), i.e., sum of E1, E2, E3 and EE2) removals which account for aqueous and particulate concentrations were 70 +/- 8, 95 +/- 1 and 93 +/- 2% at 3, 10 and 27 d SRTs respectively. The improved removal observed following an SRT increase from 3 to 10 d was attributable to the augmented biodegradation of the natural estrogens El and E2. Interestingly, estrogen biodegradation per bacterial cell increased with SRT. These were 499, 1361 and 1750 ng 10(12) viable cells(-1) d(-1). This indicated an improved efficiency of the same group or the development of a more responsive group of bacteria. In this study no improvement in absolute Sigma(EsT) removal was observed in the ASP when SRT increased from 10 to 27 d. However, batch studies identified an augmented biomass sorption capacity for the more hydrophobic estrogens E2 and EE2 at 27 d, equivalent to an order of magnitude. The lack of influence on estrogen removal during pilot plant operation can be ascribed to their distribution within activated sludge being under equilibrium. Consequently, lower wastage of excess sludge inherent of long SRT operation counteracts any improvement in sorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assessed the tolerance acquired by stream biofilms to two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen and diclofenac. Biofilms came from a stream system receiving the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The response of biofilms from a non-polluted site (upstream the WWTP) was compared to that of others downstream with relevant and decreasing levels of NSAIDs. Experiments performed in the laboratory following the pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach determined that both algae and microbial communities from biofilms of the sites exposed at the highest concentrations of ibuprofen and diclofenac acquired tolerance to the mixture of these NSAIDs occurring at the sites. It was also observed that the chronic pollution by the WWTP effluent affected the microbial metabolic profile, as well as the structure of the algal community. The low (at ng L-1 level) but chronic inputs of pharmaceuticals to the river ecosystem result in tolerant communities of lower diversity and altered microbial metabolism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the occurrence and distribution of sixteen antibiotics belonging to four groups in surface water, sediment and groundwater samples from the Wangyang River (WYR), a typical river receiving sewage discharges were investigated. Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the studied area. The aqueous samples were unavoidably contaminated with antibiotics, and the target antibiotics present in high levels were oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant at 3.6 x 10(5), 9.7 x 10(3), 6.9 x 10(4), 1.2 x 10(4), 4.8 x 10(3), and 1.1 x 10(3) ng L-1, respectively. Oxytetracycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin were the most frequently detected compounds in sediment samples, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant at 1.6 x 10(5), 1.7 x 10(4), 2.1 x 10(3) and 2.5 x 10(3) ng g(-1), respectively. The results also revealed that the high intensity of aquaculture activities could contribute to the increasing levels of antibiotics in the area. According to the ratios of measured environmental concentration (MEC) to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC), chlortetracycline, tetracycline, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin-H2O and sulfamethoxazole may present possible environmental risk to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Synechococcus leopoliensis and M. aeruginosa. Attention should be given to the long-term ecological effects caused by the continuous discharge of antibiotics in the WYR area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are present in the environment, and many of their adverse effects are unknown. The environmental risk assessment of 26 PPCPs of relevant consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment in Spain was accomplished in this research. Based on the ecotoxicity values obtained by bioluminescence and respirometry assays and by predictions using the US EPA ecological structure-activity relationship (ECOSAR (TM)), the compounds were classified following the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. According to the criteria of the European Medicines Agency, the real risk of impact of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the aquatic environment was predicted. In at least two ecotoxicity tests, 65.4 % of the PPCPs under study showed high toxicity or were harmful to aquatic organisms. The global order of the species' sensitivity to the PPCPs considered was as follows: Vibrio fischeri (5 min) > Vibrio fischeri (15 min) > algae > crustaceans > fish > biomass of WWTP. Acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clofibrate, ibuprofen, omeprazole, triclosan, parabens and 1,4-benzoquinone showed some type of risk for the aquatic environments and/or for the activated sludge of WWTPs. Development of acute and chronic ecotoxicity data, the determination of predicted and measured environmental concentrations of PPCPs, the inclusion of metabolites and transformation products and the evaluation of mixtures of these compounds will allow further improvements of the results of the ERAs and, finally, to efficiently identify the compounds that could affect the environment.

AB The influence of uncertainties in biokinetic parameters for ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria on the performance of a two-step nitrification model was evaluated using the Generalized Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique. The predictive capability of behavioral simulations generated using GLUE was assessed utilizing data from experiments comparing nitrification in the presence and absence of two pharmaceuticals - atenolol or sotalol. Results suggest that GLUE cannot account for model structural error arising when ammonia oxidation is competitively inhibited. Use of a competitive inhibition model for ammonia oxidation (i.e., correction of the model structural error), however, enables GLUE to generate meaningful uncertainty intervals. While GLUE is used in the present study, other uncertainty analysis techniques are likely to be similarly unable to account for model structural errors. Thus, results from this study emphasize the importance of model selection for efficacious uncertainty analysis. The behavioral simulations generated using GLUE based on application of the correct model was subsequently used to evaluate the sensitivity of transformation coefficients employed to describe the cometabolism of atenolol by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Sensitivity was assessed by computing nonparametric elasticities of the cometabolism transformation coefficients to biokinetic parameters selected to describe nitrification in a novel application of a generalized nonparametric analysis. Results suggest that the AOB-growth related transformation coefficient of atenolol is relatively insensitive to variation in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing biokinetic parameters. In contrast, the non-growth related transformation coefficient describing atenolol cometabolism appears to be sensitive to the specific growth rate of AOB. Elasticities are used to assess whether estimates of atenolol-AOB cometabolic biodegradation coefficients from lab-scale experiments could be used more generally. This novel application of elasticities to biological wastewater process modeling suggests that seasonal temperature variations may be an important factor in pharmaceutical biodegradation during biological wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) enter the soil environment via irrigation with treated wastewater, groundwater recharge, and land application of biosolids. The transformation and fate of PPCP/EDCs in soil affects their potential for plant uptake and groundwater pollution. This study examined four PPCP/EDCs (bisphenol A, diclofenac, naproxen, and 4-nonylphenol) in soil by using C-14-labeling and analyzing mineralization, extractable residue, bound residue, and formation of transformation products. At the end of 112 d of incubation, the majority of C-14-naproxen and C-14-diclofenac was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14, while a majority of C-14-bisphenol A and C-14-nonylphenol was converted to bound residue. After 112 d, the estimated half-lives of the parent compounds were only 1.4-5.4 d. However a variety of transformation products were found and several for bisphenol A and diclofenac were identified, suggesting the need to consider degradation intermediates in soils impacted by PPCP/EDCs.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of shallow groundwater is a substantial concern in effluent-dominated streams, due to high aqueous mobility, designed bioactivity, and effluent-driven hydraulic gradients. In October and December 2012, effluent contributed approximately 99% and 71%, respectively, to downstream flow in Fourmile Creek, Iowa, USA. Strong hydrologic connectivity was observed between surface-water and shallow-groundwater. Carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and immunologically-related compounds were detected in groundwater at greater than 0.02 mu g L-1 at distances up to 6 m from the stream bank. Direct aqueous-injection HPLC-MS/MS revealed 43% and 55% of 110 total pharmaceutical analytes in surface-water samples in October and December, respectively, with 16% and 6%, respectively, detected in groundwater approximately 20 m from the stream bank. The results demonstrate the importance of effluent discharge as a driver of local hydrologic conditions in an effluent-impacted stream and thus as a fundamental control on surface-water to groundwater transport of effluent-derived pharmaceutical contaminants.

AB The presence of 10 anticancer drugs was studied along the entire urban water cycle -from hospital effluents through urban wastewater treatment plant till surface waters- and their potential environmental risk was assessed. Azathioprine, etoposide, docetaxel, paclitaxel, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin were detected in hospital effluent and in the urban influent of the sewage treatment plant although most of them were totally eliminated after WWTP. Only cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin were found in both WWTP effluent and in the receiving river at a concentration range between nd-20 ng L-1, 25-38 ng L-1 and 7-103 ng L-1 respectively. Tamoxifen and ciprofloxacin, commonly used for veterinary practices, were also detected in the river upstream the sewage discharge. In addition, they both were considered to pose a potential risk to the environment based on the levels found in the WWTP effluent together with their ecotoxicological impact in selected organisms.

AB This work explores the competitive removal of pharmaceuticals from synthetic and environmental waters by combined adsorption-photolysis treatment. Five drugs usually present in waterways have been used as target compounds, some are pseudo-persistent pollutants (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and sulfamethoxazole) and others are largely consumed (diclofenac and ibuprofen). The effect of the light source on adsorption of drugs onto activated carbons followed by photolysis with TiO2 was assessed, being UV-C light the most effective for drug removal in both deionized water and river water. Different composites prepared from titania nanoparticles and powdered activated carbons were tested in several combined adsorption-photocatalysis assays. The composites prepared by calcination at 400 degrees C exhibited much better performance than those synthesized at 500 degrees C, being the C400 composite the most effective one. Furthermore, some synthetic waters containing dissolved species and environmental waters were used to investigate the effect of the aqueous matrix on each drug removal. In general, photocatalyst deactivation was found in synthetic and environmental waters. This was particularly evident in the experiments performed with bicarbonate ions as well as with wastewater effluent. In contrast, tests conducted in seawater showed adsorption and photocatalytic degradation yields comparable to those obtained in deionized water. Considering the peculiarities of substrate competition in each aqueous matrix, the combined adsorption-photolysis treatment generally increased the overall elimination of drugs in water.

AB Pharmaceuticals are commonly found both in the aquatic and the agricultural environments as a consequence of the human activities and associated discharge of wastewater effluents to the environment. The utilization of treated effluent for crop irrigation, along with land application of manure and biosolids, accelerates the introduction of these compounds into arable lands and crops. Despite the low concentrations of pharmaceuticals usually found, the continuous introduction into the environment from different pathways makes them 'pseudo-persistent'. Several reviews have been published regarding the potential impact of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals on arable land. However, plant uptake as well as phytotoxicity data are scarcely studied. Simultaneously, phytoremediation as a tool for pharmaceutical removal from soils, sediments and water is starting to be researched, with promising results. This review gives an in-depth overview of the phytotoxicity of pharmaceuticals, their uptake and their removal by plants. The aim of the current work was to map the present knowledge concerning pharmaceutical interactions with plants in terms of uptake and the use of plant-based systems for phytoremediation purposes.

AB Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify sources of emerging organic contaminants in the Zumbro River watershed in Southeastern Minnesota. Two main principal components (PCs) were identified, which together explained more than 50% of the variance in the data. Principal Component 1 (PC1) was attributed to urban wastewater-derived sources, including municipal wastewater and residential septic tank effluents, while Principal Component 2 (PC2) was attributed to agricultural sources. The variances of the concentrations of cotinine, DEET and the prescription drugs carbamazepine, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole were best explained by PC1, while the variances of the concentrations of the agricultural pesticides atrazine, metolachlor and acetochlor were best explained by PC2. Mixed use compounds carbaryl, iprodione and daidzein did not specifically group with either PC1 or PC2. Furthermore, despite the fact that caffeine and acetaminophen have been historically associated with human use, they could not be attributed to a single dominant land use category (e.g., urban/residential or agricultural). Contributions from septic systems did not clarify the source for these two compounds, suggesting that additional sources, such as runoff from biosolid-amended soils, may exist. Based on these results, PCA may be a useful way to broadly categorize the sources of new and previously uncharacterized emerging contaminants or may help to clarify transport pathways in a given area. Acetaminophen and caffeine were not ideal markers for urban/residential contamination sources in the study area and may need to be reconsidered as such in other areas as well.

AB A sensitive method was developed to measure the sediment concentration of 10 wastewater micropollutants selected as potential sanitary tracers of sewage contamination and include: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (acetaminophen - ACE and diclofenac - DIC), an anti-epileptic drug (carbamazepine - CBZ), a beta-blocker (atenolot - ATL), a stimulant (caffeine - CAF), a bronchoditator (theophylline - THEO), steroid hormones (progesterone - PRO and medroxyprogesterone - MedP), an artificial sweetener (aspartame - APM) and personal care products (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide - DEET). Natural sediments (combined sewer overflow and stream sediments) were extracted by ultrasonic-assisted extraction followed by solid-phase extraction. Analyses were performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation in positive mode (APCl+) with a total analysis time of 4.5 min. Method detection limits were in the range of 0.01 to 15 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) for the compounds of interest, with recoveries ranging from 75% to 156%. Matrix effects were observed for some compounds, never exceeding vertical bar +/- 18%vertical bar. All results displayed a good degree of reproducibility and repeatability, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 23% for all compounds. The method was applied to an investigation of stream and combined sewer overflow sediment samples that differed in organic carbon contents and particle size distributions. Acetaminophen, caffeine and theophylline (as confounded with paraxanthine) were ubiquitously detected at 0.13-22 ng g(-1) dw in stream bed sediment samples and 98-427 ng g(-1) dw in combined sewer overflow sediment samples. Atenolot (80.5 ng g(-1) dw) and carbamazepine (54 ng g(-1) dw) were quantified only in combined sewer overflow sediment samples. The highest concentrations were recorded for DEET (14 ng g(-1) dw) and progesterone (11.5 ng g(-1) dw) in stream bed and combined sewer overflow sediment samples, respectively. The ratio of concentration to its limit of detection (C : LOD) in sediments for a subset of compounds were compared to their C: LOD in water. In waters with a large capacity for dilution relative to fecal sources, the C: LOD ranges in sediments were greater than in water. Thus monitoring programs for fecal source tracking using wastewater micropollutants should consider sediment sampling, particularly for waters with highly diluted sources of fecal contamination.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals in our environment is a very important issue for environmental and health research. Although these substances have been detected in environmental compartments in low concentration until now, they will pose considerable environmental risk to ecosystems, animals and human due to their biological activity. Alternative plant based removal technologies that make use of some potential wetland species like Phragmites or Typha within traditional wastewater treatment plants have to be established to cope with this "new generation" of pollutants.
   We investigated uptake and translocation of diclofenac (1 mg l(-1)) in the macrophyte Typha latifolia L. during one week exposure in greenhouse experiments. Detoxification products and involved key enzymatic processes were identified. We also examined the oxidative stress induced by the treatment and the defense capacity of the plants.
   Rapid uptake and effective metabolism were observed, where glycoside and glutathione conjugates represent dominant metabolites. Up to seven-fold induction of glycosyltransferase activity was observed in roots, but not in shoots. Glutathione S-transferase activity was also induced, but to a lower extent. The activity changes of defense enzymes points to oxidative stress in the plants.
   Our results show that human pharmaceuticals can be metabolized by plants similar to xenobiotics, but that similarities to human metabolism are limited. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The enantiomeric and diastereomeric profiling of chiral pharmaceuticals (ephedrine, norephedrine, atenolol and venlafaxine) and illicit drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA)) was undertaken over a period of fourteen consecutive days in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the city of Valencia, Spain. Degradation efficiency of WWTPs was found to be compound and enantiomer dependent. Selective enantiomer enrichment was observed for several target analytes. Amphetamine and MDMA were enriched with R(-)-enantiomers. 1S,2S(+)-pseudoephedrine was found to be more readily degradable during activated sludge treatment than its diastereomer 1R,2S(-)-ephedrine. Atenolol underwent enrichment with either S(-xr)- or R(+)-enantiomer in different WWTPs. This unexpected enantiomeric variation in the stereoselective degradation of atenolol could be attributed to different processes utilized during activated sludge treatment. The application of (enantiomeric) profiling of wastewater revealed usage patterns of chiral drugs in the Valencia region. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Four side-by-side pilot-scale vertical flow (VF) constructed wetlands of different designs were evaluated for the removal of eight widely used emerging organic contaminants from municipal wastewater (i.e. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, diclofenac, tonalide, oxybenzone, triclosan, ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A). Three of the systems were free-draining, with one containing a gravel substrate (VGp), while the other two contained sand substrate (VS1p and VS2p). The fourth system had a saturated gravel substrate and active aeration supplied across the bottom of the bed (VAp). All beds were pulse-loaded on an hourly basis, except VS2p, which was pulse-loaded every 2 h. Each system had a surface area of 62 m(2), received a hydraulic loading rate of 95 mm/day and was planted with Phragmites australis. The beds received an organic loading rate of 7-16 g TOC/m(2)d. The sand-based VF (VS1p) performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than the gravel-based wetland (VGp) both in the removal of conventional water quality parameters (TSS, TOC, NH4-N) and studied emerging organic contaminants except for diclofenac (85 +/- 17% vs. 74 +/- 15% average emerging organic contaminant removal for VS1p and VGp, respectively). Although loading frequency (hourly vs. bi-hourly) was not observed to affect the removal efficiency of the cited conventional water quality parameters, significantly lower removal efficiencies were found for tonalide and bisphenol A for the VF wetland that received bi-hourly dosing (VS2p) (higher volume per pulse), probably due to the more reducing conditions observed in that system. However, diclofenac was the only contaminant showing an opposite trend to the rest of the compounds, achieving higher elimination rates in the wetlands that exhibited less-oxidizing conditions (VS2p and VGp). The use of active aeration in the saturated gravel bed (VAp) generally improved the treatment performance compared to the free-draining gravel bed (VGp) and achieved a similar performance to the free-draining sand-based VF wetlands (VS1p).

AB Aqueous solutions of mixtures of four pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacin and trimethoprim) both in Milli-Q ultrapure water and in a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant have been treated at pH 7 by different oxidation methods, such as conventional ozonation, photolytic ozonation, TiO2 catalytic ozonation, TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation and TiO2 photocatalytic ozonation. Experiments were carried out using a solar compound parabolic concentrator. The performance results have been compared in terms of removal of emerging contaminants (ECs), generation rate of phenolic intermediates, organic matter mineralization, ecotoxicity removal and enhancement of biodegradability. Also, the consumption of ozone to achieve certain treatment goals (95% removal of ECs and 40% mineralization) is discussed. Results reveal that solar photocatalytic ozonation is a promising oxidation method as it led to the best results in terms of EC mineralization (similar to 85%), toxicity removal (similar to 90%) and efficient use of ozone (similar to 2 mg O-3 mg EC-1 to achieve complete EC removal and similar to 18 mg O-3 mg TOC-1 to achieve 40% EC mineralization, respectively).

AB It is proposed that wastewater treatment facilities meet legislated discharge limits for a range of micropollutants. However, the heterogeneity of these micropollutants in wastewaters make removal difficult to predict since their chemistry is so diverse. In this study, a range of organic and inorganic micropollutants known to be preferentially removed via different mechanisms were selected to challenge the activated sludge process (ASP) and determine its potential to achieve simultaneous micropollutant removal. At a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the influence of an increase in solids retention time (SRT) on removal was evaluated. Maximum achievable micropollutant removal was recorded for all chemicals (estrogens, nonylphenolics and metals) at the highest SRT studied (27 days). Also, optimisation of HRT by extension to 24 h further augmented organic biodegradation. Most notable was the enhancement in removal of the considerably recalcitrant synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol which increased to 65 +/- 19%. Regression analysis indicates that this enhanced micropollutant behaviour is ostensibly related to the concomitant reduction in food: microorganism ratio. Interestingly, extended HRT also initiated nonylphenol biodegradation which has not been consistently observed previously in real wastewaters. However, extending HRT increased the solubilisation of particulate bound metals, increasing effluent aqueous metals concentrations (i.e., 0.45 mu m filtered) by >100%. This is significant as only the aqueous metal phase is to be considered for environmental compliance. Consequently, identification of an optimum process condition for generic micropollutant removal is expected to favour a more integrated approach where upstream process unit optimisation (i.e., primary sedimentation) is demanded to reduce loading of the particle bound metal phase onto the ASP, thereby enabling longer HRT in the ASP to be considered for optimum removal of organic micropollutants.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) can evade degradation in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and can be chronically discharged into the environment, causing concern for aquatic organisms, wildlife, and humans that may be exposed to these bioactive chemicals. The ability of a common STP process, conventional activated sludge (CAS), to remove PPCPs (caffeine, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, estrone, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, naproxen, 4-nonylphenol, tonalide, triclocarban and triclosan) from a synthetic wastewater was evaluated in the present study. The removal of individual PPCPs by the laboratory-scale CAS treatment plant ranged from 40 to 99.6%. While the efficiency of removal for some compounds was high, remaining quantities have the potential to affect aquatic organisms even at low concentrations. Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to influent recreated model wastewater with methanol (IM, solvent control) or with PPCP cocktail (IC), or CAS-treated effluent wastewater with methanol (EM, treated control) or with PPCP cocktail (EC). Alterations in hepatic gene expression (evaluated using a quantitative nuclease protection plex assay) and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) protein concentrations occurred in exposed fish. Although there was partial PPCP removal by CAS treatment, the 20% lower VTG transcript levels and 83% lower plasma VTG protein concentration found in EC-exposed fish compared to IC-exposed fish were not statistically significant. Thus, estrogenic activity found in the influent was retained in the effluent even though typical percent removal levels were achieved raising the issue that greater reduction in contaminant load is required to address hormone active agents.

AB In this study, photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide was modified by doping with silver metal. This was done by simple preparation procedure at room temperature. Different preparation conditions were studied and their effects on photocatalytic activity were investigated. The obtained nanopowders were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), specific surface area measurement, UV-Visible absorption, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples under simulated sunlight were evaluated with respect to their efficiencies for the degradation of five pharmaceutical compounds commonly present in hospital wastewater. Prepared samples showed very high efficiency for photodegradation of the studied pharmaceutical compounds. Maximum photodegradation rate of the simulated hospital wastewater was obtained using 1000 ppm of the material with 0.1% Ag/TiO2 (weight ratio) calcined at 300 degrees C and pH 5. However, the best pH of the degradation of each pharmaceutical compound varies according to the pKa. (C) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 886-894, 2014

AB Polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified chitosan was prepared and used to remove clofibric acid (CA) from aqueous solution. PEI was chemically grafted on the porous chitosan through a crosslinking reaction, and the effects of PEI concentration and reaction time in the preparation on the adsorption of clofibric acid were optimized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that PEI macromolecules were uniformly grafted on the porous chitosan, and the analysis of pore size distribution indicated that more mesopores were formed due to the crosslinking of PEI molecules in the macropores of chitosan. The PEI-modified chitosan had fast adsorption for CA within the initial 5 h, while this adsorbent exhibited an adsorption capacity of 349 mg center dot g(-1) for CA at pH 5.0 according to the Langmuir fitting, higher than 213 mg center dot g(-1) on the porous chitosan. The CA adsorption on the PEI-modified chitosan was pH-dependent, and the maximum adsorption was achieved at pH 4.0. Based on the surface charge analysis and comparison of different pharmaceuticals adsorption, electrostatic interaction dominated the sorption of CA on the PEI-modified chitosan. The PEI-modified chitosan has a potential application for the removal of some anionic micropollutants from water or wastewater.

AB An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of eight pharmaceutical compounds in biosolids from urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was developed and validated. The compounds evaluated were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen), lipid regulators (clofibric acid), and antibiotics (sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole). Ultrasound assisted extraction with a water-methanol solvent mixture (1:1, v:v) was performed and the compounds were then determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The design of the method was based on the application of the standard addition calibration methodology to reduce matrix interferences. Validation procedures were conducted with rabbit excrements as blank samples. Recoveries of the target analytes ranged from 76 to 131% in spiked samples at 50, 200 or 1000ngg(-1) dry weight (dw). The relative standard deviations were in the range of 5-15% and the method detection limits ranged from 2 to 12ngg(-1)dw. The method was applied to monitor pharmaceutical concentrations in biosolids from different WWTPs over an eight-month period (May to December 2011). Diclofenac, sulfapyridine and ibuprofen were detected in most of the samples whereas sulfamethazine and ibuprofen were the pharmaceuticals found in the highest concentrations (>200ngg(-1) dw on average).

AB Avermectin fermentation wastewater (AFW) is a highly toxic effluent generated in the pharmaceutical industry and is typically treated by using of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. This study aims to further optimize the overall treatment process to meet discharge standards and water quality for reuse. After the UASB reactor, the pretreated AFW undergoes Fenton oxidation, which improves the biodegradability of the UASB effluent and the removal of COD and ammonia in subsequent biotreatment processes. Optimal operating conditions for Fenton oxidation (pH = 3.5, H2O2 = 4 ml/l, FeSO4. 7H(2)O = 1.1 g/l) and anoxic-oxic-membrane bioreactor (AO-MBR) system (HRT = 72 h, reflux ratio = 300%) show an average removal rate of 84.3%, 79.4%, and 72.3% for COD, ammonia, and TN, respectively, which could be further treated by nanofiltration or reverse osmosis (NF/RO). Toxicity of the effluent was also significantly reduced. For a high-flux MBR system, HCl + NaClO was found to provide the best treatment for increasing the acceptable transmembrane pressure (TMP) caused by cake layer accumulation and fouling by inorganic metal ions. Study results demonstrate the potential of Fenton-AO/MBR process as a post-UASB reactor treatment and a pre-treatment of NF/RO, improving biodegradability, pollutant removal, and toxicity reduction of AFW.

AB The concentration of eleven antibiotics (trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin), three decongestants (naphazoline, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) and the antiviral drug oseltamivir's active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), were measured weekly at 21 locations within the River Thames catchment in England during the month of November 2009, the autumnal peak of the influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 pandemic. The aim was to quantify the pharmaceutical response to the pandemic and compare this to drug use during the late pandemic (March 2010) and the inter-pandemic periods (May 2011). A large and small wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were sampled in November 2009 to understand the differential fate of the analytes in the two WWTPs prior to their entry in the receiving river and to estimate drug users using a wastewater epidemiology approach. Mean hourly OC concentrations in the small and large WWTP's influent were 208 and 350 ng/L (max, 2070 and 550 ng/L, respectively). Erythromycin was the most concentrated antibiotic measured in Benson and Oxford WWTPs influent (max = 6,870 and 2,930 ng/L, respectively). Napthazoline and oxymetazoline were the most frequently detected and concentrated decongestant in the Benson WWTP influent (1650 and 67 ng/L) and effluent (696 and 307 ng/L), respectively, but were below detection in the Oxford WWTP. OC was found in 73% of November 2009's weekly river samples (max = 193 ng/L), but only in 5% and 0% of the late-and inter-pandemic river samples, respectively. The mean river concentration of each antibiotic during the pandemic largely fell between 17-74 ng/L, with clarithromycin (max = 292 ng/L) and erythromycin (max = 448 ng/L) yielding the highest single measure. In general, the concentration and frequency of detecting antibiotics in the river increased during the pandemic. OC was uniquely well-suited for the wastewater epidemiology approach owing to its nature as a prodrug, recalcitrance and temporally-and spatially-resolved prescription statistics.

ID TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE; CASSETTES
AB Antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing disease is an ever growing threat to the world. Recently, environmental bacteria have become established as important both as sources of antibiotic resistance genes and in disseminating resistance genes. Low levels of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are regularly released into water environments via wastewater, and the concern is that such environmental contamination may serve to create hotspots for antibiotic resistance gene selection and dissemination. In this study, microcosms were created from water and sediments gathered from a lake in Sweden only lightly affected by human activities. The microcosms were exposed to a mixture of antibiotics of varying environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e., concentrations commonly encountered in wastewaters) in order to investigate the effect of low levels of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance gene abundances and dynamics in a previously uncontaminated environment. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Abundances of seven antibiotic resistance genes and the class 1 integron integrase gene, intL1, were quantified using real-time PCR. Resistance genes sulI and ermB were quantified in the microcosm sediments with mean abundances 5 and 15 gene copies/10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Class 1 integrons were determined in the sediments with a mean concentration of 3.86x10(4) copies/10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies. The antibiotic treatment had no observable effect on antibiotic resistance gene or integron abundances.

AB In this study, we investigated the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals, clofibric acid and diclofenac, using UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 reactions. The degradation of diclofenac during UV photolysis reaction was faster than that of clofibric acid. Diclofenac was mainly removed by photolysis reaction; clofibric acid was more sensitive to OH radical. More effective removals of clofibric acid and diclofenac were observed when H2O2 was added in the UV photolysis reaction. The competition kinetics showed that the second-order rate constant between the OH radical and the pharmaceuticals was 5.57 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for clofibric acid and 2.45 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for diclofenac, respectively. The major reaction intermediates during the UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 reactions of clofibric acid were 4-chlorophenol and hydroquinone, and these intermediates were degraded as phenol with further reaction.

AB A hybrid ultrafiltration-osmotic membrane bioreactor (UFO-MBR) was investigated for over 35 days for nutrient and trace organic chemical (TOrC) removal from municipal wastewater. The UFO-MBR system uses both ultrafiltration (UF) and forward osmosis (FO) membranes in parallel to simultaneously extract clean water from an activated sludge reactor for nonpotable (or environmental discharge) and potable reuse, respectively. In the FO stream, water is drawn by osmosis from activated sludge through an FO membrane into a draw solution (DS), which becomes diluted during the process. A reverse osmosis (RO) system is then used to reconcentrate the diluted DS and produce clean water suitable for direct potable reuse. The UF membrane extracts water, dissolved salts, and some nutrients from the system to prevent their accumulation in the activated sludge of the osmotic MBR. The UF permeate can be used for nonpotable reuse purposes (e.g., irrigation and toilet flushing). Results from UFO-MBR investigation illustrated that the chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus removals were greater than 99%, 82%, and 99%, respectively. Twenty TOrCs were detected in the municipal wastewater that was used as feed to the UFO-MBR system. Among these 20 TOrCs, 15 were removed by the hybrid UFO-MBR system to below the detection limit. High FO membrane rejection was observed for all ionic and nonionic hydrophilic TOrCs and lower rejection was observed for nonionic hydrophobic TOrCs. With the exceptions of bisphenol A and DEET, all TOrCs that were detected in the DS were well rejected by the RO membrane. Overall, the UFO-MBR can operate sustainably and has the potential to be utilized for direct potable reuse applications

AB The World Health Organization recently proposed the inclusion of brominated congeners in addition to chlorinated congeners when computing the toxic equivalency (TEQ) of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) in assessments of human health risks. In the present study, 12 polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PBDD/Fs) were analyzed by gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry in the composited, archived biosolids that were collected in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia from 94 wastewater treatment plants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in its 2001 national sewage sludge survey. Two PBDDs and five PBDFs were detected in the biosolids composites at varying frequencies (40-100%) with a total mean concentration of 10,000 ng/kg dry weight (range: 630-42,800), of which 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hepta-BDF constituted about 95% by mass. Relative to commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) formulations, the ratio of PBDD/Fs to PBDEs in biosolids was 55-times higher (?0.002% vs ?0.11%), which indicates potential PBDE transformation or possibly additional sources of PBDD/Fs in the environment. The TEQ contribution of PBDD/Fs was estimated at 162 ng/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (range: 15-672), which is equivalent to 75% (range: 12-96%) of the total TEQ in biosolids. The TEQ of DLCs released annually to U.S. soils as a result of the land application of biosolids was estimated at 720 g (range: 530-1600 g). Among all known DLCs determined in biosolids, brominated analogs contributed 370% more TEQ than did chlorinated congeners, which indicates the need to include brominated DLCs in the exposure and risk assessment of land-applied biosolids.

AB Due to the large number of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in water and wastewater, their degradation during UV-based advanced oxidation (UV/AOP) is best monitored using a conservative indicator compound. The present study demonstrates the in situ use of sucralose, a widely consumed artificial sweetener, as a conservative probe for UV/AOP degradation of TOrCs. The main qualities of sucralose in this regard are its high concentration in wastewater effluent and surface water (enabling its direct detection), its resistance to direct UV photolysis, and its relatively slow reaction with hydroxyl radical. Degradation of sucralose was compared to the degradation of commonly detected TOrCs, across two AOPs (i.e. UV/H2O2 and UV/NO3), in both lab-scale and pilot-scale systems. In all cases, UV/AOP degradation of sucralose was slower than the degradation of the examined TOrCs, and is expected to be slower than the degradation of the majority of other environmentally relevant TOrCs. These results demonstrate the potential of sucralose as a conservative probe, to monitor the transformation of TOrCs during UV/AOP treatment. Furthermore, degradation of sucralose was slower than the degradation of many transformation products (generated during oxidation of TOrCs), implying that sucralose is also a valuable indicator for the decay of primary transformation products.

AB Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) may provide an alternative solution for the removal of co-contamination between antibiotics and heavy metals from livestock and poultry wastewater. A hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate interaction of tetracyclines (TCs) and copper (Cu) on growth of E. crassipes, removal of TCs and Cu by plants and their fates in solution. After 20 days, plant growth, concentrations and accumulation of Cu and TCs in plants, removal by plants, and dissipation in solution were significantly influenced by interaction of Cu and TCs. Influence of only Cu or TCs on plant growth was not significant, except for TCs at 15 mg L-1 which produced a negative effect on plant biomass. The presence of low-Cu and high-TCs acted synergistically to promote the negative effect of TCs on plant biomass, but increasing Cu concentration partially alleviated the adverse effect. Co-contamination of low-concentration Cu and TCs could exert antagonistic effects on the removal and accumulation of Cu and TCs by plants; in contrast, synergistic effects were found for the combination of high-concentration Cu and TCs. The Cu/TCs in solution could effectively be removed using E. crassipes. Plants significantly enhanced dissipation of TCs in solution. Hence, interaction of TCs and Cu should be taken into consideration when judging (1) an ecotoxicological potential of TCs and Cu residues in aquatic environments, and (2) removal efficiency of TCs and Cu in phytoremediation.

AB Widespread detection of numerous micropollutants including aromatic pharmaceuticals in effluents of wastewater treatment plants has prompted much research aimed at efficiently eliminating these contaminants of environmental concerns. In the present work, a novel hybrid bioreactor (HBR) of cross-linked enzymes aggregates of laccase (CLEA-Lac) and polysulfone hollow fiber MF membrane was developed for the elimination of acetaminophen (ACT), mefenamic acid (MFA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) as model aromatic pharmaceuticals. The MF alone showed removals of the three drugs varying approximately from 50 to 90% over the course of 8 h in the filtrate of aqueous solution. Synergistic action of the MF and CLEA-Lac during operation achieved eliminations from aqueous solution of around 99%, nearly 100% and up to 85% for ACT, MFA and CBZ, respectively. Under continuous operation, the HBR demonstrated elimination rates of the drugs from filtered wastewater up to 93% after 72 h for CBZ and near complete elimination of ACT and MFA was achieved within 24 h of treatment. Concomitantly to the drugs eliminations in the wastewater, the CLEA-Lac exhibited 25% residual activity while being continuously recycled with no activity in the filtrate. Meanwhile, the filtrate flowrate showed only minor decline indicating limited fouling of the membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study comprehensively analyzed 23 classes of 51 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the two major prongs of Jiulong River and its estuary in southeast China, where the levels of the targeted PPCPs were mostly unknown. For both Jiulong River and its estuary, nine PPCPs were detected with 100% detection frequencies including two anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs (ketoprofen and diclofenac acid), a stimulant (caffeine), a plasticizer (bisphenol A), two preservatives (methyl paraben and propyl paraben), two antimicrobials (triclosan and triclocarban) and a beta-blocks (metoprolol), among which bisphenol A and caffeine accounted for more than 60% in concentrations. PPCPs generally had higher concentrations in dry season than normal season and wet season, while certain PPCPs, such as UV filters, showed higher concentrations in wet season, which were presumed to be related to their usage patterns. The concentrations of PPCPs were significantly correlated to several quality parameters of the surface water. The selected sewage markers were also used to track sewage in the studied river and the ratios of easily removed markers and conservative markers were used to identify the contribution of raw or treated sewage input. From our result, Jiulong River and its estuary were likely polluted by potential discharge of raw sewage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to isolate and characterize a microbial culture able to degrade sulfonamides. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX)-degrading microorganisms were enriched from activated sludge and wastewater. The resultant mixed culture was composed of four bacterial strains, out of which only Achromobacter denitrificans PR1 could degrade SMX. This sulfonamide was used as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy with stoichiometric accumulation of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole. Strain PR1 was able to remove SMX at a rate of 73.6 +/- 9.6 mu mol(SMX)/g(cell) (dry) (weight) h. This rate more than doubled when a supplement of amino acids or the other members of the mixed culture were added. Besides SMX, strain PR1 was able to degrade other sulfonamides with anti-microbial activity. Other environmental Achromobacter spp. could not degrade SMX, suggesting that this property is not broadly distributed in members of this genus. Further studies are needed to shed additional light on the genetics and enzymology of this process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals is increasing in both hospitals and households. After administration, many compounds enter the water cycle as parent compounds or their metabolites via excretion. Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants are unable to efficiently remove all the different compounds found in sewage and, consequently, treated effluents are one of the main sources of persistent micropollutants in the environment. Hospital patients are administered relatively high quantities of drugs and therefore hospital wastewaters can consistently contribute to treatment plant influent loads, with the magnitude of environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals originating from hospital effluents largely unknown. This study has therefore developed a framework to enable authorities responsible for hospital management and environmental health to evaluate such risk, considering site-specific information such as the contribution of human population and hospital sizes, wastewater treatment removal efficiency, and potential dilution in the receiving water body. The framework was applied to three case studies, that are representative of frequent situations in many countries, and findings demonstrated that the degree of risk posed by any compound was site-specific and depended on a combination of several factors: compound concentration and toxicity, compound removal efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant and dilution factor. Ofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole were identified as compounds of concern and might require management in order to reduce risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human excreta are potential sources of plant nutrients, but are today usually considered a waste to be disposed of. The requirements on wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove nitrogen and phosphorus are increasing and to meet these requirements, more energy and chemicals are needed by WWTPs. Separating the nutrient-rich wastewater fractions at source and recycling them to agriculture as fertiliser is an alternative to removing them at the WWTP. This study used life cycle assessment methodology to compare the environmental impact of different scenarios for recycling the nutrients in the human excreta as fertiliser to arable land or removing them in an advanced WWTP. Three scenarios were assessed. In blackwater scenario, blackwater was source-separated and used as fertiliser. In urine scenario, the urine fraction was source-separated and used as fertiliser and the faecal water treated in an advanced WWTP. In NP scenario, chemical fertiliser was used as fertiliser and the toilet water treated in an advanced WWTP. The emissions from the WWTP were the same for all scenarios. This was fulfilled by the enhanced reduction in the WWTP fully removing the nutrients from the excreta that were not source-separated in the NP and urine scenarios. Recycling source-separated wastewater fractions as fertilisers in agriculture proved efficient for conserving energy and decreasing global warming potential (GWP). However, the blackwater and urine scenarios had a higher impact on potential eutrophication and potential acidification than the WWTP-chemical fertiliser scenario, due to large impacts by the ammonia emitted from storage and after spreading of the fertilisers. The cadmium input to the arable soil was very small with urine fertiliser. Source separation and recycling of excreta fractions as fertiliser thus has potential for saving energy and decreasing GWP emissions associated with wastewater management. However, for improved sustainability, the emissions from storage and after spreading of these fertilisers must decrease. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hospital effluents contribute to the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the environment due to their high load of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) and some endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs). Nowadays, hospital wastewaters are co-treated with urban wastewater; however, the dilution factor and the inefficiency of wastewater treatment plants in the removal of PhACs and EDCs make inappropriate the co-treatment of both effluents. In this paper, a new alternative to pre-treat hospital wastewater concerning the removal of PhACs and EDCs is presented. The treatment was carried out in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor under sterile and non-sterile conditions with Trametes versicolor pellets. Results on non-sterile experiments pointed out that 46 out of the 51 detected PhACs and EDCs were partially to completely removed. The total initial PhAC amount into the bioreactor was 8185 mu g in sterile treatment and 8426 mu g in non-sterile treatment, and the overall load elimination was 83.2% and 533% in their respective treatments. In addition, the Microtox test showed reduction of wastewater toxicity after the treatment. Hence, the good efficiency of the fungal treatment regarding removal of the wide diversity of PhACs and EDCs detected in hospital effluents is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of parabens (5 congeners), triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) at the scale of the Parisian sewer network and to provide representative knowledge on these compounds in France for a large area. For this purpose and in collaboration with the Parisian public sanitation service (SIAAP) in charge of the collect and treatment of the Parisian wastewater, this study focused on seven main sewer trunks of the Paris conurbation, accounting for 1 900 000 m(3) d(-1), i.e., about 8 million inhabitants. Concentrations lying in the 2000-20 000 ng l(-1) ranges were found in wastewater, confirming the ubiquity of parabens, TCS and TCC in our environment and household products. Parabens (>97%) and to a lesser extent TCS (68% in median) were mainly associated to the dissolved fraction, as demonstrated by low K-D and K-OC values. For the first time, this study also evaluated the pollutant mass loads per population equivalent (PE) of parabens, TCS and TCC at the large and representative scale of the Parisian conurbation. Hence, the median mass loads varied from 176 to 3040 mu g PE-1 d(-1) for parabens and from 26 to 762 mu g PE-1 d(-1) for TCS and TCC. Based on these results and according to the assumptions done, the extrapolation of the mass loads at the national scale pointed out an annual mass loads between 51.8 and 100.7 t y(-1) for methyl paraben (MeP) and between 11.2 and 23.5 t y(-1) for TCS. Mass loads per equivalent habitant and national mass loads are both extremely relevant and innovative data. Contrary to other countries, such data are nowadays rather difficult to gain in France and neither enquiry nor database provides access to information on the use and production of these chemicals. Since cosmetic industries are voluntarily and fully engaged in the substitution of parabens, triclosan and triclocarban in personal care product, this study could constitute a "time reference status" which could be used as a basis for future monitoring.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from the purchase and use of medications are recognized as ubiquitous contaminants of the environment. Ecological impacts can range from subtle to overt resulting from multi-generational chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple APIs (such as in the aquatic environment) or acute exposure to higher levels (such as with wildlife ingestion of improperly discarded waste). Reducing API entry to the environment has relied solely on conventional end-of-pipe pollution control measures such as wastewater treatment and take-back collections of leftover, unwanted drugs (to prevent disposal by flushing to sewers). An exclusive focus on these conventional approaches has ignored the root sources of the problem and may have served to retard progress in minimizing the environmental footprint of the healthcare industry. Potentially more effective and less-costly upstream pollution prevention approaches have long been considered imprudent, as they usually involve the modification of long-established norms in the practice of clinical prescribing. The first pollution prevention measure to be proposed as feasible (reducing the dose or usage of certain select medications) is followed here by an examination of another possible approach one that would rely on the excretion profiles of APIs. These two approaches combined could be termed eco-directed sustainable prescribing (EDSP) and may hold the potential for achieving the largest reductions in API entry to the environment largely by guiding prescribers' decisions regarding drug selection. EDSP could reduce API entry to the environment by minimizing the need for disposal (as a consequence of avoiding leftover, unwanted medications) and reducing the excretion of unmetabolized APIs (by preferentially prescribing APIs that are more extensively metabolized). The potential utility of the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) is examined for the first time as a guide for API prescribing decisions by revealing relative API quantities entering sewage via excretion.

AB Sewage profiling as a mean to estimate consumption of drugs of abuse is gaining increasing attention. However, only scarce data are available so far on the impact of microbial biotransformation on the presence and hence detectability of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in wastewater (WW) samples. The aim of this work was therefore to study the biotransformation pathways of the novel psychoactive substance 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MPDV) in WW by incubating it, based on the OECD guideline 314 A. MDPV was incubated (100 mu g/L) for 10 d at 22 degrees C in WW from a local WW treatment plant. Furthermore, urine and feces collected from rats administered 20 mg MDPV/kg BW were incubated correspondingly. Samples were worked-up either by centrifugation/filtration and solid-phase (HEX) extraction or QuEChERS. High resolution (HR) mass spectra (MS) were recorded using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. All products were identified via their HR-MS2 spectra and chromatographic properties. The observed biotransformations in WW were: demethylenation and subsequent O-methylation, hydroxylation at the phenyl part, hydroxylation at the pyrrolidine part with subsequent methylation or oxidation, N-demethylation, and hydroxylation at the alkyl part as well as combination of them. In total, 12 biotransformation products were identified after 10 days of incubation. Three of these biotransformation products were previously reported to be also rat and human metabolites. No additional MDPV biotransformation products could be found after incubating the rat urine and feces samples. Instead, the urinary phase II glucuronides were nearly completely cleaved after one day of WW incubation. The presented study indicates that demethylenyl-methyl MDPV, the most abundant metabolite in human urine, should be the best indicator in WW to estimate its use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The illicit manufacture of methamphetamine (MAP) produces substantial amounts of hazardous waste that is dumped illegally. This study presents the first environmental evaluation of waste produced from illicit MAP manufacture. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured to assess immediate oxygen depletion effects. A mixture of five waste components (10 mg/L/chemical) was found to have a COD (130 mg/L) higher than the European Union wastewater discharge regulations (125 mg/L). Two environmental partition coefficients, K-OW and K-OC, were measured for several chemicals identified in MAP waste. Experimental values were input into a computer fugacity model (EPI Suite (TM)) to estimate environmental fate. Experimental log K-OW values ranged from -0.98 to 4.91, which were in accordance with computer estimated values. Experimental K-OC values ranged from 11 to 72, which were much lower than the default computer values. The experimental fugacity model for discharge to water estimates that waste components will remain in the water compartment for 15 to 37 days. Using a combination of laboratory experimentation and computer modelling, the environmental fate of MAP waste products was estimated. While fugacity models using experimental and computational values were very similar, default computer models should not take the place of laboratory experimentation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study we characterised the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in biofilm and sediments from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge point and its receiving river. We also examined the prevalence of qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in these isolates and determined whether they harbour plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases such as TEM, SHV and CTX-M. Moreover, antibiotic concentrations were also measured to evaluate the level of contamination of these pharmaceuticals in the sampling area.
   Antibiotics were found in the range of ng L-1 in WWTP effluents, but most of them were no longer found in downstream river. However, some fluoroquinolones were detected in sediment downstream demonstrating their high persistence and their capacity to be retained in the river sediments. Most of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria class and 17 of them, 8 (7.6%) from the first sampling and 9 (6.1%) from the second sampling, carried a qnr gene. In particular, 15 isolates carried the qnrS gene and 2 carried the qnrB gene. Among the qnr-positive isolates, 12 harboured the aac(6')-lb-cr gene and 2 of them also carried a beta-lactamase on the same plasmid, indicating that they may be transferred simultaneously. It is also noteworthy that all qnr-positive isolates identified as Aeromonas species harboured the same qnrS allele, namely the qnrS2. This study reinforces the importance of environmental bacteria as vehicles for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the influence of fouling and solute-solute interactions on the rejection of four pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) by two commercial nanofiltration (NF) membranes for a water reuse purpose. Membrane bioreactor effluent was filtered and modification of membrane surface was fully characterized (roughness, MWCO, contact angle, zeta potential ... ). It was shown that polysaccharides and humic acid were the major compounds adsorbed on the membrane which causes the flux decline. Flux decline was more severe for NF-90 than NF-270 due to a higher roughness and hydrophobicity and smaller pore size. This fouling layer modified the membrane surface properties like hydrophobicity and charge. PhACs were then filtered in Milli-Q water, using virgin and pre-fouled membranes, or in real effluent, using virgin membranes, so as to identify basic phenomena involved in their retention. It appeared that changes in membrane surface affected transport and retention of salts and PhACs in comparison with unfouled membranes, especially for NF-270. The comparison between filtration of PhACs in Milli-Qwater or real effluent evidenced the effect of solute-solute interactions on retention. For all tested PhACs, rejection by NF-270 was improved when filtering spiked MBR effluent in comparison with spiked Milli-Q. The influence of the matrice was less pronounced for the NF-90. Two counteractive mechanisms appeared to be involved in the rejection of pharmaceuticals by a loose-NF like NF-270: adsorption onto macromolecules in the surrounding matrice resulting in increased rejection and the presence of a fouling layer leading to decrease in rejection. Finally, NF-90 could be a possible alternative to the systematic reverse osmosis scheme and allowed great rejection capacities and cost saving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The iodinated X-ray contrast medium diatrizoate is known to be very persistent in current wastewater treatment as well as in environmental compartments. In this study, the potential of anaerobic processes in soils, sediments, and during wastewater treatment to remove and transform diatrizoate was investigated. In anaerobic batch experiments with soil and sediment seven biologically formed transformation products (TPs) as well as the corresponding transformation pathway were identified. The TPs resulted from successive deiodinations and deacetylations. The final TP 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA) was stable under anaerobic conditions. However, DABA was further transformed under air atmosphere, indicating the potential for the mineralization of diatrizoate by combining anaerobic and aerobic conditions. With the development of a methodology using complementary liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques, all identified TPs were quantified and the mass balance could be closed without having authentic standards for four of the TPs available. The detection and quantification of diatrizoate TPs in groundwater, in technical wetlands with anaerobic zones, and in a pilot wastewater treatment plant established for anaerobic treatment highlights the transferability and up-scaling of the results attained by laboratory experiments to environmental conditions.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) are widely used anticonvulsants that are extensively metabolized in the human body. The pharmaceuticals and their human metabolites are present in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in rivers and streams, and in drinking water. In this study, the biodegradation of OXC and its main human metabolite, 10-hydroxy-CBZ (10OHCBZ), and the main human metabolite of CBZ, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (DiOHCBZ), was investigated in contact with activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sand filter material from a waterworks. The transformation of DiOHCBZ, 10OHCBZ, and OXC led to the formation of the following main TPs: 1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BaQD), 1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BaQM), 9-aldehyde-acridine, 9-carboxylic acid-acridine (9-CA-ADIN), hydroxyl 9-CA-ADIN, acridone (ADON), 11-keto-OXC, and 2,2'-(carbamoylazanediyl)dibenzoic acid. TP formation could be explained by three proposed transformation pathways, including reactions such as oxidation, alpha-ketol rearrangement, or benzylic acid rearrangement. The results highlight the fact that the TP abundances strongly depend on the concentrations spiked in the lab-scale experiments. BaQD, 9-CA-ADIN, and ADON were detected in WWTP effluents, rivers, and streams. 9-CA-ADIN was found at maximum concentrations in WWTP effluent and rivers up to 920 +/- 50 ng L-1 and 304 +/- 26 ng L-1, respectively. Even in drinking water, BaQD and 9-CA-ADIN were present at concentrations of 26 +/- 2 ng L-1 and 189 +/- 3 ng L-1, respectively.

AB Tetracycline (TC) are used as bacteriostatic agents, inhibits the synthesis of bacterial proteins, with activity against a wide variety of organisms with application in human and veterinary medicine. The presence of TC in the environment constitutes a serious problem, being weakly metabolized or absorbed into the human or animal body con. TC residues even in low concentration may produce serious toxic and other effects on humans and living organism. In this study are presented the applications of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) for degradation of TC using de BDD electrode. The influence of experimental parameters (COD, TOC, nitrogen (total Kjeldhal, organic and inorganic), HPLC and UV-Vis spectrophotometry) on electrochemical degradation is evaluated. A pseudo-first kinetic order is obtained for electrochemical reactions with BDD. Model TC solutions is used and different experimental conditions, namely, initial concentration, initial pH, applied current density, type and concentration of the electrolyte, is also tested. To study the influence of the experimental conditions on the degradation of the antibiotic, assays was been running at experimental conditions that allow kinetic and/or diffusive control, in order to determine medium mass transfer coefficients that help to predict degradation rates at experimental conditions other than those tested.

AB Concerns have emerged regarding the presence of human-use pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. We investigated the status of contamination by 29 human-use pharmaceuticals as well as wastewater indicator compounds, fecal sterols and the synthetic endocrine disruptor nonylphenol, in marine sediments from Masan Bay, one of the most contaminated bays in Korea as a result of untreated and/or treated sewage. Among the 29 pharmaceuticals determined, 10 including antacid, analgesic, antibiotic, and antipruritic compounds, and metabolites of caffeine and nicotine were detected in all sediment samples. Cimetidine, acetaminophen, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals (frequency > 50%), and at high concentrations. The highest concentrations and detection frequencies were at stations located close to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfalls and at the river mouth. The spatial distributions of pharmaceutical were significantly correlated with those of wastewater compounds. These results indicate that occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in marine environments is likely associated with direct sewage inputs, such as WWTP effluents and with other sewage-influenced sources, such as river discharge.

AB Recently, the fate of emerging compounds in environmentally relevant samples has attracted considerable attention. Solar semiconductor photocatalysis may offer an appealing methodology to treat such contaminants. At the same time the use of solar photocatalysis for water and wastewater disinfection is a topic well-documented in the literature. In this respect, the simultaneous degradation of synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and Escherichia coli removal employing simulated solar radiation and TiO2 as the photocatalyst was investigated. In general, the more complex the water matrix is the slower E. coli removal becomes, while the presence of E. coli in the reaction mixture did not obstruct EE2 removal.
   Although EE2 removal occurred relatively fast, overall estrogenic activity was only partially removed. This implies that other species inherently present in the effluent and/or some photocatalytic transformation by-products may be proportionately more estrogenic than EE2. Overall, the use of solar radiation can constitute an advantageous treatment strategy for the simultaneous removal of micro-pollutants and pathogens from secondary treated effluent.

AB Acetaminophen is globally one of the most prescribed drugs due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties. However, it is highly toxic when the dosage surpasses the detoxification capability of an exposed organism, with involvement of an already described oxidative stress pathway. To address the issue of the ecotoxicity of acetaminophen, we performed acute exposures of two aquatic plant species, Lemna gibba and Lemna minor, to this compound. The selected biomarkers were number of fronds, biomass, chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay), and proline content. Our results showed marked differences between the two species. Acetaminophen caused a significant decrease in the number of fronds (EC50 = 446.6 mg/L), and the establishment of a dose-dependent peroxidative damage in L. minor, but not in L. gibba. No effects were reported in both species for the indicative parameters chlorophyll content and total biomass. However, the proline content in L. gibba was substantially reduced. The overall conclusions point to the occurrence of an oxidative stress scenario more prominent for L. minor. However, the mechanisms that allowed L. gibba to cope with acetaminophen exposure were distinct from those reported for L. minor, with the likely involvement of proline as antioxidant.

AB Fifty samples of finished drinking waters (FDWs) from Spain covering 12 million inhabitants were tested for 53 pharmaceuticals pertaining to 12 different Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes. The studied compounds are a combination of most commonly consumed pharmaceuticals with other barely reported in the literature. Five compounds, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and ibuprofen were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in some samples (2 to 15 %), but only ibuprofen and azithromycin could be confirmed when analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with a quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument. Concentration levels of ibuprofen in the positive samples ranged from 12 to 17 ng/L (n = 6) while for azithromycin values from 5 to 9.5 ng/L (n = 3) were found. Ibuprofen fragmentation behaviour in different mass spectrometry instrument configurations (triple quadrupole, quadrupole-ion trap, and quadrupole-Orbitrap) was evaluated.

AB This work described the development, optimization and validation of an analytical method for rapid detection of multiple-class pharmaceuticals in both municipal wastewater and sludge samples based on ultrasonic solvent extraction, solid-phase extraction, and ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification. The results indicated that the developed method could effectively extract all the target pharmaceuticals (25) in a single process and analyze them within 24 min. The recoveries of the target pharmaceuticals were in the range of 69%-131% for wastewater and 54%-130% for sludge at different spiked concentration levels. The method quantification limits in wastewater and sludge ranged from 0.02 to 0.73 ng/L and from 0.02 to 1.00 mu g/kg, respectively. Subsequently, this method was validated and applied for residual pharmaceutical analysis in a wastewater treatment plant located in Beijing, China. All the target pharmaceuticals were detected in the influent samples with concentrations varying from 0.09 ng/L (tiamulin) to 15.24 mu g/L (caffeine); meanwhile, up to 23 pharmaceuticals were detected in sludge samples with concentrations varying from 60 ng/kg (sulfamethizole) to 8.55 mg/kg (ofloxacin). The developed method demonstrated its selectivity, sensitivity, and reliability for detecting multiple-class pharmaceuticals in complex matrices such as municipal wastewater and sludge.

AB In this study, three novel multi-sparger multi-stage airlift loop membrane bioreactors (Ms(2)ALMBRs) were set up in parallel for treating synthetic high-strength 7-ACA pharmaceutical wastewater under different HRTs, temperatures and pHs, respectively. During the 200-day operating time, average COD removal efficiencies were 94.96%, 96.05% and 93.9%. While average 7-ACA removal efficiencies were 66.44%, 59.04% and 59.60%, respectively. The optimal conditions were 10 h, 15-35 degrees C and 7-9 for HRT, temperature and pH, respectively. Moreover, the sludge characteristics and microorganism drug-resistances were explored. Results showed that different temperatures and pHs influenced contaminant removals by affecting MLSS concentration and beta-lactamase activity significantly. In addition, mathematical statistical models, built on the polynomial and linear regression techniques, were developed for exploring the inner relationships between HRT, temperature and pH changes and MLSS concentrations, beta-lactamase activities and contaminant removals of the Ms(2)ALMBR system.

AB The biotechnological production of pharmaceutical active substances needs ancillary substances. Surfactants are used at the end of the cell culture as a protection against potential viral or bacterial contamination and to lyse the producing cells for isolation and purification of the products. To find a replacement for a surfactant that had raised environmental concern, environmentally relevant data for potential alternatives were searched for in the literature. Significant data gaps were filled with additional tests: biodegradability, algal growth inhibition, acute daphnid immobilization and chronic daphnid reproduction toxicity, acute fish toxicity, and activated sludge respiration inhibition. The results were used to model removal in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving 3 biotechnological production sites in the Roche Group. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated using realistic amounts of surfactants and site-specific wastewater fluxes, modeled removals for the WWTPs and dilution factors by the respective receiving waters. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived for WWTPs and for both fresh and marine receiving waters as the treated wastewater of 1 production site is discharged into a coastal water. This resulted in a spreadsheet showing PECs, PNECs, and PEC divided by PNEC risk characterization ratios for the WWTPs and receiving waters for all investigated surfactants and all 3 sites. This spreadsheet now serves as a selection support for the biotechnological developers. This risk-based prioritization of surfactants is a step toward green biotechnological production.

AB Wastewater contains large amounts of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Only a little is known about the dissemination of resistance determinants and changes in soil microbial communities affected by wastewater irrigation. Community DNAs from Mezquital Valley soils under irrigation with untreated wastewater for 0 to 100 years were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for the presence of sul genes, encoding resistance to sulfonamides. Amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from community DNAs from soils irrigated for 0, 8, 10, 85, and 100 years was performed and revealed a 14% increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in rainy season soils and a 26.7% increase in dry season soils for soils irrigated for 100 years with wastewater. In particular, Gammaproteobacteria, including potential pathogens, such as Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter spp., were found in wastewater-irrigated fields. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 96 isolates from soils irrigated with wastewater for 100 years (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) revealed that 46% were affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria (mainly potentially pathogenic Stenotrophomonas strains) and 50% with the Bacilli, whereas all 96 isolates from rain-fed soils (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) were affiliated with the Bacilli. Up to six types of antibiotic resistance were found in isolates from wastewater-irrigated soils; sulfamethoxazole resistance was the most abundant (33.3% of the isolates), followed by oxacillin resistance (21.9% of the isolates). In summary, we detected an increase of potentially harmful bacteria and a larger incidence of resistance determinants in wastewater-irrigated soils, which might result in health risks for farm workers and consumers of wastewater-irrigated crops.

AB The use of Trametes versicolor has been partially successful in the removal of some pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge in laboratory-scale biopile systems. The application of two strategies for the re-inoculation of biomass was assessed during the fungal bioaugmentation of non-sterile sludge (42-d treatment) as an approach to improve the elimination of pharmaceuticals and other groups of emerging pollutants. Globally, the re-inoculation of biopiles with blended mycelium exerted a major effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals (86%), brominated-flame-retardants (81%) and UV filters (80%) with respect to the re-inoculation with additional lignocellulosic substrate colonized by the fungus (69-67-22%). The performance was better than that of the analogous non-re-inoculated systems that were assayed previously for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The results demonstrate the ability of T. versicolor to remove a wide spectrum of emerging micropollutants under non-sterile conditions, while re-inoculation appears to be a useful step to improve the fungal treatment of sludge.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a chiral fluorinated pharmaceutical indicated mainly for the treatment of depression and is one of the most dispensed drugs in the world. There is clear evidence of environmental contamination with this drug and its active metabolite norfluoxetine (NFLX). In this study the enantioselective biodegradation of racemic FIX and of its enantiomers by Labrys portucalensis strain F11 was assessed. When 2 mu M of racemic FLX was supplemented as sole carbon source, complete removal of both enantiomers, with stoichiometric liberation of fluoride, was achieved in 30 d. For racemic FIX concentration of 4 and 9 mu M, partial degradation of the enantiomers was obtained. In the presence of acetate as an additional carbon source, at 4, 9 and 21 mu M of racemic FLX and at 25 mu M of racemic FIX, (S)-FLX or (R)-FLX, complete degradation of the two enantiomers occurred. At higher concentrations of 45 and 89 mu M of racemic FLX, partial degradation was achieved. Preferential degradation of the (R)-enantiomer was observed in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first time that enantioselective biodegradation of FIX by a single bacterium is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) was used in assessing the occurrence and risk of 12 widely used antibiotics and 5 most potent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the Yangtze Estuary, China. During laboratory validation, the kinetics of pollutant uptake by POCIS were linear, and the sampling rates of most compounds were raised by flow rate and salinity, reaching the highest values at salinity 14 parts per thousand. The sampling rates varied with the target compounds with the EDCs showing the highest values (overall average = 0.123 L d(-1)), followed by chloramphenicols (0.100 L d(-1)), macrolides (0.089 L d(-1)), and finally sulfonamides (0.056 L d(-1)). Validation in the Yangtze Estuary in 2013 showed that the field sampling rates were significantly greater for all compounds except bisphenol A, in comparison to laboratory results, and high-frequency spot sampling is critical for fully validating the passive sampler. The field studies show that antibiotics were widely detected in the Yangtze Estuary, with concentrations varying from below quantification to 1613 ng L-1, suggesting their widespread use and persistence in estuarine waters. The dominating pollutants in July were sulfonamides with a total concentration of 258 ng L-1 and in October were macrolides with a total concentration of 350 ng L-1. The calculation of risk quotient suggested that sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline and erythromycin-H2O may have caused medium damage to sensitive organisms such as fish.

AB The distribution coefficient (K-d) and the organic carbon distribution coefficient (K-oc) were determined for four Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs) to three different types of sludge taken from a conventional Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Batch experiments were performed in six different environmental relevant concentrations (200 ng L-1 to 5 mu g L-1) containing 1 g L-1 sludge. K-d values ranged from 330 to 6015, 329 to 17432 and 162 to 11 770 L kg(-1) for primary, secondary and digested sludge, respectively.
   The effects of solution's pH, ionic strength and cation types on PFCs sorption were also evaluated. Sorption capacities of PFCs significantly decreased with increased pH values from 6 to 8. Furthermore, the divalent cation (Ca2+) enhanced PFCs sorption to a higher degree in comparison with the monovalent cation (Na+) at the same ionic strength.
   The obtained K-d values were applied to estimate the sorbed fractions of each PFC in different stages of a typical STP and to calculate their removal through treated wastewater and sludge. In primary settling tank, the predicted sorbed fractions ranged from 3% for Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) to 55% for Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), while in activated sludge tank and anaerobic digester sorption was more than 50% for all target compounds. Almost 86% of initial PFOA load is expected to be detected in treated wastewater; while Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), PFUdA and Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) can be significantly removed (>49%) via sorption to primary and excess secondary sludge. In anaerobic digester, the major part (>76%) of target PFCs is expected to be sorbed to sludge, while almost 3% of initial PFOA load will be detected in sludge leachates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Seasonal changes in the concentration of 21 pharmaceuticals in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ceske Budejovice were investigated over 12 months. The target compounds were 10 antibiotics, 4 antidepressants, 3 psychiatric drugs, 2 antihistamines and 2 lipid regulators. 272 Wastewater samples (136 influents and 136 effluents) were collected from March 2011 to February 2012 and analyzed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. All studied pharmaceuticals were frequently detected in both the influent and the effluent wastewater samples, except for meclozine, which was only found in the influent. The mean concentration of pharmaceuticals varied from 0.006 mu g L-1 to 1.48 mu g L-1 in the influent and from 0.003 mu g L-1 to 0.93 mu g L-1 in the effluent. The concentration of most pharmaceuticals was higher during winter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presences of micro-pollutants (active pharmaceutical ingredients, APIs) are increasingly seen as a challenge of the sustainable management of water resources worldwide due to ineffective effluent treatment and other measures for their input prevention. Therefore, novel approaches are needed like designing greener pharmaceuticals, i.e. better biodegradability in the environment. This study addresses a tiered approach of implementing green and sustainable chemistry principles for theoretically designing better biodegradable and pharmacologically improved pharmaceuticals. Photodegradation process coupled with LC-MSn analysis and in silico tools such as quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) analysis and molecular docking proved to be a very significant approach for the preliminary stages of designing chemical structures that would fit into the "benign by design" concept in the direction of green and sustainable pharmacy. Metoprolol (MTL) was used as an example, which itself is not readily biodegradable under conditions found in sewage treatment and the aquatic environment. The study provides the theoretical design of new derivatives of MTL which might have the same or improved pharmacological activity and are more degradable in the environment than MTL. However, the in silica toxicity prediction by QSAR of those photo-TPs indicated few of them might be possibly mutagenic and require further testing. This novel approach of theoretically designing 'green' pharmaceuticals can be considered as a step forward towards the green and sustainable pharmacy field. However, more knowledge and further experience have to be collected on the full scope, opportunities and limitations of this approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in water has adverse environmental and health impacts. The main objective of the current research are to investigate the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from aqueous solution by using magnetic manganese ferrite nanoparticles synthesized on powdered activated carbon (PAC). Magnetic activated carbon composites (MACC) were prepared by using chemical co-precipitation at different temperature values ranging from 298 to 423K. The obtained samples were characterized by contemporary characterization instrumental methods of analysis, and their SMX removal capabilities were evaluated. Results revealed that the procedure successfully created magnetic nanoparticles on PAC at temperatures of 298-423K, and the anchored MnFe2O4/MnO2 manifested more crystalline forms at 423K. As a result, MACC prepared at 423K showed the highest magnetic and sorption capacities among three obtained samples. The SMX maximal adsorption capacity of MACC(423K) was 159mg/g at pH 7, and the SMX adsorption remained stable at pH 3-7. The effect of common ions and humic acids on SMX adsorption indicates a high selectivity of MACC(423K) for SMX. Furthermore, MACC(423K) achieved much higher regeneration efficiency by H2O2 than that of virgin PAC, due to the presence of MnFe2O4/MnO2.

AB Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed drugs globally, due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties. However, it is highly toxic at elevated doses, with involvement of an already described oxidative stress pathway. Despite this, the number of ecotoxicological studies on potential effects of paracetamol in wild organisms is still scarce. The present article presents a comprehensive series of standardized assays for the assessment of paracetamol effects in freshwater organisms. The results show that paracetamol toxicity is widely variable among species, even when these species are phylogenetically related. Furthermore, comparisons between data from the literature and our results reinforce this conclusion, providing evidence of the inadequacy of standardized toxicity testing guidelines for pharmaceutical compounds in wild organisms. Paracetamol toxicity can be modulated by unpredictable physiological conditions that might compromise extrapolations and comparisons of responsiveness among species. The ecological relevance of data obtained from classical tests for this compound is further discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In 2030, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 350 million people will be diagnosed with diabetes. Consequently, Metformin - the biguanide drug of choice orally administered for diabetes type II- is anticipated to see a spike in production.
   Unlike many pharmaceutical drugs, Metformin (Met) is not metabolized by humans but passes through the body unchanged. Entering aquatic compartments, such as in sewage, it can be bacterially transformed to the ultimate transformation product Guanylurea (Gua).
   Sampling over one week (n = 5) from a Southern German sewage treatment plant revealed very high average (AV) concentrations in influent (AV(Met) = 111,800 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 1300 ng/L) and effluent samples (AV(Met) = 4800 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 44,000 ng/L).
   To provide a more complete picture of the distribution and potential persistence of these compounds in the German water cycle, a new, efficient and highly sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method with direct injection was used for the measurement of Metformin and Guanylurea in drinking, surface, sewage and seawater. Limits of quantification (LOQ) ranging from 2-10 ng/L allowed the detection of Metformin and Guanylurea in different locations such as: Lake Constance (n = 11: AV(Met) = 102 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 16 ng/L), river Elbe (n = 12: AV(Met) = 472 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 9 ng/L), river Weser (n = 6: AV(Met) = 349 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 137 ng/L) and for the first time in marine North Sea water (n = 14: AV(Met) = 13 ng/L, AV(Gua) = 11 ng/L). Based on daily water discharges, Metformin loads of 15.2 kg/d (Elbe) and 6.4 kg/d (Weser) into the North Sea were calculated. Lake Constance is used to abstract potable water which is further purified to be used as drinking water. A first screening of two tap water samples contained 2 ng/L and 61 ng/L of Metformin, respectively. The results of this study suggest that Metformin and Guanylurea could be distributed over a large fraction of the world's potable water sources and oceans. With no natural degradation processes, these compounds can be easily reintroduced to humans as they enter the food chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and other anthropogenic trace contaminants reach wastewaters and are often not satisfactorily eliminated in sewage treatment plants. These contaminants and/or their degradation products may reach surface waters, thus influencing aquatic life. In this study, the behavior of five different antihypertonic pharmaceuticals from the sartan group (candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan and valsartan) is investigated in lab-scale sewage plants. The elimination of the substances with related structures varied broadly from 17% for olmesartan up to 96% for valsartan. Monitoring data for these drugs in wastewater effluents of six different sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Bavaria, and at eight rivers, showed median concentrations for, e.g. valsartan of 1.1 and 0.13 mu g L-1, respectively. Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) were calculated and are mostly consistent with the measured environmental concentrations (MEC). The selected sartans and the mixture of the five sartans showed no ecotoxic effects on aquatic organisms in relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment should be reduced to minimize the risk of their distribution in surface waters, ground waters and bank filtrates used for drinking water.

AB The pollution of aquatic bodies by drugs is an emerging environmental problem, because of their extensive use in animal and human context. Ibuprofen, 2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]propanoic acid, is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly present both in wastewater and in rivers and lakes in Europe. Since in literature there is little information about the effects of ibuprofen on microalgae, in this paper we presented the results on the effects of this molecule at different concentrations (62.5 mu g L-1, 250 mu g L-1 and 1000 mu g L-1) on cultures of the freshwater microalga Scenedesmus rubescens (P.J.L. Dangeard) E. Kesslet et al. Ibuprofen effects on the alga were assayed at first through analyses of the growth curve. Moreover, analyses of cell morphology, ultrastructure, and photosynthetic pigments were additionally performed. The first negative effect of the drug was on the microalga growth, suggesting a drug action dose-dependent mechanism type, more evident at the concentration of 1000 mu g L-1 ibuprofen and in the last phase of the growth curve. In support of this, following ibuprofen exposure, the cells exhibited morphological and ultrastructural alterations, mainly consisting in large cytoplasmic inclusions, probably of lipids and/or carotenoids. The decrease of chlorophyll amounts and, on the contrary, the increase of carotenoids were correlated with a stressful condition induced by drug. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Trace organic contaminant (TrOC) studies in Australia have, to date, focused on wastewater effluents, leaving a knowledge gap of their occurrence and risk in freshwater environments. This study measured 42 TrOCs including industrial compounds, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry at 73 river sites across Australia quarterly for 1 yr. Trace organic contaminants were found in 92% of samples, with a median of three compounds detected per sample (maximum 18). The five most commonly detected TrOCs were the pharmaceuticals salicylic acid (82%, maximum = 1530 ng/L), paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen; 45%, maximum = 7150 ng/L), and carbamazepine (27%, maximum = 682 ng/L), caffeine (65%, maximum = 3770 ng/L), and the flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (44%, maximum = 184 ng/L). Pesticides were detected in 28% of the samples. To determine the risk posed by the detected TrOCs to the aquatic environment, hazard quotients were calculated by dividing the maximum concentration detected for each compound by the predicted no-effect concentrations. Three of the 42 compounds monitored (the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole and the herbicide simazine) had a hazard quotient >1, suggesting that they may be causing adverse effects at the most polluted sites. A further 10 compounds had hazard quotients >0.1, indicating a potential risk; these included four pharmaceuticals, three personal care products, and three pesticides. Most compounds had hazard quotients significantly <0.1. The number of TrOCs measured in this study was limited and further investigations are required to fully assess the risk posed by complex mixtures of TrOCs on exposed biota.

AB This study investigates the electrochemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) on a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode under different temperatures, current densities, and sample matrixes. For comparison, a commercial Pt electrode and a lab-prepared PbO2 anode were also tested. The oxidation of DEET on BDD was found to be electrochemically irreversible. The degradation of DEET increased with the increase of current density, but was slightly influenced by temperature (25-75 degrees C). Furthermore, the BDD anode was superior to the Pt and PbO2 electrodes with regard to DEET abatement and total organic carbon (TOC) removal. At 0.75 A/cm(2) and 50 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of DEET oxidation were 5.00 x 10(-3)-8.98 x 10(-3) s(-1) in DEET-spiked 1 M Na2SO4 solution, municipal wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent (MWTPSE), groundwater (GW), and river water (RW), significantly greater than that (4.73 x 10(-4) s(-1)) in DEET-spiked industrial wastewater (IW). The TOC removal in the real environmental matrixes followed the order MWTPSE > GW approximate to RW >> IW. Through electrochemical oxidation, DEET was completely mineralized in the DEET-spiked MWTPSE. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a 3-L compartmentalized activated sludge (CAS) system with 6 compartments was designed and fabricated. In the start-up stage, pre-acclimatized inoculums were added into the CAS and the system was operated under certain operating conditions until the system performance remained at a steady state. The effects of two process variables (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and influent chemical oxygen demand (CODin)) on the reactor performance were investigated and the process was modeled and analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM). From the results, the ratio of food to microorganism (F/M) was found to be the most important factor for the process control. Maximum removal efficiency (89%) was determined at a MLVSS and CODin of 4800 and 2000 mg/L, respectively. Kinetic coefficients (Y and K-d) were determined as 0.0815 g VSSproduced/g CODrem and 0.009 d(-1), respectively. Biodegradation of Co-amoxiclav and ciprofloxacin were also investigated in the CAS system. The COD removal dropped from 29 to -18% after five turnovers (two days) for Co-amoxiclay. The process instability was also observed by a remarkable increase in effluent turbidity (>370 NTU) as a result of intensive biomass decomposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the degradation of the X-ray contrast agent iopromide (IOP) and the antibiotic ofloxacin (OFLOX) by the white-rot-fungus Trametes versicolor. Batch studies in synthetic medium revealed that between 60 and 80% of IOP and OFLOX were removed when spiked at approximately 12 mg L-1 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. A significant number of transformation products (TPs) were identified for both pharmaceuticals, confirming their degradation. IOP TPs were attributed to two principal reactions: (i) sequential deiodination of the aromatic ring and (ii) N-dealkylation of the amide at the hydroxylated side chain of the molecule. On the other hand, OFLOX transformation products were attributed mainly to the oxidation, hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring.
   Experiments in 10 L-bioreactor with fungal biomass fluidized by air pulses operated in batch achieved high percentage of degradation of IOP and OFLOX when load with sterile (87% IOP, 98.5% OFLOX) and unsterile (65.4% IOP, 99% OFLOX) hospital wastewater (HWW) at their real concentration (mu g L-1 level). Some of the most relevant IOP and OFLOX TPs identified in synthetic medium were also detected in bioreactor samples. Acute toxicity tests indicated a reduction of the toxicity in the final culture broth from both experiments in synthetic medium and in batch bioreactor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to interact with target pollutants is crucial for efficient water treatment using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and inhibition by natural organic matter (NOM) can significantly reduce degradation efficiency. We compare OH center dot-based degradation (H2O2-UV) to O-1(2)-based degradation (Rose Bengal) of several probe compounds (furfuryl alcohol, ranitidine, cimetidine) interacting in water containing background constituents likely to be found in treatment water such as natural organic matter (NOM) and phosphate, as well as in effluent from a waste-water treatment plant (WWTP). Hydroxyl radicals were much more susceptible to hindrance by all three background matrices (NOM, phosphate and WWTP effluent) tested, while 102 was only slightly inhibited by NOM and not by phosphate or WWTP effluent. A mechanistic model accounting for this inhibition in terms of radical scavenging and inner filter effects was developed, and accurately simulated the results of the NOM interactions. These results underscore the importance of considering the effect of background constituents in the selection of photocatalysts and in the design of AOPs for emerging applications in tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent and disinfection of natural waters.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater during secondary treatment followed by reverse osmosis and UV disinfection was evaluated by a combination of four in-vitro cell-based bioassays and chemical analysis of 299 organic compounds. Concentrations detected in recycled water were below the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. Thus the detected chemicals were considered not to pose any health risk. The detected pesticides in the wastewater treatment plant effluent and partially advanced treated water explained all observed effects on photosynthesis inhibition. In contrast, mixture toxicity experiments with designed mixtures containing all detected chemicals at their measured concentrations demonstrated that the known chemicals explained less than 3% of the observed cytotoxicity and less than 1% of the oxidative stress response. Pesticides followed by pharmaceuticals and personal care products dominated the observed mixture effects. The detected chemicals were not related to the observed genotoxicity. The large proportion of unknown toxicity calls for effect monitoring complementary to chemical monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the stability of 124 target analytes in influent and effluent wastewater samples during short-term (4 degrees C) and long-term (-18 degrees C) storage was assessed. The most common storage scenario was considered, in which samples were frozen immediately after sampling without any pre-treatment. During short-term storage more analytes remained stable (concentration during storage was in the range of 60-120% of the initial concentration) at 4 degrees C than at -18 degrees C. During long-term storage (-18 degrees C), three types of behavior were observed: constant concentrations throughout the experimental period, decreasing concentrations with time, and loss of the compound from the sample after freezing. Differences between effluent and influent samples were observed for 50 out of 124 tested PPCPs. The amount of stable analytes decreased with time during long-term storage. 72% and 56% of the target compounds in the effluent and influent wastewater, respectively, remained stable during 60 days of storage. The number of stable compounds decreased to 57 (46%) and 46 (37%) in the effluent and influent, respectively, over 120 days. 15 Pharmaceuticals were lost after freezing/thawing cycle. The results stress the importance of storage factors during analysis of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. The stability of target compounds in the samples under the planned storage conditions should be checked before starting the experiment to obtain reliable data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The distribution of pharmaceutically active compounds in the environment has been reported in several works in which wastewater treatment plants have been identified as the main source of these compounds to the environment. The concentrations of these compounds in influent wastewater can vary widely not only during the day but also along the year, because of the seasonal-consumption patterns of some pharmaceuticals. However, only few studies have attempted to assess the hourly variability of the concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds in wastewater. In this work, the distribution and seasonal and hourly variability of twenty-one pharmaceuticals, belonging to seven therapeutic groups, have been investigated in urban and industrial wastewater. The highest concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds, except salicylic acid, were found in urban wastewater, especially in the case of anti-inflammatory drugs and caffeine. The highest concentrations of salicylic acid were measured in industrial wastewater, reaching concentration levels up to 3295 mu g L-1. The studied pharmaceutically active compounds showed different distribution patterns during winter and summer periods. Temporal variability of pharmaceutically active compounds during a 24-h period showed a distribution in concordance with their consumption and excretion patterns, in the case of urban wastewater, and with the schedule of industrial activities, in the case of industrial wastewater.

AB Thiamphenicol and florfenicol are two phenicol antibiotics widely used in aquaculture and are ubiquitous as micropollutants in surface waters. The present study investigated their photodegradation kinetics, hydroxyl-radical ((OH)-O-.) oxidation reactivities and products. Firstly, the photolytic kinetics of the phenicols in pure water was studied as a function of initial concentrations (C-0) under UV-vis irradiation (lambda > 200 nm). It was found that the kinetics was influenced by C-0. A linear plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constant vs C-0 was observed with a negative slope. Secondly, the reaction between the phenicol antibiotics and (OH)-O-. was examined with a competition kinetic method under simulated solar irradiation (lambda > 290 nm), which quantified their bimolecular reaction rate constants of (2.13 +/- 0.02) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and (1.82 +/- 0.10) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for thiamphenicol and florfenicol, respectively. Then the corresponding (OH)-O-. oxidated half-lives in sunlit surface waters were calculated to be 90.5-106.1 h. Some main intermediates were formed from the reaction, which suggested that the two phenicols underwent hydroxylation, oxygenation and dehydrogenation when (OH)-O-. existed. These results are of importance to assess the phenicol persistence in wastewater treatment and sunlit surface waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations of trace substances in sewage sludge have been measured in a survey of 28 wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) in the UK carried out over a period of 12 months. Approximately 250 samples were analysed for more than 40 trace contaminants, including trace metals, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 'emerging' and regulated organic pollutants. All substances investigated were found to be present in at least some of the sludges sampled. Concentrations were relatively homogenous across all the WwTWs, irrespective of the treatment process, influent and effluent concentrations, and the location of the sludge sampling point within each works. Analysis of the results against existing regulatory and proposed thresholds suggested that levels are mostly below the limits set in the Sewage Sludge Directive, and proposed new limits for sludge used in agriculture. Predicted soil concentrations after application of sewage sludge to land were below the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) for all determinands. Predicted concentrations of pharmaceuticals in soil were also below thresholds deemed to indicate negligible environmental risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To discover the catalytic activity of sludge-corncob activated carbon in catalytic ozonation of Ibuprofen, the performance of sludge-corncob activated carbon and three selected commercial activated carbons as catalysts in catalytic ozonation was investigated. The observation indicates the degradation rate of Ibuprofen increases significantly in the presence of sludge-corncob activated carbon and the catalytic activity of sludge-corncob activated carbon is much higher than that of the other three commercial activated carbons. Ibuprofen's removal rate follows pseudo-first order kinetics model well. It is also found that the adsorption removal of Ibuprofen by sludge-corncob activated carbon is less than 30% after 40 min. And the removal efficiency of Ibuprofen in the hybrid ozone/sludge-corncob activated carbon system is higher than the sum of sludge-corncob activated carbon adsorption and ozonation alone, which is a supportive evidence for catalytic reaction. In addition, the results of radical scavenger experiments demonstrate that catalytic ozonation of Ibuprofen by sludge-corncob activated carbon follows a hydroxyl radical reaction pathway. During ozonation of Ibuprofen in the presence of activated carbon, ozone could be catalytically decomposed to form hydrogen peroxide, which can promote the formation of hydroxyl radical. The maximum amount of hydrogen peroxide occurs in the presence of sludge-corncob activated carbon, which can explain why sludge-corncob activated carbon has the best catalytic activity among four different activated carbons.

AB The occurrence of estrogens in the aquatic environment has become a major concern worldwide because of their strong endocrine disrupting potency. In this study, concentrations of four estrogenic compounds, estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), estriol (E3) were determined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses in surface water from South China Sea, and distributions and potential risks of their estrogenic activity were assessed. The estrogenic compounds El, E2 and E3 were detected in most of the samples, with their concentrations up to 11.16, 3.71 and 21.63 ng L-1. However, EE2 was only detected in 3 samples. Causality analysis, EEQ values from chemical analysis identified E2 as the main responsible compounds. Based on the EEQ values in the surface water, high estrogenic risks were in the coastal water, and low estrogenic risks in the open sea. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Current design limitations and ineffective remediation techniques in wastewater treatment plants have led to concerns about the prevalence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in receiving waters. A novel photocatalyst, TiO2-doped low-silica X zeolite (TiO2-LSX), was used to study the degradation of the pharmaceutical compound, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The catalyst was synthesized and characterized using XRD, BET surface analysis, SEM-EDAX, and ICP-OES. The effects of different UV light intensities, initial EE2 concentrations, and catalyst dosages on the EE2 removal efficiency were studied. A higher EE2 removal efficiency was attained with UV-TiO2-LSX when compared with UV-TiO2 or UV alone. The EE2 degradation process followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. A comprehensive empirical model was developed to describe the EE2 degradation kinetics under different conditions using multiple linear regression analysis. The EE2 degradation mechanism was proposed basad on molecular calculations, identification of photoproducts using HPLC MS/MS, and reactive species quenching experiments; the results showed that oxidative degradation pathways initiated by hydroxyl radicals were predominant. This novel TiO2-doped zeolite system provides a promising application for the UV disinfection process in wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides a first estimate of the sources, distribution, and risk presented by emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in coastal waters off southwestern Taiwan. Ten illicit drugs, seven nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), five antibiotics, two blood lipid regulators, two antiepileptic drugs, two UV filters, caffeine, atenolol, and omeprazole were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Thirteen EOCs were detected in coastal waters, including four NSAIDs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and codeine), three antibiotics (ampicillin, erythromycin, and cefalexin), three illicit drugs (ketamine, pseudoephedrine, and MDMA), caffeine, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil. The median concentrations for the 13 EOCs ranged from 1.47 ng/L to 156 ng/L. Spatial variation in concentration of the 13 EOCs suggests discharge into coastal waters via ocean outfall pipes and rivers. Codeine and ampicillin have significant pollution risk quotients (RQ > 1), indicating potentially high risk to aquatic organisms in coastal waters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work deals with the environmental distribution of nonionic surfactants (nonylphenol and alcohol ethoxylates), their metabolites (NP, nonylphenol; NPEC, nonylphenol ethoxycarboxylates; and PEG, polyethylene glycols) and a selection of 64 pharmaceuticals in the Long Island Sound (LIS) Estuary which receives important sewage discharges from New York City (NYC). Most target compounds were efficiently removed (>95%) in one wastewater treatment plant monitored, with the exception of NPEC and some specific drugs (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide). Concentrations of surfactants (1.4-4.5 mu g L-1) and pharmaceuticals (0.1-0.3 mu g L-1) in seawater were influenced by tides and sampling depth, consistent with salinity differences. Surfactants levels in suspended solids samples were higher than 1 mu g g(-1), whereas only most hydrophobic or positively charged pharmaceuticals could be found (e.g., tamoxifen, clarithromycin). Maximum levels of target compounds in LIS sediments (PEG at highest concentrations, 2.8 mu g g(-1)) were measured nearest NYC, sharply decreasing with distance from major sewage inputs.

AB The ubiquitous use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in a continuous discharge into wastewater and pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are found in the environment. Due to their design towards specific drug targets, pharmaceuticals may be therapeutically active already at low environmental concentrations. Several human drug targets are evolutionary conserved in aquatic organisms, raising concerns about effects of these pharmaceuticals in non-target organisms. In this study, we hypothesized that the toxicity of a pharmaceutical towards a non-target invertebrate depends on the presence of the human drug target orthologs in this species. This was tested by assessing toxicity of pharmaceuticals with (miconazole and promethazine) and without (levonorgestrel) identified drug target orthologs in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The toxicity was evaluated using general toxicity endpoints at individual (immobility, reproduction and development), biochemical (RNA and DNA content) and molecular (gene expression) levels. The results provide evidence for higher toxicity of miconazole and promethazine, i.e. the drugs with identified drug target orthologs. At the individual level, miconazole had the lowest effect concentrations for immobility and reproduction (0.3 and 0.022 mg L-1, respectively) followed by promethazine (1.6 and 0.18 mg L-1, respectively). At the biochemical level, individual RNA content was affected by miconazole and promethazine already at 0.0023 and 0.059 mg L-1, respectively. At the molecular level, gene expression for cuticle protein was significantly suppressed by exposure to both miconazole and promethazine; moreover, daphnids exposed to miconazole had significantly lower vitellogenin expression. Levonorgestrel did not have any effects on any endpoints in the concentrations tested.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are mainly generated by chemical-synthetic industries and usually contain high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxicity. A novel lab-scale anaerobic bio-entrapped membrane reactor (AnBEMR) packed with bio-ball carriers was constructed and compared with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The aims of this study are to investigate the treatment performances and evaluate the stability of the membrane filtration of the AnBEMR and AnMBR under the conditions of a high organic loading rate (OLR), ranging from 8.0 to 36.7 kgCOD/m(3) d, and high total dissolved solids (TDS), ranging from 18,411 to 25,925 mg/L, in the treatment of chemical synthetic-based pharmaceutical wastewater. Four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 10.6, 14.1, 21.3, and 42.6 h were studied. Total COD (TCOD) removal efficiency of the AnBEMR ranged from 36.7% to 50.8% at an OLR of 8.7 +/- 0.7 kgCOD/m(3) d, while the highest OLR (34.0 +/- 2.7 kgCOD/m(3) d) only led to TCOD removal efficiency of 10.1-20.7%. The AnBEMR achieved approximately 5-10% higher TCOD removal efficiency than the AnMBR. The influences of HRT and TDS (salinity) were also studied. The results show an increase of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) with decreasing HRT in both MBRs, where extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), soluble microbial products (SMP) and suspended biomass concentration were significantly higher at the shortest HRT of 10.6 h, resulting in faster membrane fouling. Membrane fouling was improved in the AnBEMR (i.e., longer membrane filtration operating periods) due to the production of lower concentrations of EPS and SMP (protein and carbohydrate contents). Proteins, rather than carbohydrates, were the major component of EPS and SMP in both reactors. The study concludes that the application of the AnBEMR could achieve better treatment performance and reduced membrane fouling by producing lesser EPS, SMP, and suspended biomass concentration.

AB A series of six pharmaceuticals were degraded by continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) ultrasound at 205 kHz using deionized water, wastewater effluent, and its isolated organic matter matrices. In deionized water, we observed that hydrophobicity is superior to diffusivity (D-W) for predicting degradation kinetics. Enhancements in degradation kinetics by the PW mode were greatest for the highest D-W (i.e., fluorouracil (5-FU)) and K-OW (i.e., lovastatin (LOVS)) compounds, indicating that a pharmaceutical with either high diffusivity and low hydrophobicity or low diffusivity and high hydrophobicity benefits from additional time to populate the bubble-water interface during the silent cycle of PW ultrasound. Degradation of 5-FU and LOVS were inhibited by wastewater effluent to a greater extent than the other pharmaceuticals. In addition, a pulse enhancement (PE) for 5-FU and LOVS was not present in wastewater effluent. Irradiating 5-FU and LOVS in hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI), and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions of effluent organic matter (EfOM) showed that the TPI fraction reduced the PE the most, followed by the HPI and HPO fractions. The smaller size of the TPI over the HPO fraction and higher hydrophobicity of TPI over HPI implicate both size and hydrophobicity of EfOM in hindering degradation of pharmaceuticals.

AB To meet mounting water demands, treated wastewater has become an important source of irrigation. Thus, contamination of treated wastewater by pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and the fate of these compounds in the agricultural environment are of increasing concern. This field study aimed to quantify PC uptake by treated wastewater-irrigated root crops (carrots and sweet potatoes) grown in lysimeters and to evaluate potential risks. In both crops, the nonionic PCs (carbamazepine, caffeine, and lamotrigine) were detected at significantly higher concentrations than ionic PCs (metoprolol, bezafibrate, dofibric acid, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and sildenafil). PCs in leaves were found at higher concentrations than in the roots. Carbamazepine metabolites were found mainly in the leaves, where the concentration of the metabolite 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was significantly higher than the parent compound. The health risk associated with consumption of wastewater-irrigated root vegetables was estimated using the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach. Our data show that the TTC value of lamotrigine can be reached for a child at a daily consumption of half a carrot (similar to 60 g). This study highlights that certain PCs accumulated in edible organs at concentrations above the TTC value should be categorized as contaminants of emerging concern.

AB The radiation-induced removal of sulphadiazine (SD) belonging to the heterocyclic sulphonamides pharmaceuticals was investigated by gamma irradiation at different conditions in laboratory scale. The influence of initial SD concentrations, pH values, O-2 and N-2 on SD degradation was determined. The experimental results showed that gamma-ray irradiation was efficient for removing SD from wastewater. SD could be completely removed at an absorbed dose of 10kGy. The degradation kinetics of SD conformed to the first-order kinetic equation. When SD concentration was in the range of 10-30mg/L, the dose constant (d) decreased with an increasing initial SD concentration. The mineralization of SD, in terms of total organic carbon removal, was not obvious at a low absorbed dose, but it increased to more than 75% at 100kGy. The biodegradability of SD was improved after irradiation, suggesting that irradiation could be used as a pretreatment technology for treating SD-containing wastewater. The possible degradation pathway of SD was tentatively proposed based on the analysis of intermediate products during gamma irradiation.

AB The seasonal occurrence and distribution of 69 pharmaceuticals along coastal watercourses during 6 sampling campaigns and their input through El Albujon watercourse to the Mar Menor lagoon were determined by UPLC-MS-MS, considering a total of 115 water samples. The major source of pharmaceuticals running into this watercourse was an effluent from the Los Alcazares WWTP, although other sources were also present (runoffs, excess water from irrigation, etc.). In this urban and agriculturally influenced watercourse different pharmaceutical distribution profiles were detected according to their attenuation, which depended on physicochemical water conditions, pollutant input variation, biodegradation and photodegradation rates of pollutants, etc. The less recalcitrant compounds in this study (macrolides, beta-blockers, etc.) showed a relevant seasonal variability as a consequence of dissipation processes (degradation, sorption, etc.). Attenuation was lower, however, for diclofenac, carbamazepine, lorazepam, valsartan, sulfamethoxazole among others, due to their known lower degradability and sorption onto particulate matter, according to previous studies. The maximum concentrations detected were higher than 1000 ng L-1 for azithromycin, clarithromycin, valsartan, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. These high concentration levels were favored by the limited dilution in this low flow system, and consequently some of them could pose an acute risk to the biota of this watercourse. Considering data from 2009 to 2010, it has been estimated that a total of 11.3 kg of pharmaceuticals access the Mar Menor lagoon annually through the El Albujon watercourse. The highest proportion of this input corresponded to antibiotics (46%), followed by antihypertensives (20%) and diuretics (18%). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present work is to evaluate the potential of a photosonolysis process for the degradation of butyl-paraben (BPB). After 120 min of treatment time, high removal of BPB was achieved by the photosonolysis (US/UV) process (88.0 +/- 0.65%) compared to the photochemical (UV) and the conventional ultrasonication (US) processes. Several factors such as calorimetric power, treatment time, pH and initial concentration of BPB were investigated. Using a 24 factorial matrix, the treatment time and the calorimetric power are the main parameters influencing the degradation rate of BPB. Subsequently, a central composite design methodology has been investigated to determine the optimal experimental parameters for BPB degradation. The US/UV process applied under optimal operating conditions (at a calorimetric power of 40 W during 120 min and under pH 7) is able to oxidize around 99.2 +/- 1.4% of BPB and to record 43.3% of mineralization. During the US/UV process, BPB was mainly transformed into 1 hydroxy BPB, dihydroxy BPB, hydroquinone and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Microtox biotests (Vibrio fisheri) showed that the treated effluent was not toxic. The pseudo-first order kinetic model (k = 0.0367 min(-1)) described very well the oxidation of BPB.

AB The occurrence, fate, seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of four selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, were studied in 15 different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Portugal. Influent and effluent samples from four sampling campaigns, in 2013, were extracted through Oasis HLB cartridges, and quantified through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Results showed that citalopram was the SSRI most frequently found, both in influents and in effluents, with mean mass loads ranging between 14.56 and 9.51 mg/day/1000 inhabitants, respectively. Fluoxetine and sertraline were only detected in influent samples, in lower mean mass loads (14.60 and 1.36 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), whereas paroxetine was found in influent and effluent samples (12.61 and 18.90 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). WWTPs were not capable of completely removing these pharmaceuticals; nonetheless, the mean removal efficiency was 82.24%. Removal efficiency was lower in winter (74.21%), summer (72.02%), and autumn (81.19%), when compared to spring (100%).
   Our results translate the variations in SSRI prescription and use between the five Portuguese regions in study. Influent contaminated samples were found in WWTPs from Lisbon, Alentejo, Center and North (28.25, 19.01, 16.55 and 6.98 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). In the Algarve region no contaminated samples were found. A seasonal pattern in the presence of SSRIs in influent wastewaters was observed. The SSRIs mass loads in influent wastewaters were higher in autumn, followed by spring, winter, and summer.
   Finally, the potential ecotoxicological risk posed by SSRIs to different trophic levels of aquatic organisms, exposed to the effluent wastewaters studied was evaluated by means of risk quotients (RQ). Citalopram and paroxetine, the only SSRIs found in these samples, presented RQ lower than 1. According to the results, algae appeared to be the most sensitive followed by fish and daphnids.

AB As freshwater is a limited resource in many parts of the world, the use of wastewater for irrigation has become an important alternative. Therefore, many countries facing a water deficit, use partially treated, or even untreated, wastewater. This may increase the input of many contaminants into the environment. In the present study, we investigated the effect of using surfactant rich water in irrigation on the mobility of the most commonly-used veterinary antibiotic, monensin. Nine PVC lysimeters, 1.0 m long x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil to a bulk density of 1.35 Mg m(-3). Cattle manure, containing monensin, was applied at the surface of the lysimeters at the recommended rate of 10 t/ha. Each of three aqueous Brij 35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 g L-1, was applied to the lysimeters in triplicate. Over a 90 day period, soil and leachate samples were collected and analyzed. The results of the laboratory sorption experiment showed that when the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 is present, the sorption coefficient of monensin was reduced significantly from 120.22 mL g(-1) in the aqueous medium to 112.20, 100 and 63.09 mL g(-1) with Brij35 concentrations of 0.25, 2.5 and 5 g L-1, respectively. The lysimeter results indicated a significant downward movement of monensin at depths of 60 cm in the soil profile and leachate in the presence of the surfactant. Thus, the continuous use of poor quality water could influence the transport of monensin in agricultural soils, and consequently, pose a risk for groundwater pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sewage epidemiology has been proven as an effective approach to estimate the use of illicit drugs by a population. In this study, sewage analysis was applied to examine the patterns of amphetamine (AMP) and methamphetamine (METH) uses in the urban area of Beijing. Influent and effluent samples were collected from all the thirteen sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the urban area during two sampling campaigns. METH concentrations in influents were found to range from several tens to several hundred ng.L-1, whereas AMP concentrations ranged from several to several tens ng.L-1. The concentration ratios between AMP and METH in influents at most STPs were close to the rate of AMP excretion following METH ingestion, indicating that AMP in sewage in Beijing was predominately from the metabolism of METH. Much higher METH loads were observed in the center part of the urban area in Beijing, indicating a strong correlation between METH use and economic level and entertainment activities. Seasonal variation in METH loads was significant, with greater use in summer than in winter. Significant difference in METH loads between weekdays and weekend days were observed in winter but not in summer. No clear trend in diurnal variation of METH use was observed. Nearly complete removal of METH occurred at the STPS in Beijing. Apparent removal rates of AMP were lower than those of METH, likely due to degradation of METH into AMP during the wastewater treatment processes. In summary, this study represents the first application of sewage epidemiology to the entire urban population of a metropolitan in mainland China and provided an overview of METH and AMP uses in the city.

AB Pharmaceuticals are heavily used to improve human and animal health, resulting in the frequent contamination of aquatic environments with pharmaceutical residues, which has raised considerable concern in recent years. When inadequately removed from drinking water in water treatment plants, pharmaceuticals can have potential toxic effects on human health. This study investigated the spatial distributions and seasonal variations of five pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprofen (KEP), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA), in the Huangpu River system (a drinking water source for Shanghai) over a period of almost two years as well as the associated risk to human health for different age groups. All of the targets were ubiquitous in the river water, with levels decreasing in the following order: KEP (mean: 28.6 ng/L) approximate to IBP (23.3 ng/L) > DFC (13.6 ng/L) approximate to NPX (12.3 ng/L) > CA (1.6 ng/L). The concentrations of all of the investigated compounds were at the low or medium end of the global range. The upstream tributaries contained lower IBP but higher NPX than did the mainstream and downstream tributaries. However, no significant variations were found in the levels of KEP, DFC, or CA at the different sampling sites. Except for CA in the mainstream, significantly higher pharmaceutical levels were observed in the dry season than in the wet season. Overall, a very low risk of the selected pharmaceuticals for human health via drinking water was observed, but future studies are needed to examine the fate and chronic effects of all pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the human health risk of pharmaceuticals in raw drinking water in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four pilot-scale constructed wetlands (free water surface, SF; horizontal subsurface flow, HSF; vertical subsurface flows with different water level, VSF-L and VSF-H) were operated to assess their ability to remove sulfamethazine (SMZ) and tetracycline (TC) from wastewaters, and to investigate the abundance level of corresponding resistance genes (sulI, sulII, tetM, tetW and tetO) in the CWs. The results indicated that CWs could significantly reduce the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater, and the mass removal rate range of SMZ and TC were respectively 11%-95% and 85%-95% in the four systems on the basis of hydraulic equilibrium; further relatively high removal rate was observed in VSF with low water level. Seasonal condition had a significant effect on SMZ removal in the CWs (especially SMZ in SF), but TC removal in VSFs were not considered to have statistically significant differences in winter and summer. At the end period, the relative abundances of target genes in the CWs showed obvious increases compared to initial levels, ranging from 2.98 x 10(-5) to 1.27 x 10(-1) for sul genes and 4.68 x 10(-6) to 1.54 x 10(-1) for tet genes after treatment, and those abundances showed close relation to both characteristic of wastewater and configuration of CWs.

AB Polar anthropogenic organic micropollutants are frequently detected in freshwater and discharged on large scale into marine systems. In this work the results of 153 samples collected from the shorelines of the Baltic Sea (Germany), Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy), Aegean Sea and Dardanelles (Greece & Turkey), San Francisco Bay (USA), Pacific Ocean (USA), Mediterranean Sea (Israel), and Balearic Sea (Spain) are presented. The samples were analyzed for various classes of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and stimulants. Caffeine, paraxanthine, theobromine, tolyltriazole, 1H-benzotriazole, and atrazine were detected in >50% of all samples. The detection frequencies of carbamazepine, iopamidol, diuron, sulfamethoxazole, paracetamol, theophylline, and atenolol were between 20% and 32%. As caffeine is linked to untreated wastewater, the widespread occurrence of raw sewage in marine environments and thus potentially elevated nutrient concentrations and risk for the presence of wastewater-related pathogens is remarkable.

AB In this study, the concentration probability distributions of 82 pharmaceutical compounds detected in the effluents of 179 European wastewater treatment plants were computed and inserted into a multimedia fate model. The comparative ecotoxicological impact of the direct emission of these compounds from wastewater treatment plants on freshwater ecosystems, based on a potentially affected fraction (PAF) of species approach, was assessed to rank compounds based on priority. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, the multimedia fate model accounts for regressions to estimate pH-dependent fate parameters. An uncertainty analysis was performed by means of Monte Carlo analysis, which included the uncertainty of fate and ecotoxicity model input variables, as well as the spatial variability of landscape characteristics on the European continental scale. Several pharmaceutical compounds were identified as being of greatest concern, including 7 analgesics/anti-inflammatories, 3 beta-blockers, 3 psychiatric drugs, and 1 each of 6 other therapeutic classes. The fate and impact modelling relied extensively on estimated data, given that most of these compounds have little or no experimental fate or ecotoxicity data available, as well as a limited reported occurrence in effluents. The contribution of estimated model input variables to the variance of freshwater ecotoxicity impact, aswell as the lack of experimental abiotic degradation data for most compounds, helped in establishing priorities for further testing. Generally, the effluent concentration and the ecotoxicity effect factor were the model input variables with the most significant effect on the uncertainty of output results.

AB Stability and removal of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) from wastewater produced at Al-Quds University Campus were investigated. Kinetic studies in both pure water and wastewater coming from secondary treatment (activated sludge) demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory DSP underwent degradation to its hydrolytic derivative, dexamethasone, in both media. The first-order hydrolysis rate of DSP in activated sludge at 25 degrees C (3.80x10(-6)s(-1)) was about 12-fold larger than in pure water (3.25x10(-7)s(-1)). The overall performance of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed in the University Campus was also assessed showing that 90% of spiked DSP was removed together with its newly identified metabolites by the ultra-filtration (UF) system, which consists of a UF hollow fibre (HF) with a 100-kDa cutoff membrane as the pre-polishing stage for the UF spiral wound with a 20-kDa cutoff membrane. In testing other technologies, the effectiveness of adsorption and filtration by micelle-clay (MC) preparation for removing DSP was ascertained in comparison with activated charcoal. Batch adsorption in aqueous suspensions of the MC composite and activated carbon was well described by Langmuir isotherms showing the best results for MC material. Filtration of DSP water solutions demonstrated a significant advantage of columns filled in with a mixture of sand and MC complex in comparison with activated carbon/sand filters.

AB Recovering nutrients from urine as solid minerals such as struvite can eliminate many hurdles related to the use of liquid urine as fertilizer in the current urine separation systems. The focus of this study has been to increase nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies by developing a struvite formation and recycling process. Struvite crystallization was carried out in urine samples by addition of MgO where 92% of phosphorus as orthophosphate was recovered. In order to optimize the use of calcined struvite in the struvite recycling step, four calcination treatments were tested and calcination at 200 degrees C for 3 h was chosen for further experiments. To remove the remaining ammonia present in urine a struvite recycling step was used subsequently. Through sequential struvite formation and struvite recycling process up to 90% of ammonium nitrogen was successfully removed.

AB The complex nature of biological reactions in biofilm reactors often poses difficulties in analyzing such reactors experimentally. Mathematical models could be very useful for their design and analysis. However, application of biofilm reactor models to practical problems proves somewhat ineffective due to the lack of knowledge of accurate kinetic models and uncertainty in model parameters. In this work, we propose an inverse modeling approach based on tabu search (TS) to estimate the parameters of kinetic and film thickness models. TS is used to estimate these parameters as a consequence of the validation of the mathematical models of the process with the aid of measured data obtained from an experimental fixed-bed anaerobic biofilm reactor involving the treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The results evaluated for different modeling configurations of varying degrees of complexity illustrate the effectiveness of TS for accurate estimation of kinetic and film thickness model parameters of the biofilm process. The results show that the two-dimensional mathematical model with Edward kinetics (with its optimum parameters as mu(max)rho(s)/Y = 24.57, K-s = 1.352 and K-I = 102.36) and three-parameter film thickness expression (with its estimated parameters as a = 0.289x10(-5), b = 1.55x10(-4) and c = 15.2x10(-6)) better describes the biofilm reactor treating the industry wastewater.

ID OXIDATION; EFFICIENCY; REMOVAL
AB Compared to the incineration and composting, landfill was an ordinary technology which is often used in the solid waste disposal. Landfill leachate is highly loaded, toxic, and harmful to the sanitation of wastewater. In past 20 years, technologies such as advanced oxidation processes had been developed for the treatment of wastewater which is contaminated by the hazardous and recalcitrant organic compounds, such as pesticides, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals, but so far there is little information about the application of fluidized-beds Fenton process in the oxidation treatment of organic compounds from the municipal landfill leachate. In this paper, the effects of different treatments to the municipal landfill leachate from Shaoxing landfill by gas-liquid fluidized bed with Fenton reagent were examined and evaluated. The effects of various operating conditions, such as treatment time, initial COD strength, initial pH value, initial [H2O2], initial [Fe2+], and ventilation volume were examined. After evaluation, several optimal operating conditions (COD = 2500 mg/L, reaction time of 30 min, pH=2.5, [Fe2+](0) = 0.05 mmol/L, [H2O2](0) = 0.075 mmol/L, ventilation volume of 0.12 m(3)/h, and temperature = 60 degrees C) were found under which the maximum COD removal rate (61.4%) was obtained.

AB Swine wastewater is an important pollution source of antibiotics entering the aquatic environment. In this work, the adsorption behavior of sulfamethazine (SMN), a commonly-used sulfonamide antibiotic, on activated sludge from a sequencing batch reactor treating swine wastewater was investigated. The results show that the adsorption of SMN on activated sludge was an initially rapid process and reached equilibrium after 6 hr. The removal efficiency of SMN from the water phase increased with an increasing concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids, while the adsorbed concentration of SMN decreased. Solution pH influenced both the speciation of SUN and the surface properties of activated sludge, thus significantly impacting the adsorption process. A linear partition model could give a good fit for the equilibrium concentrations of SMN at the test temperatures (i.e., 10, 20 and 30 degrees C). The partition coefficient (K-d) was determined to be 100.5 L/kg at 20 degrees C, indicating a quite high adsorption capacity for SMN. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that SMN adsorption on activated sludge was an exothermic process. This study could help to clarify the fate and behavior of sulfonamide antibiotics in the activated sludge process and assess consequent environmental risks arising from sludge disposal as well.

AB The electrochemical performance of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode in the electrochemical degradation of wastewaters containing sulfadiazine (SDZ) using a filter-press reactor is presented and discussed. The electrooxidation of the SDZ (volume of 0.5 L, with a SDZ initial concentration of 250 mg L-1) obtained at optimized conditions (current density of 36 mA cm(-2), pH 7.0 and volume flow rate of 5.0 L min(-1)) showed that at the end of only 2 h of electrolysis (corresponding to a charge passed through the cell per unit volume of the wastewater of 5.2 Ah L-1) SDZ was totally eliminated. The reduction of the wastewater organic load, monitored by its chemical oxygen demand (COD) showed that the antibiotic was virtually all mineralized. Under optimized conditions the intermediate compounds were properly identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and a SDZ oxidation pathway was elucidated. Clearly the BDD electrode proved to be quite efficient for both degradation and mineralization of SDZ.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were used as adsorbent material for the removal of clofibric acid (CA) which was difficult to be removed from wastewater by traditional wastewater treatment technique. Adsorption kinetics, adsorption equilibrium, and effect of pH, ionic strength, and humic acid (HA) of the adsorption of CA onto the GO nanosheets in aqueous solution were investigated in detail. Adsorption isotherm studies indicated that the Langmuir isotherm equation fitted the sorption isotherm data better than Freundlich model and the maximum adsorption capacity of GO nanosheets for CA was 994 mg g(-1). In addition, adsorption kinetics data showed that the sorption of CA on GO nanosheets reached equilibration within a few minutes and were well fitted by pseudo second-order model. The results of the effects of environment factors indicated that CA sorption on GO nanosheets was weakly affected by ionic strength and strongly depended on pH and HA because of the structure of CA and the large number of oxygen-containing function groups presented on the surface of GO nanosheets. Besides, the removal efficiency of GO nanosheets for CA was reduced at pH >4 and enhanced at pH <4 in the presence of HA.

AB Caffeine has already been used as an indicator of anthropogenic impacts, especially the ones related to the disposal of sewage in water bodies. In this work, the presence of caffeine has been correlated with the estrogenic activity of water samples measured using the BLYES assay. After testing 96 surface water samples, it was concluded that caffeine can be used to prioritize samples to be tested for estrogenic activity in water quality programs evaluating emerging contaminants with endocrine disruptor activity.

AB BACKGROUND: The persistence of microcontaminants through conventional wastewater treatments is a matter of concern and it suggests the implementation of advanced treatment steps. Although there is evidence that reverse osmosis (RO) is the most efficient treatment for the the removal of these compounds, it has the drawback of producing significant amounts of highly polluted brine. In this work, chemical analyses and toxicity bioassays were combined to evaluate the removal of different pharmaceuticals and of dioxin-like compounds from RO brine through oxidative processes such as ozone, UV and UV/H2O2.
   RESULTS: The removal of the selected pharmaceuticals required a relatively high oxidative capacity, either by ozonation or by the combination of UV radiation and H2O2. Bioassays showed a significant dioxin-like activity in brine samples, whereas antibacterial or estrogenic activities were negligible. UV by itself was the least efficient in removing this dioxin-like activity. Ozonation appeared as the most competent treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work indicate the usefulness of advanced oxidation methods, especially ozonation, to remove biologically active micropollutants from brine samples. They also show that only the combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows complete characterization of the efficiency of advanced water treatment processes to remove recalcitrant pollutants.

AB BACKGROUND: The pollution of the aquatic environment by pharmaceuticals has become a serious problem. Conventional technologies applied in water or sewage treatment plants are not effective in drugs removal, therefore there is an urgent need to develop new methods.
   RESULTS: The removal of diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU) and naproxen (NAP) sodium salts in a photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) utilizing direct contact membrane distillation and UV-C radiation from ultrapure water, tap water, primary effluents (PE) and secondary effluents (SE) of municipal wastewater treatment plant is presented. When PE were used as feed and TiO2 loading of 0.5 g dm(-3) was applied, DCF was removed completely, IBU amount decreased for 73% and NAP for 90%. In the case of SE, DCF, IBU and NAP concentrations decreased by 100%, 93% and 94%, respectively (1.5 gTiO(2) dm(-3)). Mineralization was low and did not exceed 14% for PE and 23% for SE. No drugs were found in the distillate, however, it contained high level of N-NH4+, especially in PE.
   CONCLUSION: The hybrid system can be an effective technology for the removal of pharmaceuticals from SE and PE, however, owing to membrane fouling the latter should be pretreated before application in the PMR. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB A Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped actinobacterial strain, designated as ZYR 51(T), was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater in Jinhua city, Zhejiang province, Eastern China. Isolation was aided by using a resuscitation-promoting factor, suggesting the strain was recovered from a viable but non-culturable state. Strain ZYR 51(T) was characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Growth was found to occur at 10-45 A degrees C, pH 6.0-10.0 and 0-9 % NaCl (w/v). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that strain ZYR 51(T) belongs to the genus Gordonia and showed low level similarities (below 97 %) with all other members of this genus. The strain was found to possess meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP), along with MK-9(H-2) as the predominant menaquonine. Mycolic acids were found to be present. C-16:0 (34.9 %), 10-methyl C-18:0 (30.3 %), iso-C-18:0(8.2 %), and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c as define by MIDI; 18.8 %) were identified as the major cellular fatty acids. The polar lipid profile of strain ZYR 51(T) was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and some unknown lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ZYR 51(T) was determined to be 67.7 mol%. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia jinhuaensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain is ZYR 51(T) (=CGMCC 1.12827(T) = NBRL B-59111(T) = NBRC 110001(T)).

AB The aim of present study was to treat municipal wastewater in two-stage anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFMBR) (anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) followed by AFMBR) using granular activated carbon (GAC) as carrier medium in both stages. Approximately 95% COD removal efficiency could be obtained when the two-stage AFMBR was operated at total HRT of 5 h (2 h for AFBR and 3 h for AFMBR) and influent COD concentration of 250 mg/L. About 67% COD and 99% TSS removal efficiency could be achieved by the system treating the effluent from primary clarifier of municipal wastewater treatment plant, at HRT of 1.28 h and OLR of 5.65 kg COD/m(3) d. The system could also effectively remove twenty detected pharmaceuticals in raw wastewaters with removal efficiency in the range of 86-100% except for diclofenac (78%). No other membrane fouling control was required except scouring effect of GAC for flux of 16 LMH. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) discharged with wastewater treatment effluents are a surface water quality concern. PPCPs are partially removed during wastewater treatment and biological transformation is an important removal mechanism. To investigate the potential for enhanced PPCP removal using bioaugmentation, bacteria were previously isolated from activated sludge capable of degrading PPCPs to ng/L concentrations. This study examined the degradation kinetics of triclosan and bisphenol A by five of these bacteria, both in pure culture and when augmented to activated sludge. Sorption coefficients were determined to account for the influence of partitioning during bioremoval. When the bacteria were added to activated sludge, degradation increased. Experimentally determined kinetic parameters were used to model a full-scale continuous treatment process, showing that low biomass could achieve reduced effluent PPCP concentrations. These results demonstrated that bioaugmentation may improve PPCP removal using established wastewater infrastructure under conditions of high solids partitioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work describes the production of alternative adsorbents from industrial residues and their application for the removal of a highly consumed antidepressant (citalopram) from water. The adsorbents were produced by pyrolysis of both primary and biological paper mill sludge at different temperatures and residence times. The original sludge and the produced chars were fully characterized by elemental and proximate analyses, total organic carbon, specific surface area (BET), N-2 isotherms, FTIR, C-13 and H-1 solid state NMR and SEM. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out to describe the adsorption of citalopram onto the produced materials. The fastest kinetics and the highest adsorption capacity were obtained using primary sludge pyrolysed at 800 degrees C during 150 min. The use of pyrolysed paper mill sludge for the remediation of contaminated waters might constitute an interesting application for the valorization of those wastes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tissue-specific bioconcentration of selected antidepressants was studied in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to undiluted effluent from a Swedish municipal sewage treatment plant for 13 days. Citalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine were found in the brains and livers of most fish, but not in blood plasma or muscle. Venlafaxine was the only drug found in plasma (3/20 fish). Fluoxetine was not detected in any fish tissue, in accordance with a low concentration in the effluent and a comparably high limit of quantification in tissues. Concentrations of citalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine in fish brain were up to 1/12, 1/8 and 1/26, respectively, of the lowest concentrations found in the brains of mammals treated with therapeutic doses. Thus, given coexposure to several antidepressants and an assumed similar potency in fish, the margin of safety for targetrelated effects in fish residing in effluent-dominated streams is relatively low. Furthermore, the non-detectable levels of these drugs in blood plasma suggest that analyses of concentrations in target tissues (brain) would be more informative in field studies and other studies with environmentally realistic exposure concentrations.

AB The closed basin of the Lower Jordan Valley with the Dead Sea as final sink features high evapotranspiration rates and almost complete reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation farming. This study focuses on the water transfer schemes and the presence, spreading, and potential accumulation of pharmaceutical residues in the local water resources based on findings of a five-year monitoring program. Overall 16 pharmaceuticals and 9 iodinated X-ray contrast media were monitored in groundwater, surface water, and treated wastewater. A total of 95 samples were taken to cover all geographical settings and flow paths from origin (wastewater) to target (groundwater). Nine substances were detected in groundwater, with concentrations ranging between 11 ng/L and 33,000 ng/L. Sometimes, detection rates were higher. than in comparable studies: Diatrizoic acid 75%, iopamidol 42%, iopromide 19%, iomeprol 11%, carbamazepine and iohexol 8%, ibuprofen 6%, and fenofibrate and iothalamic acid 3%. Concentrations in groundwater generally increase from north to south depending on the application of treated wastewater for irrigation. Almost all substances occurred most frequently and with highest concentrations in treated wastewater, followed by surface water and groundwater. As exception, diatrizoic add was found more frequently in groundwater than in treated wastewater, with concentrations being similar. This indicates the persistence of diatrizoic acid with long residence times in local groundwater systems, but may also reflect changing prescription patterns, which would be in accordance with increasing iopamidol findings and surveys at local hospitals. Trend analyses confirm this finding and indicate a high probability of increasing iopamidol concentrations, while other substances did not reveal any trends. However, no proof of evaporative enrichment could be found. The high spatial and temporal variability of the concentrations measured calls for further systematic studies to assess the long-term evolution of organic trace substances in this reuse setting.

AB The increasing contamination of freshwater with pharmaceuticals, surfactants, pesticides and other organic compounds are of major concern. As these contaminants are detected at trace levels in the environment it is important to determine if they elicit biological responses at the observed levels. In addition to chemical pollutants, there is also a concern for increasing levels of bacteria and other microorganisms in freshwater systems. In an earlier study, we observed the activation of inflammatory systems downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in southern Sweden. We also observed that the water contained unidentified components that were pro-inflammatory and potentiated the immune response in human urinary bladder epithelial cells. In order to determine if these effects were unique for the studied site or represent a common response in Swedish water, we have now performed a study on three WWTPs and their recipient waters in central Sweden. Analysis of immune responses in urinary bladder epithelial cells, monocyte-like cells and blood mononuclear cells confirm that these waters activate the immune system as well as induce pro-inflammatory responses. The results indicate that the cytokine profiles correlate to the endotoxin load of the waters rather than to the levels of pharmaceuticals or culturable bacteria load, suggesting that measurements of endotoxin levels and immune responses would be a valuable addition to the analysis of inland waters.

AB Simultaneous nitrification/denitrification and trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal during waste-water treatment by an integrated anoxic-aerobic MBR was examined. A set of 30 compounds was selected to represent TrOCs that occur ubiquitously in domestic wastewater. The system achieved over 95% total organic carbon (TOC) and over 80% total nitrogen (TN) removal. In addition, 21 of the 30 TrOCs investigated here were removed by over 90%. Low oxidation reduction potential (i.e., anoxic/anaerobic) regimes were conducive to moderate to high (50% to 90%) removal of nine TrOCs. These included four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (primidone, metronidazole, triclosan, and amitriptyline), one steroid hormone (17 beta-estradiol-17-acetate), one industrial chemical (4-tert-octylphenol) and all three selected UV filters (benzophenone, oxybenzone, and octocrylene). Internal recirculation between the anoxic and aerobic bioreactors was essential for anoxic removal of remaining TrOCs. A major role of the aerobic MBR for TOC, TN, and TrOC removal was observed.

AB Standardized ecotoxicological tests still constitute the fundamental tools when doing risk-assessment of aquatic contaminants. These protocols are managed towards minimal mortality in the controls, which is not representative for natural systems where mortality is often high. This methodological bias, generated from assays where mortality in the control group is systematically disregarded, makes it difficult to measure therapeutic effects of pharmaceutical contaminants leading to lower mortality. This is of concern considering that such effects on exposed organisms still may have substantial ecological consequences. In this paper, we illustrate this conceptual problem by presenting empirical data for how the therapeutic effect of Oxazepam-a common contaminant of surface waters-lower mortality rates among exposed Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) from wild populations, at two different life stages. We found that fry hatched from roe that had been exposed to dilute concentrations (1.1 +/- 0.3 mu g l(-1)) of Oxazepam for 24 h 3-6 days prior to hatching showed lower mortality rates and increased activity 30 days after hatching. Similar effects, i.e. increased activity and lower mortality rates were also observed for 2-year old perch exposed to dilute Oxazepam concentrations (1.2 +/- 0.4 mu g l(-1)). We conclude that therapeutic effects from pharmaceutical contaminants need to be considered in risk assessment assays to avoid that important ecological effects from aquatic contaminants are systematically missed.

AB Batch experiments were carried out for 7 days to investigate the simultaneous removal of various organic and inorganic contaminants including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), metals, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and estrogenic activity in wastewater by four freshwater green microalgae species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella vulgaris. After treatment for 7 days, 76.7-92.3% of TN, and 67.5-82.2% of TP were removed by these four algae species. The removal of metals from wastewater by the four algae species varied among the metal species. These four algae species could remove most of the metals efficiently (>40% removal), but showed low efficiencies in removing Pb, Ni and Co. The four algae species were also found to be efficient in removing most of the selected organic compounds with >50% removal, and the estrogenic activity with removal efficiencies ranging from 46.2 to 81.1% from the wastewater. Therefore, algae could be harnessed to simultaneously remove various contaminants in wastewater.

The addition of Fe(II) to the UV/H2O2 system did not improve the degradation efficiency due to inhibition of the photo-Fenton reaction, at acid pH, in the presence of chloride ions in these wastewaters. The increase of pH from 2 to 7 increased the degree of mineralization under UV photolysis of H2O2 because more HO center dot radicals are available by HOCl center dot dissociation reaction. Under the selected operation conditions ([H2O2](o) = 11,500 ppm, [Fe(II)] = 0 ppm, [TOC](o) = 125 ppm and pH = 7), 100% of TOC removal was attained in 120 min. A significant synergistic effect of combining photolysis (UV/H2O2) and sonolysis was observed. Sonophotolysis (UV/H2O2/ultrasound) technique significantly increased the degree of mineralization (100% TOC removal in 90 min using 6500 ppm H2O2) when compared with each individual process. Sonochemical reaction was favored by the presence of chloride ions since the concentration of contaminants at the gas liquid interface increased. Free radicals reaction was the controlling mechanism in the UV/H2O2/ultrasound system. HO center dot radicals were the main oxidative intermediate species in the process, although hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2 center dot) also played a role. The contribution of thermal-pyrolytic reaction (in gas-phase) to sonophotolysis process was negligible. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We employed a multi-tracer approach to investigate sources and pathways of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in urban groundwater, based on 53 groundwater samples taken from confined aquifers and unconfined aquifers in Tokyo. While the median concentrations of groundwater PFAAs were several ng/L, the maximum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, 990 ng/L), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 1800 ng/L) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA, 620 ng/L) in groundwater were several times higher than those of wastewater and street runoff reported in the literature. PFAAs were more frequently detected than sewage tracers (carbamazepine and crotamiton), presumably owing to the higher persistence of PFAAs, the multiple sources of PFAAs beyond sewage (e.g., surface runoff, point sources) and the formation of PFAAs from their precursors. Use of multiple methods of source apportionment including principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid ratio analysis highlighted sewage and point sources as the primary sources of PFAAs in the most severely polluted groundwater samples, with street runoff being a minor source (44.6% sewage, 45.7% point sources and 9.7% street runoff, by PCA-MLR). Tritium analysis indicated that, while young groundwater (recharged during or alter the 1970s, when PFAAs were already in commercial use) in shallow aquifers (<50 m depth) was naturally highly vulnerable to PFAA pollution, PFAAs were also found in old groundwater (recharged before the 1950s, when PFAAs were not in use) in deep aquifers (50-500 m depth). This study demonstrated the utility of multiple uses of tracers (pharmaceuticals and personal care products; PPCPs, tritium) and source apportionment methods in investigating sources and pathways of PFAAs in multiple aquifer systems.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA English

DE Sewage effluent quality; Trace chemicals; Data distributions
ID WATER TREATMENT WORKS
AB It is important to understand the statistical distribution of monitoring data for them to be of value in determining the parameters of environmental models. No such distributional information has been available for many trace contaminants in sewage effluents. This paper applies the data of a major UK sewage works' effluent monitoring programme to determine the validity of the common assumption that data are lognormally distributed. Effluent quality was monitored at 162 wastewater treatment works over 1 year, generating over 3,000 results for each of over 40 substances, including metals, trace organic substances and pharmaceuticals. It is demonstrated that the lognormal assumption is clearly justified for the great majority of substances in the spatial case-for annual average effluent concentrations across different treatment works. In the site-specific, temporal case-for individual determinations of concentration at a single site over an annual period-lognormality is generally supported but not demonstrated so unequivocally for all site/substance combinations. The principal source of uncertainty was lack of sufficient numbers of observations reported to adequately low reporting limits.

AB Six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated to evaluate the occurrence and removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), NDMA formation potential (FP) and four specific NDMA precursors, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylformamide (DMFA) and dimethylaminobenzene (DMAB). DMA and tertiary amines with DMA functional group commonly existed in municipal wastewater. Chemically enhanced primary process (CEPP) had no effect on removal of either NDMA or NDMA FP. In WWTPs with secondary treatment processes, considerable variability was observed in the removal of NDMA (19%-85%) and NDMA FP (16%-76%), moreover, there was no definite relationship between the removal of NDMA and NDMA FP. DMA was well removed in all the six surveyed WWTPs; its removal efficiency was greater than 97%. For the removal of tertiary amines, biologic treatment processes with nitrification and denitrification had better removal efficiency than conventional activated sludge process. The best removal efficiencies for TMA, DMFA and DMAB were 95%, 68% and 72%, respectively. CEPP could remove 73% of TMA, 23% of DMFA and 36% of DMAB. After UV disinfection, only 17% of NDMA was removed due to low dosage of UV was applied in WWTP. Although chlorination could reduce NDMA precursors, NDMA concentration was actually increased after chlorination.

AB The environmental safety of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) requires a crucial examination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of biomarkers of stress and toxicity in freshwater mussels to the effect of commonly found PPCPs in wastewater. We treated male mussels Unio tumidus, from an undisturbed site with ibuprofen (IBU, 250 ng L-1), triclosan (TCS, 500 ng L-1), or estrone (E1, 100 ng L-1) for 14 days. Untreated mussels from this site (C) and mussels inhabiting a polluted area (P) were also examined after a similar time of being kept in the laboratory. The consequences of chronic exposure of the mussels in the P-group were reflected in elevated concentrations of oxyradicals (1.4 times), oxidized glutathione (4.3 times), lipofuscin (2.2 times), and DNA-strand breaks in the digestive gland (DG) in comparison to the C-group, higher levels of caspase-3 activity in the DG, and vitellogenin-like proteins in gonads among all studied groups. Exposed mussels demonstrated some common responses with mussels in the P-group: elevated levels of lactate/pyruvate ratio, lipofuscin (IBU and E1), DNA fragmentation (TCS and E1), and caspase-3 activity (TCS and E1). Exposed to PPCPs mussels also showed elevation of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and/or glutathione-S-transferase activity in the DG and a decrease in lysosomal stability in hemocytes (TCS and E1). The TCS group was distinguished by having the highest level of DNA-fragmentation and the lowest concentrations of total glutathione, oxyradicals, lipofuscin, pyruvate, and lactate, reflecting total metabolic depression. These results show that selected PPCPs at low concentrations alter a variety of physiological processes in this animal model system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The conventional parameters and acute toxicities of antibiotic wastewater collected from each treatment unit of an antibiotic wastewater treatment plant have been investigated. The investigation of the conventional parameters indicated that the antibiotic wastewater treatment plant performed well under the significant fluctuation in influent water quality. The results of acute toxicity indicated that the toxicity of antibiotic wastewater could be reduced by 94.3 percent on average after treatment. However, treated antibiotic effluents were still toxic to Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity of antibiotic production wastewater could be attributed to the joint effects of toxic compound mixtures in wastewater. Moreover, aerobic biological treatment processes, including sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and aerobic biofilm reactor, played the most important role in reducing toxicity by 92.4 percent. Pearson's correlation coefficients revealed that toxicity had a strong and positive linear correlation with organic substances, nitrogenous compounds, S2-, volatile phenol, cyanide, As, Zn, Cd, Ni and Fe. Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) was the greatest contributor to toxicity according to the stepwise regression method. The multiple regression model was a good fit for [TU50-15 min] as a function of [NH4+] with the determination coefficient of 0.981. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are commonly used in swine feed to treat and prevent disease, as well as to promote growth. Antibiotics released into the environment via wastewater could accelerate the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria and resistance genes in the surrounding environment. In this study, we quantified the occurrence of sulfonamides, sulfonamide-resistant microorganisms and resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm in northern Taiwan and its surrounding natural water bodies and soils. Sulfonamide levels were similar in the receiving downstream and upstream river water. However, the prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, as analyzed by cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, was significantly greater in the downstream compared to the upstream river water samples. Barcoded-pyrosequencing revealed a highly diverse bacterial community structure in each sample. However, the sequence identity of the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in the wastewater and downstream environment samples was nearly identical (99-100%). The sul1 gene, which is genetically linked to class 1 integrons, was dominant in the downstream water bodies and soils. In conclusion, the increased prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm, independent of the persistent presence of sulfonamides, could be a potential source of resistant gene pools in the surrounding environment.

AB The occurrence and seasonal variation of 50 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Xiamen, China was investigated over a period of one year. Among the targets, 39 PPCPs were detected in the influent. The highest concentration was observed for acetaminophen, with the average concentration in the influent of 2963.5 ng/L. The seasonal variation of PPCPs in the influent was observed. For most pharmaceuticals, highest concentrations were in March 2013, followed by December 2012, while the concentrations were lower in August 2012 and May 2013. Among the detected PPCPs, 14 targets could be removed more than 50% in the WWTP. The activated sludge treatment process contributed to most of PPCP removal, while the adsorption to the particles in the primary treatment and the transformation under UV radiation in the disinfection treatment also contributed to the PPCP removal. Among the detected PPCPs in the influent, 36 PPCPs could be detected in the final effluent of the WWTP. Significantly higher concentrations of PPCPs were observed in effluent samples collected in March 2013 compared to other seasons, suggesting higher concentrations of PPCPs could be discharged into the surrounding seawater during this period.

AB In this study, the microwave-assisted sol-gel method and chemical reduction were used to synthesize Cu-TiO2 nanorod composites for enhanced photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in the presence of UV and visible lights. The electron microscopic images showed that the Cu nanoparticles at 4.5 +/- 0.1 nm were well-deposited onto the surface of TiO2 nanorods after chemical reduction of Cu ions by NaBH4. The X-ray diffractometry patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic results indicated that Cu species on the Cu-TiO2 nanorods were mainly the mixture of Cu2O and Cu-0. The Cu-TiO2 nanorods showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward BPA photodegradation under the irradiation of UV and visible lights. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k(obs)) for BPA photodegradation by 7 wt% Cu-TiO2 nanorods were 18.4 and 3.8 times higher than those of as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods and Degussa P25 TiO2, respectively, under the UV light irradiation. In addition, the k(obs) for BPA photodegradation by 7 wt% Cu-TiO2 nanorods increased by a factor of 5.8 when compared with that of Degussa P25 TiO2 under the irradiation of 460 +/- 40 nm visible light. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using one-dimensional Cu-TiO2 nanorods for photocatalytic degradation of BPA and other pharmaceutical and personal care products in water and wastewater treatment plants.

AB Sequential treatments consisting in a chemical process followed by a conventional biological treatment, have been applied to remove mixtures of nine contaminants of pharmaceutical type spiked in a primary sedimentation effluent of a municipal wastewater. Combinations of ozone, UVA black light (BL) and Fe(III) or Fe3O4 catalysts constituted the chemical systems. Regardless of the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP), the removal of pharmaceutical compounds was achieved in 1h of reaction, while total organic carbon (TOC) only diminished between 3.4 and 6%. Among selected ozonation systems to be implemented before the biological treatment, the application of ozone alone in the pre-treatment stage is recommended due to the increase of the biodegradability observed. The application of ozone followed by the conventional biological treatment leads high TOC and COD removal rates, 60 and 61%, respectively, and allows the subsequent biological treatment works with shorter hydraulic residence time (HRT). Moreover, the influence of the application of AOPs before and after a conventional biological process was compared, concluding that the decision to take depends on the characterization of the initial wastewater with pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Overall photodegradation of pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and pharmaceutical metabolites were investigated in order to evaluate their photochemical fate in aquatic environments in various natural organic matter (NOM) enriched solutions. Tested PPCPs exhibited different rates of loss during direct and indirect photolysis. Here, only ultraviolet (UV) light source was used for direct photolysis and UV together with (DOM)-D-3* for indirect photolysis. Diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole were susceptible to photodegradation, whereas carbamazepine, caffeine, paraxanthine and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) showed low levels of photodegradation rate, reflecting their conservative photoreactivity. During indirect photodegradation, in contrast to the hydrophilic autochthonous NOM, allochthonous NOM with relatively high molecular weight (MW), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and hydrophobicity (e.g., Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA)) revealed to significantly inhibit the photolysis of target micropollutants. The presence of Typha wetland NOM enhanced the indirect photolysis of well-known conservative micopollutants (carbamazepine and paraxanthine). And atenolol, carbamazepine, glimepiride, and N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole were found to be sensitive to the triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*) with Typha wetland NOM under deoxygenated condition. This suggests that photolysis in constructed wetlands connected to the wastewater treatment plant can enhance the degradation of some anthropogenic micropollutants by the interaction with (DOM)-D-3* in wetlands.

AB Fluctuations in ammonium (NH4+), measured as NH4-N loads using an ion-selective electrode installed at the inlet of a sewage treatment plant, showed a distinctive pattern which was associated to weekly (i.e., commuters) and seasonal (i.e., holidays) fluctuations of the population. Moreover, population size estimates based on NH4-N loads were lower compared to census data. Diurnal profiles of benzoylecgonine (BE) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC- COOH) were shown to be strongly correlated to NH4-N. Characteristic patterns, which reflect the prolonged nocturnal activity of people during the weekend, could be observed for BE, cocaine, and a major metabolite of MDMA (i.e., 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine). Additional 24 h composite samples were collected between February and September 2013. Per-capita loads (i.e., grams per day per 1000 inhabitants) were computed using census data and NH4-N measurements. Normalization with NH4-N did not modify the overall pattern, suggesting that the magnitude of fluctuations in the size of the population is negligible compared to those of illicit drug loads. Results show that fluctuations in the size of the population over longer periods of time or during major events can be monitored using NH4-N loads: either using raw NH4-N loads or population size estimates based on NH4-N loads, if information about site-specific NH4-N population equivalents is available.

AB A submerged membrane bioreactor was set up to investigate the removal efficiencies of five pharmaceuticals from synthetic domestic wastewater. Batch experiments were conducted with sterilized sludge and activated sludge to explore the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation for those pharmaceuticals. Notable difference of those pharmaceuticals removal efficiencies was observed, at about 92.2, 90.0, 55.4, 38.5 and 3.2% for acetaminophen, 17 beta-estradiol, naproxen, diclofenac sodium, and carbamazepine, respectively. Results of batch adsorption experiments via sterilized sludge showed that the removal efficiencies of five pharmaceuticals by sludge adsorption were 7.9, 68.2, 60.1, 40.1 and 71.5%, respectively, which were positively correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficients. Results of batch experiments via activated sludge showed that 83.4% of acetaminophen, 98.0% of 17 beta-estradiol, and 46.8% of naproxen were removed through the combination of sludge adsorption and biodegradation, while adsorption accumulation in sludge phase was only 1.8, 1.3 and 7.0%. This implies that the removals of these three drugs were mainly achieved by biodegradation. The total removal efficiency of diclofenac sodium was 19.7%, and the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation were 14.9 and 4.8%, which indicated that the removal of diclofenac sodium was mainly achieved by sludge adsorption. The total removal efficiency of carbamazepine was only 8.9% and this implies that neither sludge adsorption nor biodegradation is effective for its removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is a public health concern: drugs administered to humans and animals are excreted with urine or faeces and attend the sewage treatment. The main consequences of use and abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that has become a serious global problem. Aim of the study is to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products.
   Results: Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin (VA) and Penicillin (P). In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted.
   Conclusions: Wild caught seawater fish collected in Gulf of Salerno (Campania Region), especially in marine areas including mouths of streams, were contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains and that they might play an important role in the spread of antibiotic-resistance.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is a typical Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC), which is potentially harmful during wastewater reclamation. In this study, its degradation during Fenton's process under different operational conditions was investigated in combination with subsequent nanofiltration of low concentration remnant BPA and compounds derived from oxidation. The results indicate that BPA could be degraded efficiently in aqueous phase by Fenton, even at very low hydrogen peroxide doses. The treatment of up to 300 mg/L solutions of BPA with Fenton liquor at optimal conditions resulted in its complete removal in less than 2 min. The optimal conditions were found to be pH, = 3, H2O2/BPA = 020 and Fe2+/BPA = 0.012. Five NF polymeric membranes having different properties were used for the nanofiltration of treated and non-treated solutions. The nanofiltration of BPA solutions showed that rejection is related to adsorption ability of BPA on the membrane and size exclusion mechanism. In the nanofiltration of the effluent after Fenton oxidation, high TOC, COD, colour and Fe2+ (>77%) removal were achieved, although significant membrane fouling was also observed. The normalised water flux after membrane flushing with water was lower than 60% in almost all used membranes, which indicates significant non-easily removable fouling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   STRATEGIES
AB Micropollutants (MPs) as individual compounds or in complex mixtures are relevant for water quality and may trigger unwanted ecological effects. MPs originate from different point and diffuse sources and enter water bodies via different flow paths. Effluents from conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in which various MPs are not or not completely removed, is one major source. To improve the water quality and avoid potential negative ecological effects by micropollutants, various measures to reduce the discharge should be taken. In this feature we discuss one of these measures; the benefits of upgrading WWTPs toward reduced MP loads and toxicities from wastewater effluents, using the recently decided Swiss strategy as an example. Based on (i) full-scale case studies using zonation or powder activated carbon treatment, showing substantial reduction of MP discharges and concomitant reduced toxicities, (ii) social and political acceptance, (iii) technical feasibility and sufficient cost-effectiveness, the Swiss authorities recently decided to implement additional wastewater treatment steps as mitigation strategy to improve water quality. Since MPs are of growing global concern, the concepts and considerations behind the Swiss strategy are explained in this feature, which could be of use for other countries as well. It should be realized that upgrading WWTPs is not the only solution to reduce the discharge of MPs entering the environment, but is part of a broader, multipronged mitigation strategy.

AB Steroids are excreted from humans and animals and discharged with wastewaters into the environment, resulting in potential adverse effects on organisms. Based on the excretion rates from different groups of humans and animals, the emissions of seven steroids (estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), testosterone (T), androsterone (A), progesterone (P), and cortisol (C)) were comprehensively estimated in 58 river basins of whole China, and their multimedia fate was simulated by using a level III fugacity multimedia model. The results showed that higher emission densities for the steroids were found in the river basins of east China than in west China. This distribution was found to be generally similar to the distribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across China. E3, A, and P displayed higher emission densities than the other steroids in most of the river basins. The total excretion of steroids by humans and animals in China was estimated to be 3069 t/yr. The excretion of steroids from animals was two times larger than that from humans. After various treatments, the total emission of steroids was reduced to 2486 t/yr, of which more than 80% was discharged into the water compartment. The predicted concentrations in water were within an order of magnitude of the measured concentrations available in the literature. Owing to wastewater irrigation, more steroid mass loadings in agricultural soil were found in the basins of Haihe River and Huaihe River in comparison with the other river basins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the emissions and multimedia fate of seven steroids in the river basins of China.

AB Magnetic nano-scaled particles Fe3O4 were studied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to generate active radicals for degradation of acetaminophen (APAP) in water. The Fe3O4 MNPs were found to effectively catalyze PMS for removal of APAP, and the reactions well followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics pattern (R-2 > 0.95). Within 120 min, approximately 75% of 10 ppm APAP was accomplished by 0.2 mM PMS in the presence of 0.8 g/L Fe3O4 MNPs with little Fe3+ leaching (<4 mu g/L). Higher Fe3O4 MNP dose, lower initial APAP concentration, neutral pH, and higher reaction temperature favored the APAP degradation. The production of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals was validated through two ways: (1) indirectly from the scavenging tests with scavenging agents, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and ethanol (EtOH); (2) directly from the electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) tests with 0.1 M 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO). Plausible mechanisms on the radical generation from Fe3O4 MNP activation of PMS are proposed based on the results of radical identification tests and XPS analysis. It appeared that Fe2+ Fe3+ on the catalyst surface was responsible for the radical generation. The results demonstrated that Fe3O4 MNPs activated PMS is a promising technology for water pollution caused by contaminants such as pharmaceuticals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are the predominant disposal method for human waste in areas without municipal sewage treatment alternatives. Relatively few studies have addressed the release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from OWTS to groundwater. PPCP fate and transport from OWTS are important, particularly where these systems are adjacent to sensitive aquatic ecosystems such as coastal areas or wetlands. The objectives of this study were to identify PPCPs in residential wastewater and groundwater beneath OWTS and to characterize the environmental conditions affecting the OWTS discharge of PPCPs to nearby streams. The study sites are in coastal plain aquifers, which may be considered vulnerable "end-members" for subsurface PPCP transport. The PPCPs most commonly detected in the OWTS, at concentrations ranging from 0.12 mu g L-1 to 12.04 mu g L-1 in the groundwater, included: caffeine, ibuprofen, DEET, and homosalate. Their presence was related to particulate and dissolved organic carbon abundance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Illicit drug use is a global phenomenon involving millions of individuals, which results in serious health and social costs. The chemical analysis of urban wastewater for the excretion products of illicit drugs is a potent approach for monitoring patterns and trends of illicit drug use in a community. The first international and multidisciplinary conference on this topic was recently organized to present the epidemiological knowledge of patterns in drug use and the information obtained from wastewater analysis. This paper gives an overview of the main issues that emerged during the conference, focusing on the identified research gaps and requirements and on the future challenges and opportunities from bringing together wastewater analysis and drug epidemiology. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) uses an established multi-indicator system to monitor illicit drug use and to identity the emergence of new psychoactive substances. The methodological challenges of monitoring a hidden and stigmatized behavior like drug use include the limitations of self-report data and reporting delays. An increasing evidence base suggests that wastewater analysis can address some of these problems. Specifically this technique can: monitor temporal and spatial trends in drug use at different scales, provide updated estimates of drug use, and identify changing habits and the use of new substances. A best practice protocol developed by a Europe-wide network of experts is available to produce homogeneous and comparable data at different sites. The systematic evaluation of uncertainties related to wastewater analysis has highlighted which areas require careful control and those that need further investigation to generally improve the approach. Wastewater analysis has considerable potential to complement existing approaches for monitoring drug use due to its ability to produce objective, real-time estimates of drug use and to give timely information of any change in the patterns of use.

AB This paper presents, for the first time, community-wide estimation of drug and pharmaceuticals consumption in England using wastewater analysis and a large number of compounds. Among groups of compounds studied were: stimulants, hallucinogens and their metabolites, opioids, morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and others. Obtained results showed the usefulness of wastewater analysis in order to provide estimates of local community drug consumption. It is noticeable that where target compounds could be compared to NHS prescription statistics, good comparisons were apparent between the two sets of data. These compounds include oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, methadone, tramadol, temazepam and diazepam. Whereas, discrepancies were observed for propoxyphene, codeine, dosulepin and venlafaxine (over-estimations in each case except codeine). Potential reasons for discrepancies include: sales of drugs sold without prescription and not included within NHS data, abuse of a drug with the compound trafficked through illegal sources, different consumption patterns in different areas, direct disposal leading to over estimations when using parent compound as the drug target residue and excretion factors not being representative of the local community. It is noticeable that using a metabolite (and not a parent drug) as a biomarker leads to higher certainty of obtained estimates. With regard to illicit drugs, consistent and logical results were reported. Monitoring of these compounds over a one week period highlighted the expected recreational use of many of these drugs (e.g. cocaine and MDMA) and the more consistent use of others (e.g. methadone).

AB Concentrations of metabolites of illicit drugs in sewage water can be measured with great accuracy and precision, thanks to the development of sensitive and robust analytical methods. Based on assumptions about factors including the excretion profile of the parent drug, routes of administration and the number of individuals using the wastewater system, the level of consumption of a drug can be estimated from such measured concentrations. When presenting results from these 'back-calculations', the multiple sources of uncertainty are often discussed, but are not usually explicitly taken into account in the estimation process. In this paper we demonstrate how these calculations can be placed in a more formal statistical framework by assuming a distribution for each parameter involved, based on a review of the evidence underpinning it. Using a Monte Carlo simulations approach, it is then straightforward to propagate uncertainty in each parameter through the back-calculations, producing a distribution for instead of a single estimate of daily or average consumption. This can be summarised for example by a median and credible interval. To demonstrate this approach, we estimate cocaine consumption in a large urban UK population, using measured concentrations of two of its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and norbenzoylecgonine. We also demonstrate a more sophisticated analysis, implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our model allows the two metabolites to simultaneously inform estimates of daily cocaine consumption and explicitly allows for variability between days. After accounting for this variability, the resulting credible interval for average daily consumption is appropriately wider, representing additional uncertainty. We discuss possibilities for extensions to the model, and whether analysis of wastewater samples has potential to contribute to a prevalence model for illicit drug use. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Analysis of wastewater with an aim of community-wide estimation of drug use is a new and very promising approach. Until now it was very difficult to determine if mass loads of studied drugs were actually originating from consumption, or disposal of unused drugs or production waste. This uncertainty in the estimation of community wide drugs use should not be underestimated. This paper aims to apply for the first time enantiomeric profiling in verifying sources of the presence of MDMA and amphetamine in wastewater based on a case study in two Dutch cities: Utrecht and Eindhoven. The results showed that MDMA is usually present in wastewater due to its consumption (MDMA enriched with R(-)-enantiomer). Excessively high mass loads of MDMA during a sampling campaign in Utrecht in 2011 proved to be racemic indicating direct disposal of unused MDMA possibly as a result of a police raid at a nearby illegal production facility. Enantiomeric profiling was also undertaken in order to verify the origin of unexpectedly high mass loads of amphetamine in the city of Eindhoven in 2011. Unfortunately, a distinction between consumption and direct disposal of unused amphetamine in Dutch wastewater could not be achieved. Further work will have to be undertaken to fully understand sources of amphetamine in Dutch wastewaters. Crown Copyright 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sewage-based epidemiology was applied for the first time to a number of mainland Chinese megacities. The application monitored influents to 9 sewage treatment plants (STPs) to estimate the use of illicit drugs in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. Altogether, 11.4 million inhabitants were covered during September-October 2012.24-h composite raw sewage samples were collected for 4 consecutive days at each STP. Each collected sample was analyzed for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methylester, methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethy1-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, ketamine, and norketamine. Through the analysis of these chemical residues, the use of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, mephedrone, methadone, methamphetamine, methylenedioxypyrovalerone and ketamine among Chinese urban inhabitants was monitored. The results obtained demonstrated in a quantitative way that the drug use patterns of Chinese are different from their European counterparts. Abuse of methamphetamine and ketamine was particularly noteworthy in China, while consumption of cocaine and ecstasy, the most popular drugs in Europe, was very low among the sampled Chinese inhabitants. Further, the use of most drugs demonstrated a geographical trend, since their use was much higher in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou than it was in Beijing and Shanghai. Interestingly, the exclusive, but minor, metabolite of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine, was detected only sporadically. This would suggest that the use of heroin among Chinese urban users sampled in the study was low. Further, the patterns of drug use observed during the study are largely consistent with trends reported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Overall, our study suggests that sewage-based epidemiology can readily be used to monitor the use of illicit drugs in those countries/regions where traditional means to monitor drug use patterns have only yielded limited or information of questionable reliability.

AB Several drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine and several opioid prescription drugs were detected in wastewater from two Canadian cities, a small community (75,000 population) and a large urban center (1.6 million population). The objective of this study was to evaluate community use of these drugs in two cities with large differences in population size and demographics. In addition, we evaluated the use of the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) as a monitoring tool for drugs of abuse. Heroin was not detected at either location, probably because this illicit drug is metabolized to morphine prior to excretion. Acetylcodeine and acetylmorphine were also not detected. Estimates of community consumption from wastewater analysis indicated that the most widely used drug was cocaine at a median level of consumption in the larger city of approximately 38 doses per day per 1000 people. Consumption of the substituted amphetamine, ephedrine, as well as methamphetamine was also higher in the larger city, at 21 and 1.8 doses per day per 1000 people, respectively. Use of amphetamine, MDMA and tramadol were similar in both centers, but use of oxycodone was greater in the smaller city. Use of MDMA (ecstasy) peaked on weekends. Ketamine was detected in wastewater from the larger city; the first report of abuse of this veterinary anesthetic in a North American city. POCIS sampling rates were determined for the first time for 7 of the target compounds. Comparing the time weighted average concentrations estimated from POCIS data to the concentrations obtained from 24-h composite samples, the data were generally comparable, except for some compounds which were not detected in POCIS deployed in the untreated wastewater, probably because of biofouling or accumulation of debris on the cages containing the POCIS. This study indicates that the size and demographics of population centers can influence the patterns of abuse of drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites are continually released from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment; however, their impact on aquatic biota is poorly understood. This study examined the toxicity and bioconcentration of three pharmaceuticals: moxifloxacin, rosuvastatin, and drospirenone to the unionid mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea. Effects of moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin were assessed through aqueous 21-d static-renewal tests using 2-year-old mussels, at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mg/L (nominal concentrations). Following exposure, survival, behavior, algal clearance rate, hemocyte viability and density, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were assessed. In addition, the acute (48 h) toxicity of moxifloxacin (0-100 mg/L) and drospirenone (0-3 mg/L) to glochidia (larval mussels) were examined. In 21 day exposures (2-yr old mussels), there were no differences in survival, oxygen consumption, hemocyte density, or GST activity over the range of concentrations examined: however, the proportion of time mussels spent filtering, and consequently the algal clearance rate, decreased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin concentrations. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranged between 0.03 and 70 for moxifloxacin, and between 0 and 0.05 for rosuvastatin for exposures up to 100 mg/L. The BCF for moxifloxacin at the highest exposure concentration was lower than that at the mid-level concentrations, likely due to decreased filtering activity at the higher exposure levels. The feeding rates declined and the amount of time the subadult mussels spent with their valves closed increased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin exposures. Glochidia viability did not vary with exposure to drospirenone, but declined at the highest moxifloxacin concentration, resulting in an EC50 of 120 mg/L. Overall, observed sublethal and lethal effects occurred at concentrations which exceed expected environmental concentrations through aqueous exposure, suggesting a low risk to freshwater mussels from these particular PPCPs.

AB Wastewater analysis has the potential to provide objective information on community drug use. Introducing a population biomarker (PB) in the sample analysis may significantly reduce errors in the back-calculation associated with population estimation and wastewater volume measurement. A number of potential PBs have been suggested but no systematic evaluation has been conducted so far. This study evaluated the eligibility of the previously suggested PB candidates (creatinine, cholesterol, coprostanol and cotinine) as well as three new ones (cortisol, androstenedione and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) using five criteria. We assessed the quantification method, affinity to particulate matter and stability of candidates in wastewater, as well as the constancy of inter-day excretion and correlation between excretion and census population. All PB candidates were quantifiable in wastewater. Cholesterol and coprostanol were eliminated from further consideration due to affinity to particulate matters in the wastewater. Creatinine, cortisol and androstenedione were disqualified for stability reasons. On a population scale, both cotinine and 5-HIAA were excreted (RSD = 8.01 +/- 1.13% and 10.20 +/- 0.89%, respectively) at a constant rate and concentrations of each correlated well with the census population (r = 0.9809 and 0.9442, respectively). Overall, both cotinine and 5-HIAA are eligible PBs, but the neurotransmitter metabolite 5-HIAA may be more suitable for international comparisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data obtained from the analysis of wastewater from large-scale sewage treatment plants has been successfully applied to study trends in the use of classical illicit drugs such as cocaine, but the dynamic nature of the new psychoactive substances (NPS) market presents a unique set of challenges to epidemiologists. In an attempt to overcome some of the challenges, this paper presents a framework whereby a collection of tools and alternative data-sources can be used to support the design and implementation of wastewaterbased studies on NPS use. Within this framework the most likely and most suitable biomarkers for a given NPS are predicted via (in-silico) Under bar metabolism, biotransformation and sorption models. Subsequent detection and confirmation of the biomarkers in samples of wastewater are addressed via high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
   The proposed framework is applied to a set of test substances including synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones. In general, the (in-silico) Under bar models predict that transformation via N-dealkylation and hydroxylation is likely for these compounds, and that adsorption is expected to be significant for cannabinoids in wastewater. Screening via HRMS is discussed with examples from the literature, and common-fragment searching and mass-defect filtering are successfully performed on test samples such that spectral noise is removed to leave only the information that is most likely to be related to the NPS biomarkers. HRMS screening is also applied to a set of pissoir-sourced wastewater samples and a total of 48 pharmaceuticals and drugs including 1-(2methoxyphenyl)piperazine (oMeOPP) are identified.

AB Stability of the selected urinary biomarkers of six illicit drugs and two therapeutic opioids in municipal wastewater was studied in order to determine errors associated with their possible transformation in the sewer. The stability was assessed in experiments conducted at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C in order to simulate typical winter and summer temperature conditions in the sewer system. Among fourteen substances tested, the most unstable compounds were morphine-3-beta-D glucuronide (MG), 6-acetyl morphine (6-AM), cocaine (COC) and 6-acetyl codeine (6-AC), while all other investigated compounds appeared to be relatively stable over a period of 72 h. The transformation of all degradable compounds followed pseudo-first order kinetics with significantly longer half-times (t(1/2)) at winter conditions. At 20 degrees C, t(1/2) of MG, 6-AM, COC and 6-AC was 7 h, 87 h, 35 h and 58 h, respectively, while the corresponding tip, values at 10 degrees C were 18 h, 139 h, 173 h and 87 h. The main transformation mechanism of MG, 6-AM and 6-AC was most probably their enzymatic hydrolysis to morphine (MOR) and codeine (COD), while COC transformation to benzoylecgonine (BE) was primarily governed by chemical hydrolysis. The results indicate that the effect of the observed transformation of urinary biomarkers of COC and 6-AM on the estimates of COC and heroin consumption are relatively small (<10%) if the in-sewer hydraulic retention time is lower than 12 h. Acidification of the wastewater samples proved to be the good way to stabilise the wastewater samples for the analysis of all selected compounds, except for I 1-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). This finding should be taken into account when selecting the preservation technique for multiresidual analyses of different groups of illicit drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to assess the bioavailable concentrations of analgesics, psycholeptics, antidepressants and illicit drugs in the surface waters of the Czech Republic. All of the sampling sites are located within the most important water quality monitoring profiles at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. The total concentrations of the compounds ranged from 463 to 6447 ng POCIS-1 (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler). Carbamazepine (196-2690 ng POCIS-1) and tramadol (160-2250 ng POCIS-1) were the most abundant compounds at every site. The most polluted sites were those that received communal wastewater effluent and had a low dilution factor (ratio of wastewater effluent and river flow). The aqueous concentrations of the target compounds were estimated using sampling rate values obtained during a field calibration experiment. Patterns in the aqueous concentrations of the compounds (after back calculation from POCIS extracts) and the POCIS concentrations are different, possibly leading to discrepancies between the toxicity assessments conducted using POCIS extracts and those conducted using grab samples of water from the same location.

AB Abused drug concentrations were determined in nine Finnish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), representing the metropolitan area, university cities and rural towns. In an eight-day study period in August 2012, 24-hour composite influent wastewater samples were collected. Biological markers and census-based information were used to estimate the size of the population served. The analytical method included solid phase extraction, liquid chromatographic separation, tandem mass spectrometric identification, and quantification using isotope-labeled internal standards. The study covered amphetamines, cannabis and cocaine. The levels of some opioids used in treatment and their metabolites were also determined. Amphetamine was the most prevalent drug of abuse, the median loads varying between the cities from 4.16 to 29.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. In three western cities methamphetamine was detected in even higher amounts, ranging from 0.87 to 47.5 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. Ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine (as benzoylecgonine, BE) were found in higher concentrations during weekends compared to weekdays, the difference being statistically significant. The concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA) was below the limit of quantification in the two rural towns, while in the other cities the load varied between 3.77 and 20.7 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The average variation in BE load was 0.05-6.82 and that of MDMA 0-20.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. While the metropolitan area showed the highest loads of abused drugs, the substances were continuously detected at all WWTPs included in the study. The median concentration of codeine ranged from 164 to 325 mg/1000 inhabitants/d and that of morphine from 18.8 to 31.5 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The methadone load was below the level of detection in two towns, and at the other locations were 1.22-9.46 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The first metabolite of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), was not detected at all. Although the method has limitations, wastewater analysis gives additional information for assessing the degree of drug abuse and range of drugs abused in a society. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a study on the occurrence and behavior of illicit drugs and metabolites in sewage water systems has been made. A comprehensive dataset was obtained by analyzing illicit drugs daily in influent and effluent waters from three sewage treatment plants (STPs), over three different weeks. To complete this dataset, monitoring was conducted during an international pop/rock festival, an interesting facet within this study. The STPs selected were sited along the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Castellon province, Valencia region) and represent towns of different sizes, with appreciable variations in the population in the summer period. Illicit drug concentrations in the influents were low, except during the celebration of the music festival, when the levels of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, amphetamine, MDA and MDMA increased. Comparing the influent and effluent concentration data allowed the rough estimation of the removal of illicit drugs and metabolites by each STP. Removal efficiencies were estimated between 75 and 100% for most of the analytes under investigation. The loads discharged into the aquatic ecosystem were also calculated from effluent data. Weekly discharges of drugs and metabolites via effluent sewage waters presented values commonly below 10 g for each individual drug, with the exception of benzoylecgonine, which usually exceeded this level. The increase in population and drug consumption during the music event led to a notable increase in the weekly discharges, reaching values up to 406 g of MDMA and 122 g of benzoylecgonine.

AB Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) and tyrosinases (EC 1.14.18.1) are ubiquitous enzymes present in nature as they are known to originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, etc. Both laccase and tyrosinase are copper-containing phenoloxidases requiring readily available 02 without auxiliary cofactor for their catalytic transformation of numerous phenolic substrates. In the present study, laccase and tyrosinase have been insolubilized as combined crosslinked enzyme aggregates (combi-CLEA) using chitosan, a renewable and biodegradable polymer, as crosslinker. The combi-CLEA, with specific activity of 12.3 U/g for laccase and 167.4 U/g for tyrosinase, exhibited high enzymatic activity at pH 5-8 and temperature at 5-30 degrees C, significant resistance to denaturation and no diffusional restriction to its active site based upon the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters. Subsequently, the combi-CLEA was applied to the transformation of acetaminophen as a model phenolic compound in samples of real wastewaters in order to evaluate the potential efficiency of the biocatalyst. In batch mode the combi-CLEA transformed more than 80% to nearly 100% of acetaminophen from the municipal wastewater and more than 90% from the hospital wastewater. UPLC-MS analysis of acetaminophen metabolites showed the formation of its oligomers as dimers, trimers and tetramers due to the laccase and 3-hydroxyacetaminophen due to the tyrosinase.

AB The aerobic biodegradation of 5-methyl-benzotriazole (5-TTri) was optimized using lab-scale setups and activated sludge communities (ASC) collected from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) MBR-MH, CAS-E and CAS-M being different in their treatment technologies. ASC inocula were diluted to rule out non-biodegrading species and incubated under two nutrient conditions: A) mineral salt media (MSM) and B) carbon and nitrogen supplied MSM giving MSM-CN. 5-TTri removal with the ASC ranged from 60% to 100% in only 10 days. 100 mu L suspended biomass from the biodegrading setups was subsequently plated on solid media to eliminate possible activated sludge remnants. After growth occurred, mixed colonies were harvested and inoculated in fresh liquid MSM containing 20 mg L-1 5-TTri. These bacterial consortia showed good 5-TTri removal in MSM-CN rather than in MSM, indicating nutrient supply being required for efficient biodegradation. In addition, experiments with high 5-TTri concentrations ranging from 20 to 1000 mg L-1 were conducted in both, MSM and MSM-CN and the maximal 5-TTri removal capacity of the ASC evaluated. 50 mg L-1 5-TTri was still removed in both media whereas 100 mg L-1 was solely removed in MSM-CN. 5-TTri biodegradation patterns also indicated that 5-TTri might be co-metabolized by microbial consortia. Furthermore, experiments with gradient-solid-media-plates showed 5-TTri to be inhibitory for the ASC in concentrations above 50 mg L-1 and revealed the optimal conditions regarding carbon and nitrogen concentration and pH value for effective 5-TTri biodegradation by ASC. Nitrogen proved a crucial factor for enhancing organisms' biodegradation capacity with an optimal pH around 7 while carbon showed no such effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the increased consumption of chemotherapeutic agents, their high toxicity, carcinogenicity, their occurrence in the aquatic environment must be properly evaluated. An analytical method based on online solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated. A 1 mL injection volume was used to quantify six of the most widely used cytotoxic drugs (cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, ifosfamide, methotrexate, irinotecan and epirubicin) in municipal wastewater. The method was validated using standard additions. The validation results in wastewater influent had coefficients of determination (R-2) between 0.983 and 0.998 and intra-day precision ranging from 7 to 13% (expressed as relative standard deviation %RSD), and from 9 to 23% for inter-day precision. Limits of detection ranged from 4 to 20 ng L-1 while recovery values were greater than 70% except for gemcitabine, which is the most hydrophilic compound in the selected group and had a recovery of 47%. Matrix effects were interpreted by signal suppression and ranged from 55 to 118% with cyclophosphamide having the highest value. Two of the target anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) were detected and quantified in wastewater (effluent and influent) and ranged from 13 to 60 ng L-1. The proposed method thus allows proper monitoring of potential environmental releases of chemotherapy agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sewage lagoon serving the small municipality of Lakefield in Ontario, Canada was monitored in the summer, fall and winter to determine removals of carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, triclosan, sucralose, HHCB and AHTN. Concentrations of these compounds in untreated and treated wastewater were estimated by deploying POCIS and SPMD passive samplers in the sewage lagoon. Passive samplers were also deployed at several points upstream and downstream of the point of discharge from the lagoon into the Otonabee River. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS were utilized to determine the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and sucralose, an artificial sweetener. Among PPCPs sampled by POCIS, the highest estimated concentration in untreated wastewater was ibuprofen sampled during the fall, at an estimated concentration of 60.3 ng/L. The estimated average concentration of sucralose was 13.6 ng/L in the untreated wastewaters. Triclosan, HHCB and AHTN in SPMDs were highest during fall season, at 30, 1677 and 109 ng/L, respectively. For all compounds except gemfibrozil, carbamazepine and sucralose, removals were highest in the summer (83.0 to 98.8%) relative to removals in the fall (48.4 to 91.4%) and winter (14.0 to 78.3%). Finally, the estimated concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan and HHCB were compared with predicted values obtained through application of the WEST (R) modeling tool, with a new model based on the River Water Quality Model No. I and extended with dynamic mass balances describing the fate of chemicals of emerging concern subject to a variety of removal pathways. The model was able to adequately predict the fate of these four compounds in the lagoon in summer and winter, but the model overestimated removals of three of the four test compounds in the fall sampling period. This lagoon was as effective at removing PPCPs as many conventional WWTPs, but removals were better during the summer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microelectrolysis studies were carried out to find the current density domain where hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) formation is favored, 10 <= j <= 20 mA cm(-2). Electrolysis experiments at mean linear flow velocities of 14.6 <= u <= 58.4 cm s(-1) were performed. The experimental set-up achieved 100% diclofenac mineralization with 78% current efficiency and energy consumption of 2.54 kWh m(-3) at j = 15 mA cm(-2) and u = 29.2 cm s(-1).

AB The electrochemical oxidation (EO) treatment in water of Fantetra, a veterinary drug widely used in Chile, and its components: oxytetracycline hydrochloride, phtalylsulfathiazole and diphenhydramine, has been carried out at constant current using a BDD/Stainless steel system. First, solutions of each drug were electrolyzed following the decay of the absorbance of each compound and total organic carbon abatement. The mineralization of the Fantetra commercial formulation was also studied. An analysis of the degradation by-products was made by high performance liquid chromatography. Thus, during the degradation of each pharmaceutical by the electrochemical oxidation process, aliphatic carboxylic acids were detected prior to their complete mineralization to CO2 and nitrogen ions, while NO3- and NH4+ remain in the treated solution.
   This is an essential preliminary step towards the applicability of the EO processes for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) have drawn attention to many countries due to their persistent input and potential threat to human health and the environment. This article reviews the current contamination sources and their status for surface waters in China. The contamination levels of ECs in surface waters are in the range ng L-1 to mu g L-1 in China, apparently about the same as the situation in other countries. ECs enter surface water via runoff, drainage, rainfall, and wastewater treatment effluent. The frequency of occurrence of ECs increased rapidly from 2006 to 2011; a significant reason is the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. As for the distribution of EC pollution in China, the frequency of occurrence of ECs in eastern regions is higher than in western regions. A majority of EC studies have focused on surface waters of the Haihe River and Pearl River watersheds due to their highly developed industries and intense human activity. Legislative and administrative regulation of ECs is lacking in China. To remove ECs, a number of technologies, such as absorption by activated carbon, membrane filtration technology, and advanced oxidation processes, have been researched.

AB In recent years, numerous studies have indicated that various long-term use drugs, such as antibiotics or analgesics, not only cannot be completely decomposed via sewage treatment but also exhibit biological toxicity if they enter the environment; thus, the release of these drugs into the environment can damage ecological systems. This study sought to investigate the acute toxicity of two commonly utilized analgesics, ibuprofen (IBU) and acetaminophen (APAP), to aquatic organisms after these drugs have entered the water. To address this objective, the acute toxicity (median lethal concentration, LC50, for a 96-h exposure) of IBU alone, APAP alone, and mixtures containing different ratios of IBU and APAP in green neon shrimp (Neocaridina denticulate) were measured. The results of four tests revealed that the 96-h LC50 values for IBU and APAP alone were 6.07 mg/L and 6.60 mg/L, respectively. The 96-h LC50 for a 1:1 mixture of IBU and APAP was 6.23 mg/L, and the toxicity of this mixture did not significantly differ from the toxicity of either drug alone (p <0.05). The experimental results for mixtures containing unequal ratios of IBU and APAP indicated that mixtures with high APAP concentrations and low IBU concentrations exhibited markedly greater toxicity in N. denticulate (LC50 =4.78 mg/L) than APAP or IBU alone. However, mixtures with high IBU concentrations and low APAP concentrations exhibited lower toxicity in N. denticulate (LC50 = 6.78 mg/L) than IBU or APAP alone. This study demonstrated that different mixtures of IBU and APAP were associated with different toxic effects in green neon shrimp. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, environmental risks of selected pharmaceuticals were investigated to assess potential hazards. Ciprofloxacin, Clarithromycin, Cefuroxime axetil, antibiotics, Benzalkoniuman antiseptic, Paracetamol, an analgesic, and Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory, were selected due to their high rate of usage in Turkey. Ciprofloxacin was found to have the highest risk due to its high PEC/PNEC ratio (28.636). Benzalkonium, Paracetamol and Clarithromycin have a potential to cause environmental hazards. The biodegradation and biological concentration factors (BCF) of the drugs were also determined using EP.A/STWIN and EPA/BCFVVIN programs. The results illustrated that these pharmaceuticals are nonbiodegradable in wastewater treatment plants. The BCFs of Benzalkonium and Clarithromycin were found to be very high, 70.79011kg and 56.490 L/kg, respectively. It was suggested that alternative treatment methods other than biological ones should be investigated for these pharmaceuticals because of their low biodegradability. Also, unnecessary use of antibiotics is supposed to be discouraged to reduce environmental hazards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The accumulation of high-molecular-weight organic compounds is a common phenomenon in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). It is currently not known to what extent accumulation occurs in full-scale plants because relevant tests were mostly performed in experimental plants. To overcome the lack of practical experience, a measurement campaign was carried out including four municipal wastewater treatment plants and two pilot plants [one MBR and one conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)]. The results clearly showed that accumulation depends on sludge retention time (SRT), temperature, sludge volume index (SVI), and the fraction of volatile suspended solids (VSS). As a result of biological processes, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) accumulation may increase for a limited period of time and amounts 10-120 mg/(PE . d). The introduction of sludge from a municipal MBR into the system of conventional activated sludge plants (CAS) for external sludge handling does not affect the treatment efficacy of the latter. On the other hand, it can be assumed that accumulated critical substances (e. g., pharmaceuticals) in an MBR may be released during external sludge processing and reach the receiving water.

The generally low efficiencies of conventional wastewater treatment processes for the removal of this type of pollutants demands for the development of alternative or complementary water and wastewater treatment technologies, among which adsorption processes have been gaining popularity, provided that cheap efficient adsorbents are found. Clay materials have been one of the popular choices in this regard. In the present study, quantum chemical calculations have been performed by periodic DFT using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method to characterize the interactions of two benzodiazepine molecules, alprazolam and diazepam, with a surface of clay mineral, vermiculite. It was observed that both molecules interact strongly with the vermiculite surface, both through a water-bridge binding and by cation-bridge provided by the exchangeable Mg2+ cations of the vermiculite surface. The results point to an interesting potential of vermiculite to be used efficiently as filter medium to remove these pollutants from water and wastewater.

AB Aqueous chlorination kinetics of the lipid regulator gemfibrozil and the formation of reaction products were investigated in deionized water over the pH range 3 to 9, and in two wastewater matrices. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil was found to be highly dependent on pH. No statistically significant degradation of gemfibrozil was observed at pH values greater than 7. Gemfibrozil oxidation between pH 4 and 7 was best represented by first order kinetics. At pH 3, formation of three reaction products was observed. 4'-ClGem was the only reaction product formed from pH 4-7 and was modeled with zero order kinetics. Chlorine oxidation of gemfibrozil in two wastewater matrices followed second order kinetics. 4'-ClGem was only formed in wastewater with pH below 7. Deionized water rate kinetic models were applied to two wastewater effluents with gemfibrozil concentrations reported in literature in order to calculate potential mass loading rates of 4'ClGem to the receiving water.

AB The degradation of 230 mL of a 0.6-mM sulfanilamide solution in 0.05 M Na2SO4 of pH 3.0 has been studied by electro-Fenton process. The electrolytic cell contained either a Pt or boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon-felt cathode. Under these conditions, organics are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals formed at the anode surface from water oxidation and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction between initially added (and then electrochemically regenerated) Fe2+ and cathodically generated H2O2. From the decay of sulfanilamide concentration determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, an optimum Fe2+ concentration of 0.20 mM in both cells was found. The drug disappeared more rapidly using BDD than Pt, and, in both cases, it was more quickly removed with raising applied current. Almost total mineralization was achieved using the BDD/carbon-felt cell, whereas the alternative use of Pt anode led to a slightly lower mineralization degree. In both cells, the degradation rate was accelerated at higher current but with the concomitant fall of mineralization current efficiency due to the greater increase in rate of the parasitic reactions of hydroxyl radicals. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography allowed the identification of catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene as aromatic intermediates, whereas ion exclusion chromatography revealed the formation of malic, maleic, fumaric, acetic, oxalic, formic, and oxamic acids. NH4 (+), NO3 (-), and SO4 (2-) ions were released during the electro-Fenton process. A plausible reaction sequence for sulfanilamide mineralization involving all detected intermediates has been proposed. The toxicity of the solution was assessed from the Vibrio fischeri bacteria luminescence inhibition. Although it acquired its maximum value at short electrolysis time, the solution was completely detoxified at the end of the electro-Fenton treatment, regardless of the anode used.

AB The treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was studied using granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, UV/H2O2 process, and their combination. Experimental results reveal that GAC adsorption alone has 79% efficiency in total organic carbon (TOC) removal in 10min breakthrough time with the dosage of 333.33mgactivated carbon/L. The adsorption data are fitted well with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The UV/H2O2 process alone at 6h hydraulic retention time with optimum dosage of 4.25mgH2O2/mgCOD shows 29 and 26% TOC reduction using 185 and 254nm UV lamps, respectively. The kinetic modelling of the UV254/H2O2 process is developed using chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TOC as lumped parameters. A good agreement between model predictions and experimental data is confirmed. In combined processes, pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater by UV254/H2O2 followed by GAC adsorption process along with the desorption of contaminants from GAC and the subsequent treatment of the condensed steam by UV254/H2O2 process leads to 82 % TOC removal efficiency. On the other hand, the GAC adsorption along with UV254/H2O2 treatment of regenerant (condensed steam) from the desorption process leads to 88 % TOC removal at optimum conditions.

AB This study described an analytical method for the identification of common phase II pharmaceutical metabolites in reclaimed water using liquid chromatography high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry after solid phase extraction (SPE). Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated at resolution of 70000 in MS mode and 35000 in data-dependent MS/MS mode, without using lock mass. Firstly, parent drugs and their metabolites were tentatively identified based on accurate mass using a mass tolerance of 5 ppm. A detailed examination of the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for all potential metabolites revealed the presence of two phase II metabolites of sulfamethoxazole, acetylsulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide in reclaimed water. Secondly, the high resolution data-dependent MS/MS spectra of each compound were further investigated using metabolic profiling software. After comparing characteristic ions obtained in MS/MS mode with those predicted by the software and reported in previous studies, the two phase II metabolites were positively identified in reclaimed water. Lastly, the two metabolites were detected and quantified in the reclaimed water samples collected during a period of one month. As a result, averaged concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, acetylsulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide were calculated at 2848 +/- 1367 ng L-1, 1980 +/- 1410 ng L-1, and 2859 +/- 1526 ng L-1, respectively. The two metabolites represented 54% of the source of sulfamethoxazole in reclaimed water suggesting the importance of measuring pharmaceutical metabolites in the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first known report of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide surviving intact through wastewater treatment plants and occurring in environmental water samples.

AB A modified version of the QuEChERS method has been evaluated for the determination of 21 pharmaceuticals and 6 personal care products (PPCPs) in drinking-water sludge samples by employing ultra high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The performance of the method was evaluated through linearity, recovery, precision (intra-day), method detection and quantification limits (MDL and MQL) and matrix effect. The calibration curves prepared in acetonitrile and in the matrix extract showed a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. MQLs values were on the ng g(-1) order of magnitude for most compounds. Recoveries between 50% and 93% were reached with RSDs lower than 10% for most compounds. Matrix effect was almost absent with values lower than 16% for 93% of the compounds. By coupling a quick and simple extraction called QuEChERS with the UPLC-MS/MS analysis, a method that is both selective and sensitive was obtained. This methodology was successfully applied to real samples and caffeine and benzophenone-3 were detected in ng g(-1) levels. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We established a method for the simultaneous analysis of seven preservatives and five antimicrobials in water. These chemicals are widely used in cosmetics, and their presence in river water is of concern. We used the method to test 13 sites in Japanese rivers and streams contaminated by domestic wastewater, effluent, or industrial wastewater. 2-Phenoxyethanol (2-PE), isopropylmethylphenol, resorcinol, and triclosan were detected at most sites; the maximum concentration of 2-PE detected was 14000 ng L-1. The results suggest that the major sources of 2-PE were cosmetics and household detergents. The ratio of methylparaben to n-propylparaben in river waters with direct wastewater drainage was similar to that in common cosmetics. This is the first research on levels of 2-PE, isopropylmethylphenol, and chlorphenesin in river water. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concern over the occurrence of artificial sweeteners (ASWs) as well as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment is growing, due to their high use and potential adverse effects on non-target organisms. The data for this study are drawn from a nationwide survey of ASWs in sewage sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that receive domestic (WWTPD), industrial (WWTP1), or mixed (domestic plus industrial; WWTPM) wastewaters in Korea. Five ASWs (concentrations ranged from 7.08 to 5220 ng/g dry weight [dw]) and ten PPCPs (4.95-6930 ng/g dw) were determined in sludge. Aspartame (concentrations ranged from 28.4 to 5220 ng/g dw) was determined for the first time in sewage sludge. The median concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge from domestic WWTPs were 0.8-2.5 and 1.0-3.4 times, respectively, the concentrations found in WWI'Ps that receive combined domestic and industrial wastewaters. Among the five ASWs analyzed, the median environmental emission rates of aspartame through domestic WWTPs (both sludge and effluent discharges combined) were calculated to be 417 mu g/capita/day, followed by sucralose (117 mu g/capita/day), acesulfame (90 pg/capita/day), and saccharin (66 pg/capita/day). The per-capita emission rates of select PPCPs, such as antimicrobials (tridocarban: 158 pg/capita/day) and analgesics (acetaminophen: 59 mu g/capita/day), were an order of magnitude higher than those calculated for antimycotic (miconazole) and anthelmintic (thiabendazole) drugs analyzed in this study. Multiple linear regression analysis of measured concentrations of ASWs and PPCPs in sludge revealed that several WWTP parameters, such as treatment capacity, population-served, sludge production rate, and hydraulic retention time could influence the concentrations found in sludge.

AB Recently UV/TiO2 photocatalytic treatment for municipal reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) has drawn increasing attention due to its high efficiency and low cost. We determined the organics in ROC samples by a combination of multiple analytical techniques: i.e. electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight (ESI-QToF), photocatalytic degradation method, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). By these multiple techniques we were able to determine the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to be 24.50 ppm, which was composed of high molecular weight (MW) (>2000 Da) natural organic matter (NOM) of 23.36 ppm (95.35%wt.) and low MW (<2000 Da) fluorosurfactants of 1.08 ppm (4.41%), and pharmaceuticals & other organic compounds of 0.06 ppm (0.24%). Using ESI-QToF tandam mass spectrometry, molecular structures of 5 series of fluorosurfactants (63 compounds) and 9 phamaceuticals were elucidated. Conjugated compounds and sample color were monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. No volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in the ROC samples by GC/MS. A combination of these 6 techniques provided a comprehensive method to depict the overall constituents of various organics in ROC. Quantitative estimation of organic compounds and structural determination of surfactants and pharmaceuticals in ROC were also investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental antibiotic contamination is due mainly to improper and illegal disposal of these molecules that, yet pharmacologically active, are excreted by humans and animals. These compounds contaminate soil, water and plants. Many studies have reported the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in plants and their negative effects on photosynthesis, cell growth and oxidative balance. Therefore, the principal objective of this paper was the study of antibiotic accumulation sites in plants and its uptake modality. Iberis sempervirens L., grown in soil and in agar in the presence or absence of tetracycline, were used as a model system. Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that tetracycline was absorbed and propagated in plants through apoplastic transport and also accumulated in intercellular spaces. Tetracycline was rarely detected inside cells (in cytoplasm and mitochondria where, coherent to its pharmacological activity, it probably affected ribosomes), except in stomata. Moreover, we verified and clarified further the phytotoxic effects of tetracycline on plants. We observed that the antibiotic induced a large reduction in plant growth and development and inhibition of photosynthetic activity. As tetracycline may lead to oxidative stress in plants, plant cells tried to balance this disequilibrium by increasing the amount and activity of some endogenous enzyme antioxidant agents (superoxide dismutase 1 and catalase) and levels of antiradical secondary metabolites.

AB Nanoscale photocatalysts have attracted much attention due to their high surface area to volume ratios. However, due to extremely high reactivity, TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared using different methods tend to either react with surrounding media or agglomerate, resulting in the formation of much larger flocs and significant loss in reactivity. This work investigates the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a persistent pharmaceutical compound from wastewater (WW) using TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared in the presence of a water-soluble whey powder as stabilizer. The TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared in the presence of whey stabilizer displayed much less agglomeration and greater degradation power than those prepared without a stabilizer. Higher photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine was observed (100%) by using whey stabilized TiO2 nanoparticles with 55 min irradiation time as compared to ZnO nanoparticles (92%). The higher degradation of CBZ in wastewater by using TiO2 nanoparticles as compared to ZnO nanoparticles was due to formation of higher photo-generated holes with high oxidizing power of TiO2. The photocatalytic capacity of ZnO anticipated as similar to that of TiO2 as it has the same band gap energy (3.2 eV) as TiO2. However, in the case of ZnO, photocorrosion frequently occurs with the illumination of UV light and this phenomenon is considered as one of the main reasons for the decrease of ZnO photocatalytic activity in aqueous solutions. Further, the estrogenic activity of photocatalyzed WW sample with CBZ and its by-products was carried out by yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay method. Based upon the YES test results, none of the samples showed estrogenic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In highly urbanized areas, surface water and groundwater are particularly vulnerable to sewer exfiltration. In this study, as an alternative to Microbial Source Tracking (MST) methods, we propose a new method combining microbial and chemical fecal indicators (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) analysis both in water and sediment samples and under different meteorological conditions. To illustrate the use of this method, wastewater exfiltration and subsequent infiltration were identified and quantified by a three-year field study in an urban canal. The gradients of concentrations observed suggest that several sources of fecal contamination of varying intensity may be present along the canal, including feces from resident animal populations, contaminated surface run-off along the banks and under bridge crossings, release from contaminated banks, entrainment of contaminated sediments, and most importantly sewage exfiltration. Calculated exfiltration-infiltration volumes varied between 0.6 and 15.7 m(3)/d per kilometer during dry weather, and between 1.1 and 19.5 m(3)/d per kilometer during wet weather. WWMPs were mainly diluted and degraded below detection limits in water. E. coli remains the best exfiltration indicator given a large volume of dilution and a high abundance in the wastewater source. WWMPs are effective for detecting cumulated contamination in sediments from a small volume source and are particularly important because E. coli on its own does not allow source tracking.

AB The concentrations and behaviour of 105 different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the aqueous phase of sewage water within a municipal sewer collection system have been investigated. Sewage water samples were gathered from seven pump stations (one of which was located within a university hospital) and from sewage water treatment influent and effluent. The targeted APIs were quantified using a multi-residue method based on online solid phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The method was thoroughly validated and complies with EU regulations on sample handling, limits of quantification, quality control and selectivity. 51 APIs, including antibiotics, antidepressants, hypertension drugs, analgesics, NSAIDs and psycholeptics, were found frequently within the sewer collection system. API concentrations and mass flows were evaluated in terms of their frequency of detection, daily variation, median/minimum/maximum/average concentrations, demographic dissimilarities, removal efficiencies, and mass flow profiles relative to municipal sales data. Our results suggest that some APIs are removed from, or introduced to, the aqueous phase of sewage waters within the studied municipal collection system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biocides are widely formulated in household and personal care products. We investigated the distribution and ecological risks of 16 household biocides in aquatic environments of a highly urbanized region in South China, evaluated triclosan as a chemical indicator for this group of household chemicals, and proposed a novel approach to predict the environmental occurrence and fate of these household biocides by using triclosan usage data and a level-III fugacity model. Eleven biocides were quantitatively detected at concentrations up to 264 +/- 15.3 ng/L for climbazole in surface water, and up to 5649 +/- 748 ng/g for triclocarban in sediment of four rivers in the region. The distribution of biocides in the aquatic environments was significantly correlated with environmental variables such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus and population. Domestic sewage in the region was the dominant pollution source for most biocides such as azole fungicides (fluconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and carbendazim) and disinfectants (triclosan and triclocarban). Preliminary risk assessment showed high ecological risks posed by two biocides carbendazim and triclosan in river waters. Mostly important, triclosan was found to be a reliable chemical indicator to surrogate household biocides both in water and sediment based on the correlation analysis. In addition, the fugacity modeling could provide simulated concentrations comparable to the monitoring results. Therefore, with the usage data of the chemical indicator triclosan and correlation formula with other biocides, this model can be applied for predicting the occurrence and fate of various household biocides in a catchment.

AB Personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can impact aquatic organisms. Health indicators were compared for mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) collected above and below WWTP discharges from five streams in suburban areas of the Houston metropolitan area, Texas, USA. Specimens were evaluated for reproductive, morphological, and histological indicators. Several indicators revealed significant spatial and temporal variation; however, possibly because of their mobility, fish collected upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants did not reveal consistent trends based on the endpoints examined. CEC concentrations in water samples from stream reaches below WWTP discharges were quantified for the first time in the Houston Metropolitan area. The 18 CECs detected in stream water had concentrations lower than values currently reported to impact fish. Future research should examine caged fish at each site and fish collected over longer stream reaches that receive successive discharges from WWTP and stronger CEC gradients.

AB The visualisation of DNA damage response proteins enables the indirect measurement of DNA damage. Soon after the occurrence of a DNA double-strand break (DSB), the formation of gamma-H2AX histone variants is to be expected. This review is focused on the potential use of the gamma-H2AX foci assay in assessing the genotoxicity of environmental contaminants including cytostatic pharmaceuticals, since standard methods may not be sensitive enough to detect the damaging effect of low environmental concentrations of such drugs. These compounds are constantly released into the environment, potentially representing a threat to water quality, aquatic organisms, and, ultimately, human health. Our review of the literature revealed that this method could be used in the biomonitoring and risk assessment of aquatic systems affected by wastewater from the production, usage, and disposal of cytostatic pharmaceuticals.

AB Presence of pathogenic microorganism in anodic effluent of microbial fuel cell (MFC) makes it unfit for reuse. In this study, performance of dual chamber MFC was evaluated in terms of organic matter removal, power generation and disinfection in cathodic chamber. Anodic effluent was treated further in cathodic chamber for achieving disinfection with different doses of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with available chlorine varying from 0.67, 1.32, 2, 3 and 4g/L. Addition of different doses of NaOCl resulted in satisfactory disinfection along with removal of nitrogenous compounds. Power output of MFC improved up to 3 g/L of available chlorine (6.5 W/m(3)); however, further increase in chlorine concentration decreased the power. Voltammetric and impedance analysis showed higher and faster electron reduction and decrease in polarization resistance at 3 g/L dose. Higher organic matter removal from wastewater and complete elimination of microorganism, along with improved power output, demonstrates effectiveness of hypochlorite as catholyte.

AB The photocatalytic degradation in distilled water of 15 selected emerging contaminants (ECs) has been evaluated in a solar pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) plant by using TiO2 photocatalysts immobilized on glass spheres. The durability of the photocatalysts has been evaluated by measuring its performance during 4 consecutive cycles. TiO2 was prepared by the sol-gel method using titanium isopropoxide as precursor, combined with commercial TiO2 Degussa P25 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the pore generating agent. The following microcontaminants in a concentration of 100 mu gL(-1) have been studied: acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan. The fluorine containing ECs, this is, flumequine and ofloxacin, are totally degraded under the studied reaction conditions. By contrary, a progressive decay of the photocatalytic activity is observed for the other contaminants. The contaminants with amine or amide groups but without halogen heteroatoms in the structure record the lowest degradation rates. In order to recover the photoactivity, different strategies using aqueous solutions containing H2O2 under UV irradiation, NaOH, NH4OH and direct heat treatment in air at 400 degrees C, were adopted. For the sake of simplicity, these experiments have been performed in a solarsimulator at 765 W m(-2). In order to determinate the nature of the species adsorbed on the titania active sites, the used and the regenerated photocatalysts were analyzed by XPS. Chemical treatment with NaOH results in the removal of the TiO2 layer. The ECs containing sulphate, fluoride or chloride groups are easily adsorbed on the photocatalyst active sites as compared to the ECs containing amide or amine groups and are easily desorbed by the regeneration treatments. Amongst the different pretreatment studied, calcination and H2O2/UV irradiation are the most efficient methods to recover the photocatalytic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Active pharmaceutical compounds reach the wastewater treatment plants mainly through excretion and improper disposal, and, because of insufficient treating methods, they end up to surface water or even potable water in some cases. Atenolol and metoprolol are beta-blockers, members of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals group. They are generally used in the treatment of disorders such as hypertension, angina and arrhythmias. They have been in long-term use in Europe and North America, and they have also been detected in the aquatic environment.
   In this study the degradation of atenolol and metoprolol in aqueous solutions by means of the photo-Fenton reaction was investigated. The purpose of this study was: (i) to investigate the influence of the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide, by means of central composite design, (ii) to study the degradation kinetics in aqueous solutions, (iii) to evaluate the mineralization and the toxicity evolution of the target compounds and (iv) to identify the degradation products.
   It has been found that increase of iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration accelerate the degradation of atenolol and metoprolol, while the kinetics of the process can be characterized as pseudo-first order. In general the photo-Fenton method has proved to be effective in decomposing and mineralizing the target compounds. The determination of the by-products formed during the degradation using LC-MS/MS equipment and the evaluation of the toxicity of the treated solution in different stages of the process would offer significant, innovative information regarding the treatment of water and wastewater containing active pharmaceutical compounds, especially of the beta-blocker group.

AB Concentrations of the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine (Cbz), oxcarbazepine (OxCz) and their main metabolites were predicted in a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) and in the vicinity of its submarine outfall located in a Mediterranean coastal zone. Refined predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated in effluents based on consumption data and human excretion rates. PECs were estimated in the sea using the hydrodynamic MARS 3D model integrating meteorological data, oceanic conditions (wind, tide, atmospheric pressure), freshwater and sewage inputs. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were compared to PECs to assess the estimation relevance. In the coastal zone, PEC and MEC were in the same magnitude range. Modeling of Cbz diffusion and advection just above the submarine outfall showed the influence of the thermocline during summer, with low diffusion of Cbz from the bottom to the surface. This work allowed understanding the dispersion of target compounds and deserved further development for a better acknowledgement of vulnerability at local scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A microbial process for the degradation of sulfamethazine (SMN) was studied. The activated sludge of a municipal sewage treatment plant was used to degrade SMN under controlled conditions. Results show that the aerobic condition was favored for the removal of SMN and the removal process was characterized by rapid adsorption on activated sludge and subsequent slow biodegradation. Nearly complete removal of SMN (500 mu g/L) was achieved after 120 h, which was principally attributed to biodegradation. SMN was removed at a faster pace at a higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration and temperature, while the influence of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration was comparatively insignificant. The specific pseudo-first-order rate constant per unit MLSS decreased with an increase in MLSS concentration. The temperature coefficients (theta) were similar (1.042 and 1.027) over the ranges of 10-20 degrees C and 20-30 degrees C, respectively. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Purpose The Todos os Santos Bay is the largest bay in Brazil and receives drainage from various watersheds. For more than 450 years, it was the main destination for the domestic and hospital sewage from the city of Salvador, Bahia. With the growing concern regarding the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment, an investigation was undertaken to determine the presence and levels of some commonly used drugs (i.e., atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, erythromycin, ibuprofen) and personal care products (i.e., galaxolide, tonalide), using sedi-ments as an indicator of their presence in the water column.
   Material and methods Surficial sediment samples from 17 stations located in the intertidal zone of the Todos os Santos Bay and infralittoral zone along the north coast of Salvador were tested for the presence of some PPCPs using LC-MS/MS (for drugs) and GC-MS/MS (for fragrances).
   Results and discussion The PPCPs examined were present in all sediment samples at levels of parts per billion of dry sediment. The highest concentrations were found for the fragrances galaxolide (52.5 ng g(-1)) and tonalide (27.9 ng g(-1)), followed by caffeine (23.4 ng g(-1)) and pharmaceuticals ibuprofen (14.3 ng g(-1)), atenolol (9.84 ng g(-1)), carbamazepine (4.81 ng g(-1)), erythromycin (2.29 ng g(-1)), diclofenac (1.06 ng g(-1)), and diazepam (0.71 ng g(-1)).
   Conclusions Pharmaceuticals were found to be ubiquitous in the sediments of the study areas. The texture of the sediment was an important factor in PPCPs fixation and deposition. The concentrations of all PPCPs had statistically significant positive correlations with the percentage of clay in the sediments.

AB In the present investigation, an attempt was made to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by Iron impregnated poly acrylamide (IPA) compound in a fluidized bed reactor as heterogeneous catalyst. The IPA was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, TGA, DSC, fluorescence spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The experiments were carried out under batch and continuous mode operations. The quantitative removal of COD, BOD5, NH4+-N and TKN from the PWW was evaluated. The oxidation of organics in PWW was confirmed through UV-visible, fluorescence and FT-IR spectroscopy. In this study, the mechanism of oxidation of the persistent organic pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater in terms of the generation of (OH)-O-center dot radical using IPA was evaluated. The (OH)-O-center dot radical was identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) spin trapping method.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (VVVVTPs) dispose of numerous trace organic contaminants in the receiving waters that can impact biological function in aquatic organisms. However, the complex nature of WWTP effluent mixtures and a wide variety of potential mechanisms that can alter physiological and reproductive development of aquatic organisms make it difficult to assess the linkages and severity of the effects associated with trace organic contaminants. This paper describes a surface water quality modeling exercise that was performed to understand the relevant contaminant fate and transport processes necessary to accurately predict the concentrations of trace organic compounds present in the aquatic environment. The target compounds modeled include a known antiandrogenic personal care product (triclosan) and selected pharmaceuticals (venlafaxine, naproxen, and carbamazepine). The WASP 7.5 model was adapted and calibrated to reflect approximately ten kilometers of reach of the Grand River watershed that is highly influenced by a major urban WWTP. Simulation of the fate and transport of the target compounds revealed that flow-driven transport processes (advection and dispersion) greatly influenced the behavior of the target contaminants in the aquatic environment However, fate mechanisms such as photolysis and biodegradation can play an important role in the attenuation of some compounds. The exception was carbamazepine where it was shown to act as a conservative tracer compound for wastewater specific contaminants in the water phase. The calibrated water quality model can now be employed in a number of future applications. Prediction of fate and transport of other trace organic contaminants across the watershed and assessment of the performance of WWTP infrastructure upgrades in the removal of these compounds are just a few examples.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro estrogenic and the cytotoxic activity of six cytostatics (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and imatinib) belonging to the five classes of Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) detected in wastewater systems. The estrogenic activity was assessed by YES-assay on Saccharomyces cerevisiae-RMY326 and E-screen on MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic activity was assessed by MIT Cell Proliferation Assay on the MCF-7 and the MDA-MB-231 cells.
   The results of estrogenic activity, detected by E-screen and expressed as EC50, showed a high potential of imatinib (10(-7) mu M) followed by cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Capecitabine was poorly estrogenic while etoposide and doxorubicin EC50 values were not possible to determine. Cytotoxicity was found at concentrations far from those detected in effluents. The potential endocrine activity of the most active drugs could be associated with human and wildlife risk when considering their occurrence in the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was applied for the determination of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen as well as eight of their known human metabolites in wastewater samples. Extraction time and addition of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) to the liquid membrane were evaluated resulting in a method with an optimal extraction time of 5 h and 5% (w/V) TOPO addition to the membrane liquid (di-n-hexyl ether). With the optimized method, enrichment factors ranged between 778 and 4830. The method was applied for analysis of samples collected from Kallby wastewater treatment plant in the city of Lund, Sweden. Samples were collected from the influent, water entering as well as exiting the conventional activated sludge treatment and the effluent to study the behaviour of these compounds during the treatment process. All twelve substances were found in the influent and for all four drugs, higher concentrations were detected of the metabolites than the parent compounds. Highest concentrations were detected of o-desmethylnaproxen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen (average influent concentrations of 45,35 and 63 mu g/L respectively). The study showed only partial removal during the primary treatment whereas both parent compounds and metabolites were efficiently removed during the activated sludge process. In the effluent all analytes were detected in concentrations below 1 mu g/L thus showing that either the investigated metabolites do not belong to the NSAID transformation products formed during the activated sludge treatment or they are also quickly further transformed within the treatment.

AB Small scale laboratory experiment series were performed to study the suitability of a cyclodextrin-based sorbent (beta-cyclodextrin bead polymer, BCDP) for modelling the removal of micropollutants from drinking water and purified waste water using simulated inflow test solutions containing target analytes (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, bisphenol-A, diclofenac, beta-estradiol, ethinylestradiol, estriol, cholesterol at 2-6 mu g/L level). This work was focused on the preliminary evaluation of BCDP as a sorbent in two different model systems (filtration and fluidization) applied for risk reduction of emerging micropollutants.
   For comparison different filter systems combined with various sorbents (commercial filter and activated carbon) were applied and evaluated in the filtration experiment series.
   The spiked test solution (inflow) and the treated outflows were characterized by an integrated methodology including chemical analytical methods gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and various environmental toxicity tests to determine the efficiency and selectivity of the applied sorbents.
   Under experimental conditions the cyclodextrin-based filters used for purification of drinking water in most cases were able to absorb more than 90% of the bisphenol-A and of the estrogenic compounds. Both the analytical. chemistry and toxicity results showed efficient elimination of these pollutants. Especially the toxicity of the filtrate decreased considerably.
   Laboratory experiment modelling post-purification of waste water was also performed applying fluidization technology by beta-cyclodextrin bead polymer. The BCDP removed efficiently from the spiked test solution most of the micropollutants, especially the bisphenol-A (94%) and the hormones (87-99%)
   The results confirmed that the BCDP-containing sorbents provide a good solution to water quality problems and they are able to decrease the load and risk posed by micropollutants to the water systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced treatment to remove trace constituents and emerging contaminants is an important consideration for wastewater treatment for potable reuse, and reverse osmosis (RO) can be a suitable technology to provide the necessary level of treatment. However, membrane fouling by biological and organic matter is a concern. This research examined the development of the RO membrane fouling layer using a bench-scale membrane bioreactor operating at different solids retention times (SRTs), followed by a custom-designed RO test cell. The RO test cell contained stacked plates that sandwich five sheets of RO membrane material, which can be extracted for autopsy at separate times over the course of an experiment without disturbing the remaining membranes. The MBR-RO system was run continuously for 2 weeks at each SRT. The RO membranes were stained for live and dead cells, protein, and carbohydrate-like materials, and visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Images of the stained foulant layers were obtained at different depths within the foulant layer at each time point for all SRT conditions. As the RO foulant layer developed, changes occurred in the distribution and morphology of the live cells and carbohydrates, but not the proteins. These trends were similar for all three SRT conditions tested. RO membrane fouling increased with increased MBR SRT, and the highest SRT had the highest ratios of live to dead cells and carbohydrate-like material to dead cells. The autopsied membranes were also analyzed for protein and carbohydrate content, and it was found that the carbohydrate concentration on the membranes after 14 days increased as the SRT increased.

AB In this study, the occurrence in wastewater of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), naproxen and ibuprofen, and one personal care product, triclosan, was assessed using the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS). The samplers were initially calibrated in the laboratory to obtain sampling rates (R-s) for each target compound followed by deployment in the influent and effluent of Goudkoppies and Northern Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs), South Africa. Exposure was done for 14 days in 2012. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence (FLD) detectors was used to analyse POCIS extracts. Laboratory calibration of POCIS yielded R-s values for the three compounds that were between 0.087 and 0.383 l.d(-1) in quiescent conditions, and 0.125 and 0.936 l.d(-1) in stirred conditions. From the accumulated amounts in field-deployed samplers, estimated freely dissolved concentrations of the studied compounds in wastewater influent ranged from 55.0 to 78.4 mu g.l(-1) and 52.3 to 127.7 mu g.l(-1) in Goudkoppies and Northern WWTPs, respectively. Average concentrations of these compounds in the treated effluent ranged from 10.7 to 13.5 mu g.l(-1) in Goudkoppies WWTP, and 20.4 to 24.6 mu g.l(-1) in Northern WWTP. Analyte removal efficiencies varied between 68 and 86% in Goudkoppies WWTP and 61 and 82% in Northern WWTP. Grab samples processed by SPE method yielded higher analyte concentrations (up to three-fold) as compared to POCIS-derived estimates. This discrepancy was attributed to SPE's ability to extract both the free dissolved, and particle sorbed fractions of the contaminants.

AB This work is focused on the use of TiO2-WO3 photocatalysts for the removal of a mixture of emerging contaminants through photocatalytic ozonation using simulated solar light as radiation source. Own-made TiO2-WO3 catalysts with WO3 content around 4 wt% were synthesized using P25 and titanate nanotubes as TiO2 starting materials. Photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by means of ICP-OES, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, TEM, Raman, XPS and DR-UV-Vis spectroscopy. Photocatalytic ozonation using WO3 based titanate nanotubes composite gave place to complete removal of emerging contaminants (caffeine, metoprolol and ibuprofen in a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant effluent aqueous matrix) in less than 40 min with TOC removal up to 64% after 2 h. The highest catalytic activity of this material in the reaction under study compared to bare TiO2 is due to several effects such as higher activity under visible light radiation joined to an increase in adsorption capacity of organic compounds and catalytic ozonation ability caused by the presence of WO3.

AB Influence of inherent buffering nature of real field pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) was evaluated in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) at varying organic loads (OL1-OL4). Dynamics of in situ buffers present in the wastewater during remediation enhanced the electrogenic activity. Improvement in power density (PD) and open circuit voltage (OCV) was observed as the organic load increased from OL1 to OL4 (PD of 62.45 to137 mW/m(2); OCV-245 to 324 mV). It was concluded from the buffering capacity () profiles that base values were relatively more stable than acid values indicating the dynamics of nutrients and salts present in PW. pH increased with increase in OL documenting improvement in power output and waste remediation. Present study depicted an optimum pH range suitable for effective operation of MFC for bioelectrogenesis using PW as substrate.

AB The bezafibrate (BZF) degradation and mineralization performances of a red mud (RM) catalyst doped with cobalt (i.e. Co/RM) during the ozonation reaction have been evaluated experimentally. The purposes of this study were to study the performance reaction mechanism and intermediate. In a next stage of our study also economic evaluations for a large scale application will be considered. Results of this study showed that catalytic zonation using Co/RM not only led to the successful degradation of BZF, but also mineralized the corresponding intermediates, in ultrapure water as well as the effluent of wastewater. Detoxification was also achieved in this reaction process. The surface and structure properties of Co/RM were characterized by several analytical methods. The leaching of toxic heavy metal from the catalyst used in this process was very low, with the heterogeneous reaction dominating the decomposition of BZF, which made the reuse of the catalyst highly feasible. The enhanced generation of hydroxyl radical was critical to the success of the catalytic activity. Furthermore, 22 of the intermediates generated during this process were identified and several degradation pathways were proposed (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Estrogenic steroids such as estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are among the most potent endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Compared with North America, Europe and Japan there is no reliable information on the concentration of steroid hormones in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) influents and effluents in Iran. The aim of the present study was to determine the amounts of E1, E2, E3, and EE2 influents and effluents of 7 municipal WWTPs across Tehran, the capital city of Iran, in two seasons, summer and autumn, through solid-phase extraction (SPE) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   Results: The results showed that the concentrations of E1, E2, and EE2 in influents ranged from 6.54-18.76 ng/L, 1.02-8 ng/L and 4.18-11.76 ng/L, respectively. Also, the concentrations of E1, E2, and EE2 in effluents ranged from 1.04-4.99 ng/L, 0.5-2.20 ng/L and 0.5-2.58 ng/L, respectively. The levels of E3 were below the detection limit (0.5 ng/L). The percentage removal rate of E1, E2 and EE2 ranged between 61.76-87.25%, 50.98-82.63%, and 66.3-90.25%, respectively. Results indicated no significant correlation between hormone concentrations and seasons.
   Conclusions: The study showed that WWTP number 7 had significant differences in influent hormone concentrations compared with others. Results only showed a significant relationship between hormones and TSS removal rate, but there was no significant relationship between hormones and COD removal rate. The removal rate of hormone in WWTP number 4 and 7 were significantly different from the others. There was no significant correlation between hormone concentrations and seasons.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a rapidly expanding field that can provide information on illicit drug usage in communities, based on the measured concentrations in samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, select illicit drugs (six drugs and eight metabolites) were determined on a daily basis for a week in wastewater, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge from two WWTPs in the Albany area in New York State. The WWTP that served a larger population (similar to 100 000, with a flow rate of 83 300 m(3)/d) showed 3.2 (methadone) to 51 (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; MBA) times higher mass flows of illicit drugs than did the WWTP that served a smaller population (similar to 15 000, with a flow rate of 6850 m(3)/d). The consumption rate of target illicit drugs in the communities served by the two WWTPs was estimated to range from 1.67 to 3510 mg/d/1000 people. Between the dissolved and particulate phases, the fraction of methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), amphetamine, and MDA sorbed to SPM ranged from 34.3% to 41.1% of the total mass in the waste stream. The removal efficiencies of illicit drugs from the two WWTPs ranged from 4% (norcocaine) to 99% (cocaine); however, methamphetamine, methadone, and EDDP showed a negative removal in WWTPs. The environmental emission of illicit drugs from WWTP discharges was calculated to range from 0.38 (MDEA) to 67.5 (EDDP) mg/d/1000 people. Other markers such as caffeine, paraxanthine, nicotine, and cotinine were found to predict the concentrations of select illicit drugs in raw wastewater (r(2) = 0.20-0.79; p <= 0.029).

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a typical sulfonamide antibiotic, has been widely detected in secondary wastewater effluents and surface waters. In this work we investigated the oxidative degradation of SMX by commonly used oxidants of chlorine, ozone and permanganate. Chlorine and ozone were shown to be more effective for the removal of SMX (0.05-5.0 mg/L), as compared with permanganate. Higher pH enhanced the oxidation of SMX by ozone and permanganate, but decreased the removal by chlorine. Moreover, the ozonation of SMX was significantly influenced by the presence of humic acid (HA), which exhibited negligible influence on the oxidation by chlorine and permanganate. Fairly lower mineralization of SMX occurred during the oxidation reactions, with the highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal of 13% (for ozone). By using LC-MS/MS, 7, 5 and 5 oxidation products were identified for chlorine, ozone and permanganate and possible transformation pathways were proposed. It was shown that different oxidants shared some common pathways, such as the cleavage of S-N bond, the hydroxylation of the benzene ring, etc. On the other hand, each of the oxidants also exhibited exclusive degradation mechanisms, leading to the formation of different transformation products (TPs). This work may provide useful information for the selection of oxidants in water treatment processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distribution of five groups of antibiotics were investigated in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary over four seasons. Four tetracyclines (TCs), sulfaquinoxaline (SQ), enrofloxacin (EFC) and thiamphenicol (TAP) were detected in all the samples, while sulfamerazine (SM) and sulfathiazole (ST) showed the lowest detection frequency. The detection frequencies and antibiotic concentrations were generally higher in January and May, indicating that low flow conditions and low temperature might enhance the persistence of antibiotics in sediment. Antibiotic levels varied with location, with the highest concentrations being observed around river discharges and sewage outfalls. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the concentration of quinolones and TOC revealed the significant role played by TOC. The concentration of quinolones at Wusongkou exceeded the trigger value (0.10 mg kg(-1)) of the Steering Committee of the Veterinary International Committee on Harmonization (VICH), which should be paid attention to in future studies.

AB The use of chemical markers of undoubted anthropogenic sources for surface freshwater contamination by wastewaters was evaluated employing correlations observed between measured physico-chemical parameters as the electrical conductivity and the concentration of different emerging organic compounds. During the period from April/2011 to April/2012 spatial-temporal variations and contamination patterns of two rivers (Pirai and Jundiai rivers), Sao Paulo state, Brazil were evaluated. Seven physico-chemical parameters and concentrations of different classes of emerging contaminants were determined in samples collected in seven field campaigns. The high linear correlation coefficients obtained for the compounds diclofenac (r = 0.9085), propanolol (r = 0.8994), ibuprofen (r = 0.8720) and atenolol (r = 0.7811) with electrical conductivity, also corroborated by principal component analysis (PCA), point to the potential use of these compounds as markers of investigated surface water contamination by wastewaters. Due to specific inputs, these environmental markers showed very good effectiveness for the identification and differentiation of water body contamination by discharges of treated and untreated urban sewage.

AB The occurrence of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its metabolites in German and Portuguese wastewater was investigated. A total of 46 samples from influent and effluent wastewater were analyzed by liquid-chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry. The five metabolites 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (DiOH-CBZ), 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-CBZ (10-OH-CBZ), 10,11-epoxy-10,11-dihydro-CBZ, 2-hydroxy-CBZ and 3-hydroxy-CBZ were very persistent with little to no removal during wastewater treatment. The highest concentrations were found for CBZ, DiOH-CBZ, and 10-OH-CBZ, with up to 5.0, 4.8 and 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, the related pharmaceutical oxcarbazepine and the metabolites 9-hydroxymethy1-10-carbamoylacridan, 1-hydroxy-CBZ (1-OH-CBZ) and 4-hydroxy-CBZ (4OH-CBZ) were detected. Explicit care was taken to achieve a good chromatographic separation of the numerous isomers that were difficult to distinguish by mass spectrometry alone. A phenylether stationary phase provided the best separation. In combination with high resolution mass spectrometry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange, this LC column enabled us to identify 1-OH-CBZ and 4-OH-CBZ in wastewater for the first time.

AB Sulfadiazine (SD) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are widely used sulfonamide antibiotics, which are present as contaminants in surface waters and are known to undergo phototransformation. This kinetic study was conducted to identify the processes responsible for their phototransformation in sunlit surface waters. Water samples from the Thur River (Switzerland) and from a pilot wastewater treatment plant, as well as aqueous solutions of two well-characterized natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracts, namely Suwannee River and Pony Lake fulvic acids (SRFA, PLFA), were examined. Both sulfonamides were found to undergo direct and indirect phototransformation, with contributions of excited triplet states of DOM and of effluent organic matter (EfOM) and possibly of hydroxyl radical and other unidentified reactive species. Under simulated sunlight, SMX mainly reacted through direct phototransformation, with a certain contribution of indirect phototransformation occurring for a wastewater effluent. The behavior of SD was found to be more diverse. For river waters, wastewater effluents and PLFA solutions, indirect phototransformation was predominant, while for SRFA solutions direct phototransformation prevailed. The rates of phototransformation of SD were interpreted as the result of a complex interplay between the photosensitizing and the inhibitory effect of DOM/EfOM, with an additional component related to the nitrite ion as a source of photoproduced hydroxyl radical. For typical conditions found in surface waters comparable to the Thur River, phototransformation half-lives on the order of 3-13 d were estimated for the two studied sulfonamides.

AB The identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals in surface waters is challenging as they comprise a variety of structures which are often present at nanomolar concentrations and are temporally highly variable. Hence, a holistic passive sampling approach can be an efficient technique to overcome these limitations. In this study, a combination of 4 different passive samplers used for sampling polar (POCIS A(pharm) and POCIS Bpesticide) and apolar compounds (LDPE low density polyethylene membranes, and silicone strips) were used to profile anti-androgenic activity present in river water contaminated by a wastewater effluent. Extracts of passive samplers were analysed using HPLC fractionation in combination with an in uitro androgen receptor antagonist screen (YAS). Anti-androgenic activity was detected in extracts from silicone strips and POCIS A/B at (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 0.55 +/- 0.06 mg flutamide standard equivalents/sampler respectively, but was not detected in LDPE sampler extracts. POCIS samplers revealed higher selectivity for more polar anti-androgenic HPLC fractions compared with silicone strips. Over 31 contaminants were identified which showed inhibition of YAS activity and were potential antiandrogens, and these included fungicides, germicides, flame retardants and pharmaceuticals. This study reveals that passive sampling, using a combination of POCIS A and silicone samplers, is a promising tool for screening complex mixture of anti-androgenic contaminants present in surface waters, with the potential to identify new and emerging structures with endocrine disrupting activity.

AB In this study, pH-sensitive polysulfone (PSf)/polyactylic acid (PAA) nanofiltration membranes were synthesized for separation of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, amoxicillin separation was enhanced by pH of filtration environment. In order to do so, a flat sheet ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with different pore sizes was prepared by the phase inversion process. A further layer of polyacrylic acid which is sensitive to filtration media pH was grafted onto this fabricated PSf UF membrane surface by UV-initiated graft. Efficiency of amoxicillin separation improved as a result of pH-sensitive nature of amoxicillin as well as surface activity and pH-sensitivity of developed nanofiltration membranes. The results confirmed that increase in molecular weight of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the pore forming agent in the phase inversion stage, increased the pore size, the amount of acrylic acid deposition on the membrane walls and pH-sensitivity. Also, an increase in grafting intensity decreased the pore sizes and increased their surface charges as well as amoxicillin separation. AFM analysis showed that surface roughness decreases which reflect the reduction in deposition of acrylic acid onto membrane surface valleys. Since the membrane pores are electrically charged, which was confirmed by zeta potential measurement, when the pH of solution increases, the amoxicillin separation by these pH-sensitive membranes increases. Finally, the amoxicillin separation of synthesized nanofiltration membranes at pH = 10 successfully reached relatively high amount of 91%, while acceptable flux of 108.31 h(-1) m(2) was maintained. The SEM images also confirmed increase in membrane pore sizes due to increase of PEG molecular weight. The FUR analysis revealed that the amount of amoxicillin fouled on the membrane surface declined at higher pH due to high repulsion of amoxicillin by membrane. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Electrochemical degradation of different effluents polluted with carbamazepine, a well-known refractory pharmaceutical contaminant, was addressed in this article. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q(TM) technology), surface water from a lake and urban wastewater were the matrices used to evaluate the feasibility of performing the electro-oxidation of carbamazepine. Specific designs of experiments were planned for each of the aqueous media. The initial carbamazepine concentration and the electric current density were considered as the operational variables. Although the optimal values of both variables follow the same trend in the three cases, significant differences are observed regarding the comparative influence of each variable on the degradation of carbamazepine.

AB In this study, the spatial extent of a wastewater-influenced water mass (plume) originating from a wastewater treatment plant outlet in Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva) was monitored by two manned submersibles from June to August 2011. The main goal was to assess whether micropollutants in the wastewater mass cause an ecotoxicological risk to the aquatic environment, and to determine how far the zone of risk extends beyond the wastewater outlet. Real-time measurements of elevated electrical conductivity were used as a proxy to indicate the presence of wastewater-influenced water. Conductivity was highest in immediate proximity to the wastewater outlet, though if all measurements obtained over the duration of the sampling campaign were integrated, elevated conductivity extended over an area of at least 1 km(2) surrounding the outlet. Additionally, water samples were collected within and outside Vidy Bay, and were analyzed for 39 micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and corrosion inhibitors). Micropollutant concentrations were generally in the low ng/L range, though for some substances > 100 ng/L was measured. The concentrations of most pharmaceuticals, which are primarily wastewater-derived, decreased with decreasing conductivity and with increasing distance from the wastewater outlet. Pesticide concentrations, in contrast, were homogeneous throughout Vidy Bay and the lake. An ecotoxicological risk assessment based on the cumulative risk exerted by all measured substances indicated that the wastewater caused a zone of potential ecotoxicological risk that extended well into the deep lake and in the direction of a downstream drinking water intake.

AB Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the residence (or flushing) time of water in Vidy Bay (north shore of Lake Geneva) for different meteorological conditions. A hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW) was applied to simulate the flow field in the embayment during 2010 and January 2011. Using these results, particle tracking was applied to estimate transport of wastewater effluent discharged into the embayment. The model predictions compared well with published field measurements of dissolved species (as given by electrical conductivity profiles) within the wastewater. The pelagic boundary of the embayment was defined by the largest within-bay gyre. Based on this definition, particle tracking was used to quantify the residence time under dominant wind conditions. Similarly, particle tracking was used to determine the travel time (i.e., time to exit the embayment) for each of Vidy Bay's three inflows (stream, stormwater and wastewater effluent). Although the wind field over the lake is variable, current patterns in the embayment can be simulated using the hydrodynamic model forced by a spatially uniform wind field. For a given wind speed, the main factor influencing residence and travel times is the wind angle. The presence of gyres leads to high mean residence times with large variability. As the wind direction becomes more aligned with the shoreline (i.e., with increasing westerly or easterly components), longshore currents dominate. These disrupt gyre formation and markedly reduce the mean and variability of embayment residence time. The numerical model was utilized to assess the potential for plume movement (in plan) from above the wastewater effluent outfall towards one of Lausanne's drinking water intakes. In the most direct pathway, westward longshore currents can move water from the embayment to the water column above the intake location.

AB Seasonal removal efficiency of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products was monitored in a wastewater treatment plant in esk, Budjovice, Czech Republic, over a period of 1 year (total amount of samples, n = 272). The studied compounds included four UV filters, three analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs and nine anti-hypertensive/cardiovascular drugs. In most cases, elimination of the substances was incomplete, and overall removal rates varied strongly from -38 to 100 %. Therefore, it was difficult to establish a general trend for each therapeutic group. Based on the removal efficiencies (REs) over the year, three groups of target compounds were observed. A few compounds (benzophenon-1, valsartan, isradipine and furosemide) were not fully removed, but their REs were greater than 50 %. The second group of analytes, consisting of 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, tramadol, sotalol, metoprolol, atenolol and diclofenac, showed a very low RE (lower than 50 %). The third group of compounds showed extremely variable RE (benzophenon-3 and benzophenon-4, codeine, verapamil, diltiazem and bisoprolol). There were significant seasonal trends in the observed REs, with reduced efficiencies in colder months.

AB Global detection of antibiotic substances in water matrices has considerably increased in the recent past. However, in India research on this issue is limited or generalised in the literature. Risks associated with the presence of antibiotics in the environment can be quantified using a hazard quotient (HQ) approach. Here, HQs were developed using the measured environmental concentration (MEC) approach for antibiotic residues in Indian water matrices previously reported in the literature. In the present study, environmental risk assessment, using the HQ index [HQ= measured environmental concentration (MEC)/predicted no effect concentration (PNEC)] for different antibiotics, was performed according to the guidelines of European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA). MEC and PNEC levels were obtained from the literature. PNEC values were also calculated from EC50 using a safety factor when no PNECs were reported in the literature. HQs were obtained for industrial effluents (HQ= 104) that were greater than any previously reported values. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, seemed to present the greatest risk in India. The HQ indices for Indian water matrices were in the following order: industrial effluents> lake water> river water> hospital effluents> treated sewage. groundwater. A very high HQ represents a potential environmental concern for aquatic environments in India and demands that immediate attention be devoted to regulating these compounds, especially in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater.

AB Occurrence, distribution, spatial and seasonal variations, and partitioning between aqueous phase and suspended particulate matters (SPM) of triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) in Xiaoqing River, which receives wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, were studied. The distribution of the total TCC and TCS levels in surface water and sediments along the river were discussed. The highest TCC and TCS concentrations were both found near the discharge port of WWTPs, and the TCC and TCS levels decreased downstream of the WWTPs as a result of their distances from the source of WWTP discharges. The mean values of TCC and TCS in low-flow season were 1.62 and 1.80 times, respectively, as much as in high-flow season in surface water. The study on partitioning of TCC and TCS between aqueous phase and SPM shown the mean level of dissolved TCC accounted for about 10 % of the total level in surface water, whereas the TCS level was about 30 %. The TCC concentrations detected in the surface sediment samples (0 to 5 cm) ranged from 226 to 1,956 ng/g, with a mean value of 733 ng/g. The TCS levels were between 85 and 705 ng/g, with a mean value of 255 ng/g. The distribution and variations of TCC and TCS in sediments along the river were highly consistent with those in the water phase. The TCC and TCS levels in deep sediments (5 to 10 cm) were significantly lower than those in surface sediments. The mean TCC level in surface sediments was about 2.4 times as much as in deep sediments, and the TCS level in surface sediments was 3.1 times as much as in deep sediments.

AB In this report, we refer to pharmaceuticals that are widespread in the urban aquatic environment and that mainly originate from wastewater treatment plants or non-point source sewage as "wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals" (WWMPs). To some extent, they reflect the condition or trend of water contamination and also contribute to aquatic environmental risk assessment. The method reported here for screening typical WWMPs was proposed based on academic concerns about them and their concentrations present in the urban aquatic environment, as well as their properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and related environmental risks caused by them. The screening system consisted of an initial screening system and a further screening system. In the former, pharmaceuticals were categorised into different evaluation levels, and in the latter, each pharmaceutical was given a normalised final evaluation score, which was the sum of every score for its properties of accumulation, persistence, eco-toxicity and environmental risk in the aquatic environment. The system was applied to 126 pharmaceuticals frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In the initial screening procedure, five pharmaceuticals were classified into the "high" category, 16 pharmaceuticals into the "medium" category, 15 pharmaceuticals into the "low" category and 90 pharmaceuticals into the "very low" category. Subsequently, further screening were conducted on 36 pharmaceuticals considered as being of "high", "medium" and "low" categories in the former system. We identified 7 pharmaceuticals with final evaluation scores of 1-10, 10 pharmaceuticals with scores of 11-15, 15 pharmaceuticals with scores from 16 to 20 and 4 pharmaceuticals with scores above 21. The results showed that this screening system could contribute to the effective selection of target WWMPs, which would be important for spatial-temporal dynamics, transference and pollution control of pharmaceuticals in the urban aquatic environment. However, there remains a number of pharmaceutical parameters with measured data gaps, such as organic carbon adsorption coefficients and bioconcentration factors, which, if filled, would improve the accuracy of the screening system.

AB BACKGROUNDSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline is found to be one of the most persistent pharmaceutical drugs and it has been detected in effluents from wastewater treatment plants. This work evaluates the feasibility of homogeneous solar photo-Fenton oxidation for treating aqueous solutions containing sertraline.
   RESULTSThe influence of iron and H2O2 dosages was studied in order to optimize the reagents consumption. The beneficial role of simulated solar irradiation was noticeable and sertraline was readily oxidized; TOC removal up to 90% was achieved at a hydrogen peroxide dose as low as 40% of the stoichiometric amount for mineralization. Dechlorination was the first step of the proposed reaction pathway giving rise to the formation of by-products of much lower toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONSSolar simulated photo-Fenton allowed reduction of the doses of iron and H2O2 needed, and therefore the main operating cost associated with this process, without compromising the quality of the effluent in terms of ecotoxicity. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Outdoor shallow wetland mesocosms, designed to simulate surface constructed wetlands to improve lagoon wastewater treatment, were used to assess the role of macrophytes in the dissipation of wastewater nutrients, selected pharmaceuticals, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Specifically, mesocosms were established with or without populations of Typha spp. (cattails), Myriophyllum sibiricum (northern water milfoil), and Utricularia vulgaris (bladderwort). Following macrophyte establishment, mesocosms were seeded with ARG-bearing organisms from a local wastewater lagoon, and treated with a single pulse of artificial municipal wastewater with or without carbamazepine, clofibric acid, fluoxetine, and naproxen (each at 7.6 mu g/L), as well as sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine (each at 150 mu g/L). Rates of pharmaceutical dissipation over 28 d ranged from 0.073 to 3.0 d(-1), corresponding to half-lives of 0.23 to 9.4 d. Based on calculated rate constants, observed dissipation rates were consistent with photodegradation driving clofibric acid, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine removal, and with sorption also contributing to carbamazepine and fluoxetine loss. Of the seven gene determinants assayed, only two genes for both beta-lactam resistance (bla(CTX) and bla(TEM)) and sulfonamide resistance (sulI and sulII) were found in sufficient quantity for monitoring. Genes disappeared relatively rapidly from the water column, with half-lives ranging from 2.1 to 99 d. In contrast, detected gene levels did not change in the sediment, with the exception of sulI, which increased after 28 d in pharmaceutical-treated systems. These shallow wetland mesocosms were able to dissipate wastewater contaminants rapidly. However, no significant enhancement in removal of nutrients or pharmaceuticals was observed in mesocosms with extensive aquatic plant communities. This was likely due to three factors: first, use of naive systems with an unchallenged capacity for nutrient assimilation and contaminant removal; second, nutrient sequestration by ubiquitous filamentous algae; and third, dominance of photolytic processes in the removal of pharmaceuticals, which overshadowed putative plant-related processes.

AB Two hybrid membrane processes combining powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption with ultrafiltration (UF) were investigated regarding operational performance and efficiency to remove organic micropollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent. A pressurized PAC/UF (pPAC/UF) and a submerged PAC/UF (sPAK/UF) system were operated continuously over a period of six months.
   Both UF membrane systems showed good compatibilitywith the application of PAC showing no abrasion or other negative impacts. The pPAC/UF system reached permeability values up to 290 L/(m(2)h bar) at high fluxes of 80 L/(m(2)h) compared to the sPAC/UF with a permeability of up to 200 L/(m(2)h bar) at fluxes of up to 23 L/(m(2)h). Surface analysis of both membranes with scanning electron microscopy revealed no membrane deterioration after the six-month period of operation. On the surface of the pressurized membrane the formation of a PAC layer was observed, which may have contributed to the high permeability by forming a protective coating.
   Five micropollutants, i.e. sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, mecoprop, diclofenac and benzotriazole in ambient effluent concentrations were investigated. Both PAC/UF systems removed 60-95% of the selected micropollutants at a dosage of 20 mg PAC/L and 4 mg Fe3+/ L. However, extreme peak loads of sulfamethoxazole with concentrations of up to 30 mu g/L caused a considerable performance decrease for more than a week. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eight commercially available powdered activated carbons (PAC) were examined regarding organic micro-pollutant (OMP) removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. PAC characteristic numbers such as B.E.T. surface, iodine number and nitrobenzene number were checked for their potential to predict the OMP removal of the PAC products. Furthermore, the PAC-induced removal of UV254 (nm) absorption (UVA(254)) in WWTP effluent was determined and also correlated with OMP removal. None of the PAC characteristic numbers can satisfactorily describe OMP removal and accordingly, these characteristics have little informative value on the reduction of OMP concentrations in WWTP effluent. In contrast, UVA(254) removal and OMP removal correlate well for carbamazepine, diclofenac, and several iodinated x-ray contrast media. Also, UVA(254) removal can roughly describe the average OMP removal of all measured OMP, and can accordingly predict PAC performance in OMP removal. We therefore suggest UVA(254) as a handy indicator for the approximation of OMP removal in practical applications where direct OMP concentration quantification is not always available. In continuous operation of large-scale plants, this approach allows for the efficient adjustment of PAC dosing to UVA(254), in order to ensure reliable OMP removal whilst minimizing PAC consumption.

AB This study was undertaken to investigate whether adaptation by pre-exposure to trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was necessary for microbial transformation during managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Two pairs of laboratory-scale soil columns, each receiving a different primary substrate, were utilized to simulate the dominant bulk organic carbon present in MAR systems receiving wastewater effluent of varying quality and having undergone different degrees of pre-treatment, as well as organic carbon prevalent at different stages of subsurface travel. Each pair of columns consisted of duplicate set-ups receiving the same feed solution with only one pre-exposed to a suite of eight TOrCs for approximately ten months. Following the pre-exposure period, a spiking experiment was conducted in which the non-exposed columns also received the same suite of TOrCs. TOrC attenuation was quantified for the pre- and non-exposed columns of each pair during the spiking experiment. The microbial community structure and function of these systems were characterized by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics, respectively. Biotransformation rather than sorption was identified as the dominant removal mechanism for almost all the TOrCs (except triclocarban). Similar removal efficiencies were observed between pre-exposed and non-exposed columns for most TOrCs. No obvious differences in microbial community structure were revealed between pre- and non-exposed columns. Using metagenomics, biotransformation capacity potentials of the microbial community present were also similar between pre- and non-exposed columns of each pair. Overall, the pre-exposure of MAR systems to TOrCs at ng/L levels did not affect their attenuation and had no obvious influence on the resulting microbial community structure and function. Thus, other factors such as bioavailability of the primary substrate play a greater role regarding biotransformation of TOrCs. These results indicate that MAR systems adapted to a primary substrate are capable of degrading TOrC without necessarily being pre-exposed to them, making MAR a robust treatment barrier for biodegradable TOrCs.

AB Antidepressants, even at low concentrations, can reveal some adverse effects on aquatic life due to disturbing homeostasis throughout the central and peripheral nervous system both in vertebrates and invertebrates. To date there have not been any reports regarding the presence of these pharmaceuticals in surface and tap waters in Eastern Europe. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 21 antidepressant pharmaceuticals at specific points of the main Polish river - the Vistula, a smaller river of the Warsaw region - the Utrata, as well as in tap water samples of Warsaw. Samples were collected twice at one month intervals and analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique coupled with the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM).
   This is the first study where active compounds such as moclobemid or trazodone in the environment have been investigated.
   Environmental risk assessment of antidepressants in Poland was estimated on the basis of annuals sale data extracted from the NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia-National Health Service) base of reimbursed pharmaceuticals'. Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of target pharmaceuticals were compared with their measured concentration (MEC).
   Moreover, the application of the EMEA/CHMP guideline for environmental risk assessment of the antidepressants was discussed. The highest concentration of antidepressants was observed in the small river Utrata. In tap water only trace amounts of antidepressants including citalopram (up to 1.5 ng/l), mianserin (up to 0.9 ng/l), sertraline (<3.1 ng/l), moclobemid (up to 0.3 ng/l) and venlafaxine (up to 1.9 ng/l) were detected. However this highlights their inadequate elimination in the drinking waste treatment facility. The presence of antidepressants in drinking water and the aquatic environment could have long-term effects even at low exposure level, especially since synergy amongst pharmaceutical pollutants may occur.

AB Concerns are being expressed recently over possible environmental effects of human pharmaceuticals. Although the likelihood of acute toxicity is low, the continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment means that sublethal effects on non-target organisms need to be seriously considered. One-year-old Atlantic salmon parr were exposed to 7.85 +/- 0.13 mu g L-1 of the antidepressant drug Carbamazepine (CBZ) for five days to investigate changes of mRNA expression in the brain by means of a custom 17k Atlantic salmon cDNA microarray. The selected concentration is similar to upper levels that can be found in hospital and sewage treatment plant effluents. After treatment, 373 features were differently expressed with 26 showing up- or down-regulation of >= 2-fold (p <= 0.05). Among the mRNAs showing the highest change were the pituitary hormones encoding features somatolactin, prolactin and somatotropin, or growth hormone. Functional enrichment and network analyses of up- and down-regulated genes showed that CBZ induced a highly different gene expression profile in comparison to untreated organisms. CBZ induced expression of essential genes of the focal adhesion and extracellular matrix - receptor interaction pathways most likely through integrin alpha-6 (itga6) activation. Negative regulation of apoptotic process, extracellular matrix organization and heme biosynthesis were the most enriched biological process related GO-terms, with the simultaneous enrichment of collagen and extracellular region related cellular component GO-terms, and extracellular matrix structural constituent, hormone activity and chromatin binding molecular function related GO-terms. These results show that relatively low doses of CBZ may affect brain physiology in exposed salmon parr, targeting similar processes as in human, indicating a high degree of conservation of targets of CBZ action. However, and since the mRNAs showing most changes in expression are critical for adaptation to different stressors and life history transitions in Atlantic salmon, more research should be undertaken to assess CBZ effects to avoid impairment of normal development and maintenance of natural populations.

AB The removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was studied in three lab-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) systems; a single-stage mesophilic, a single-stage thermophilic and a two-stage thermophilic/mesophilic. All micropollutants underwent microbial degradation. High removal efficiency (> 80%) was calculated for diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen; whereas triclosan, bisphenol A and the sum of nonylphenol (NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO) and nonylphenol diethoxylate were moderately removed (40-80%). NSAIDs removal was not affected by the type of AD system used; whereas slightly higher EDCs removal was observed in two-stage system. In this system, most microcontaminants were removed in thermophilic digester. Biotransformation of NP1EO and NP was affected by the temperature applied to bioreactors. Under mesophilic conditions, higher removal of NP1EO and accumulation of NP was noticed; whereas the opposite was observed under thermophilic conditions. For most analytes, higher specific removal rates were calculated under thermophilic conditions and 20 days SRT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the influent and effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and its receiving water in Beijing, China were determined. Results from the present study confirmed that caffeine, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and chloramphenicol were removed at a high rate (> 70 % efficiency). In contrast, removal efficiency of the other 12 compounds was quite poor (ranged from -40 % to 58 %). Some compounds in the receiving river were present at higher concentrations compared to those in the WWTP effluent, indicating that sources other than treated effluents are present. The risk to the aquatic environment was estimated by a ratio of measured environmental concentration and predicted no-effect concentration. For those compounds found in the effluent and surface water, mefenamic acid, trimethoprim and gemfibrozil may pose a medium risk to aquatic environment.

AB BACKGROUNDRemoval of some EDCs, such as triclosan including its metabolites (2,4-dichloro phenol and 2,3,4-trichloro phenol), estrogens (estrone, 17--estradiol and 17--ethinyl estradiol) and some pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, clofibrate, clofibrate methyl ester, carbamazepine) from water and treated wastewater by commercial highly crosslinked polymer adsorbents (Diaion SP207, Diaion SP825, Dowex L493) and activated carbon was investigated using batch adsorption. The analyses of EDCs were performed by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   RESULTSThe optimum dosages of polymer adsorbents were in the range 0.2-1.2 g L-1, while the respective values for activated carbon were in the range 0.05-0.2 g L-1. When treated municipal wastewater was used as the water matrix, removal rates of EDCs for activated carbon clearly deteriorated compared with pure water solutions. However, when the synthetic resins were tested in treated effluent, most substances exhibited similar or even higher removals.
   CONCLUSIONSPolymer adsorbents exhibited good performance for removal of EDCs from water. Their use in biologically treated effluent for EDCs removal is also a viable option. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The hyporheic zone - a spatially fluctuating ecotone connecting surface water and groundwater - is considered to be highly reactive with regard to the attenuation of organic micropollutants. In the course of the presented study an undisturbed sediment core was taken from the infiltration zone of a bank filtration site in Berlin and operated under controlled laboratory conditions with wastewater-influenced surface water at two different temperatures, simulating winter and summer conditions. The aim was to evaluate the fate of site-relevant micropollutants, namely metoprolol, iopromide, diclofenac, carbamazepine, acesulfame, tolyltriazole, benzotriazole, phenazone and two phenazone type metabolites, within the first meter of infiltration dependent on the prevailing temperature. A change in temperature resulted in a development of significantly distinct redox conditions. Both temperature dependencies and related redox dependencies were identified for all micropollutants except for benzotriazole and carbamazepine, which behaved persistent under all conditions. For the remaining compounds degradation rate constants generally decreased from warm and oxic/penoxic/suboxic over cold and oxic/penoxic to warm and manganese reducing (transition zone). Individual degradation rate constants ranged from 0 (e.g. diclofenac, acesulfame and tolyltriazole in the transition zone) to 1.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) for metoprolol under warm conditions within the oxic to suboxic zone.

AB Organic contaminants have become one of the most serious environmental problems, and the removal of organic contaminants (e.g., dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals/drugs) and common industrial organic wastes (e.g., phenols and aromatic amines) from aqueous solutions is of special concern because they are recalcitrant and persistent in the environment. In recent years, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been gradually applied to the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater through adsorption processes. This paper reviews recent progress (145 studies published from 2010 to 2013) in the application of CNTs and their composites for the removal of toxic organic pollutants from contaminated water. The paper discusses removal efficiencies and adsorption mechanisms as well as thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. CNTs are predicted to have considerable prospects for wider application to wastewater treatment in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The stability of 26 cytostatic drugs (21 parent compounds and 5 metabolites) in wastewater was studied using liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Wastewater aliquots were spiked with the target compounds at 1000 mu g L-1 and stored in the dark under different temperature (-20, 4 and 25 degrees C) and pH (acid and neutral) conditions for different periods of time (up to 3 months). The influence of these factors (temperature, pH and time) on the stability of the compounds was evaluated through an experimental design. The most negative factor was the time of storage, but temperature also exerted a very important influence. Acidification of the samples is a good option for some cytostatics (e.g., temozolomide, tamoxifen and its metabolites, and chlorambucil) but it may have a negative effect on others (e.g. ifosfamide). The design also showed correlations between factors indicating that an increase of the storage time is more relevant at high temperatures, while an increase of the temperature is more detrimental in non-acidified samples. After 3 months at -20 degrees C, all compounds with the exception of temozolomide, vinorelbine, imatinib and erlotinib presented recoveries below 80%. The most unstable compounds were oxaliplatin, 5-(3-N-methyltriazen-1-yl)-imidazole-4-carboxamide and chlorambucil. To the authors' knowledge, the stability data reported in the present study is the first ever published for most of the target compounds in wastewater. The results obtained point out storage at -20 degrees C from collection to analysis as the best storage option. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of sixteen pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in mixed solutions with four types of water and two sets of UV radiation was investigated. UVC (254 nm) photolysis was ineffective at eliminating a large number of PhCs while a big number of them were refractory. However, vacuum UV (VUV: 185 nm + 254 nm) photolysis in the same experimental conditions eliminated the PhCs almost completely. The eliminations in ultrapure water (UPW), tap water (TW) and Neya River water (NRW) and their organic/inorganic contents were inversely correlated, which was more evident in VUV photolysis. Natural organic matter (NOM) in NRW did not have an impact in indirect photolysis, but effluent organic matter (EfOM) in secondary-treated effluent (NWTPE) enhanced indirect photolysis, which was more evident in VUV photolysis underlining the point that radiation wavelength/intensity can be a limiting factor in organic-rich waters. Moreover, VUV photolysis was far superior (90% mineralization) to UVC photolysis (10% mineralization) for PhCs mineralization. The greatly enhanced elimination and mineralization efficiencies observed for VUV photolysis were attributed to accelerated direct photolysis with 185 nm wavelength and indirect photolysis involving (OH)-O-center dot. The results demonstrated efficacy of VUV photolysis in wastewater treatment and its potential use as a tertiary treatment.

AB The fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater treatment systems is an area of increasing concern. Little research has been done to understand this issue in rural or decentralized communities. The objective of this research was to examine the ability of a bench scale nitrifying recirculating biofilter (RBF) to remove four acidic PhACs: gemfibrozil, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from secondary treated municipal wastewater at concentrations of 20 and 200 mu g/L. The average removals in this study were between 92 and 99% for ibuprofen, 89 and 99% for naproxen, 62 and 92% for gemfibrozil and 40 and 76% for diclofenac, which is consistent with literature. Ibuprofen and naproxen were largely removed through biological transformation; whereas gemfibrozil and diclofenac showed more variable removal, likely due to both biological transformation and sorption processes. PhAC removal in the RBFs was repeatable between trials, robust and responsive to system upsets, and the presence of PhACs as a single compound versus mixtures had no impact on PhAC removal efficiency. In summary, this study indicates that RBFs as a nitrifying stage of a multi-stage filtration process could be a viable technology for removal of some acidic pharmaceuticals in small onsite wastewater treatment facilities.

AB In this work, extraction of acetaminophen (ACTP), currently named as paracetamol, from aqueous solutions by emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) using Aliquat 336 as carrier was investigated. An ELM system is made up of hexane as diluent, Span 80 as the surfactant and potassium chloride as the inner aqueous solution. Influence of operating conditions that affects the permeation of ACTP such as surfactant concentration, extractant concentration, emulsification time, sulfuric acid concentration in external phase, acid type in external phase, internal phase concentration, type of internal phase, stirring speed, volume ratio of internal phase to membrane phase, treatment ratio, ACTP initial concentration and diluent type was examined. Additionally, the effect of KCl concentration in the internal aqueous phase on the stripping of ACTP and the reuse of the recovered membrane was studied. Under most favorable conditions, it was possible to extract practically all of ACTP molecules from the feed external solution. The recovery of the membrane phase was total and the extraction of ACTP was not decreased. The ELM treatment represents a very interesting advanced separation process for the removal of ACTP even from complex matrices such as natural water, sea water and sewage water effluent.

The developed carbon-tubules were applied for the aqueous phase decontamination of three pharmaceutical drugs. Ibuprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were selected for the study. Batch and fixed-bed studies were performed to investigate the adsorption of selected pharmaceutical drugs. Mathematical modelings were applied to the experimental data in order to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity and evaluate the characteristics of the fixed-bed. Based on finding, the adsorption mechanism was investigated by adsorbate and adsorbent physicochemical characteristics. (C) 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB An increasing number of reports on plant uptake of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) have been recently published, raising concerns of human exposure through dietary intake. In this study, PC uptake and translocation were evaluated in cucumber and tomato plants to elucidate the effects of PC physicochemical properties, soil type, and irrigation-water quality. Nonionic PCs were taken up and accumulated at higher levels in plants grown in soils of lower organic matter and clay content. While the concentration of most PCs in cucumber and tomato leaves were of similar order, their concentrations in the tomato fruit were much lower than in the cucumber fruit. This is related to differences in fruit physiology. Our data suggest that irrigation with treated wastewater reduces the bioavailability of acidic PCs for uptake by cucumber plants as compared to fresh water irrigation. This study sheds light on factors affecting the uptake of PCs by crops irrigated with treated wastewater, the governing role of PCs' physicochemical properties along with the physiological nature of the plant, soil properties and water quality that together determine uptake, translocation, and accumulation within plant organs. Occurrence of metabolites in plant suggests that PC metabolism has to be evaluated to reveal the total uptake.

AB TiO2/high-silica zeolite composite synthesized by a sol-gel method was applied for the removal of sulfamethazine (SMT) antibiotic from water, and simple models including both adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition were developed. In this study, two types of models were constructed: a synergistic model that included the interaction between the zeolite and TiO2 in the composite, and an individual model, which did not include the interaction. We obtained rate constants for adsorption, desorption and photocatalytic decomposition experimentally, and compared them with the results calculated using the synergistic and individual models. The individual model predicted that ca. 55% of SMT would be removed from the system after 6 h of treatment; however, our experiments showed that 80% of the SMT was removed, suggesting the existence of another reaction pathway. Therefore, a synergistic model was constructed, in which, part of the SMT was adsorbed onto the zeolite within the composite, desorbed from the zeolite and migrated to the TiO2, and was then photocatalytically decomposed. Experiments were carried out with varying amounts of the TiO2-zeolite composite, and the synergistic model was validated. We estimated that 10% of the desorbed SMT was photocatalytically decomposed without being released into the water. When TiO2-zeolite composite concentrations were 0.04, 0.12 and 0.20 g/L, and the treatment time was 6 h, the proportions of the total decomposition of SMT that occurred via this synergistic reaction pathway were calculated as 52.2%, 58.6% and 66.7%, respectively. In other words, over half of the SMT was decomposed through the synergistic reaction, which played a very significant role in the overall removal of SMT (the remainder of the SMT was decomposed through simple photocatalysis on the TiO2).

AB The pharmaceutically active compound diclofenac has been monitored during one year at separate treatment units of two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate its seasonal variation and the removal efficiency. Conventional wastewater characterization was also performed to assess the possible relationship between conventional parameters and diclofenac. Diclofenac concentrations in the influent and effluent of both WWTPs were detected in the range of 295-1376 and 119-1012 ng/L, respectively. Results indicated that the higher diclofenac removal efficiency was observed in summer season in both WWTPs. Although a consistency in diclofenac removal was observed in WWTP_1, significant fluctuation was observed at WWTP_2 based on seasonal evaluation. The main removal mechanism of diclofenac in the WWTPs was most often biological (55%), followed by UV disinfection (27%). When diclofenac removal was evaluated in terms of the treatment units in WWTPs, a significant increase was achieved at the treatment plant including UV disinfection unit. Based on the statistical analysis, higher correlation was observed between diclofenac and suspended solids concentrations among conventional parameters in the influent whereas the removal of diclofenac was highly correlated with nitrogen removal efficiency.

AB In order to transform a wide range of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), the three oxidative enzymes laccase (Lac) from Trametes versicolor, versatile peroxidase (VP) from Bjerkandera adusta and glucose oxidase (GOD) from Aspergillus niger were concomitantly cross-linked after aggregation, thus, making a combined cross-linked enzyme aggregate (combi-CLEA) that was versatile and involved in an enzymatic cascade reaction. From the initial enzymes about 30% of initial laccase activity was recovered along with 40% for each of VP and GOD. The combi-CLEA showed good results in conditions close to those of real wastewater (neutral pH and medium temperature) as well as a good ability to resist to denaturing conditions such as high temperature (60 C) and low pH (3). Batch experiments were realized to test the free enzyme's ability to degrade, a PhACs cocktail, mainly in a synthetic wastewater containing acetaminophen, naproxen, mefenamic acid, indometacin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, caffeine, diazepam, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, fenofibrate and bezafibrate, carbamazepine and its by-product 10-11 epoxy-carbamazepine. High removal was achieved (more than 80%) for the five first compounds. Then, the elimination ability of the combi-CLEA with or without hydrogen peroxide, glucose or manganese sulfate was determined. Globally, our results demonstrated that VP has a wider removal spectrum than Lac. These removal features are enhanced under more specific conditions, whereas the combi-CLEAcombined advantages of both VP and laccase. Finally, the elimination of PhACs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent using the combi-CLEA was marginally investigated. Concentrations of most of the selected PhACs were below the limit of quantification (lower than 20 ng/L) except for acetaminophen. Its combi-CLEA-mediated removal reached up to 25%.

AB Free chlorine is extensively used for water and wastewater disinfection nowadays. However, it still remains a big challenge to determine the rate constants of rapid chlorination reactions although competition kinetics and stopped-flow spectrophotometric (SFS) methods have been employed individually to investigate fast reaction kinetics. In this work, we proposed an SFS competition kinetics method to determine the rapid chlorination rate constants by using a common colorimetric reagent, N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD), as a reference probe. A kinetic equation was first derived to estimate the reaction rate constant of DPD towards chlorine under a given pH and temperature condition. Then, on that basis, an SFS competition kinetics method was proposed to determine directly the chlorination rate constants of several representative compounds including tetracycline, ammonia, and four a-amino acids. Although Cl2O is more reactive than HOCl, its contribution to the overall chlorination kinetics of the test compounds could be neglected in this study. Finally, the developed method was validated through comparing the experimentally measured chlorination rate constants of the selected compounds with those obtained or calculated from literature and analyzing with Taft's correlation as well. This study demonstrates that the SFS competition kinetics method can measure the chlorination rate constants of a test compound rapidly and accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We determined national baseline levels and release inventories of 77 traditional and novel brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in biosolids composites (prepared from 110 samples) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2001 national sewage sludge survey (NSSS). Additionally, analyses were performed on archived samples from a 3-year outdoor mesocosm study to determine the environmental persistence of BFRs in biosolids-amended soil. The total polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) concentration detected in biosolids composites was 9400 960 mu g/kg dry weight, of which deca-BDE constituted 57% followed by nona- and penta-BDE at 18 and 13%, respectively. The annual mean loading rate estimated from the detected concentrations and approximate annual biosolids production and disposal numbers in the U.S., of the sum of PBDEs and non-BDE BFRs was calculated to be 47,900-60,100 and 12,900-16,200 kg/year, of which 24,000-36,000 and 6400 9700 kg/year are applied on land, respectively. Mean concentration of PBDEs were higher in the 2001 samples compared to levels reported in EPA's 2006/7 Targeted NSSS, reflecting on-going efforts in phasing-out PBDEs in the U.S. In outdoor soil mesocosms, > 99% of the initial BFRs mass in the biosolids/soil mixtures (1:2) persisted over the monitoring duration of three years. Estimates of environmental releases may be refined in the future by analyzing individual rather than composited samples, and by integrating currently unavailable data on disposal of biosolids on a plant-specific basis. This study informs the risk assessment of BFRs by furnishing national inventories of BFR occurrence and environmental release via biosolids application on land. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chlorine is widely used in drinking water treatment plants as a common disinfectant, and it also can effectively remove many pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water and wastewater. Two pyrazolone compounds (propyphenazone and aminopyrine) that have been frequently detected in aquatic environments were selected for investigation into their removal during free chlorine disinfection. The influencing factors on the removal of the pharmaceuticals were explored at initial pharmaceutical concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.25 mu M, chlorine dosages ranging from 14.08 to 28.17 mu M and pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0. The results showed high removal efficiencies of the two pharmaceuticals by free chlorine in the order of propyphenazone>aminopyrine. Their removal and reaction rate constants (k(obs)) were clearly dependent on the chlorine dosage and pH. High chlorine dosages accelerated the removal rates of both compounds. The highest removal efficiencies and the highest k(obs) were observed at neutral pH for propyphenazone (>90% for 24 s reaction) and slightly acidic pH for aminopyrine (>85% for 110 s reaction). In addition, the degradation of the two compounds by free chlorine and the structure characteristics of the oxidation byproducts were estimated by non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), ultraviolet (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The results of the NPOC analysis indicated that chlorine cannot completely mineralize propyphenazone or aminopyrine. Chlorine atom substitution, dealkylations and ring-opening reactions may occur during propyphenazone or aminopyrine chlorination according to the UV-Vis and FT-IR analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) may occur ubiquitously in the aquatic environment. In order to protect the ecosystem and drinking water sources from potentially toxic effects, discharges of an increasing number of OMPs are being regulated. OMP removal from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents as a point source is a preferred option with removal by adsorption onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) and OMP transformation to presumably harmless compounds by ozonation as the most promising techniques. In this study, effluents of four WWTPs were treated with PAC and ozone in bench-scale experiments to compare the removal efficiencies of seven relevant OMPs. Concentrations of carbamazepine and diclofenac were reduced by more than 90% with 20 mg/L PAC or 5-7 mg/L ozone (0.5 mg O-3 per mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC)). Comparing typical doses for practical applications ozonation proved to be more efficient for abatement of sulfamethoxazole, while removal of benzotriazole and iomeprol was comparatively more efficient with activated carbon. While well known for ozonation, DOC-normalized doses were also applied to PAC and correlated better to relative OMP removal than volume proportional PAC addition. Furthermore, OMP removal efficiencies corresponded well with the reduction of ultraviolet light absorption at 254 nm for both treatment options. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
