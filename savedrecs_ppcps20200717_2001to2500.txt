AB Pharmaceutical discharges into the aquatic ecosystem are of environmental concern and sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been pointed out as the major source of these compounds to coastal zones, where oceanic disposal of sewage occurs through submarine outfalls. Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water, but little is known about the effects on marine organisms. In this study, we employed a tiered approach involving the determination of environmental concentrations of DCF in marine water and the adverse biological effects for fertilization, embryo-larval development and biomarker responses of the mussel Perna perna. Results indicate that effects in fertilization rate and embryo-larval development were found in the order of mg.L-1. However, low concentrations of DCF (ng.L-1) significantly decreased the lysosomal membrane stability and COX activity, as well as triggered DNA damage, oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant defenses. Our results point to an environmental hazard at coastal ecosystems and suggest the need for improvements in the treatment of domestic wastewater aiming to reduce DCF concentrations, as well as regulation on current environmental legislation and monitoring of aquatic ecosystems.

AB The combination of adsorption and photocatalytic processes (adsorption/photocatalysis) was studied in the removal of the psychoactive substance caffeine from aqueous solutions at initial pollutant concentration in the range 6-25 mg/L. For this purpose, photoactive ZnO semiconductor was supported on commercial zeolite pellets (ZnO/ZEO) using wet impregnation method. From an engineering point of view, the use of pellets in a packed bed reactor permits to overcome the limitation of slurry systems that need the expensive post-treatment steps for the separation of particles from treated wastewater.
   X-ray diffraction, UV Vis reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements at -196 degrees C were performed to analyze the characteristics of the samples. In particular, it was found that ZnO nanoparticles are in wurtzite phase and incorporated in the mesoporous structure of the zeolite pellets. The final ZnO loading in ZnO/ZEO composites was found to be 6.1 wt%. The comparison between the adsorption and adsorption/photocalytic tests performed with ZnO/ZEO pellets showed that in dark conditions, the caffeine removal was 60% after 120 min of run time, while, in presence of UV light, the almost total removal of caffeine was achieved after the same treatment time. Moreover, also after several reuse cycles of adsorption/photocalytic tests, the removal rate of caffeine did not change, meaning that the photocatalytic oxidation process is able to degrade the caffeine adsorbed on ZnO/ZEO pellets surfaces resulting in the recovery of the adsorption capacity.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and phenolic utility chemicals in sewage water are considered to be an emerging problem because of increased use and observed adverse effects in the environment. The study provides knowledge on the removal efficiency of micropollutants with a range of physical and chemical properties in three commercially available onsite wastewater treatment facilities (OWTFs), tested on influent wastewater collected from 2500 person equivalents in Bildchen, Germany. A longer hydraulic retention time would in theory be expected to have a positive effect, and this study presents results for three different OWTFs in full-scale comparable tests under natural conditions. A range of 24 different pharmaceuticals, five phenols and three hormones were analyzed. Flow-proportional consecutive sampling was performed in order to determine the removal efficiency. Twenty-eight substances were detected in the effluent wastewater out of 32 substances included. Average effluent concentrations of Simvastatin, Estrone, Estradiol and Ethinylestradiol were above the indicative critical-effect concentration of pharmacological effect on fish in all facilities. Average effluent concentrations of both Diclofenac and Estradiol were higher than the Environmental Quality Standards applied in Sweden (190-240 times and 9-35 times respectively). The removal efficiency of micropollutants was high for substances with high logK(ow), which enhance the adsorption and removal with sludge. Low removal was observed for substances with low logK(ow) and acidic characteristics, and for substances with stabilizing elements of the chemical structure. Facilities that use activated sludge processes removed hormones more efficiently than facilities using trickling filter treatment technique. Moreover, longer hydraulic retention time increased the removal of pharmaceuticals, hormones, turbidity and total nitrogen. Removal of Caffeine, Ibuprofen, Estrone, Naproxen and Estradiol, was strongly correlated to the sludge and particles removal. Thus, the efficiency of the tested OWTFs could be improved by adjusting the technical methods and increasing the hydraulic retention time. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial degradation is an important pathway during the removal of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the effects of CW design, plant presence, and different plant species on the microbial community in CWs have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of L-arginine, L-phenyl-oalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations. These results provide useful information for optimizing the operational parameters of CWs to improve ibuprofen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of several classes of emerging contaminants (ECs) was assessed in the River Lambro basin, one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas of Italy. The study aims were to identify the main sources of ECs, quantify their amounts circulating in the water cycle, and study their fate in the aquatic environment. More than 80 ECs were selected among pharmaceuticals (PHARM), personal care products (PCPs), disinfectants (DIS), illicit drugs (IDs), perfluorinated compounds (PERF), alkylphenols and bisphenol A (Alk-BPA), and anthropogenic markers (AM). Specific analytical methods were developed for quantitative analysis based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ECs were measured in rivers upstream and downstream of the main city (Milan), and in untreated and treated wastewater from Milan to assess the contribution to river contamination, and in superficial and deep groundwater in the city area to study the relationship between river and groundwater contamination. Samples were collected in a two-year monitoring campaign. Almost all ECs were ubiquitous in untreated wastewater, at concentrations up to the mu g/L range, and the most abundant classes were PHARM and AM. Removals during different wastewater treatment processes were studied and the most stable substances were PHARM, PCPs and PERF. The mass loads increased for all the classes of ECs along the River Lambro basin. A mass balance was done in the river basin and allowed to identify the main sources of contamination, which were domestic, from treated or untreated wastewater, for PHARM, PCPs and IDs, mainly industrial for PERF, and both industrial and domestic for Alk-BPA. The study of AM helped to identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater. A substantial contribution of surface water to groundwater contamination was observed. This study improves the knowledge on occurrence, sources and fate of multiple classes of ECs in a highly urbanized area providing useful information to help the establishment of EU regulations for ECs.

AB The persistence of acesulfame (ACE) in wastewater treatment (and subsequently the aquatic environment) has led to its use as a marker substance for wastewater input into surface water and groundwater. However, ACE degradation of >85% during summer and autumn was observed in nine German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Annual removal performance was more stable in larger plants, enhanced by low biological oxygen demand and impeded by water temperatures below 10 degrees C. Literature data suggest that the potential to degrade ACE emerged in WWTPs around the year 2010. This development is ongoing, as illustrated by ACE content in the German rivers Elbe and Mulde: Between 2013 and 2016 the ACE mass load decreased by 70-80%. In enrichment cultures with ACE as sole carbon source the carbonaceous fraction of ACE was removed completely, indicating catabolic biotransformation and the inorganic compound sulfamic acid formed in quantitative amounts. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes suggests that several species are involved in ACE degradation, with proteobacterial species affiliated to Phyllobacteriaceae, Methylophilaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Pseudomonas becoming specifically enriched. ACE appears to be the first micropollutant for which the evolution of a catabolic pathway in WWTPs has been witnessed. It can yet only be speculated whether the emergence of ACE removal in WWTPs in different regions of the world is due to independent evolution or to global spreading of genes or adapted microorganisms.

AB This study investigates the removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in two sets of anoxic/anaerobic/ oxic sequencing batch reactors inoculated with either suspended or granular activated sludge. Continuously, for three months, 2 mu g/L SMX was spiked into the reactor feeds in a synthetic municipal wastewater with COD, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) of 400, 43 and 7 mg/L, respectively. The presence of SMX had no significant impact on treatment performance of the suspended and granular biomass. After 12 h of hydraulic retention time, SMX removal efficiencies of 84 and 73% were obtained for the granular and suspended biomass, respectively. Mixing without aeration did not remove SMX, confirming the insignificance of SMX removal via sorption. The pseudo-first order SMX removal rate constants in the granular and suspended biomass were 2.25 +/- 0.30 and 1.34 +/- 0.39 L/gVSS.d, respectively. The results suggest that granules with advantages such as elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration could be effective for the removal of this class of antibiotics.

AB Nitroaromatic Compounds are widely used in agricultural pesticides, pharmaceuticals, military explosives, and other applications. They enter the environment via manufacturing and municipal wastewater discharges and releases from agricultural and military operations. Because of their ubiquity and toxicity, they are considered an important class of environmental contaminants. Nitroaromatics are known to undergo reductive transformation to aromatic amines, and under aerobic conditions they are susceptible to coupling reactions which may lead to their irreversible incorporation into soil organic matter. However, there is also evidence of coupling reactions in the absence of oxygen between reduced intermediates of the insensitive munitions compound 2,4-dinitroanisole, leading to the formation of azo dimers. The formation of such products is a concern since they may be more toxic than the original nitroaromatic compounds. The objective of this research is to provide evidence of the anaerobic formation of azo coupling products. 4-Nitroanisole was used as a model compound and was spiked into incubations containing anaerobic granular sludge with H-2 as the electron donor. Using liquid chromatography, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, the formation of the azo dimer 4,4'-dimethoxyazobenzene was confirmed. However, due to the instability of the azo bond under the reducing conditions of our incubations, the azo dimer did not accumulate. Consequently, 4-aminoanisole was the major product formed in our experiment. Other minor suspected coupling products were also detected in our incubations. The results provide clear evidence for the temporal formation of at least one azo dimer in the anaerobic reduction of a model nitroaromatic compound. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sorption of 3 pharmaceuticals, which may exist in 4 different forms depending on the solution pH (irbesartan in cationic, neutral and anionic, fexofenadine in cationic, zwitter-ionic and anionic, and citalopram cationic and neutral), in seven different soils was studied. The measured sorption isotherms were described by Freundlich equations, and the sorption coefficients, K-F (for the fixed n exponent for each compound), were related to the soil properties to derive relationships for estimating the sorption coefficients from the soil properties (i.e., pedotransfer rules).
   The largest sorption was obtained for citalopram (average K-F value for n = 1 was 1838 cm(3) g(-1)) followed by fexofenadine (K-F = 35.1 cm(3/n) mu g(1-1/n) g(-1) n = 1.19) and irbesartan (K-F = 3.96 cm(3/n) mu g(1-1/n) g(-1), n = 1.10). The behavior of citalopram (CIT) in soils was different than the behaviors of irbesartan (IRB) and fexofenadine (FEX). Different trends were documented according to the correlation coefficients between the K-F values for different compounds (R-JRB,R-FEX = 0395, p-value<0.01; R-IRB,R-CIT = -0.835, p-value<0.05; R-FEX,R-CIT = 0.759, p-value<0.05) and by the reverse relationships between the KF values and soil properties in the pedotransfer functions. While the K-F value for citalopram was positively related to base cation saturation (BCS) or sorption complex saturation (SCS) and negatively correlated to the organic carbon content (Cox), the K-F values of irbesartan and fexofenadine were negatively related to BCS, SCS or the clay content and positively related to Cox. The best estimates were obtained by combining BCS and Cox for citalopram (R-2= 93.4), SCS and Cox for irbesartan (R-2 = 96.3), and clay content and Cox for fexofenadine (R-2 = 82.9).

AB Background: The presence of pharmaceutical substances and their residual in water resources is an important environmental concern. Azithromycin, an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of infectious diseases, is a pollutant agent in the wastewater. The aim of this study was to investigate azithromycin degradation in aqueous solution through ultrasonic process in the presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles as catalysts.
   Methods: Sonocatalytic experiments were performed at variable conditions including pH (38), temperature (20-60 degrees C), time (3-21 minutes), catalyst dosage (0.25-2 g/L), hydrogen peroxide concentration (15-100 mg/L) and initial azithromycin concentration (10-100 mg/L).
   Results: The optimum values for pH (3), temperature (40 degrees C), time (15 minutes), catalyst dosage (1 g/L), H2O2 concentration (50 mg/L) and initial azithromycin concentration (20 mg/L) were determined. The highest degradation efficiency of 98.4% was achieved after 15 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation under optimum condition.
   Conclusion: According to the results, ultrasonic irradiation is able to degrade azithromycin. In addition, ZnO and hydroxyl radical can successfully accelerate the reaction process in the shortest possible time.

AB Many countries are utilizing reclaimed waste-water for agriculture as water demands due to drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations. Unfortunately, wastewater often contains biologically active, pseudopersistant pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Runoff from agriculture and effluent from wastewater treatment plants also contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on an agricultural pest, the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer, Hemiptera: Aphididae). Second instar nymphs were transferred to bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) that were grown hydroponically. Treatment plants were spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations found in reclaimed wastewater. M. persicae displayed no differences in population growth or microbial community differences due to chemical treatments. Plants, however, displayed significant growth reduction in antibiotic and mixture treatments, specifically in wet root masses. Antibiotic treatment masses were significantly reduced in the total and root wet masses. Mixture treatments displayed an overall reduction in plant root wet mass. Our results suggest that the use of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation would not affect aphid populations, but could hinder or delay crop production.

AB Contamination of agricultural soils by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) resulting from the application of treated wastewater, biosolids and animal wastes constitutes a potential environmental risk in many countries. To date a handful of studies have considered the phytotoxicity of individual PPCPs in crop plants, however, little is known about the effect of PPCPs as mixtures at environmentally relevant levels. This study investigated the uptake and transport, physiological responses and detoxification of a mixture of 17 PPCPs in cucumber seedlings. All PPCPs were detected at higher concentrations in roots compared to leaves, with root activity inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At 5-50 mu g/L, the mature leaves exhibited burnt edges as well as a reduction in photosynthesis pigments. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation increased with increasing PPCP concentrations; and their contents were greater in roots than in leaves for all PPCP treatments. Enzymes involved in various functions, including oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) and xenobiotic metabolism (peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase), were elevated to different levels depending on the PPCP concentration. Glutathione content gradually increased in leaves, while a maxima occurred at 0.5 mu g L-1 PPCPs in roots, followed by a decrease thereafter. This study illustrated the complexity of phytotoxicity after exposure to PPCP mixtures, and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms likely responsible for the detoxification of PPCPs in higher plants.

AB One of the main pursuits, yet most difficult, in monitoring studies is to identify the sources of environmental pollution. In this study, we have identified health-care facilities from south European countries as an important source of pharmaceuticals in the environment. We have estimated that compounds consumed in by the elderly and released from effluents of senior residences can reach river waters at a concentration higher than 0.01 mu g/L, which is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) threshold for risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals in surface waters. This study has been based on five health institutions in Portugal, Spain, and France, with 52 to 130 beds. We have compiled the pharmaceuticals dispensed on a daily base and calculated the consumption rates. From 54.9 to 1801 g of pharmaceuticals are consumed daily, with laxatives, analgesics, antiepileptics, antibiotics, and antidiabetic agents being the main drug families administered. According to excretion rates, dilution in the sewerage system, and elimination in wastewater treatment plants, macrogol, metformin, paracetamol, acetylcysteine, amoxicillin, and gabapentin, among others, are expected to reach river waters. Finally, we discuss the risk management actions related to the discharge of pharmaceuticals from senior residences to surface waters.

AB In this study, avocado seed was successfully used as raw material for producing activated carbons by conventional pyrolysis. In order to determine the best condition to produce the activated carbons, a 2(2) full-factorial design of experiment (DOE) with three central points was employed by varying the temperature and time of pyrolysis. The two evaluated factors (temperature and time of pyrolysis) strongly influenced the S-BET, pore volumes, hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity ratio (HI) and functional groups values; both factors had a negative effect over S-BET, pore volumes and functional groups which means that increasing the values of factors leads to decrease of these responses; on the other hand, with regards to HI, both factors caused a positive effect which means that increasing their values, the HI has an enhancement over its values. The produced activated carbon exhibited high specific surface areas in the range of 1122-1584 m(2) g(-1). Surface characterisation revealed that avocado seed activated carbons (ASACs) have hydrophilic surfaces and have predominantly acidic groups on their surfaces. The prepared ASACs were employed in the adsorption of 25 emerging organic compounds such as 10 pharmaceuticals and 15 phenolic compounds which presented high uptake values for all emerging pollutants. It was observed that the activated carbon prepared at higher temperature of pyrolysis (700 degrees C), which generated less total functional groups and presented higher HI, was the activated carbon with higher sorption capacity for uptaking emerging organic contaminants. Based on results of this work, it is possible to conclude that avocado seed can be employed as a raw material to produce high surface area and very efficient activated carbons in relation to treatment of polluted waters with emerging organic pollutants.

AB The removal efficiency (RE) of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a major determinant of the environmental impact of these contaminants. However, RE data are available for only a few chemicals due to the time and cost required for conventional target analysis. In the present study, we applied non-target screening analysis to evaluate the RE of polar contaminants, by analyzing influent and effluent samples from a Swedish WWTP with direct injection UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS. Matrix effects were evaluated by spiking the samples with isotope-labeled standards of 40 polar contaminants. For 85% of the compounds, the matrix effects in the influent and effluent were not significantly different. Approximately 10000 compounds were detected in the wastewater, of which 319 were identified by using the online database mzCloud. Level 1 identification confidence was achieved for 31 compounds for which we had reference standards, and level 2 was achieved for the remainder. RE was calculated from the ratio of the peak areas in the influent and the effluent from the non-target analysis. Good agreement was found with RE determined from the target analysis of the target compounds. The method generated reliable estimates of RE for large numbers of contaminants with comparatively low effort and is foreseen to be particularly useful in applications where information on a large number of chemicals is needed.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a potent carcinogen associated with chloramination of wastewater and wastewater impacted drinking waters. Substantial effort has been expended to identify the precursors and mechanisms leading to NDMA formation. One of the major discoveries has been that molecules in the N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamine class, including the common pharmaceutical ranitidine, form NDMA in high yield during chloramination. Simultaneously, it was hypothesized that these precursors react with monochloramine, the dominant species in most chloramine mixtures, to form NDMA. This monochloramine hypothesis contradicts past mechanistic work with simple secondary amines, as well as practical experience showing that minimization dichloramine reduces the level of NDMA formation during wastewater reuse and drinking water treatment. In this work, we address the contradiction between practical experience and model precursor studies by showing that N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamines form NDMA chiefly via reactions with dichloramine, rather than monochloramine. We experimentally demonstrate substantially higher NDMA yields from dichloramination than from monochloramination of four N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamine compounds, including ranitidine, and computationally rationalize declining NDMA yields at large dichloramine doses, which may explain past results reporting low NDMA yields from dichloramination of ranitidine. These results provide support for NDMA control strategies currently under evaluation at wastewater reuse facilities.

AB Numerous man-made chemicals pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where biological and chemical treatments often result in the formation of a wide range of transformation products via reactions such as conjugation and alkylation. Such transformation products may come into contact with plants when treated wastewater and biosolids are used in agricultural production or when plants are used for mitigation purposes (e.g., treatment wetlands). Using the high-volume antimicrobial triclosan as a model compound, we showed that its primary transformation product in the WWTPs, methyl triclosan, was readily converted back to the parent in plants. Upon exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of methyl triclosan, triclosan was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana cells within 12 h, and the level of triclosan increased over time. The molar fraction of triclosan to methyl triclosan in the cells was estimated to be 0.17 at 144 h. When grown in a nutrient solution containing methyl triclosan, lettuce and carrot seedlings were also capable of transforming methyl triclosan back to triclosan after 4 days, with triclosan levels reaching >10 mu g/g in lettuce tissues and >3 mu g/g in carrot tissues. The back and forth conversions of triclosan in various environmental compartments effectively prolong its environmental persistence and exposure. Future assessment of this and other emerging contaminants should consider such interconversions to obtain a better understanding of their fate and risks.

AB Phytoremediation has been applied for treating an extensive range of environmental contaminants such as anti-diabetic drug metformin which is increasingly found as environmental contaminant. These contaminants are released to the environment via human and veterinary medicine and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, native plant capabilities for uptake of metformin from wastewater were investigated. Moreover, uptake rate of metformin was studied in two different concentrations of 20 and 50 mg l(-1) metformin solution by Amaranthus retroflexus, Ricinus communis, Brassica napus, Celosia cristata, Helianthus annuus and Phragmites australis. The results showed that after exposing to 20 mg l(-1) metformin solution 69.53 +/- 2.25% of metformin was remediated by H. annuus plants. Also in 50 mg l(-1) metformin solution, H. annuus plants showed the most remediation potential (65.7 +/- 1%). Metformin uptake is raised by B. napus and C. cristata plants along with increasing metformin concentration. There was no evidence of the presence of metformin in the roots and shoots of R. communis and C. cristata. The results also indicated that plants such as H. annuus can be a potential candidate for uptake of metformin from wastewater.

AB Sulfamethoxazole is an emergent contaminant in waters. It is an antibiotic for humans and animals that is difficult to biodegrade in drinking water and sewage treatment plants. As the most frequent sulfonamide, its treatment and removal is difficult. In its anionic form, it can be retained by ion exchange, although competition with other ions, especially salts present in natural and treated water, needs to be taken into consideration because of competition between the anions for the active sites of the resin. This work investigated the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from low saline waters. An anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP500, was used to remove SMX in synthetic solutions in the presence of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate salts. Multicomponent system solutions containing a fixed concentration of salts and different concentrations of SMX were tested in batch experiments. The presence of Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- suppressed the adsorption of SMX, especially the presence of SO42-, which showed the highest adsorption capacity onto the resin. Adsorption equilibrium constants were determined using the Langmuir isotherm and the extended Langmuir isotherm for multicomponent systems. The maximum adsorption capacity for the SMX and salts system was 105 mg/mL wet resin and the equilibrium constants 1.4 L/g SMX, 6 L/g NO3-, 9 L/g SO42-. Kinetics was analyzed using the pore diffusion model, getting a diffusivity value of 1.3 x 10 cm(2)/s for SMX. Finally, two operational load and elution cycles were carried out in a fixed-bed column using mixture synthetic solutions of SMX and salts to obtain the corresponding breakthrough curves. Results show that the resin is able to retain SMX despite the high competition of the other anions and can be regenerated completely after each cycle. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB We systematically investigated the occurrence and distribution of 93 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 5 artificial sweeteners (ASs) in surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin in south China. In surface water, 52 compounds were detected with median concentrations ranging from 0.06 ng/L to 504 ng/L, while in groundwater, 33 compounds were detected with concentrations up to 4580 ng/L for acesulfame. PPCPs and ASs were widely detected in the surface water and groundwater samples, which indicated contamination by domestic wastewater in the surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin. Temporal and spatial variations of the detected chemicals were observed in surfacewater. Acesulfame, sucralose and cyclamate can be used as wastewater indicators to imply contamination in groundwater caused by domestic wastewater due to their hydrophilicity, anthropogenic sources and ubiquity in ground water. Moreover, the detection of the readily degradable ASs, cyclamate, was a strong indication of untreated wastewater in groundwater. Sucralose was found to be a suitable wastewater indicator to reflect domestic wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater qualitatively and quantitatively, and it can be used to evaluate wastewater burden in surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin. The wastewater burden data from this survey implied serious contamination in surface water and groundwater by domestic wastewater at Shima River, a tributary of the Dongjiang River. The findings from this study suggest that the selected labile and conservative chemicals can be used as indication of wastewater contamination for aquatic environments qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB This study investigated the occurrence, removal and risk of 42 organic micropollutants (MPs), including 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 12 endocrine disrupting chemicals, in 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) distributed across China. The composition profiles of different MP categories in the influent, effluent, and excess sludge were explored and the aqueous removal efficiencies of MPs were determined. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacies of different wastewater treatment processes in eliminating MPs. Results indicate that different MP categories showed quite similar distributions among the studied WWTPs, with phenolic estrogenic compounds (PEs), macrolides, and fluoroquinolones being always dominant in the influent, effluent and excess sludge. Tetracyclines, bezafibrate, caffeine, steroid estrogens, and PEs showed high and stable aqueous removal efficiencies, whereas other MPs showed considerably varied aqueous removal efficiencies. Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process combined with a moving-bed biofilm reactor achieved the highest aqueous removal of MPs among various secondary treatment processes. A combined process consisting of ultrafiltration, ozonation and CIO2 disinfection resulted in the highest removal of MPs among the tertiary treatment processes. Sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, estrone, and bisphenol A in the effluent, as well as beta-estradiol 3-sulfate in the excess sludge could pose high risks. This study draws an overall picture about the current status of MPs in WWTPs across China and provides useful information for better control of the risks associated with MPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The feasibility of using activated carbon/chitosan-poly (vinyl alcohol) biocomposites (AC/CHT-PVA) as an adsorbent for removal of naproxen from a factory wastewater in Tuzla, Istanbul/Turkey was studied in the presented study. The biocomposites were synthesized with different AC: CHT-PVA ratios of 1.0; 2.0 and 3.0 (w/w). The adsorbent materials were characterized by FT-IR, SEM and TGA analysis. When AC was embedded into CHT-PVA matrix, the naproxen removal performance increased from 41.01% to 97.03%. The optimal pH for maximum adsorption was found as 7.0. Equilibrium isotherms for the naproxen adsorption onto AC/CHT-PVA biocomposite were measured experimentally. The Langmuir model was fitted to the equilibrium data better than The Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Raduskevich isotherm models. The mono layer adsorption capacity of AC/CHT-PVA: 3.0 for naproxen was found to be 12.24 mg/g at 298 K. According to the kinetics results, the equilibrium time of AC/CHT-PVA biocomposites was found 100 min and it was indicated that the adsorption follows the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The process was favorable and spontaneous. The thermodynamic parameters, Delta G degrees, Delta S degrees and Delta H degrees were calculated and the enthalpy of adsorption (Delta H degrees) was found positive for all biocomposites supported the endothermic nature of adsorption reactions.

AB Newly observed presence of 'emerging contaminants', defined also Compounds of Emerging Concern, chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are poorly understood has been amply reported in wastewater and aquatic environments. 'Conventional' water pollutants have been described for decades and their impact on human health and the environment are known; effective technologies for their removal are well established. This is not the case for most emerging contaminants: no effective removal technologies have been discovered to date, to simultaneously remove all of the concerned contaminants, even though some techniques have been demonstrated to remove some contaminants to a certain extent. Radiation processing using electron beam (EB) accelerators and gamma irradiators has shown promising results in many water-related applications. Radiation/EB processing is an additive-free process using short lived reactive species formed during radiolysis of water for decomposition of pollutants. Isolated studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of radiation, alone or in combination with other treatments, in the decomposition of refractory organic compounds in aqueous solutions and in the removal or inactivation, of microorganisms and parasites. This review paper on this specific technology summarizes results of reported applications.

AB Contamination of water bodies by pharmaceuticals has recently received much attention. Even at low concentration, pharmaceuticals can disrupt the natural hormonal responses (endocrine disruptors) leading to a multitude of toxicological effects in aquatic life. In the current study, the estrogenic effect of selected pharmaceuticals was evaluated using the E-Screen assay, which quantifies the cell proliferation of estrogen responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells with respect to 17 beta-estradiol. In this assay, 17-alpha ethinylestradiol and acetaminophen were found to yield a strong and weak estrogenic response, respectively, while diclofenac and carbamazepine caused antagonistic effect. Validity of the in vitro assay was confirmed when these pharmaceuticals did not generate any response in the estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Based on the level of residual pharmaceuticals reported in wastewater effluents in Mumbai, the results of this study indicate that estrogenic effects may be expected in wastewater effluents.

AB Sorptive removal of six phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-butylphenol (4tBP) by functionalized biochar (fBC) through competitive interactions was investigated. EDC sorption was pH dependent with the maximum sorption at pH 3.0-3.5 due to hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions as the principal sorptive mechanism. Sorption isotherm of the EDCs was fitted to the Langmuir model. Sorption capacities and distribution coefficient values followed the order E1 > E2 >= EE2 > BPA > 4tBP > E3. The findings suggested that EDC sorption occurred mainly through pseudo-second order and external mass transfer diffusion processes, by forming H-bonds along with pi-pi electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions at different pH. The complete removal of similar to 500 mu g L-1 of each EDC from different water decreased in the order: deionised water > membrane bioreactor (MBR) sewage effluent > synthetic wastewater. The presence of sodium lauryl sulphonate and acacia gum in synthetic wastewater significantly suppressed sorption affinity of EDCs by 38-50%, hence requiring more fBC to maintain removal efficacy.

AB The behavior of 10 micropollutants, i.e. four estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17a-ethynylestradiol), carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), triclosan, oxybenzone, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A, was investigated in a typical domestic wastewater treatment plant. LC-MS and yeast estrogen screen bioassay were used to study the changes in micropollutants and estrogenicity across unit processes in the treatment system. Primary treatment via sedimentation showed that only 4-nonylphenol was removed, but led to no significant change in estrogenicity. Secondary treatment by the biological nitrification-dentrification process showed complete removal of oxybenzone and partial removal of the estrogens, which led to a decrease in estrogenic activity from 80 to 48 ng/L as estradiol equivalent (EEq). Ultraviolet treatment completely degraded the estrogens and triclosan, but failed to lower the concentrations of bisphenol A, SMX, and CBZ; a decrease in estrogenic activity from 48 to 5 ng/L EEq across the unit, a value that was only slightly larger than the observed EEq of 1 ng/L for the deionized control. Similarly, the anaerobic digestion of sludge completely degraded estrogens, oxybenzone, and SMX, but had no impact on bisphenol A, triclosan, and CBZ. The study emphasises the need to complement chemical analyses with estrogenic bioassays to evaluate the efficacy of waste water treatment plants.

AB This study provides an alternative solution for the bioremediation of a recalcitrant pharmaceutical micropollutant. Clofibric acid (CLA) was chosen as target molecule, because of its environmental persistence and resistance to wastewater treatment technologies. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a phenol-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from the activated sludge to degrade CLA. In order to evaluate the effect of acclimation process with glucose as carbon co-substrate, two protocols were performed, in which the transfer of the inoculum is carried out either in the exponential growth phase or in the decline phase. The results showed a removal efficiency of CLA of 35% when cells in the decline phase were used for inoculation. In contrast, a very low removal yield (10%) was achieved when cells harvested in the exponential phase were used as inoculum. This work is the first one reporting on the capability of this bacterium to remove this drug. The obtained data showed that the isolated strain is able to degrade target molecule and might be a promising agent for the elimination of this refractory compound.

AB The antibiotic-resistance profiles of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from four different sampling sites of the hospital wastewater at Lucknow city were evaluated. Of the 200 Gram-negative bacterial isolates tested, marked antibiotic resistances (over 90%) were observed for amoxicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and penicillin depending upon the sampling sites. All Gram-negative bacterial isolates also showed multiple resistance patterns (2-13 antibiotics) in different combinations of antibiotics. The MAR index ranges were found (0.01-0.86) indicating the high risk of environmental contamination. The findings indicated that pollution of aquatic environments from different sources of the city may have a significant contribution to the emergence and dissemination of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria as well as other pathogenic bacteria in the hospital wastewater. This overuse of antibiotics as well as other pharmaceuticals in the hospital and their introduction into the aquatic environment may have a potential public health risk.

AB This study surveyed the hospital wastewater characters focusing on antibiotic contamination in seven hospitals in Bangkok. It detected 19 antibiotics of which the high-frequent detection were quinolones such as ofloxacin + levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin including sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared the highest concentrations of 12.11 and 9.60 mu g/L, respectively. Most antibiotic concentrations in the wastewaters of the studied hospitals gave a good correlation (r(2) = 0.77-0.99) to the amount of usage. In this study, batch acute toxicity tests were performed to assess the toxicity of hospital wastewater on mixed liquor, freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus quadricauda), and microcrustacean (Moina macrocopa). The hospital wastewaters could inhibit the mixed liquor growth and gave similar toxic levels among test species: algae and microcrustacean (9.81-13.63 and 2.62-3.09 TU, respectively). The conventional activated sludge (CAS) and rotating biological contactor (RBC) could remove fluoroquinolones and tetracycline via biomass adsorption. After treatment, most of treatment could reduce the toxicity. Nevertheless, the effluent gave slight toxicity on some test species which might be caused from chlorination and a common toxicant (NH3-N).

AB Parabens are widely used as antimicrobial and preservatives in pharmaceutical and personal care products and are continuously reaching the water streams. Conventional wastewater treatments are proven inefficient on the removal of this kind of contaminants from wastewater. Therefore, catalytic ozonation appears as a suitable option, due to the oxidant power of ozone and its high capacity of hydroxyl radical generation in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The main drawback of catalytic ozonation is related with the choice of stable and active catalysts at low cost. On this way, two volcanic rocks were tested to enhance the removal of a mixture of parabens by ozonation, improving their degradation. Indeed, catalytic ozonation with volcanic rock allowed total paraben degradation using a transferred ozone dose (TOD) of 55 mg/L which corresponds to a reduction of about threefold the amount of TOD comparatively with single ozonation (170 mg/L of TOD). Due to the presence of semiconductors on volcanic rock composition, the effect of UVA irradiation on paraben degradation was analyzed. The neutral and basic conditions enhanced catalytic ozonation comparatively to acid conditions. Higher pH values allowed a total methylparaben degradation with 35 mg O-3/L, whereas for low pH values, 55 mg O-3/L was required. The use of a radical scavenger proven that hydroxyl radicals are the main responsible for paraben degradation with catalytic ozonation. This was confirmed through the analysis of the by-products, where 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and hydroquinone were quantified.

AB This study investigated the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions supported on chemically treated fly ash. The coal fly ash was supplied by the electric power station in Krakow, Poland. There are plenty of studies showing the utilization of fly ash as a low-cost adsorbent for wastewater containing heavy metals or dyes. Adsorption and immobilization of pharmaceuticals and personal care products on fly ash is a relatively new method but it is a very promising one. In this study, the adsorptive removal of diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, bezafibrate, bisphenol A, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol by HCl- and NaOH-treated fly ash was assessed. Chemical treatment of fly ash changed structures of particles and enhanced specific surface areas. HCl-treated fly ash was characterized by the highest BET specific surface area 47.9 m(2) g(-1) and unburned carbon content 8.1%. Isotherms for all compounds except for 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and estriol (E3) were linear. Higher linear regression coefficients (R (2)) obtained for isotherms of EE2 and E3 show that the Freundlich model better describes their sorption. Adsorption coefficients K (d) varied between 109.5 (L kg(-1)) for bisphenol A and 471.5 (L kg(-1)) for bezafibrate. Freundlich constants (K (F)) for EE2 and E3 were 62.3 and 119.9 (A mu g(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1)), respectively. Acid treatment of fly ash increased adsorption of diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, bezafibrate and bisphenol A. Comparison of the octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K (OW)) with the partitioning coefficients normalized on unburned carbon content (log K (UC)) revealed similarities but no strong correlation. The increasing of unburned carbon increased sorption of compounds to fly ash.

AB The functionalized nano-clay composite adsorbent was prepared, and its properties were characterized using FT-IR, XRD and SEM techniques. The synthesized nano-clay composite was studied with regard to its capacity to remove ibuprofen under different adsorption conditions such as varying pH levels (5-9), initial ibuprofen concentrations (3, 5 and 10 mg L-1), contact time, and the amount of adsorbent (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 g). In order to evaluate the nanocomposite adsorption capacity, the adsorption results were assessed using nine isotherm models. The results showed that the optimum adsorption pH was 6 and that an increase or decrease in the pH reduced the adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was fast and reached equilibrium after 120 min. The maximum efficacy of ibuprofen removal was approximately 95.2%, with 1 g of adsorbent, 10 mg L-1 initial concentration of ibuprofen, 120 min contact time and pH = 6. The optimal adsorption isotherm models were the Freundlich, Fritz-Schlunder, Redlich-Peterson, Radke-Prausnitz, Sip, Toth and Khan models. In addition, four adsorption kinetic models were employed for adsorption system evaluation under a variety of experimental conditions. The kinetic data illustrated that the process is very fast, and the reaction followed the Elovich kinetic model. Therefore, this nano-clay composite can be used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of ibuprofen from aqueous solutions, such as water and wastewater.

AB Amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic to combat bacterial infections. However, this drug can cause serious problems when discarded in waterways due to its great bioaccumulation potential. This compound can be treated via advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are capable of converting amoxicillin into carbon dioxide and water. In this context, the use of ozone as an oxidizer has excelled in amoxicillin degradation. This paper aims at treating a synthetic solution of amoxicillin (0.1 g L-1) in a reactor with ozone bubbling. A Design of Experiment (DoE) with a response surface known as Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the treatment process. In addition, a Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method was used in the construction of a Pareto boundary chart. Results after 1-h treatment showed a reduction of 53% of the initial organic matter from a designed model using factors, such as pH, ozone generator power, and O-3 flow. A model was built from the CCD with score of 0.9929. Thus, the model was able to represent the real scenario with confidence.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment may be decomposed by abiotic and biotic factors. Photodegradation is the most investigated abiotic process, as it occurs in the natural environment and may be applied in wastewater treatment technology. Although pharmaceuticals are detected in effluents and surface water in a mixture, the photodegradation process is mainly evaluated with single compounds. The photodegradation of fluoxetine (FLU) and fluvoxamine (FLX) in the presence of diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS) was investigated with HPLC and bioassay. FLU did not degrade under UV-Vis irradiation in SunTest CPS+ either with or without the tested additives, although small amounts of desmethyl fluoxetine and 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol were formed. In contrast, during irradiation, FLX isomerized to cis-FLX. This process was enhanced by DCF and TCS, but to a lesser degree than by humic acids. Thus, the presence and composition of the matrix should be considered in the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. As the toxicity of the tested solutions depended only on the concentration of the tested drugs, it was suggested that the biological activity of the photodegradation products was lower than that of the parent compounds.

AB Southern Brazil is an agricultural region that is experiencing strong growth in both cereal and animal production. The intensification of agricultural practices, as well as the growing urbanization in this region, also generates strong anthropogenic pressures on the aquatic environment. In Brazil, the lack of sewage treatment and the wide use of waste (liquid or solid) for the fertilization of soils are likely to favor the spread of pharmaceuticals in the surrounding environment. Considering the benefits of the determination of anthropogenic markers in the environment, the study aimed to monitor the presence of carbamazepine (CBZ) and sucralose (SCR) in the Guapore River, representative of a southern Brazilian rural watershed. Both carbamazepine and sucralose are measured in water by polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) (CBZ: lower than limit of detection (<LOD) to 746 mu g g(-1) and SCR:<LOD) and in the river biofilms (CBZ: <LOD to 3.6 ng g(-1) and SCR: <LOD to 139.3 ng g(-1)) to give an overview of the level of aquatic contamination. The use of sucralose and carbamazepine as tracers of anthropogenic activity proved promising, as was the use of biofilms and POCIS as samplers. Biofilm and POCIS are two complementary techniques. Biofilms are able to identify contaminated environment sites by the capture of SCR as a human marker and POCIS are capable to capture the CBZ compounds with higher efficiency in polluted sites than biofilms.

AB A framework is presented that is intended to facilitate the evaluation of potential aquatic ecological risks resulting from discharges of down-the-drain chemicals. A scenario is presented using representatives of many of the types of chemicals that are treated domestically. Predicted environmental chemical concentrations are based on reported loading rates and routine removal rates for 3 types of treatment: trickling filter, activated sludge secondary treatment, and activated sludge plus advanced oxidation process as well as instream effluent dilution. In tier I, predicted effluent concentrations were compared with the lowest predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) obtained from the literature using safety factors as needed. A cumulative risk characterization ratio (cumRCR) <1.0 indicates that risk is unlikely and no further action is needed. Otherwise, a tier 2 assessment is used, in which PNECs are based on trophic level. If tier 2 indicates a possible risk, then a retrospective assessment is recommended. In tier 1, the cumRCR was >1.0 for all 3 treatment types in our scenario, even though no chemical exceeded a hazard quotient of 1.0 in activated sludge or advanced oxidation process. In tier 2, activated sludge yielded a lower cumRCR than trickling filter because of higher removal rates, and the cumRCR in the advanced oxidation process was <<1.0. Based on the maximum cumulative risk ratio (MCR), more than one-third of the predicted risk was accounted for by one chemical, and at least 90% was accounted for by 3 chemicals, indicating that few chemicals influenced the mixture risk in our scenario. We show how a retrospective assessment can test whether certain chemicals hypothesized as potential drivers in the prospective assessment could have, or are having, deleterious effects on aquatic life.

AB A facile photoluminescent probe for picric acid (PA) detection was developed using photoluminescent carbon nanodots (C-dots), which was obtained from a traditional Chinese medicinal material Sichuan Bergamot via a one-step hydrothermal method for the first time. The as-prepared photoluminescent C-dots show favorable blue color photoluminescence with the maximum emission at 440 nm. It has been successfully applied as a photoluminescent probe for the detection of PA. This photoluminescent probe exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity toward PA from 0.4 mu M to 80 mu M with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9987. The limit of detection (LOD) for PA is 82 nM. Furthermore, the proposed C-dots for photoluminescent probe detection of PA in real water samples (river water, refinery wastewater and pharmaceutical factory wastewater) by adding 5 mu M and 20 mu M PA with satisfactory recoveries from 99.5% to 101.5%. These novel photoluminescent C-dots is promising in environmental analysis of PA.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer was developed and evaluated for selective determination of metronidazole (MNZ) in wastewater. This was achieved by using sodium methacrylate as monomer, toluene as porogen, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker, azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator and metronidazole as template molecule to generate the selectivity of the polymer for the compound, as well as non-imprinted polymers were synthesized. Two different polymerization approaches were used, bulk and emulsion and the polymers obtained by emulsion presented higher retention percentages the MIP 2-M presented the higher retention (83%). The performed method, was validated in fortified water, showing linearity from 10 up to 1000 ng/mL; limit of detection and quantification for compound were between 3 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Finally, the method was applied in samples of a wastewater treatment plant in the city of San Luis Potosi, M,xico, and the concentrations of MNZ in these samples were 84.1-114 ng/mL.

AB Municipal biosolids provide organic matter to soil, and nutrients essential for crop growth. Some contaminants of standing and emerging concern such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, brominated flame retardants, and highly persistent perfluoroalkyl acids are not fully removed in the waste treatment process; and thus, they are often found in resultant biosolids applied to land. This paper provides an overview of selected research led by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on monitoring and predicting the fate and transport of these noted contaminants in field soil-hydrological environments following land applications of dewatered and liquid municipal biosolids. Different land application practices were examined in the context of their potential to reduce environmental exposure. Field studies of liquid/slurry municipal biosolids demonstrated that in macroporous soils contaminants of all types can rapidly reach shallow groundwater and tile drainage systems. Nevertheless, loads of contaminants in subsurface (tile) drainage can be significantly reduced if an aeration-based pre-tillage is employed. For dewatered municipal biosolids, directly injecting biosolids into subsoil had an indifferent effect upon water contamination, when compared with traditional surface application methods. For very high single applications of dewatered municipal biosolids to land, compounds such as the antifungal miconazole, the PBDE congener BDE 209, and perfluorooctanoic acids, for example, can persist in biosolid aggregates. Yet, for modestly macroporous soils, most of these compounds will not enter critical subsurface water receptors.

AB In this study, ASM41 (as-synthesised MCM-41), MCM-41, MCM-41 encapsulated with graphene oxide (MCM-41-GO) and reduced graphene oxide (MCM-41-G) were fabricated and utilized in the remediation of acetaminophen and aspirin from water. A surfactant template (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) was added to ASM41 to make it more hydrophobic and its effects on the remediation of acetaminophen and aspirin from wastewater was studied. To further improve the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, MCM-41 was encapsulated with GO and G which also aided in easy separation of the adsorbent from the aqueous solution. Comparative studies of the adsorption of acetaminophen and aspirin on all four adsorbents were investigated. Batch adsorption studies of acetaminophen and aspirin were carried out to determine the effects of pH, initial concentration, time and adsorbent dose. Adsorption mechanism was through EDA, pi-pi interactions, and hydrophobic effects. Data from sorption kinetics showed ASM41 had the highest q(m) value for aspirin (909.1 mg/g) and MCM-41-G had the highest qm value for acetaminophen (555.6 mg/g). The significant adsorption by ASM41 can be attributed to increased hydrophobicity due to the retention of the surfactant template. Thermodynamic studies revealed the adsorption process as spontaneous and exothermic. Desorption studies revealed that adsorbents could be regenerated and reused for adsorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There are over 40,000 chemical compounds registered for use in Australia, and only a handful are monitored in the aquatic receiving environments. Their effects on fish species in Australia are largely unknown. Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were sampled from six river sites in Southeast Queensland identified as at risk from a range of pollutants. The sites selected were downstream of a wastewater treatment plant discharge, a landfill, two agricultural areas, and two sites in undeveloped reaches within or downstream of protected lands (national parks). Vitellogenin analysis, histopathology of liver, kidney and gonads, morphology of the gonopodium, and chemical body burden were measured to characterize fish health. Concentrations of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in water were analyzed by in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis. Estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic, progestagenic and anti-progestagenic activities and TrOCs were detected in multiple water samples. Several active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), industrial compounds, pesticides and other endocrine active compounds were detected in fish carcasses at all sites, ranging from <4-4700 ng/g wet weight, including the two undeveloped sites. While vitellogenin protein was slightly increased in fish from two of the six sites, the presence of micropollutants did not cause overt sexual endocrine disruption in mosquitofish (i.e., no abnormal gonads or gonopodia). A correlation between lipid accumulation in the liver with total body burden warrants further investigation to determine if exposure to low concentrations of TrOCs can affect fish health and increase stress on organs such as the liver and kidneys via other mechanisms, including disruption of non-sexual endocrine axes involved in lipid regulation and metabolism.

AB In this study, the applicability of UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to serve as reliable surrogates to predict acute toxicity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) wastewater was investigated. The medicine residues and VFAs were identified as main components of the TCM wastewater, and their individual and joint toxicity assays were operated with luminescent bacteria. The median effective concentration (EC50) values of medicine residues and VFAs were in the range of 26.46 -165.55 mg/L and 11.45-20.58 g/L, respectively. The joint toxicity action modes of medicine residues, VFAs and medicine residues-VFAs were identified as additive, additive and synergistic respectively. UV254 and VFAs showed better correlations with acute toxicity according to the correlation analysis, compared with other conventional parameters. The regression model was a good fit for toxic unit (TU50) as a function of UV254 and VFAs according to the stepwise regression method (adjusted R-2 = 0.836). Validation of the model to the pilot-scale samples provided satisfactory prediction results in the influent and hydrolysis acidification effluent samples tests, but for EGSB effluent and final effluent samples, the model needed further optimization. Surrogates prediction using UV254 and VFAs provided a valuable and cost saving tool for rapid or on-line monitoring of acute toxicity of TCM wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of veterinary antibiotic removal from wastewater using an electrocoagulation method.
   The removal efficiency of ampicillin, doxycycline, sulfathiazole and tylosin; the antibiotic degradation degree after electrolysis; and the toxicity and qualitative composition of antibiotic solutions after electrocoagulation were determined in the experiments.
   HPLC-QTOF was used for quantitative and qualitative determination. The eco-toxicity was assessed using the MARA (R) assay.
   After electrocoagulation, the concentration of ampicillin, doxycycline, sulfathiazole and tylosin in wastewater decreased 3.6 +/- 3.2%, similar to 100%, 3.3 +/- 0.4% and 3.1 +/- 0.3%, respectively. Doxycycline was the only antibiotic effectively removed from wastewater during electrocoagulation. Simultaneously, part of this antibiotic underwent oxidative degradation. As a result of this process, the eco-toxicity in the reaction environment decreased. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Manganese dioxides are ubiquitous in natural waters, soils, and sediments and play an important role in oxidative transformation of organic pollutants. This work presents the kinetics of the oxidation of selected beta-blockers, betaxolol, metoprolol, and atenolol by birnessite (delta-MnO2) as a function of concentration of the beta-blocker, dosage of delta-MnO2, and solution pH. The values of pseudo-first-order rate constants (k(obs)) of beta-blockers decreased in the order betaxolol > atenolol > metoprolol, which was positively correlated with their acid dissociation constants (K-a). Effect of series of metal ions (Fe3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) on the degradation of beta-blockers by delta-MnO2 was systematically examined. All of these metal ions inhibited the oxidation reaction under the same constant ionic strength. The inhibition efficiency was positively correlated with the logarithm of stability constant of metal ions in aqueous solution (logK(MeOH)). By LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses, the oxidation of beta-blockers primarily involved hydroxylation and cleavage of the parent molecules to the short branched chain compounds. An electron transfer mechanism for the oxidation of beta-blockers by delta-MnO2 was proposed. The oxidation was initiated by the electron transfer from the nonbonding electrons on nitrogen (N-electrons) of beta-blockers to delta-MnO2, followed by transformation of radical intermediates. These findings will help to understand the oxidation processes of beta-blockers and predict the effect of metal ions on the removal of pollutants by delta-MnO2 in the environment.

AB Sludge recycled in agriculture may bring antibiotics into cropped soils. The nature, total amount, and availability of the antibiotics in soil partly depend on the sludge treatments. Our paper compares the fate of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) residues between soils incubated with the same sludge but submitted to different processes before being added in soil.
   The fate of C-14-AC-SMX residues was studied in mixtures of soil and sludges at different treatment levels: 1) activated and 2) centrifuged sludges, both enriched with C-14-AC-SMX, and 3) limed and 4) heat dried sludges obtained by treating the previously contaminated centrifuged sludge. The evolution of the extractability of C-14 residues (CaCl2, methanol) and their mineralization were followed during 119 days.
   More than 80% of the initial C-14-activity was no longer extractable after 14 days, except in soil with limed sludge. Liming and drying the centrifuged sludge decreased the mineralized C-14 fraction from 5.7-6.4% to 1.2-1.8% and consequently, the corresponding soils contained more C-14 residues after 119 days. Although C-14 residues were more CaCl2-extractable in soil with limed sludge, they seemed to be poorly bioavailable for biodegradation. For all solid sludges, the mineralization rate of C-14-AC-SMX residues was strongly correlated to that of sludge organic carbon, with a coefficient three times lower for the limed and dried sludges than for the centrifuged sludge after 14 days.

AB Concern is growing over contamination of the environment with artificial sweeteners (ASWs) because of their widespread existence in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To evaluate ASWs removal and the effect on activated sludge, acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharin (SAC) were introduced individually or in mixture to sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) in environmentally relevant concentrations (100 ppb) for 100 days. Comparisons between ACE removal in a full-scale WWTP and in lab-scale SBRs were conducted. Results showed that CYC and SAC were completely removed, whereas SUC was persistent. However, ACE removal in lab-scale SBRs was significantly greater than in the full-scale WWTP. In SBRs, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal appeared unchanged after adding ASWs (p > 0.05). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) declined significantly (p < 0.05). The mixed ASWs had more evident effects than the individual ASWs. Microbial community analyses revealed that Proteobacteria decreased obviously, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria were enriched with the addition of ASWs. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated ACE had a greater impact on activated sludge than the other ASWs.

AB Ozone is an effective disinfectant against all types of waterborne pathogens. However, accurate and quantitative kinetic data regarding virus inactivation by ozone are scarce, because of the experimental challenges associated with the high reactivity of ozone toward viruses. Here, we established an experimental batch system that allows tailoring and quantifying of very low ozone exposures and simultaneously measuring virus inactivation. Second-order ozone inactivation rate constants (k(O3-virus)) of five enteric viruses [laboratory and two environmental strains of coxsackievirus B5 (CVF, CVEnv1, and CVEnv2), human adenovirus (HAdV), and echovirus 11 (EV)] and four bacteriophages (MS2, Q beta, T4, and Phi 174) were measured in buffered solutions. The k(O3-virus) values of all tested viruses ranged from 4.5 x 10(5) to 3.3 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1). For MS2, k(O3-MS2) depended only weakly on temperature (2-22 degrees C; E-a = 22.2 kJ mol(-1)) and pH (6.5-8.5), with an increase in k(O3-MS2) with increasing pH. The susceptibility of the selected viruses toward ozone decreases in the following order: Q beta > CVEnv2 > EV approximate to MS2 > Phi 174 approximate to T4 > HAdV > CVF approximate to CVEnv1. On the basis of the measured k(O3-Virus) and typical ozone exposures applied in water and wastewater treatment, we conclude that ozone is a highly effective disinfectant for virus control.

AB Caffeine, a widely found component in food and pharmaceuticals, is harmful to ecosystem when discharged into the environment because of its non-eco-friendly nature and recalcitrant properties. Complete caffeine degradation by methanogenesis was successful for the first time in a man-made bioreactor. We confirmed the success through continuously operating a bioreactor, testing the methane potential and determining the kinetic behaviour. In the continuous operation, an 87.5 +/- 5.3% removal efficiency of caffeine was observed using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor for the digestion of coffee processing wastewater in the long-term process. In methane potential tests with caffeine as the sole substrate, the complete conversion from caffeine to CH4 was achieved in a caffeine-rich environment with a caffeine concentration up to 2000 mg/L. We have proposed and confirmed a reaction equation for the caffeine degradation by methanogenesis based on the stoichiometric relationship between the degraded caffeine and the increased end-products: CH4, NH4+-N and CO2. In the kinetic behaviour experiment, the regular monitoring the residual caffeine and the end-products indicated that methanogenic degradation of caffeine clearly includes two major steps: caffeine converting to intermediates and the intermediates converting to CH4. The major accumulated intermediates should be hydrolysis products and the process of hydrolysis products converting to volatile fatty acids was identified to be the rate-limiting step of caffeine degradation. This work provided a new thought to microbial caffeine degradation and will be useful in developing innovative technology for bioenergy harvest at the same time of decaffeination.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compound residues in water bodies is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Various pharmaceuticals have been detected in raw municipal wastewaters, after wastewater treatment plant processes, and even in drinking water. Many common pharmaceuticals are bio-accumulating and they can have a harmful impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   In this work, pulsed corona discharge technology (PCD) is studied as a potential method for antibiotic compounds abatement. Two antibiotics, amoxicillin and doxycycline, were chosen as test pharmaceutical compounds. The aim of the study was to investigate the transformation kinetics of binary solutions (water single antibiotic compound) and ternary solutions (water - two antibiotic compounds) of the compounds and to optimize operational parameters for improved oxidation performance. Ternary solutions were investigated to obtain data on transformation kinetics when two competing pharmaceutical molecules are present in the solution. The experiments showed that reactions of doxycycline oxidation are always first order reactions. Reaction of amoxicillin oxidation has second order in the case of experiments with binary solution in alkaline medium. In other cases, it has first order. The transformation products formed were identified and monitored based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometer analysis. OH-amoxicillin, amoxicillin pencilloic acid, OH-doxycycline and 2-OH-doxycycline had the largest peaks areas. All studied compounds and all transformation products can be easily oxidized by PCD. Approximately 1 kWh/m(3) and 0.5 kWh/m(3) delivered energy is enough for oxidation of great part of amoxicillin and doxycycline respectively. Low frequency, 50 pps, and high (pH = 12) are preferable for oxidation of both antibiotics from the energy consumption point of view.

AB Degradation and mineralization of ibuprofen (IBU) were investigated using Ultraviolet (UV) Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in TiO2 photocatalysis. Samples of ultrapure water (UP) and a secondary treated effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), both spiked with IBU, as well as a highly concentrated IBU (230 mg L-1) pharmaceutical industry wastewater (PIWW), were tested in the TiO2/UV-LED system. Three operating parameters, namely, pH, catalyst load and number of LEDs were optimized. The process efficiency was evaluated in terms of IBU removal using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Additionally, the mineralization was investigated by determining the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. The chemical structures of transformation products were proposed based on the data obtained using liquid chromatography with a high resolution mass spectrometer ion trap/time-of-flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). A possible pathway of IBU degradation was accordingly suggested. Bioassays were performed using the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri to evaluate the potential acute toxicity of original and treated wastewaters. TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis was efficient to remove IBU from UP and from PIWW, and less efficient in treating the wastewater from the municipal WWTP. The acute toxicity decreased by ca. 40% after treatment, regardless of the studied matrix.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is seen as a very promising technology to remove micropollutants (MPs) from wastewater. Unfortunately this process tends to produce a highly saline concentrate stream, as commercial NF membranes retain both the MPs and most of the ions. The high salinity makes subsequent degradation of the MPs in a bioreactor very difficult. The main goal of this study is to prepare and study a NF membrane that combines a low salt rejection with a high MPs rejection for the treatment of secondary-treated municipal wastewater. This membrane was prepared using layer by layer (LbL) deposition of the weak polycation poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and the weak polyanion poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), on the surface of a hollow fiber dense ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. The ionic strength of the coating solutions was varied and properties of the formed polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), such as hydration, hydrophilicity, hydraulic resistance and ions retention were studied. Subsequently we tested the apparent and steady state rejection of MPs from synthetic wastewater under cross-flow conditions. The synthetic wastewater contained the MPs Diclofenac, Naproxen, Ibuprofen and 4n-Nonylphenol, all under relevant concentrations (0.5-40 mu g/L, depending on the MP). PEMs prepared at lower ionic strength showed a lower hydration and consequently a better retention of MPs than PEMs prepared at higher ionic strengths. A strong relationship between the apparent rejection of MPs and their hydrophobicity was observed, likely due to adsorption of the more hydrophobic MPs to the membrane surface. Once saturated (steady state), the molecular size of the MPs showed the best correlation with their rejection, indicating rejection on the basis of size exclusion. In contrast to available commercial NF membranes with both high salt and MP rejection, we have prepared an unique membrane with a very low NaCl retention (around 17%) combined with a very promising removal of MPs, with Diclofenac, Naproxen, Ibuprofen and 4n-Nonylphenol being removed up to 77%, 56%, 44% and 70% respectively. This membrane would allow the treatment of secondary treated municipal wastewater, strongly reducing the load of MPs, without producing a highly saline concentrate stream.

AB Fifty-five pharmaceuticals were monitored at four rivers and inlets and/or outlets of three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Yodo River watershed, Japan over 17 sampling events. Twenty-six quantified pharmaceuticals were classified by source and fate. The load per person (LPP) of nine pharmaceuticals, including six with observed mass balance in studied river stretch of <80%, was appreciably lower in river water (RW) than in the effluent (EF) of STPs (RW/EF <0.5), indicating that they were susceptible to in-stream attenuation in the study area, while the others were relatively conservative. The LPP of 12 pharmaceuticals in RW were within +/- 50% of that in EF. Because their mass loadings in rivers were correlated with human population in the catchment and most people use the sewer system, the major source of the 12 pharmaceuticals was considered to be STPs. The LPP of the three most labile pharmaceuticals in STPs (caffeine, theophylline, and acetaminophen) was >1.5 in RW/EF and <1.0 in RW/influent (IF) of STPs. Poorly treated sewage discharged from households without using the sewer system was considered to be influential source of the three pharmaceuticals. The LPP (RW/EF) of caffeine, a pharmaceutical contained in food and beverage, was considerably higher than that of the other two, and this is attributable to untreated gray water discharged at households using the night-soil treatment system. The LPP of two veterinary drugs (sulfamonomethoxine and lincomycin) were >1.5 (RW/EF) and >1.0 (RW/IF). Their mass loadings in rivers showed a positive correlation with swine population in the catchment, although sulfamonomethoxine is equally used in both cattle and swine farming. This was attributable to application of cattle excrement as manure, and lability of sulfamonomethoxine during composting processes. The major source of the two veterinary drugs was considered to be on-site treatment facilities of swine urine. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of human drugs in the aquatic environment is partly due to an incomplete and insufficient removal process of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Thus, drug traces are observed at different concentrations in water bodies, sediments and aquatic plants all over the world. At the same time, Surface Flow Treatment Wetlands (SFTWs) at the outlet of WWTPs are commonly observed in small municipalities as complementary treatment. However, little is known regarding the role of SFTWs in the complementary mitigation of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, and the interactions between drugs, plants and sediment throughout the seasons. For that reason, we conducted sampling sessions over a period of two years on a full-scale SFTW downstream of a vertical-flow constructed wetland. At each session, the SFTW influent and effluent, as well as five different plant species and one composite sediment sample, were sampled. We detected more than fifty pharmaceutical compounds in the inflow and outflow water. The compounds most frequently detected were bisoprolol and ketoprofen. We emphasized that the SFTW removal ability was better in the summer than in the winter, due to the impact of weather on physicochemical parameters. Large variations of removal efficiencies were also observed when considering all of the detected compounds. Large seasonal variations were also observed for each compound. In addition, the study of the five plants showed their ability to uptake drugs from water and soil to the leaves in a species-specific manner. The pharmaceutical composition of the sediment was also correlated with the season: the maximum occurrence was reached in summer, and the minimum was reached in winter. Finally, the continuous decrease in removal efficiencies highlights the ageing effect on SFTW removal ability. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is one of the most widely used pharmaceutically active compounds and frequently detected in treated wastewater and the impacted aquatic environment. However, the fate and toxicity of TCS in aquatic organisms is poorly known, including in particular the potential for the formation of incomplete biological transformation products. In this study, TCS posed high toxic effects (e.g., growth inhibition and damage of photosynthesis) to typical freshwater diatom Navicula sp., with the 24 h and 72 h EC50 values of 173.3 and 145.6 mu gL(-1), respectively. The bioaccumulation of TCS in diatom cells increased with the increasing exposure to TCS and showed to be time-dependent. The higher intracellular. TCS lead to higher toxicity on Navicula sp. The intracellular TCS concentration and the growth inhibition of TCS in Navicula sp. at pH 7.5 was obviously higher than that at pH 8.3, which was likely due to the higher abundance of unionized TCS in the culture. KMnO4 reduced both bioaccumulation and toxicity of TCS in Navicula sp., especially at pH 8.3. A total of seven products were detected by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These findings will provide a reference for the risk assessment of TCS in aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by fouled nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has been extensively studied. Investigations on the effects of PhACs on organic fouling or biofouling in the NF/RO membrane application are still lacking. In this study, NF/RO membranes were fed with both synthetic (SRNOM solution and synthetic wastewater containing pure culture inoculum) and real (secondary effluent) water matrices spiked with three PhACs to elucidate the impact of PhACs on membrane fouling in comparison with control experiments in the absence of PhACs. Results showed that the PhACs mitigated flux decline during NF/RO filtration of SRNOM solution. The total organic foulants on both membrane surfaces decreased in the presence of PhACs due to the increased negative charges of the membranes and the enhanced size and charge effects of PhAC-macromolecule complexes in SRNOM solution. PhACs appeared to inhibit cell growth in the early stages of biofouling, causing a decline in total biomass, and then induced cell lysis, releasing EPS to protect from chemical stress in the later stages of biofouling, especially protein-like materials, causing more severe biofouling. The alleviation of declines in flux and salt rejection during the filtration of secondary effluent were found in the presence of PhACs. Therefore, we hypothesized that organic fouling or early-stage biofouling occurred during 100 h of filtration of secondary effluent. The decrease in PhAC retention was more obvious due to the higher ionic strength in the secondary effluent. This study may aid understanding of PhAC removal from various matrices and the effects of PhAC mixtures on membrane fouling by in practical NF/RO membranes applications.

AB Recovering nitrogen from separately collected urine can potentially reduce costs and energy of wastewater nitrogen removal and fertilizer production. Through benchtop experiments, we demonstrate the recovery of nitrogen from urine as ammonium sulfate using electrochemical stripping, a combination of electrodialysis and membrane stripping. Nitrogen was selectively recovered with 93% efficiency in batch experiments with real urine and required 30.6 MJ kg N-1 in continuous-flow experiments (slightly less than conventional ammonia stripping). The effects of solution chemistry on nitrogen flux, electrolytic reactions, and reactions with electro-generated oxidants were evaluated using synthetic urine solutions. Fates of urine-relevant trace organic contaminants, including electrochemical oxidation and reaction with electro-generated chlorine, were investigated with a suite of common pharmaceuticals. Trace organics (<0.1 mu g L-1) and elements (<30 mu g L-1) were not detected at appreciable levels in the ammonium sulfate fertilizer product. This novel approach holds promise for selective recovery of nitrogen from concentrated liquid waste streams such as source-separated urine.

AB Systematic sampling and analysis of wastewater samples are increasingly adopted for estimating drug consumption in communities. An understanding of the in sewer transportation and transformation of illicit drug biomarkers is critical for reducing the uncertainty of this evidence-based estimation method. In this study, biomarkers stability was investigated in lab-scale sewer reactors with typical sewer conditions. Kinetic models using the Bayesian statistics method were developed to simulate biomarkers transformation in reactors. Furthermore, a field-scale study was conducted in a real pressure sewer pipe with the systematical spiking and sampling of biomarkers and flow tracers. In-sewer degradation was observed for some spiked biomarkers over typical hydraulic retention time (i.e., a few hours). Results indicated that sewer biofilms prominently influenced biomarker stability with the retention time in wastewater. The fits between the measured and the simulated biomarkers transformation demonstrated that the lab-based model could be extended to estimate the changes of biomarkers in real sewers. Results also suggested that the variabilities of biotransformation and analytical accuracy are the two major contributors to the overall estimation uncertainty. Built upon many previous lab-scale studies, this study is one critical step forward in realizing wastewater based epidemiology by extending biomarker stability investigations from laboratory reactors to real sewers.

AB The presence of intersex fish in watersheds around the world is a warning of the presence of anthropogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) being deposited into the aquatic environment. The anti-diabetic drug metformin is among the most prevalent and ubiquitous of the myriad pharmaceuticals found in wastewater effluent and watersheds worldwide. In addition to its prescription for type-2 diabetes, metformin is indicated as a treatment in cancers and the endocrine disorder polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Our previous research found evidence of endocrine-disruption following Pimephaies promelas (fathead minnow) exposure to metformin at an environmentally relevant concentration. However, the mechanism of action leading to these impacts is unknown. Although metformin does not structurally resemble classical EDCs, there's an increasing recognition that endocrine disruption may occur by mechanisms other than classical endocrine receptor binding, and metformin's off-label use for treating endocrine-related disorders such as PCOS indicates its potential interaction with the endocrine system. To further explore metformin's mechanism of action as an EDC, we measured expression of numerous endocrine-related genes in male fathead minnows exposed to metformin at a low-dose similar to that found in wastewater effluent and the environment (40 mu g L-1) for a full year (early development to adulthood) and discovered significant upregulation of the AR (3.6 +/- 0.9-fold), 3 beta-HSD (3.9 +/- 0.8-fold), 17 beta-HSD (17 +/- 4-fold), CYP19A1 (40 +/- 20-fold), and SULT2A1 (2.3 +/- 0.4-fold) genes in exposed male gonad. We also found a significant correlation between expression of 3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD, and CYP19A1 in testis of metformin-treated male fish and the degree of intersex occurring in their gonads. These results provide additional evidence of the endocrine disrupting impact of the drug metformin and insight into the potential mechanisms by which metformin may influence the endocrine system in aquatic organisms.

AB Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been widely studied for adsorption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). However, effluent organic matter (EfOM) is found to compete with PPCP for sorption sites on MWCNT, thereby markedly reducing the adsorptive capacities of MWCNT for PPCP in wastewater effluent. Herein, we report that precoagulation of secondary wastewater effluent effectively mitigated the competitive adsorption of EfOM and increased the adsorption capacities of MWCNT for acetaminophen, caffeine, triclosan, and carbendazim by up to 34%. Analyses of the coagulated waters using size exclusion chromatography and three-dimensional fluorescence spectrophotometry revealed that precoagulation primarily removed biopolymers and humic substances; the latter is known to suppress PPCP adsorption onto MWCNT. Moreover, the removal of EfOM by precoagulation reduced membrane permeability decrement and relieved membrane fouling. These results suggest that coagulation, a conventional technique widely used by water treatment plants, is a viable pretreatment approach for filtration of PPCP in wastewater by MWCNT. This finding also demonstrates the potential of integrating conventional technology and novel nanotechnology for cost-effective, advanced wastewater treatment.

AB The deposition of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on semiconductors has been demonstrated to be an efficient route to improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to plasma resonance effect, but the photocatalytic efficiency of the available Ag-based photocatalysts is still low and far from practical application. In this study, a novel photocatalyst with Ag NPs deposited on the surface of AgIn5S8 (Ag/AgIn5S8) was fabricated via solvothermal method and further photo-reduction approach. The amount of deposited Ag nanoparticles has an obvious effect on the charge separation and visible-light photocatalytic activity of Ag/AgIn5S8, and 2.5% Ag/AgIn5S8 nanocomposites exhibit the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with 95.3% degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC% HCl) compared with that of the other samples due to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs, proper bandgap of AgIn5S8 and the synergistic effect between them. The main reactive species in TC% HCl degradation are center dot OH and center dot O-2(-). The possible degradation pathway of TC% HCl and photocatalytic mechanism of Ag/AgIn5S8 were proposed according to high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, main reactive species, and conduction band and valence band of AgIn5S8. Moreover, Ag/AgIn5S8 nanohybrids were applied to treat real pharmaceutical industry wastewater, and it was found that the mineralization efficiency and COD removal of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater can reach 56.3% and 77.6%, respectively. The above results indicate Ag/AgIn5S8 photocatalysts have a promising prospect in the treatment of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater.

AB Mechanical harvest of massive harmful algal blooms is an effective measure for bloom mitigation. Yet subsequent processing of the resulting water from algae water separation after the harvesting becomes a new problem since individual algal cells or small algal aggregates are still present in the water. Here, we proposed a novel approach for effectively flocculating the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa with a removal efficiency of 97% in 6 h using hydrolyzed urine. Nitrogen and phosphorus were simultaneously reclaimed through struvite formation. The addition of Mg2+ promoted the flocculation efficiency and nutrient removal as well as the yield of struvite. Ca2+ could enhance the flocculation efficiency by forming calcium phosphate. During the flocculation process, no significant damage in algal cells was observed. This study provides a novel and sustainable potential for subsequent processing of the resulting water after algae water separation with simultaneous nutrient precipitation and reducing nutrient loads to wastewater treatment plants.

AB Present study investigates the potential of Ti/RuO2 electrode for degradation and mineralization of Ofloxacin (OFLX) antibiotic from synthetic wastewater by electro-oxidation (EO) method, not reported earlier. Effects of various EO parameters such as applied current (I), initial pH, initial OFLX concentration (C-0) and supporting electrolyte concentration on %OFLX removal efficiency and %TOC removal efficiency were systematically studied and reported. Decay kinetics of OFLX by varying C-0 and applied I were also studied. Additionally, mineralization current efficiency and specific energy consumption of OFLX mineralization were evaluated. Moreover, mode of oxidation method involved (direct and/or indirect oxidation) was also explored. Major OFLX transformation products during EO were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and possible degradation reaction mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, operating cost analysis was performed to check the economic feasibility of the EO process.
   The optimum pH and current (I) were found to be approximate to 6.8 (natural pH of OFLX wastewater) and 1 A, respectively. Mineralization current efficiency decreased from 7.8% to 4.9% with increase in I value from 0.25 to 1 A. approximate to 80% of OFLX removal in 30 min of electrolysis and 463% TOC removal in 240 min of electrolysis at I = 1 A were observed. Pseudo-first-order kinetic model best fitted the experimental data showing R-2 value approximate to 0.99 for all the C-0 and applied I studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CPX), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is found in the bulk effluents emerged from pharmaceutical industries. Its presence in the effluent may lead to toxicity to the aquatic life and antimicrobial resistance. Hence, the oxidative degradation of CPX by classical Fenton's process was investigated for the present study. The maximum CPX and total organic carbon (TOC) removal from the synthetic wastewater (initial CPX concentration = 100 mg L-1) were 70% and 55%, respectively, under the best reaction conditions ([H2O2]:[Fe2+] = 10, stoichiometric H2O2 concentration = 14.2 mM and initial wastewater pH = 3.0). Five major degradation products could be identified by high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HR LC-MS) which could have resulted by the occurrence of decarboxylation, defluorination, hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring. The time based detection of ferrous and ferric ions in aqueous phase confirmed the CPX degradation by hydroxyl radicals. A pathway has been proposed for CPX degradation by Fenton's process based on the kinetic decay and/or evolution profiles of CPX and intermediates as well as the release of inorganic ions into the aqueous solution. It was indicated from the rapid respirometric test that the wastewater toxicity was lowered after Fenton's treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a biorecalcitrant pharmaceutical compound frequently detected in wastewater and water bodies which has numerous negative effects on living organisms. In this investigation the effect of electrocatalytically generated active chlorine on CBZ degradation was studied using Nb/BDD or Ti/IrO2 anodes. Subsequently, a response surface methodology based on a factorial plan and central composite design was carried out to determine the contribution of individual factors and to obtain the optimal experimental parameters for CBZ abatement. Electric current and treatment time were found to be the pivotal parameters influencing the degradation efficiency with respective contributions of 45.19% and 35.44%. The anode material had lower influence on the response, however, using an Nb/BDD anode, the oxidation was more effective due to the increased production of center dot OH radicals as well as HClO, Cl center dot and ClO- species. Considering CBZ degradation and energetic consumption, the percentage of degraded CBZ was 88.70 +/- 0.35% consuming 1.07 kWh m(-3) (at 1.0 A, NaCl concentration of 14 mM after 12.45 min, using Nb/BDD anode). First order kinetic constant (k) value of 0.189 min(-1) was obtained at optimal conditions when demineralized water was used for the NaCl supporting electrolyte, while k was lower when tap water or treated wastewaters were used for this purpose. Oxidation of CBZ yielded six aromatic intermediates, identified by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry technique and degradation pathways were proposed. The performed acute toxicity tests indicated an increase during the treatment, which was demonstrated to be mainly attributed to the remnant active chlorine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Antibiotics are emerging pollutants released into the environment through wastewater and manure or effluents from livestock plants. Compared to the wide literature on the effects of antibiotics on the development of drug resistant bacteria and on the adverse effects on animals and human beings, the effects on plants are less investigated. Here we evaluated the effects of four antibiotics (cloramphenicol: CAP, spiramycin: SPR, spectinomycin: SPT, vancomycin: VAN) belonging to different chemical groups, on seed germination and root development of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. San Marzano). Specifically, seed germination and root elongation kinetics, as well as the number of mithotic figures in root apical meristem, were studied in relation to different concentrations of each antibiotic (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 mg L-1) for 10 and 7 days, respectively. Results showed that seed germination was not affected, but root development (root elongation kinetics and cell division) was impaired at concentrations from 10 mg L-1 (SPT) and 100 mg L-1 (CAP) to 1000 mg L-1 (SPR and VAN).

AB Cyclophosphamide (CP) and Ifosfamide (IF) are two nitrogen mustard drugs widely prescribed in cancer therapy. They are continuously released via excreta into hospital and urban wastewaters reaching wastewater treatment plants. Although CP and IF, their metabolites and transformation products (TPs) residues have been found in the aquatic environment from few ng L-1 to tens of mu g L-1, their environmental toxic effects are still not well known. The present study aimed to investigate the acute and chronic ecotoxicity of CP and IF and their commercially available human metabolites/TPs, i.e. carboxy-CP, Keto-CP and N-dechloroethyl-CP on different organisms of the aquatic trophic chain. The experiments were performed using the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the crustaceans Thamnocephalus platyurus and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Moreover, to assess the treatment conditions in regards to parent compound removal and formation of new TPs, CP and IF were UV-irradiated for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h, followed by toxicity evaluation of treated samples by algae, rotifers and crustaceans. Between the parent compounds, IF resulted as more toxic drug under tested conditions, exerting both acute and chronic effects especially on C. dubia (LC50:196.4 mg L-1, EC50:15.84 mg L-1). Among the tested metabolites/TPs, only carboxy-CP inhibited the reproduction in the rotifer. However, LOEC and NOEC values were calculated for CP and IF for all organisms. In addition, despite a low degradation of CP (28%) and IF (36%) after 48 h UV-irradiation, statistically significant effect differences (p < 0.05) from not-irradiated and irradiated samples were observed in both acute and chronic assays, starting from 6 h UV-irradiation. Our results suggest that the toxic effects found in the aquatic organisms may be attributable to interactions between the parent compounds and their metabolites/TPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work we have investigated in details the process of degradation of the 4-amino-6-chlorobenzene-1,3-disulfonamide (ABSA), stable hydrolysis product of frequently used pharmaceutical hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), as one of the most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water. The study encompassed investigation of degradation by hydrolysis, photolysis, and photocatalysis employing commercially available TiO2 Degussa P25 catalyst. The process of direct photolysis and photocatalytic degradation were investigated under different type of lights. Detailed insights into the reactive properties of HCTZ and ABSA have been obtained by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, preference of HCTZ towards hydrolysis was confirmed experimentally and explained using computational study. Results obtained in this study indicate very limited efficiency of hydrolytic and photolytic degradation in the case of ABSA, while photocatalytic degradation demonstrated great potential. Namely, after 240 min of photocatalytic degradation, 65% of ABSA was mineralizated in water/TiO2 suspension under SSI, while the nitrogen was predominantly present as NH4+. Reaction intermediates were studied and a number of them were detected using LC-ESI-MS/MS. This study also involves toxicity assessment of HCTZ, ABSA, and their mixtures formed during the degradation processes towards mammalian cell lines (rat hepatoma, H-4-II-E, human colon adenocarcinoma, HT-29, and human fetal lung, MRC-5). Toxicity assessments showed that intermediates formed during the process of photocatalysis exerted only mild cell growth effects in selected cell lines, while direct photolysis did not affect cell growth.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have a limited capacity to eliminate micropollutants. One option to improve this is tertiary treatment. Accordingly, the WWTP Eriskirch at the German river Schussen has been upgraded with different combinations of ozonation, sand, and granulated activated carbon filtration. In this study, the removal of endocrine and genotoxic effects in vitro and reproductive toxicity in vivo was assessed in a 2-year long-term monitoring. All experiments were performed with aqueous and solid-phase extracted water samples. Untreated wastewater affected several endocrine endpoints in reporter gene assays. The conventional treatment removed the estrogenic and androgenic activity by 77 and 95 %, respectively. Nevertheless, high anti-estrogenic activities and reproductive toxicity persisted. All advanced treatment technologies further reduced the estrogenic activities by additional 69-86 % compared to conventional treatment, resulting in a complete removal of up to 97 %. In the Ames assay, we detected an ozone-induced mutagenicity, which was removed by subsequent filtration. This demonstrates that a post treatment to ozonation is needed to minimize toxic oxidative transformation products. In the reproduction test with the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a decreased number of embryos was observed for all wastewater samples. This indicates that reproductive toxicants were eliminated by neither the conventional nor the advanced treatment. Furthermore, aqueous samples showed higher anti-estrogenic and reproductive toxicity than extracted samples, indicating that the causative compounds are not extractable or were lost during extraction. This underlines the importance of the adequate handling of wastewater samples. Taken together, this study demonstrates that combinations of multiple advanced technologies reduce endocrine effects in vitro. However, they did not remove in vitro anti-estrogenicity and in vivo reproductive toxicity. This implies that a further optimization of advanced wastewater treatment is needed that goes beyond combining available technologies.

AB The occurrence, partitioning, and spatio-temporal distribution of seven pharmaceuticals for human use, three steroid hormones and one personal care product were determined in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment of Pirai Creek and Jundiai River (Jundiai River Basin, So Paulo, Brazil). The maximum average detected concentrations of the compounds in the Pirai River samples were < 30 ng L-1, except for caffeine (222 ng L-1). In Jundiai River samples, most of the compounds were frequently detected, wherein caffeine had the highest concentration, with maximum average concentrations of 14,050 ng L-1, followed by atenolol (431 ng L-1), ibuprofen (268 ng L-1) and diclofenac (214 ng L-1). Atenolol, propranolol, estrone, and triclosan were the contaminants most frequently detected in sediment and SPM samples. Triclosan had the highest average proportion of SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase (> 75%). Contaminants with acid functional groups showed, in general, a lower tendency to bind to particulate matter and sediments. In addition, hydrophobicity had an important effect on their environmental partitioning. The spatial distribution of contaminants along the Jundiai River was mainly affected by the higher concentration of contaminants in water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results obtained here clearly showed the importance of the analysis of some contaminants in the whole water, meaning both dissolved and particulate compartments in the water, and that the partitioning is ruled by a set of parameters associated to the physicochemical characteristics of contaminants and the matrix properties of the studied, which need be considered in an integrated approach to understand the fate of emerging chemical contaminants in aquatic environments.

AB The spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance (due to over and non-judicious use of antibiotics) is an apprehensive subjects matter and the role of wastewater treatment plants has been attracting particular interest. These stations are a reservoir of resistant bacteria, and the amount of bacteria released into the environment is very high and dangerous. The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a practical solution for surmounting scarcity of water, but there are several health-related and environmental risks associated with this practice. It may increase antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in soil and water. Wastewater treatment plant effluents have been recognised as significant environmental AR reservoirs due to selective pressure generated by antibiotics that are frequently discharged in water. It also enhanced the possibility of horizontal gene transfer by increasing the abundance of the resistance gene. This review focuses on the emergence of antibiotic resistance in waste water, waste water treatment, challenges and their impact on human health. Based on the current state of the art, we conclude that the improvements in wastewater treatment technologies are required that not only remove solids, organic matter, and nutrients but also they could remove AR element and bacteria.

AB Bovine bile was assessed as a novel bio-surfactant pre-treatment to enhance anaerobic digestion of lipid-rich dissolved air flotation (DAF) sludge using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. Bile was dosed at arbitrary concentrations from 0.2-6 g/L. At 0.6 g bile/L, methane yield increased by 7.08%. Doses above 2 g bile/L produced negative impacts on SMP, kinetics and digestion profile. At 6 g/L bile produced a 6% decrease in specific methane production and up to 79% additional inhibitory duration, delayed time of peak methane production by up to 74%, and slowed total digestion time by up to 65%. Reaction kinetics declined linearly with respect to bile addition, reaching half the control value at 6 g/L bile concentration. Subsequent anaerobic toxicity assays between 1 and 6 g bile/L revealed that bile has an inhibitory effect under BMP testing at these higher doses. The economic viability of using bile as a bio-surfactant was assessed. In comparison to the current use of bile as a sale product to pharmaceutical companies, the addition of 0.2 g bile/L to existing slaughterhouse waste streams could increase the value of bile to 220% of its current sale value. The promising results of bile dosed at 0.6 g/L under BMP testing warrant further investigation into long-term impact of bile pre-treatments of high-fat slaughterhouse wastewater in semi-continuous digestion experiments.

AB Pharmaceuticals are environmental micropollutants that pose an emerging challenge because they are poorly eliminated in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Over the last decade, many attempts have been made to solve this problem, and wastewater fungal treatment is a promising alternative. In this study, six different ligninolytic fungi (Trametes versicolor, Ganoderma lucidum, Irpex lacteus, Stropharia rugosoannulata, Gymnopilus luteofolius and Agrocybe erebia) were studied as bioremediation candidates for the removal and degradation of six recalcitrant pharmaceutical micropollutants: Carbamazepine (CBZ), Venlafaxine (VFX), lopromide (IPD), Diclofenac (DCF), Cyclophosphamide (CFD) and Ifosfamide (IFD). Self-immobilization in a pellet shape was achieved for all fungal mycelia (which was the first time that this was reported for S. rugosoannulata, G. luteofolius, and A. erebia). Biodegradation achievement was greater than 90% for IPD with G. luteofolius and greater than 70% for CBZ with S. rugosoannulata, which suggests a great potential for this alternative biological treatment. Besides, this was the first report where fungal treatment achieved CFD and IFD removals greater than 20% for the treatment with T. versicolor, G. lucidum and S. rugosoannulata. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We herein report the removal of amodiaquine, an emerging drug contaminant from aqueous solution using [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] (fum = fumaric acid; bpy = 4,4-bipyridine; bdc = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents. The adsorbents were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Adsorption process for both adsorbents were found to follow the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the adsorption equilibrium data fitted best into the Freundlich isotherm with the R-2 values of 0.973 and 0.993 obtained for [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities foramodiaquine in this study were found to be 0.478 and 47.62 mg/g on the [Zn-2(fum)(2)(bpy)] and [Zn4O(bdc)(3)] MOFs respectively, and were obtained at pH of 4.3 for both adsorbents. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis of the MOFs after the adsorption process showed the presence of the drug. The results of the study showed that the prepared MOFs could be used for the removal of amodiaquine from wastewater.

AB This work reports on the variation in wastewater treatment works (WwTW) influent concentrations of a wide variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), their removal efficiency, effluent concentrations and potential risks to the aquatic environment. The research is based on data generated from two large UK-wide WwTW monitoring programmes. Taking account of removal of parent compound from the aqueous phase during treatment in combination with estimates of dilution available it is possible to prioritise the APIs of greatest risk of exceeding estimates of predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) in receiving waters for all WwTW in the UK. The majority of substances studied were removed to a high degree, although with significant variation, both within and between WwTW. Poorer removal (between influent and effluent) was observed for ethinyloestradiol, diclofenac, propranolol, the macrolide antibiotics, fluoxetine, tamoxifen and carbamazepine. All except the last two of these substances were present in effluents at concentrations higher than their respective estimated PNEC (based on measurement of effluents from 45 WwTW on 20 occasions). Based on available dilution data as many as 890 WwTW in the UK (approximately 13% of all WwTW) may cause exceedances of estimated riverine PNECs after mixing of their effluents with receiving waters. The overall degree of risk is driven by the toxicity value selected, which in itself is controlled by the availability of reliable and relevant ecotoxicological data and consequently the safety factors applied. The dataset and discussion, provides information to assist in the future management of these types of chemicals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present work describes the first known study to date on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water and wastewater of Cuernavaca, the capital of the state of Morelos (Mexico). Selected pharmaceuticals (a total of 35) were extracted fromthe collected water samples with a generic solid phase extraction (SPE) protocol and determined in the sample extracts by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-tandemmass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the pharmaceuticals detected in the investigated area. A total of twelve pharmaceuticals were found in the water samples analyzed, with detection frequencies above 78% and in most cases of 100%. Overall, the most abundant pharmaceuticals in surface water were the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs naproxen (732-4880 ng/L), acetaminophen (354-4460 ng/L), and diclofenac (258-1398 ng/L), and the lipid regulator bezafibrate (286-2100 ng/L). On the contrary, other compounds like the beta-blocker atenolol and the psychiatric drug carbamazepine were found at only a few ng or tens of ng per liter in the Apatlaco River. Despite the fact that some of the most abundant compounds showed good removal (> 97%) during wastewater treatment, concentrations downstream the WWTP were only slightly lower than upstream. This indicates the existence of additional inputs of untreated wastewater into the river. Based on the obtained HQ-values, the concentrations of ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and naproxen present in the river could pose a high toxicity risk for the aquatic ecosystem. These findings highlight these pharmaceuticals as relevant organic contaminants in the area of study and the need to further monitor them in order to adopt appropriate measures to safeguard the ecosystem, and eventually human health.

AB The effectivity of different treatment stages at two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in Oslo, Norway, to remove antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli from municipal wastewater was investigated. The WWTPs were effective in reducing the total cultivable E. coli. The E. coli in WWTP samples were mainly resistant to ampicillin (6-27%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (5-24%), and, to a lesser extent, tetracycline (3-14%) and ciprofloxacin (0-7%). In the first WWTP, a clear decrease in the percentage of E. coli resistant to these antibiotics was found, with the main removal occurring during physical/chemical treatment. In the second WWTP, the percentage of cultivable resistant E. coli did not display a considerable change. During laboratory-scale membrane filtration of WWTP effluents using ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes, all E. coli, including those resistant to antibiotics, were removed completely. The results imply that UF and NF processes are potent measures to remove antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) during post-treatment of WWTP effluents, thus reducing the potential spread of antibiotic resistance in the receiving aquatic environment.

AB The effect of granular activated carbon (GAC) addition on the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, metoprolol, galaxolide and triclosan in a up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was studied. Prior to the reactor studies, batch experiments indicated that addition of activated carbon to UASB sludge can decrease micropollutant concentrations in both liquid phase and sludge. In continuous experiments, two UASB reactors were operated for 260 days at an HRT of 20 days, using a mixture of source separated black water and sludge from aerobic grey water treatment as influent. GAC (5.7 g per liter of reactor volume) was added to one of the reactors on day 138. No significant difference in COD removal and biogas production between reactors with and without GAC addition was observed. In the presence of GAC, fewer micropollutants were washed out with the effluent and a lower accumulation of micropollutants in sludge and particulate organic matter occurred, which is an advantage in micropollutant emission reduction from wastewater. However, the removal of micropollutants by adding GAC to a UASB reactor would require more activated carbon compared to effluent post-treatment. Additional research is needed to estimate the effect of bioregeneration on the lifetime of activated carbon in a UASB-GAC reactor.

AB The present study was aimed at investigating the feasibility of a solar photocatalytic system to degrade toxic materials generated from different activities (e.g., xylene from petroleum refineries, tetracycline from pharmaceuticals factories, and chloropyrifos from constructions and pesticides) using the coupled homogenous-heterogeneous solar photocatalytic process. The system consists of ten Pyrex tubes (25 mm inside diameter and 125 cm long) connected in series and mounted on a parabolic trough collector (PTC) with other associated facilities. Different operating variables were studied to predict the performance of the solar reactor like, pH of solution, loading of heterogeneous catalyst, loading of homogeneous catalyst, H2O2 concentration, and liquid flow rate. The maximum degradations obtained, using coupled heterogeneous-homogeneous solar photocatalytic process, were 100% within 30 min for tetracycline at (Fe2+= 50 mg/l, TiO2 = 100 mg/l, H2O2 = 200 mg/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min), 100% for xylene within 30 min at (100mg TiO2/l, 50mg Fe2+/l, 100 mg H2O2/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min), and for chlopyrifos, a maximum degradation of 100% was obtained within 1.5 h at (150 mg Fe2+/l, 250 mg H2O2/l, and 400 mg TiO2/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min). Results of this study confirmed the capability of the designed solar system to degrade different types of toxic organics.

AB A wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical plant of chemical organic synthesis with a TOC of ca 1.4 g/L and low biodegradability has been treated by coupling of advanced Fenton oxidation process and subsequent biological treatment. The influence of the reaction temperature, the hydrogen peroxide concentration and the iron/copper loadings as catalysts in the Fenton process were studied. A moderate oxidant concentration (7.5 mgH(2)O(2)/ mgTOC) and a temperature of 70 degrees C enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater with a TOC reduction of ca. 35%. A subsequent biological treatment operating with HRT and SRT of 2 days and 20 days, respectively, allowed increasing the TOC removal above 90%. The oxidant concentration and the reaction temperature of Fenton process as pre-treatment to increase biodegradability were significantly lower than the values of the Fenton process currently implemented in the pharmaceutical plant to achieve an almost complete mineralization of the organic matter (21.4 mgH(2)O(2)/mgTOC and 120 degrees C, respectively). The techno-economical evaluation of the coupling Fenton/biological system compared to the Fenton process as unique treatment, showed that the lower oxidant uptake of the Fenton process for the coupling system is economically more profitable than using an excess of oxidant and a higher reaction temperature for the intensive Fenton process.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are known to be persistent. Their presence after conventional treatments in sewage treatment plants may harm aquatic environments. The simultaneous degradation of the pharmaceuticals gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen involving photo-Fenton processes was evaluated using different sources and concentrations of iron (Fe2+, Fe3+ and the iron complexes of oxalate- FeOx), initial pH (2.6, 5.0 and 7.0) and concentrations of H2O2. The classic photo-Fenton reaction (at initial pH 2.6, using Fe2+ and Fes+) showed a limited efficiency in promoting gemfibrozil degradation, which, based on evidence provided by LC-MS measurements, is related to the formation of associations between this compound and iron ions. The simultaneous degradation of gemfibrozil and the other compounds was improved using FeOx (1.0 mg L-1- in iron) at an initial pH of 2.6 and 2.0 mg L-H2O2. In addition, using this catalyst it was possible to efficiently degrade the pharmaceuticals at an initial pH of 5.0, reaching complete degradation of these compounds with a treatment time varying between 20 and 60 min and generating a low toxicity effluent. These results highlight the potential applicability of ferrioxalate as a photocatalyst in the photo-Fenton process as an alternative method to degrade this kind of pollutant at a pH near neutrality.

AB Discharges of care, analyses and research activities from hospital wards are the source of the specificity of hospital effluents because they contain, among others, drug residues, detergents and disinfectants. Even if hospitals represent a small fraction of the total drug load discharged into the environment, below 10% for drugs, the characterization of this specific effluent shows that global pollution is 2-3 times more concentrated than urban wastewater. Moreover this ratio increases to 150 times for some micropollutants. Activated sludge acclimation in 2 membrane bioreactor (MBR) configurations (external and external submerged) to effluents from an oncological ward will be studied monitoring the performances on conventional pollution parameters (chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, total suspended solids etc.). The performances of drug degradation are compared with the data of the literature and with degradation tests in batch reactor with no acclimated biomass from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The results are achieved for effluents with a high concentration of drug molecules, up to 6.82 mg L-1 for ifosfamide. The treatment allows the development of enhanced purification efficiencies on drug molecules and confirms the choice of a MBR process to treat this effluent, although the simultaneous presence of the various compounds leads to a complex biological response. Indeed, 5-FU was eliminated almost systematically over 90%. Sulfamethoxazole and codeine can be significantly eliminated biologically, respectively to 79 and 95%. IF and CP removal in the reactor appeared more moderate since it does not exceed 40% but membrane fouling led to higher removals of both molecules.

AB The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Bizerte concentrates different types of chemical and biological pollutants in the Bizerte lagoon (Tunisia). Considering four upstream and downstream WWTP discharge stations, seventy nine, culturable bacterial strains were isolated and identified from water and sediment as fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, pathogenic staphylococci and non-enterobacteriacea. Fecal coliforms were most abundant (2.5 10(5) bacteria/mg) in sediment of WWTP discharge. Leuconostoc spp (23.1%) and Chryseomonasluteola (23.1%) were the most prevalent culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated at the upstream discharge stations. However, Staphylococcus xylosus (13.9%) was the most prevalent culturable FIB isolated at the WWTP discharge stations. Moreover, high antibioticresistance phenotypes were present in all sampling stations, but especially in WWTP discharge station in both water and sediment. Resistance levels in water and sediment, respectively were amoxicillin (58.8%; 34.8%), penicillin (50%; 31.6%), oxacillin (60%; 33.3%), cefotaxim (55.2%; 39.1%), ceftazidim (66.7%; 50%), gentamycin (42.9%; 38.9%), tobramycin (50%; 25%), vancomycin (33.3; 71.4%), amikacin (66.7%; 0%) and ciprofloxacin (100%; 100%). Interestingly, beta-lactam antibiotic resistant FIB were mostly isolated from water as well as from sediments of upstream and WWTP discharge station. Canonical correspondence analysis CCA correlating antibiotic resistance profile with the abiotic data showed that, in water column, culturable bacterial strains isolated in upstream WWTP discharge stations were interestingly correlated with the resistance to amikacin, oxacillin, cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin, however, in sediment, they were correlated with the resistance to amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefotaxim and vancomycin. Serious beta-lactams and aminoglycosides acquired resistance appeared mainly in fecal strepto-cocci and pathogen staphylococci groups.

AB This study investigated the impact of sulphur content on the performance of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with an emphasis on the biological stability, contaminant removal, and membrane fouling. Removal of 38 trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) that are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater by AnMBR was evaluated. Results show that basic biological performance of AnMBR regarding biomass growth and the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was not affected by sulphur addition when the influent COD/SO42- ratio was maintained higher than 10. Nevertheless, the content of hydrogen sulphate in the produced biogas increased significantly and membrane fouling was exacerbated with sulphur addition. Moreover, the increase in sulphur content considerably affected the removal of some hydrophilic TrOCs and their residuals in the sludge phase during AnMBR operation. By contrast, no significant impact on the removal of hydrophobic TrOCs was noted with sulphur addition to AnMBR.

AB Shortages in nutrients and freshwater for a growing population are critical global issues. Source separation of waste streams combined with decentralized resource recovery is a promising approach to address this problem. Urine contains within 1% of household wastewater up to 80% of nitrogen (N) and 50% of phosphorus (P). Since microalgae are efficient at nutrient uptake, growing them in urine is a promising technology to clean urine and produce biomass as fertilizer. The aim of this study was to develop a process for nutrient recovery from minimally diluted human urine using immobilized cultivation of microalgae on porous substrate photobioreactors (PSBRs). Treatment of urine, unamended except for a 1:1 dilution with tap water, was performed with the green alga Desmodesmus abundans, chosen among 96 algal strains derived from urine-specific enrichments and culture collections. A growth rate of 7.2 g dry weight m(-2) day(-1) and removal efficiencies for N and P of 13.1 and 94.1% were determined. Pre-treatment of urine with activated carbon was found to eliminate potentially detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals. In combination with other technologies, PSBRs could be applied in decentralized resource recovery systems, helping to close the link between sanitation and food production.

AB This study focuses on the application of combining membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment with reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) membrane treatment for removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. Twenty-seven PPCPs were measured in real influent with lowest average concentration being trimethoprim (7.12 ng/L) and the highest being caffeine (18.4 ng/L). The results suggest that the MBR system effectively removes the PPCPs with an efficiency of between 41.08% and 95.41%, and that the integrated membrane systems, MBR-RO/NF, can achieve even higher removal rates of above 95% for most of them. The results also suggest that, due to the differences in removal mechanisms of NF/RO membrane, differences of removal rates exist. In this study, the combination of MBR-NF resulted in the removal of 13 compounds to below detection limits and MBR-RO achieved even better results with removal of 20 compounds to below detection limits.

AB Sewage sludge incineration in a fluidized bed is considered to be one of the most suitable ways of sewage sludge disposal. This process reduces the volume of the waste and causes the destruction of organic contaminants such as POPs, pharmaceuticals, and other compounds with endocrine-disrupting potential. Oxygen-enriched air combustion and oxy-fuel combustion can increase the combustion efficiency, reduce the amount of flue gas, and make possible CO2 capture more effective. However, the influence of incineration medium composition has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the case of sewage sludge incineration. In this paper, the incineration of sewage sludge in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor was studied at oxygen-enriched air conditions, oxy-fuel conditions, and oxy-fuel conditions with zero and nonzero concentrations of steam, CO, NO, N2O, and SO2 in the inlet combustion medium. Consequently, the effects of various operating parameters on pollutants formation were comprehensively described with emphasis on aforementioned sewage sludge incineration processes. An increase in combustion temperature resulted in an increase in NOx and SO2 emissions and in a decrease in N2O emissions. Increase in inlet oxygen concentration led to a decrease in NOx and N2O emissions. N2O and SO2 emissions were higher in CO2-rich atmosphere (oxy-fuel combustion conditions). The presence of water vapor in the inlet combustion medium resulted mainly in the reduction of NOx emissions. The presence of CO, NO, N2O, and SO2 in the dry inlet combustion medium reduced mainly overall nitrogen-to-NOx conversion, while the effect on SO2 removal efficiency was only marginal.

AB Concentrations of pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, were studied in the aqueous and solid phase of municipal sewage sludge, collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in central Finland. The samples included untreated municipal sludge from the biological wastewater treatment, digested sludge and sludge before and after composting. First, samples were taken as grab samples to study the bioavailable part in aqueous phase but also the part in solid fraction. Later, the long-term concentrations were studied by passive sampling with styrene divinylbenzene-reverse phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS) disks. In the untreated solid sludge, the concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen were 0.5 ng g(-1), 26 ng g(-1), 29 ng g(-1), 250 ng g(-1), and 13 ng g(-1), while in liquid phase they were 5.6 ng L-1, 200 ng L-1, 210 ng L-1, 35 ng L-1, and 55 ng L-1, respectively. Concentrations decreased with the treatment steps but substantial amounts still occured even after the final stage. The results show that current sludge treatment cannot fully remove pharmaceuticals, leaving varying concentrations after each stage. Additionally, the results suggest that SDB-RPS disks are suitable for sampling and quantification of the bioavailable fraction of pharmaceuticals in municipal sludge.

AB Benzotriazole (BT) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5-MeBT) are broadly used in industrial applications, such as anti-icing fluids and dishwashing detergent, and act as the primary building blocks for UV absorbers and photostabilizers. This study examined the occurrence of these two compounds in the environment and their unique photochemical behavior affecting photosensitizers and other micro-organic pollutants in aqueous environments. BT and 5-MeBT were detected in all river water samples from the major rivers in Taipei City in the concentration ranges of 147 to 1560 ng/L and 22 to 235 ng/L, respectively, and both compounds persisted through a conventional wastewater treatment plant. The direct photolysis half-lives of BT and 5-MeBT were 56.9 and 14.0 h, respectively. The half-life of photolysis in river water for BT was 44.2 h, whereas the half-life of 5-MeBT was 24.7 h. The long half-lives in real-water matrices resulted in their prevalence in water bodies, and these compounds were also found to minimize the photosensitizing ability of nitrate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) and increase the persistence of other micro-organic pollutant. With BT present, the production of center dot OH in nitrate photolysis was reduced, the degradation of DOM under sunlight was hindered, and the photodegradation of pharmaceutical residues in surface water, such as methotrexate, was completely impeded. This study suggests that in cases in which BT and 5-MeBT are highly concentrated, the effectiveness of natural attenuation process, i.e., photodegradation, in the aqueous environment is diminished, which increases the persistence of the pollutants as well as the risk of exposure.

AB Diffuse pollution in rural areas due to agricultural runoff is a widespread and difficult problem to address due to the large areas affected. Drainage channels receive polluted water, but its introduction into conventional treatment network is often unfeasible. Within this context, microalgae-based treatment systems could be used as alternative treatment plants. A new design of semi-closed (hybrid) tubular horizontal photobioreactor (HTH-PBR) with low energy requirements has been evaluated for microalgae cultivation at full-scale (8.5 m(3)), using agricultural runoff as feedstock. This novel system was tested in batch and continuous mode over 4 and 135 d. Considering a full-scale application in an agricultural context, a batch test was carried out to evaluate the performance of the system. An increase of 22% in the biomass concentration in 4 d was registered, and all nutrients were consumed during the first two days. In the continuous experiment carried out over winter (December April), productivity was between 2 and 14 g g [TSS] m(-3) d, but values up to 76.4 g [TSS] m(-3) d were reached at the end of the study in spring, despite the low nutrients concentration in the feedstock. Elimination of emerging contaminants was also evaluated, obtaining the highest removals for the synthetic musk fragrances tonalide and galaxolide (73% and 68%), and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (61%).

AB Emerging pollutants can reach the environment through the sludge of Wastewater Treatment Plants. In this work, the use of Trametes versicolor in biopiles at lab-scale was studied, evaluating its capacity to remove the most hydrophobic Pharmaceuticals and assessing the evolution of the biopiles microbial communities. The total removal of drugs at real concentrations from sewage sludge was assessed for non-inoculated and fungal inoculated biopiles, testing if the re-inoculation of the biopiles after 22 days of treatment would improve the removal yields. It was found that 2 out of the 15 initially detected pharmaceuticals were totally degraded after 22 days, and re-inoculated fungal biopiles achieved higher removal rates than non-re-inoculated fungal biopiles for single compounds and for all the drugs simultaneously: 66.45% and 49.18% re-inoculated and non-re-inoculated biopiles, respectively. Finally, the study of the bacterial and fungal communities revealed that fungal inoculated and non-inoculated biopiles evolved to similar communities adapted to the presence of those drugs.

AB In the present study, snO(2) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by chemical precipitation method using anhydrous aspartic acid and surfactant at two annealing temperatures, 300 degrees C and 600 degrees C. The effect of surfactants cationic CTAB and anionic SDS on the synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were studied elaborately. In this article, for the first time, SnO2 NPs were employed as an excellent photo catalyst in the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a popular antiepileptic drug which is most commonly detected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in municipal wastewater under UV-C light irradiation. Comparative studies between the photocatalytic activity of SnO2 NPs synthesized with CTAB (SC1) and SDS (SS1) on the degradation of the CBZ drug were investigated. Parameters like the effect of catalytic loading, initial concentration, pH and contact time were also studied for optimization. The results indicate that SC1 is a better photocatalyst with rate constant 6.66 x 10(-2) min(-1) than SS1 with rate 5.7 x 10(-2) min(-1). To determine the transformation product formed on the photodegradation LCMS (ESI) analysis was done. The synthesized SnO2 NPs can be recycled up to 8th cycles without any notable alteration in its photocatalytic activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deriving reliable estimates of chemical emissions to the environment is a key challenge for impact and risk assessment methods and typically the associated uncertainty is not characterised. We have developed an approach to spatially quantify annual chemical emission loads to the aquatic environment together with their associated uncertainty using consumer survey data and publicly accessible and non confidential data sources. The approach is applicable for chemicals widely used across a product sector. Product usage data from consumer survey studies in France, the Netherlands, South Korea and the USA were combined with information on typical product formulations, wastewater removal rates, and the spatial distribution of populations and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP5) in the four countries. Results are presented for three chemicals common to three types of personal care products (shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash) at WWTP and national levels. Uncertainty in WWTP-specific emission estimates was characterised with a 95% confidence interval and ranged up to a factor of 4.8 around the mean, mainly due to uncertainty associated with removal efficiency. Estimates of whole country product usage were comparable to total market estimates derived from sectorial market sales data with differences ranging from a factor 0.8 (for the Netherlands) to 5 (for the USA). The proposed approach is suitable where measured data on chemical emissions is missing and is applicable for use in risk assessments and chemical footprinting methods when applied to specific product categories.

AB In this work, the combination of membrane bioreactor (MBR) and electro-oxidation (EC)) process was studied for the treatment of a synthetic hospital wastewater fortified with four pharmaceutical pollutants namely carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBU), estradiol (E-E) at a concentration of 10 mu g L-1 venlafaxine (VEN) at 0.2 mu g L-1. Two treatment configurations were studied: EC) process as pre-treatment and post-treatment. Wastewater treatment with MBR alone shows high removal percentages of IBU and E-E (similar to 90%). Unlikely for CBZ and VEN, a low elimination percentage (similar to 10%) was observed. The hydraulic and the solid retention times (HRT and SRT) were 18 h and 140 d respectively, while the biomass concentration in the MBR was 16.5 g L-1. To enhance pharmaceuticals elimination, an ED pretreatment was conducted during 40 min at 2 A. This configuration allowed a 92% removal for VEN, which was far greater than both treatments alone, with lower than 30% and 50% for MBR and E0, respectively. The MBR-EO coupling (EC) as post-treatment) allows high removal percentages (similar to 97%) of the four pharmaceutical pollutants after 40 min of treatment at a current intensity of 0.5 A with Nb/BDO as electrodes. This configuration appears to be very effective compared to the first configuration (EO-MBR) where ED process is used as a pre-treatment. Toxicity assessment showed that the treated effluent of this configuration is not toxic to Daphnia magna except at 100% v/v. The MBR-EO coupling appears to be a promising treatment for contaminated hospital effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug effective against gastrointestinal parasites in humans and animals. Despite the fact that it has been detected in environment (water, sediment and soil), there is no information on its fate in the environment. So, in order to understand the sorption process of albendazole in environment, the sorption mechanism and kinetic properties were investigated through sorption equilibrium and sorption rate experiments. For that purpose, batch sorption of albendazole on five sediment samples and five soil samples from Croatia's region with different physico-chemical properties was investigated. Except physico-chemical properties of used environmental solid samples, the effects of various parameters such as contact time, initial concentration, ionic strength and pH on the albendazole sorption were studied. The K-d parameter from linear sorption model was determined by linear regression analysis, while the Freundlich and Langmuir sorption models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms. The estimated Kd values varied from 29.438 to 104.43 mLg(-1) at 0.01 M CaCl2 and for natural pH value of albendazole solution (pH 6.6). Experimental data showed that the best agreement was obtained with the linear model (R-2 > 0.99), while the rate of albendazole sorption is the best described with the kinetic model of pseudo-second-order. Obtained results point to a medium or even strong sorption of albendazole for soil or sediment particles, which is particularly dependent on the proportion of organic matter, pH, copper and zinc in them.

AB Antibiotic contamination of aqueous environment due to pharmaceutical sewage may lead to development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strain. In this research, elimination of antibiotics from synthetic wastewater was investigated. For this purpose, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were treated by a pilot scale of net-like rotating biological contactor with three compartments, 48 plastic discs with total volume of 78.75 L. This system was continuously operated for about one year at various organic loading rates with different antibiotic dosages. The obtained results indicated that by increasing hydraulic retention time, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was gradually increased. The optimal hydraulic retention time for desired rate of COD removal was 36 h. In addition, the effect of hydraulic retention time, organic load rate and sulfamethoxazole concentration in the removal of sulfamethoxazole and organic matter was assessed. Moreover, the results demonstrated that with increasing in organic load rate, sulfamethoxazole elimination was enhanced. In the next step, simultaneous removal of both antibiotics for constant inlet COD concentration of 8000 mg/L at optimum hydraulic retention time was analysed. The results showed that trimethoprim removal efficiency was approximately 100%, even at high concentration of trimethoprim (50 mg/L). For observation of dominant microorganism, samples of the developed biofilm on rotating biological contactor discs were scanned by scanning electron microscopy. In the first compartment where biomass was exposed to highest concentration of antibiotics, fungus strains were the dominant organism. In the second and third compartment antibiotic-resistant bacteria were the dominant attached living organisms.

AB Phytochemicals are widely present in fruits, vegetables and other plants and have great health benefits owing to their antioxidant properties. They are naturally found in the aquatic environment as well as discharged from sewage treatment plants after their large consumption. Little is known about their impact on fish; particularly in light of their interactions with pharmaceuticals. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of diosmin, naringenin, quercetin and idole-3-carbinol on CYP1A-dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity on rainbow trout hepatic microsomes in the presence of two pharmaceuticals: clotrimazole and dexamethasone. The interactions between the phytochemicals and pharmaceuticals used in this study were determined using a combination index. Hepatic microsomes were exposed to two concentrations (1-or 50 mu M) of phytochemicals and pharmaceuticals separately and in combinations. Singly, clotrimazole inhibited EROD activity 40% and 90% of control, while dexamethasone did not. Naringenin and diosmin inhibited EROD activity alone up to 90% and 55% respectively, but activities were further inhibited in the presence of either pharmaceutical. The preliminary study of combinations of clotrimazole with phytochemicals primarily showed synergistic effects. While EROD activity was not inhibited in the presence of quercetin or indole-3-carbinol, significant and synergistic inhibition was detected when either of these was combined with clotrimazole or dexamethasone.

AB This paper deals with an experimental and modelling study on the electrochemical oxidation of refractory pharmaceuticals using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Different parameters have been investigated, such as the role of salts (sulfates), the presence of other organics, and the influence of applied current intensity. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Salbutamol (SALBU) were used for models of pharmaceuticals, and urea as a model for a common organic. The complete removal of pharmaceuticals was observed in all electrolyses under galvanostatic conditions. The presence of common organic waste or other pharmaceutical has no significant impact on the degradation of the CIP target molecule. A mathematical model predicting the temporal concentration variation of organics with electroxidation time has been developed. In this model, different oxidation pathways have been considered: the transfer of electrons (direct oxidation) or of oxygen atoms via the reaction with either hydroxyl radicals or/and with strong electrogenerated oxidants. Excellent correlation with experiments is obtained under all experimental conditions.

AB The impact and occurrence of wastewater (treated and untreated) derived pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been investigated in small, rural and effluent-dominated tributaries of the lower Ebro River located in the North-Eastern Spain (Catalonia). We have observed the predominant effect of stream flow and consequently dilution factor on the concentration levels of detected PhACs that combined with the absence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) resulted in 12 times higher concentrations in streams with direct discharge of untreated wastewater. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most ubiquitous compounds, in terms of both individual concentration and frequency of detection. In the sites impacted by raw wastewater, acetaminophen and ibuprofen showed the highest concentrations among all analyzed PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 7.78 mu g L-1 and 2.66 mu g L-1, respectively. However, PhACs detected in the sites impacted by treated wastewater showed generally lower concentration levels and frequencies of detection. Also, effluent-dominated streams showed higher concentration levels of PhACs due to a generally lower stream flows and small dilution factors. However, concentration levels of detected PhACs were dependent on the hydraulic travel time and distance from the discharge point and related with the in-stream attenuation. As a result, this study highlights the combined impact of hydrological and chemical stressors on the water quality of the rural Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Industrial fermentations for the production of pharmaceuticals generate large volumes of waste water that can be biologically treated to recover plant nutrients through the application of pharmaceutical-derived wastes to the soil. Nevertheless, benefits and risks associated with their recovery are still unexplored. Thus, the aim of the present work was to characterize three potential organic residues (sludge, anaerobic digestate and compost) derived from the wastewater generated by the daptomycin production process. The main parameters evaluated were the physico-chemical properties, potential contaminants (heavy metals, pathogens and daptomycin residues), organic matter stabilization and the potential toxicity towards soil microorganisms and plants. The results showed that all the studied materials were characterized by high concentrations of plant macronutrients (N, P and K), making them suitable for agricultural reuse. Heavy metal contents and pathogens were under the limits established by European and Italian legislations, avoiding the risk of soil contamination. The compost showed the highest organic matter stabilization within the studied materials, whereas the sludge and the anaerobic digestate were characterized by large amounts of labile organic compounds. Although the pharmaceutical-derived fertilizers did not negatively affect the soil microorganisms, as demonstrated by the enzymatic activities, the sludge and the anaerobic digestate caused a moderate and strong phytotoxicity, respectively. The compost showed no toxic effect towards plant development and, moreover, it positively affected the germination and growth in lettuce and barley. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that the valorization of pharmaceutical-derived materials through composting permits their agricultural reuse and also represents a suitable strategy to move towards a zero-waste production process for daptomycin.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has received wide attention, and they have recently been considered as emerging organic contaminants. Since conventional wastewater processes are not particularly effective, the development of new technology that can completely remove pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments is an urgent need. Recently, iron-copper bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention, and they are known as good Fenton reagents for the degradation of persistent organic pollutants. In this study, yolk-shell structured Fe3O4@SiO2 was prepared via a spontaneous self-transformation process, and it was decorated with copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu) to produce a novel catalyst aimed at the rapid catalytic oxidation of acetaminophen in the heterogeneous Fenton reaction. Different ratios of Fe3O4 and copper were obtained by varying the precursor amounts of yolk-shell and copper salt. The catalyst properties were characterized by several techniques to verify the successful synthesis of the targeted materials. The results demonstrated that the Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu was controllably prepared, copper nanoparticles were firmly immobilized on the mesoporous silica shell, and the decoration of copper did not impact the yolk-shell structure of the precursor material. The catalytic activity of Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu was much better than that of Fe3O4@SiO2 for the degradation of acetaminophen. The catalytic performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu increased with increasing copper content. Radical scavenging studies showed that center dot OH is the main reactive species contributing to acetaminophen degradation. In addition, the catalyst also exhibited good separation and satisfactory regeneration properties. The decoration of copper nanoparticles onto the yolk-shell structure Fe3O4@SiO2 was proved to be an attractive alternative method to obtain a novel bimetallic catalyst applied in heterogeneous Fenton-like system for the removal of persistent pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB This study showed that substituted anilines of environmental concerns could be appreciably degraded by potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) in the pH range of 6-10 with apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) varying from 0.32 to 36,500 M-1 s(-1). The pH-dependence rate curves were well fitted via a kinetic model, which involved the formation of intermediates between Fe(VI) and substituted anilines. The plausible degradation pathways were proposed including the generation of aniline radical cations and their further oxidation to nitrobenzene compounds or dimerization to azobenzene compounds. Humic acid (HA) significantly reduced the transformation rates of substituted anilines with Fe(VI) even though considering the effect of oxidant consumption. This suppression effect likely resulted from the reaction between HA and the aniline radical cation, where the aniline radical cation was turned back to parent compound. Meanwhile, it was found that HA also had an impact on the formation kinetics of oxidation products. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) for degradation of substituted anilines in natural water was evaluated, where background matrix constituents could affect both the kinetics of contaminants degradation and products formation, similar to the case of HA. These results have advanced the understanding of Fe(VI) chemistry involved in water and wastewater treatment.

AB The elimination of organic carbon, nitrogen, five emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and fluorescence signature was evaluated in two treatment lines comprising different constructed wetland (CW) configurations: (i) partially saturated vertical subsurface flow (SVF) wetland (treatment line 1) and (ii) unsaturated vertical subsurface flow (UVF), horizontal subsurface flow (HF) and free water surface (FWS) wetlands in series (treatment line 2). Results showed important differences between the different CW configurations. The highest removal of BOD5 (81%), COD (67%), TOC (72%) and fluorescing organic matter were observed in the UVF wetland, whereas the HF and FWS wetlands were the most efficient units for total nitrogen removal (60 and 69%, respectively). The SVF wetland showed a greater performance in the reduction of total nitrogen than the UVF bed (52 vs. 35%). In addition, the SVF wetland exhibited a higher removal of the EOCs caffeine (95 vs. 90%), trimethoprim (99 vs. 87%) and sulfamethoxazole (64 vs. 4%), as opposed to DEET (34 vs. 63%), whose removal was superior in the UVF unit. Sucralose was negligibly removed in all the CWs. PARAFAC analysis of fluorescence measurements revealed that the proteinaceous tryptophan-like fluorescent component was the most highly removed one in all the investigated CWs (> 28%) and, particularly, in the UVF wetland (66%), whereas humic and fulvic-like components resulted recalcitrant to decomposition. Increases of fluorescence intensities were often observed for fulvic-like substances in CWs operating with saturation of the bed, and these were particularly relevant in the SVF unit. Finally, important correlations (r > 0.7) between the tryptophan-like fluorescent component and the wastewater quality parameters COD and BOD5 suggest fluorescence spectroscopy as an useful monitoring tool for water treatment efficiency in CW systems.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are frequently studied contaminants, their fate in the environment is still not completely clear. During a one year study, a complex approach including water, sediment and fish sampling was used to describe the behaviour of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites (PTMs) in the environment. Eighteen pharmaceuticals and seven of their metabolites were determined in a pond used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was applied to determine the PTMs concentrations in all matrices. Seasonal variations in concentrations were evaluated. The partitioning of contaminants between pond compartments was estimated by means of solid water distribution coefficients (K-d) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for the livers of fish. Ka values were almost stable throughout the year, which may be a sign of the continuous transport of PTMs between water and sediment under the experimental conditions. Almost all of the studied compounds, with exception of sertraline (BAF of 6200), were found to not be bioaccumulative in fish livers. The pond removal efficiency was calculated for all PTMs, and favourable conditions for natural pharmaceutical removal were proposed. Further aspects regarding fish pharmaceutical exposure need to be studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phototransformation of 18 organic micropollutants (OMPs) commonly detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents was examined attempting to explain their fate during UV disinfection in WWTPs. For this purpose, a lab-scale UV reactor (lamp emitting at 254 nm) was used to study the influence of the operational conditions (UV dose, temperature and water matrix) on OMPs abatement and disinfection efficiency. Chemical properties of OMPs and the quality of treated effluent were identified as key factors affecting the phototransformation rate of these compounds. Sampling campaigns were carried out at the inlet and outlet of UV systems of three WWTPs, and the results evidenced that only the most photosensitive compounds, such as sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac, are eliminated. Therefore, despite IN treatment is an effective technology to phototransform OMPs, the UV doses typically applied for disinfection (10-50 mJ/cm(2)) are not sufficient to remove them. Consequently, small modifications (increase of UV dose, use of catalysts) should be applied in WWTPs to enhance the abatement of OMPs in UV systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs), which receive wastewater containing extremely high levels of antibiotics, are regarded as potential hot spots for antibiotic-resistance development in the environment. Six sampling campaigns in six PWWTPs in Southeastern China were carried out to assess the prevalence and fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARCS). Different genes were monitored in different PWWTPs (PWWTP A: lincosamides; PWWTP B: aminoglycosides and macrolides; PWWTP C: quinolones; PWWTP D: macrolides and quinolones; PWWTP E: cephalosporins; and PWWTP F: quinolones and macrolides) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), according to the antibiotic type produced. The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from (1.03 +/- 0.91) x 10(1) to (6.78 +/- 0.21) x 10(7) copies/mL The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for 0%-577% of influents to the six PWWTPs with a median value of 6%. Most of the ARGs are transported to the dewatered sludge, with concentrations from (138 +/- 0.21) x 10(5) to (6.84 +/- 0.43) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). In different treatment units (before/after biological units), a clear trend of proliferation or attenuation was not observed for the ARGs, aside from a strong attenuation in moving bed bio-film reactor (MBBR) in PWWTP C. Through correlation analyses, this study demonstrated that the bacterial abundance and antibiotic concentrations within the PWWTPs influenced the fate of the associated ARGs, and this was possibly related primarily to the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of corresponding ARGs. Macrolide ARGs, which tend to locate in plasmids and transposons, positively correlate weakly with total macrolide antibiotic concentrations but positively correlate strongly with 165 rRNA concentrations. Furthermore, ARC concentrations in the wastewater from fermentation were significantly higher than in the wastewater from chemical synthesis and preparation. This is the first comprehensive study on the behavior of antibiotic resistance genes under extremely high-level antibiotic selection pressures in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWVVTPs) in Southeastern China.

AB This study investigated the potential of biochar filters as a replacement or complement for sand filters for removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater in onsite sewage facilities (OSSF). Specifically, the study investigated the effects of biodegradation, adsorption and a combination of these processes on removal of four model PhACs from wastewater in biochar filters operated under hydraulic loading conditions mimicking those found in onsite infiltration beds. Concentrations and removal of the four PhACs (i.e. carbamazepine, metoprolol, ranitidine and caffeine) were investigated over 22 weeks in four treatments: biochar (BC) with active or inactive biofilm (BC-active-biofilm, BC-inactive-biofilm), biochar without biofilm (BC-no-biofilm) and sand with active biofilm (Sand-active-biofilm). The adsorption of carbamazepine was high in BC-no-biofilm (99% removal after 22 weeks), while biodegradation was very low in Sand-active-biofilm (7% removal after 22 weeks). Removal of carbamazepine in BC-active-biofilm was high and stable over the 22 weeks (>98%), showing a significant role of biofilm in filter biogeneration. However, carbamazepine removal declined over time in BC-inactive-biofilm, from 99% in week 13 to 73% in week 22. Metoprolol was poorly degraded in Sand-active-biofilm (37% after 22 weeks), while adsorption seemed to be the major pathway for removal of metoprolol in biochar. Ranitidine and caffeine were efficiently removed by either adsorption (97% and 9S%, respectively, after 22 weeks) or biodegradation (99% and >99%, respectively, after 22 weeks). In conclusion, biochar is a promising filter medium for OSSF, especially for persistent PhACs such as carbamazepine and metoprolol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental sustainability of a semi-industrial solar photo-Fenton reactor, treating real effluents emanating from a pharmaceutical laboratory, is assessed herein. The life cycle assessment/analysis (LCA) methodology was employed and real life cycle inventory (LCI) data was collected from a ferrioxalate-assisted homogeneous solar photo-Fenton wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), at Ciudad Real, Spain. Electricity was provided by photovoltaic (PV) panels in tandem with a battery bank, making the plant autonomous from the local grid. The effective treatment of 1 m(3) of secondary-treated pharmaceutical wastewater, containing antipyrine, was used as a functional unit. The main environmental hotspot was identified to be the chemical reagents used to enhance treatment efficiency, mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to a smaller degree oxalic acid. On the other hand, land use, PV panels, battery units, compound parabolic collectors (CPC), tanks, pipes and pumps, as materials, had a low contribution, ranging from as little as 0.06% up to about 2% on the total CO2eq emissions. Overall, the solar photo-Fenton process was found to be a sustainable technology for treating wastewater containing micropollutants at semi-industrial level, since the total environmental footprint was found to be 2.71 kgCO(2) m(-3) or 272 mPt m(-3), using IPCC 2013 and ReCiPe impact assessment methods, respectively. A sensitivity analysis revealed that if the excess of solar power is fed back into the grid then the total environmental footprint is reduced. Depending on the amount of solar power fed back into the grid the process could have a near zero total environmental footprint. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we have evaluated the occurrence and distribution of 78 pharmaceuticals in different aquatic marine environments from the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain) for the first time. The obtained results revealed that pharmaceuticals were present in seawater at total concentrations ranging 61-2133 and 16-189 ng L-1 in coastal and oceanic transects, respectively. Potential marine pollution hotspots were observed in enclosed or semi-enclosed water bodies (Cadiz Bay), showing concentrations that were one or two orders of magnitude higher than in the open ocean. The presence of these chemicals in local sewage treatment plants (STPs), one of the main contamination sources, was also assessed, revealing total concentrations of up to 23 mu g L-1 in effluents. PhACs with the highest detection frequencies and concentrations in the sampling region were analgesics and anti-inflammatories followed by antibiotics in the case of samples from Cadiz Bay or caffeine in oceanic seawater samples. Risk quotients, expressed as ratios between the measured environmental concentration (MEC) and the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) were higher than 1 for two compounds (gemfibrozil and ofloxacin) in effluent of Jerez de la Frontera sewage treatment plant (STP). No high environmental risk was detected in both coastal and oceanic sampling areas, although the information available about the effects of these chemicals on marine biota is still very limited and negative effects on non-target species cannot be discarded.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a pharmaceutical frequently categorized as a recalcitrant pollutant in the aquatic environment. Endophytic bacteria previously isolated from reed plants have shown the ability to promote growth of their host and to contribute to CBZ metabolism.
   In this work, a horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) hairy root (HR) culture has been used as a plant model to study the interactions between roots and endophytic bacteria in response to CBZ exposure. HRs could remove up to 5% of the initial CBZ concentration when they were grown in spiked Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Higher removal rates were observed when HRs were inoculated with the endophytic bacteria Rhizobium radiobacter (21%) and Diaphorobacter nitroreducens (10%). Transformation products resulting from CBZ degradation were identified using liquid chromatography ultra high-resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-UHR-QTOF-MS). CBZ metabolism could be divided in four pathways. Metabolites involving GSH conjugation and 2,3-dihydroxylation, as well as acridine related compounds are described in plants for the first time.
   This study presents strong evidence that xenobiotic metabolism and degradation pathways in plants can be modulated by the interaction with their endophytic community. Hence it points to plausible applications for the elimination of recalcitrant compounds such as CBZ from wastewater in CWs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is one of the most representative characteristics of pollutant in pharmaceutical industry usually has high biological toxicity, making it difficult to treat. In this study, a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was employed to treat THF pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). During the 80-day operating time, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and THF removal efficiencies reached 95.3% and 98.5% when HRT was above 24 h. Mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) in the attached sludge on membrane surface showed a trend of rising on first 28 days (48h-36 h) and then decreasing. Protein is the major component of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) independent of changes in HRT. The study concludes that THF pharmaceutical wastewater can be effectively remedied in the AnMBR system at low HRT. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation filters (VFs), a type of land application system, are a robust technology based on natural treatment mechanisms for the removal of wastewater contaminants. Their capacity to attenuate emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) has not yet been evaluated. The present study reports the results of a 2-year EOC monitoring carried out using a poplar VF receiving wastewater primarily treated by an Imhoff tank. The compounds selected included analgesics, a beta-adrenergic blocker, stimulants, an anticonvulsant, an anti-depressant, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic and analgesic and stimulant metabolites. EOCs were analysed in the Imhoff tank effluent, in the infiltrated water at a depth of 90 cm and in the groundwater at a depth of 10 m. The results demonstrated that EOC attenuation was more significant in the first 90 cm than in the rest of the soil profile. The removal efficiency for all of the selected EOCs was higher than 90% with the exception of ketoprofen, which may pose a higher threat of groundwater contamination. The observed attenuation correlated with the hydrophobicity and charge state of the EOCs. The higher persistence of the metabolites 4-AAA and 4-FAA shows that progression in the degradation pathway does not always imply a mitigation of contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Investigations have focused on the removal and transformation of pharmaceuticals during drinking water and wastewater treatment. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the changes of the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity based on different modes of action (MoAs) during chlorination, chloramination and ozonation processes of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ). The results illustrated that ozonation enhanced the cytotoxicity and the chromosome damage effects on CHO-K1 cells detected by cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay based on high-content screening technique, though ozonation showed the highest removal efficiency for CBZ. Non-target chemical analysis followed by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for the transformation products (TPs) suggested that the chromosomal damage effects could probably be attributed to 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)quinazoline-2-one (BQM) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD). In contrast to CBZ itself and the ozonated sample, the chlorinated and chloraminated samples caused DNA damage effects in SOS/umu test. Acridine, 9 (10) H-acridone, chlorinated 9 (10) H-acridone and TP-237, which were first identified in the chlorination or chloramination processes, were predicted to be the DNA damaging agents. These genotoxic TPs were primarily generated from the oxidation of seven-membered N-heterocyclic in CBZ. This study highlighted the potential adverse effects generated in ozonation process and the oxidation of N-heterocyclic containing pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction was proposed to synthesize porous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to avoid their aggregation in solution. Hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs-OH) were reacted with different concentrations of rigid decafluorobiphenyl (DFB) to form the different CNTs-based adsorbents (CNT-DFB0.9, CNT-DFB1.8, CNT-DFB2.7 and CNT-DFB3.6). Among them, CNT-DFB1.8 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for carbamazepine (CBZ) and tetracycline (TC) due to its higher specific surface area and pore volume than powdered CNTs. The proposed reaction was verified and the textural properties of the CNT-DFB adsorbent were characterized. The CNT-DFB1.8 adsorbent exhibited faster adsorption for CBZ than TC, and the maximum adsorption capacities for CBZ and TC were 403.0 and 456.5 mu mol/g respectively, according to the Langmuir fitting. With the increase of solution pH, TC adsorption on CNT-DFB1.8 decreased while CBZ adsorption increased. In addition, a simple thermal method was applied to regenerate the spent CNT-DFB1.8 by heating in air at 400 degrees C, and the adsorption capacity changed little in the five adsorption cycles. This study provided a novel method to increase the dispersion of CNTs in the prepared adsorbent, showing the potential application for the removal of pharmaceuticals in water or wastewater treatment.

AB This study focuses on the fate of pharmaceuticals discharged into an estuarine environment, particularly into the Turbidity Maximum Zone (TMZ). Batch experiments were set up to investigate the factors regulating the degradation of 53 selected pharmaceuticals. Treated effluents from Bordeaux city (France) were mixed with water from the estuarine Garonne River during 4 weeks under 6 characterized conditions in order to assess the influence of suspended particulates, sterilization, untreated wastewater input and dilution on the degradation kinetics. Of the 53 pharmaceuticals monitored, 43 were quantified at the initial time. Only 7 exhibited a persistent behavior (e.g. carbamazepine, meprobamate) while biotic degradation was shown to be the main attenuation process for 38 molecules (e.g. abacavir, ibuprofen highly degradable). Degradation was significantly enhanced by increasing concentrations of suspended solids. A persistence index based on the half-lives of the compounds has been calculated for each of the 43 pharmaceuticals to provide a practical estimate of their relative stability. The stability of pharmaceuticals in estuarine environments is likely to be highly variable and attenuated primarily by changes in suspended solid concentration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Air and precipitation samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other commercial chemicals within the St. Paul/Minneapolis metropolitan area of Minnesota, U.S. Of the 126 chemicals analyzed, 17 were detected at least once. Bisphenol A, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and cocaine were the most frequently detected; their maximum concentrations in snow were 3.80, 9.49, and 0.171 ng/L and in air were 0.137, 0.370, and 0.033 ng/m(3), respectively. DEET and cocaine were present in samples of rain up to 14.5 and 0.806 ng/L, respectively. Four antibiotics - ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole - were detected at concentrations up to 10.3 ng/L in precipitation, while ofloxacin was the sole antibiotic detected in air at 0.013 ng/m(3). The X-ray contrast agent iopamidol and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen were detected in snow up to 228 ng/L and 3.74 ng/L, respectively, while caffeine was detected only in air at 0.069 and 0.111 ng/m(3). Benzothiazole was present in rain up to 70 ng/L, while derivatives of benzotriazole - 4-methylbenzotriazole, 5-methylbenzotriazole, and 5-chlorobenzotriazole - were detected at concentrations up to 1.5 ng/L in rain and 3.4 ng/L in snow. Nonylphenol and nonylphenol monoethoxylate were detected once in air at 0.165 and 0.032 ng/m(3), respectively. Although the sources of these chemicals to atmosphere are not known, fugacity analysis suggests that wastewater may be a source of nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, DEET, and caffeine to atmosphere. The land-spreading of biosolids is known to generate PM10 that could also account for the presence of these contaminants in air. Micro-pollutant detections in air and precipitation are similar to the profile of contaminants reported previously for surface water. This proof of concept study suggests that atmospheric transport of these chemicals may partially explain the ubiquity of these contaminants in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in natural waters, which act as drinking water sources, raises concerns. Moreover, those compounds incompletely removed by treatment have the chance to form toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during subsequent disinfection. In this study, acetaminophen (Apap), commonly used to treat pain and fever, was selected as a model PPCP. The formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBPs, namely trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, and haloacetamides, during chlor(am)ination of Apap was investigated. Yields of chloroform (CF), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), dicholoacetamide (DCAcAm), and tricholoacetamide (TCAcAm), during chlorination were all higher than from chloramination. The yields of CF continuously increased over 48 h during both chlorination and chloramination. During chlorination, as the chlorine/Apap molar ratios increased from 1 to 20, CF yields increased from 0.33 +/- 0.02% to 2.52 +/- 0.15%, while the yields of DCAN, DCAcAm and TCAcAm all increased then decreased. In contrast, during chloramination, increased chloramine doses enhanced the formation of all DBPs.
   Acidic conditions favored nitrogenous DBP formation, regardless of chlorination or chioramination, whereas alkaline conditions enhanced CF formation. Two proposed formation mechanisms are presented. The analysed DBPs formed during chlorination were 2 orders of magnitude more genotoxic and cytotoxicity than those from chioramination.

AB To optimize removal of organic micropollutants from the water cycle, understanding the processes during activated sludge treatment is essential. In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa, but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for accumulation of ammonium.

AB The limited availability of fresh water is a global crisis. The growing consumption of fresh water due to anthropogenic activities has taken its toll on available water resources. Unfortunately, water bodies are still used as sinks for waste water from domestic and industrial sources. Azo dyes account for the majority of all dye stuffs, produced because they are extensively used in the textile, paper, food, leather, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Bacterial degradation of azo dyes under certain environmental conditions has gained momentum as a method of treatment, as these are inexpensive, eco-friendly, and can be applied to wide range of such complex dyes. The enzymatic approach has attracted much interest with regard to degradation of azo dyes from wastewater. The oxido-reductive enzymes are responsible for generating highly reactive free radicals that undergo complex series of spontaneous cleavage reactions, due to the susceptibility of enzymes to inactivation in the presence of the other chemicals. The oxidoreductive enzymes, such as lignin peroxidase, laccases, tyrosinase, azoreductase, riboflavin reductive, polyphenol oxidase, and aminopyrine n-demethylase, have been mainly utilized in the bacterial degradation of azo dye. Along with the reductive enzymes, some investigators have demonstrated the involvement in some other enzymes, such as Lignin peroxides and other enzymes. This chapter reviews the importance of enzymes in dye degradation.

AB In the last few years, the issue of new dangerous micropollutants, penetrating from municipal wastewater into the environment, which can pose a threat to animals and plants, but also humans, has become very topical. These substances, the originator of which is our developed society, are completely out of the ordinary standards of wastewater treatment, and most of the commonly used purification technology is ineffective against them. The persistent and bioaccumulative nature of these substances brings major risk to wild live plants and animals because it affects their endocrine systems. It causes transcription of DNA and RNA. The immediate danger to humans is primarily the bioaccumulation potential of these substances and their binding to a solid soil matrix where they can be leached into groundwater and contaminated with drink water sources. The escape of these substances into the environment is primarily connected with the abundant use of chemical additives in various industries, with a separate chapter being agriculture, where the massive use of chlorine-based chemical pesticides for long years has completely infested a large amount of soil. Wastewater is one of the main gates of micropollutants entering the aquatic environment, especially those that are part of pharmaceutical products, such as hormonal contraceptives, which contain synthetic hormones that cause severe sexmutagens changes in fish. However, the increased occurrence of micropollutants is not only related to the fact that these substances are abundantly overused, but also that the detection methods were able to capture these substances during the sub 20 years. From the time perspective, we are not yet able to determine their future environmental developments, and we do not know about interactions exist between them and other substances in the frame of sewage and treatment process, when that may induce new substances that can often be more dangerous than origins mother substances. Our aim should, therefore, be to make the processes and technologies for removing these substances from wastewater as efficiently as possible so as to prevent their free distribution to the environment. This section of the publication attempts to summarize the current knowledge of hazardous micropollutants in wastewater and the possibilities of their elimination.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution is becoming an unavoidable environmental issue of emerging concern. As forecasted, the consumption of medicinal drugs and their use in veterinary practice is expected to systematically increase over coming years, resulting in their increased discharge. The most commonly used pharmaceuticals include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen), cardiovascular drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, lipid-regulating agents), antibiotics, oral contraceptives, anti-depressants, immunosuppressive drugs and cytostatics. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are known to partially survive the conventional process of wastewater treatment. In freshwaters, they may undergo photodegradation, biodegradation, sorption to sediments and uptake by organisms. The latter results in metabolism or bioaccumulation, and potential toxicological effects and physiological responses. The magnitude of effects is largely modulated by the concentration of APIs, time of exposure and some environmental factors such as light and nutrient availability. The response to APIs in closely taxonomically related species may be significantly different. The concomitant presence of different APIs usually evokes potentiation of adverse effects. The most serious effects of pharmaceutical pollution evidenced so far for freshwaters include increase in antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, feminization, behavioral changes, and immunosuppression in fish. Beyond any doubt, it is imperative to support systematic research on API detection methods, to monitor the great number of APIs in wastewater, surface and groundwater, and tap water, and to assess the ecological risks arising from their increased presence in the freshwater environment.

AB Activated carbons are considered to be the most successful adsorbent materials due to their high adsorption capacity for the majority of pollutants, e.g. dyes, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, phenols. They possess large surface area, and different surface functional groups, which include carboxyl, carbonyl, phenol, quinone, lactone and other groups bound to the edges of the graphite-like layers. Therefore, they are regarded as good adsorbents both in liquid and gas phases. The most widely used carbonaceous materials for the industrial production of activated carbons are coal, wood and coconut shell. These types of precursors are quite expensive and often imported, in many places; hence making it necessary, particularly for developing countries, to find a cheap and available feedstock for the preparation of activated carbon for use in industry, drinking water purification and wastewater treatment. In order to reduce the synthesis cost of activated carbons, some green final products are recently proposed, using several suitable agricultural by-products (lignocellulosics) - i.e. including olive-waste cakes, cattle-manue compost, bamboo materials, apple pulp, potato peel - as activated carbon precursors. In this chapter, special attention is given to activated carbons based on some of agricultural wastes from the Mediterranean region, which can be characterized as green.

AB Over the centuries, a tremendous increase in human population has placed a demand for industrial growth, which enhanced the disposal of wastewater and resulted in developing a sustainable technology for wastewater treatment. Phenol and its derivatives are the most pondered substantial pollutants generated from pharmaceutical industries, basic organic chemical manufacturing industries, petroleum refineries, petrochemical industries, coal gasification operations, liquefaction process, tannery, pesticide manufacturing industries, and pulp and paper mills, which contain harmful pollutants that are toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Accumulation of phenol even at a lower concentration may be fatal to all living beings in the ecosystem. This chapter includes the overview of phenol pollution, deleterious effects of phenol in the ecosystem, biodegradation of phenols, and significance of engineered microbes for phenol degradation.

AB The interest of consumers and government organizations on improving the quality of food and its impact on human health is growing in recent years. Consuming low-calorie foodstuffs are increasingly demanded, and the presence of artificial sweeteners plays an important role not only in food but also in waste reaching the environment. Analysis of these compounds is important in assessing food safety and quality. This chapter reviews the analytical approaches for the extraction and reliable identification and quantification of most commonly used artificial sweeteners in food, pharmaceutical, and environmental related matrices. The advantages and disadvantages of determination techniques used are described, with special emphasis on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with different approaches, including applications of high resolution mass spectrometry. The possibility of using new materials for efficient extraction, miniaturized extraction techniques, and the potential for quantification of LC-MS/MS techniques are highlighted as future prospects, based on achievements.

AB Nowadays, since the core-shell gold-magnetite nanoparticles include the saturation magnetisation (iron oxide) and plasmon surface (gold shell) properties, they have been considered in biological and biomedicine research areas. In the present work, multifunctional glutathione decorated gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (GSH-AuMNPs) were successfully synthesised and fully characterised. From the absorption peak at 525, the formation of the core-shell GSH-AuMNPs was confirmed. Although the saturation magnetisation value was slightly decreased during the formation process, they were easily recovered through magnetic decantation. The biocompatibility of the synthesised NPs was approved by the cytotoxicity researches. Furthermore, the GSH-AuMNPs indicated a good catalytic activity for the catalytic reduction of 2-nitrophenol by sodium borohydride and reused for six consecutive cycles without a significant decrease in its activity. Overall, this study introduced a unique structure with high catalytic activity, which could provide a useful platform for the biomedical, analytical, catalytic applications and wastewater treatment.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine toxicity of wastewater from hospitals in the Czech Republic using traditional and alternative toxicological methods. The pilot study comprised weekly dynamics of sewage ecotoxicity of treated wastewater from one hospital in two different seasons. A detailed investigation of wastewater ecotoxicity, genotoxicity and reprotoxicity followed in five different hospitals.
   METHODS: The seven following bioassays were used in this study: algal growth inhibition test (ISO 8692), Vibrio fischeri test (ISO 11348-2), Daphnia magna acute toxicity test (ISO 6341), Allium cepa assay, Ames test (OECD TG 471), Comet assay and YES/YAS assay.
   RESULTS: The wastewater ecotoxicity during one week showed no differences in separate working days, however, higher toxicity values were recorded in May compared to November. In the following study, samples from two of the five hospitals were classified as toxic, the others as non toxic. Genotoxicity has not been confirmed in any sample. In several cases, wastewater samples exhibited agonist activity to the estrogen and androgen receptors.
   CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated different levels of toxicity of treated hospital wastewater. Variable sensitivity of individual bioassays for tested wastewater samples was recognized. A more extensive study including proposal for improvement of hospital wastewater treatment within the Czech Republic can be recommended with the aim to decrease the discharge of toxic chemicals into the local sewage system and the environment.

AB Water scarcity is one of the main problems faced by many countries. In order to increase water supply in some regions, reuse of wastewater is proposed. With the purpose of obtaining safe water, more treatment has to be used. Among other pollutants, pharmaceutically active compounds and their metabolites are frequently detected in water subjected to conventional treatments. To remove them, advanced treatments should be used. Some of them are still at lab scale while others are used already at real scale. Here we review the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants with conventional treatment and also in advanced treatments applied at lab and real scale to treat wastewater.

AB Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate of species which are adapted to cold freshwater ecosystems. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46 degrees N, 10 degrees E; 1799 m asl) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. Larvae of this species were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 h to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (STP/10, STP/100, STP/1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the STP/10 effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.

AB Acute toxicity and genotoxic activity of 11 pollutants were investigated in wild populations of Diamesa cinerella and Diamesa zernyi (Diptera Chironomidae) from two alpine streams (Italian Alps). D. cinerella was collected in two sites on the non-glacial Vermigliana stream, 50 m-upstream and 5-m downstream of the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) at the Tonal Pass (1799 m a.s.l.). D. zernyi was collected in the Presena glacial stream, close to the glacier snout (2685 m a.s.l.). IV-instar larvae were exposed for 24-96 h to increasing concentrations of three drugs (ibuprofen-IBU, furosemide-FUR, trimethoprim-TMP), three personal care products (triclocarban-TCC, tonalid-TON, sucralose-SUCR), and five pesticides (boscalid-BOS, captan-CAP, chlorpyrifos-CPS, metolachlor-MET, terbuthylazine-TER). The experimental concentrations were from one to several million times higher than the highest environmental concentration (EC) measured in the study sites. Two mixtures of pesticides were also prepared: MIX 1K=10(3) x EC of CPS, MET and TER, and MIX 10K=10(4) x EC of CPS, MET and TER. Species-and site-specific responses were observed for both tests. On the basis of survival data, both species resulted very resistant to pharmaceuticals (mainly to FUR for which no effects on survival and movement or pupation were observed), and more sensitive to pesticides (mainly to CPS, MET and CAP). Genotoxicity tests (Comet assay) highlighted a WTP effect under natural conditions and a genotoxic effect for 9 of the 11 tested compounds. Overall, a clear gradient of increasing resistance in larvae from the least (PR0) to the most polluted (TP_dw) site was highlighted by both tests, ecotoxicological and of genotoxicity, as also expected according to species autecology (D. zernyi is restricted to very cold and pristine habitats). D. cinerella living downstream of the effluent accumulates a significantly higher DNA damage than the other populations, highlighting a basal physiological stress condition in nature. It is plausible that these larvae possess chemical resistance strategies to survive already under natural conditions. Diamesa spp. exhibited a higher toxic resistance than any other model species tested to date under the same pollutants, probably associable to its strong cold resistance. The results emphasised that the measured concentrations of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and pesticides seem to be far below those required to cause acute effects. However, the effects on freshwater communities of prolonged exposure to mixture of trace CECs and pesticides remain unknown.

AB The occurrence, fate, mass loading and environmental emission of 37 pharmaceuticals were studied through an integrated approach involving both dissolved and adsorbed phase at a typical wastewater treatment plant in Hunan Province, Southern China. The results displayed the prevalence of 24 and 23 compounds in dissolved phase of influent and effluent, respectively. Fourteen compounds were found adsorbed onto sludge with a mean concentration ranging from 0.85 to 2900 mu g/kg dry weight. Twelve compounds exhibited high adsorption potential onto suspended particulate matter (SPM) with a mean fraction ranging from 8.8% (trimethoprim) to 97% (tetracycline). Furthermore, SPM showed a diverse absorbability in influent and effluent water circumstance. The overall elimination varied from -16% for lincomycin to 99% for paracetamol, while macrolides were able to withstand the whole treatment process. Mass balance analysis indicated that degradation was the predominant removal pathway for most compounds, and adsorption onto sludge combined with a minor portion of degradation explained for the reduction of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas macrolides were recalcitrant to both two processes. The total mass loading was estimated to be up to 2800 mg/d/1000 inhabitants and most compounds exhibited lower or comparable level comparing to the global published data. The total environmental emission was estimated up to be 1000 mg/d/1000 inhabitants, and a value of 650 mg/d/1000 inhabitants was obtained when considering merely the dissolved phase. This work would be helpful for the better understanding of ultimate fate and real pollution of pharmaceuticals in the water environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase, probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main biological removal processes.

AB Biological nitrogen removal from industrial wastewater (pharmaceutical synthetic wastewater) was studied. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) were utilized to treat ammonium-rich wastewater. No external carbon source was added to the reactors. At nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 2.5 kg N/(m(3).day), the efficiency of ammonium removal from synthetic wastewater in SBR was 86.9%. SBBR ammonium removal efficiency under fixed dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 0.3 mg O-2/dm(3) was 98.4%. Specific nitrification rate (SNR) and specific denitrification rate (SDNR) in SBR were 9.24 mg NH4+-N/(g MLVSS.h) and 18.56 mg NO3--N/(g MLVSS.h), respectively. Nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) showed high correlation with DO decrement (R-2 = 0.983), NAR and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) had high correlation, too (R-2 = 0.976). SND efficiency in SBBR reached 94.1% while ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were dominant and NAR in SBBR process at the DO level of 0.3 mg O-2/dm(3) was 90.3%.

AB Currently, there is increasing awareness regarding the effect of antibiotics on various organisms in the ecosystem even though they may occur at relatively low concentration. Thus, their concentration needs to be quantified precisely in various matrices including ground water, surface water, and municipal wastewater. The use of liquid chromatography together with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-LC-MS/MS) has enhanced the reliability, accessibility, and accuracy with which antibiotics can be detected. In the present study, a HR-LC-MS/MS-based method was developed for four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, azithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole). Initially, various mobile phases and LC columns were evaluated. The effect of solution pH, drying time of cartridge, and solvent used in the concentration step on recovery of antibiotics during solid-phase extraction (SPE) was also evaluated. Subsequently, the recovery of antibiotics from influent and effluent wastewater samples, obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in India, was determined based on the matrix spike method. The results revealed that for these wastewater samples even the use of structurally similar, isotopically labelled (deuterated) standards could not adequately improve the recovery of target antibiotics.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWIN) and application of biosolids to arable land expose the agro-environment to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) which can be taken up by crops. In this project, we studied the effect of a carrier medium (e.g., biosolids and TWW) on plant (tomato, wheat and lettuce) uptake, translocation and metabolism of carbamazepine as a model for non-ionic PPCPs. Plant uptake and bioconcentration factors were significantly lower in soils amended with biosolids compared to soils irrigated with TWW. In soils amended with biosolids and irrigated with TWW, the bioavailability of carbamazepine for plant uptake was moderately decreased as compared to plants grown in soils irrigated with TWW alone. While TWW acts as a continuous source of PPCPs, biosolids act both as a source and a sink for these compounds. Moreover, it appears that decomposition of the biosolids in the soil after amendment enhances their adsorptive properties, which in turn reduces the bioavailability of PPCPs in the soil environment In-plant metabolism of carbamazepine was found to be independent of environmental factors, such as soil type, carrier medium, and absolute amount implemented to the soil, but was controlled by the total amount taken up by the plant.

AB The guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) recommend the use of standard ecotoxicity assays and the assessment of endpoints at the individual level to evaluate potential effects of PPCP on biota. However, effects at the sub-individual level can also affect the ecological fitness of marine organisms chronically exposed to PPCP. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the environmental risk of two PPCP in marine sediments: triclosan (TCS) and ibuprofen (IBU), using sub-individual and developmental endpoints. The environmental levels of TCS and IBU were quantified in marine sediments from the vicinities of the Santos submarine sewage outfall (Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at 15.14 and 49.0 ng g(-1), respectively. A battery (n = 3) of chronic bioassays (embryo-larval development) with a sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus) and a bivalve (Perna perna) were performed using two exposure conditions: sediment-water interface and elutriates. Moreover, physiological stress through the Neutral Red Retention Time Assay (NRRT) was assessed in the estuarine bivalve Mytella charruana exposed to TCS and IBU spiked sediments. These compounds affected the development of L. variegatus and P. perna (75 ng g(-1) for TCS and 15 ng g(-1) for IBU), and caused a significant decrease in M. charruana lysosomal membrane stability at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.08 ng g(-1) for TCS and 0.15 ng g(-1) for IBU). Chemical and ecotoxicological data were integrated and the risk quotient estimated for TCS and IBU were higher than 1.0, indicating a high environmental risk of these compounds in sediments. These are the first data of sediment risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products of Latin America. In addition, the results suggest that the ERA based only on individual-level and standard toxicity tests may overlook other biological effects that can affect the health of marine organisms exposed to PPCP.

AB The emerging organic micro-pollutants (EMOPs) cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes. In this paper, the most commonly detected EMOPs in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants, including trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, triclosan and methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, were selected to acclimate activated sludge, to enhance the biodegradation of EMOPs. The results showed that the acclimated activated sludge can significantly enhance the removal of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, triclosan and methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, but slightly improve the degradation of carbamazepine. The distribution of six EMOPs between water and sludge phases demonstrated that biodegradation made a major contribution to their removal. The maximal degradation rate constants were determined to be 0.9028 (sulfamethoxazole), 0.5374 (trimethoprim), 0.4123 (triclosan), 0.3544 (diclofenac), 0.2534 (methyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate) and 0.0224 (carbamazepine). Degradation intermediate products were detected in water phase at the end of the acclimation process through the comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography figures before and after the acclimation process, suggesting that degradation products of EMOPs might be in the effluents. In summary, the acclimation of activated sludge could be an option for removing EMOPs, and more attention should be paid to the degradation products of EMOPs in the effluent.

AB The paper presents a study on the treatment of the furniture industry wastewater in a bench scale advanced oxidation reactor. The researched technology utilized a simultaneous application of ozone, ultraviolet radiation and surface-immobilized TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst. Various combinations of processes were tested, including photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, catalytic ozonation, photolytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation were tested against the efficiency of degradation. The efficiency of the processes was primarily characterized by the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, indicating the remaining organic material in the wastewater after the treatment, while the toxicity changes in wastewater were researched by Daphnia magna toxicity tests. Photocatalytic ozonation was confirmed as the most effective combination of processes (99.3% of TOC reduction during 180min of treatment), also being the most energy efficient (4.49-7.83MJ/g). Photocatalytic ozonation and photolytic ozonation remained efficient across a wide range of pH (3-9), but the pH was an important factor in photocatalysis. The toxicity of wastewater depended on the duration of the treatment: half treated water was highly toxic, while fully treated water did not possess any toxicity. Our results indicate that photocatalytic ozonation has a high potential for the upscaling and application in industrial settings.

AB Three cancerostatic platinum compounds (CPCs) including cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are complexes of Pt and classified as probable carcinogenic compounds to humans. This study aimed to perform health risk assessment of platinum cytotoxic drugs for drinking water by developing a sensitive analytical method in the water resource of Qom Province in the central part of Iran. Concentrations of the platinum drugs were determined, including 052 +/- 0.2 mu g/L for cisplatin, 0.94 +/- 0.36 mu g/L for carboplatin and 0.27 +/- 0.16 mu g/L for oxaliplatin in influent samples, and 0.24 +/- 0.07 mu g/L for cisplatin, 0.28 +/- 0.05 mu g/L for carboplatin and 0.11 +/- 0.01 mu g/L for oxaliplatin in effluent samples. The results indicated that in all the well water samples related to the groundwater, the concentration of the platinum-based compounds was lower than the calculated limits of quantification (LOQ); the concentration of cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin across the samples in the station of drinking water distribution was also below the limits of detection (LOD). The resulting margin of exposure (MOE) is lower than one (MOE < 1) for the three groups including children, pregnant women and lactation women related to cisplatin and carboplatin was determined through exposure to raw and untreated drinking water. Further research is recommended to be conducted in this area, particularly environmental fate of metabolites and transformation products.

AB BACKGROUNDPiroxicam (PRX) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain and swelling of conditions like arthritis. PRX has been extensively detected in seawater, surface, and sewage waters worldwide and therefore its efficient treatment is an issue of emerging concern. In this work, the sonochemical degradation of PRX was investigated.
   RESULTSAll experiments were conducted at constant ultrasound frequency of 20kHz while the following range of experimental conditions was investigated: initial PRX concentration 320-960 mu g L-1, ultrasound power density 20-60W L-1, temperature 20-60 degrees C, reaction time up to 60min. The effect of different water matrices, namely surface water (SW), bottled water (BW), ultrapure water (UPW) and humic acid (HA) aqueous solution on process efficiency was also explored. It was found that PRX degradation reached 96% after only 10min of treatment under the best conditions (i.e. [PRX](0)=320mg L-1, 20 degrees C, 36W L-1) assayed. Power density could positively affect PRX degradation. Nevertheless, PRX degradation decreased when its initial concentration and the temperature of the bulk liquid was increased. PRX degradation was found to decrease, in different water matrices, in the order: UPW>5mg L-1 HA>BW>10mg L-1 HA>SW. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 14 transformation by-products (TBPs) were formed and subsequently degraded during treatment while the PRX degradation pathways were also elucidated.
   CONCLUSIONAt the optimal operating conditions assayed, PRX was efficiently degraded after about 10min of sonochemical oxidation, thus rendering it a promising technology for the treatment of xenobiotics. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This study investigates the mineralization efficiency, i.e. removal of total organic carbon (TOC) in hospital wastewater by direct ozonation, ozonation with UV radiation (O-3/UV), homogeneous catalytic ozonation (O-3/Fe2+) and homogeneous photocatalytic ozonation (O-3/Fe2+/UV). The influence of pH and reaction time was evaluated. For the best process, toxicity and degradation efficiency of the selected pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) were determined. The results showed that the PhCs detected in the hospital wastewater were completely degraded when the mineralization efficiency reached 54.7% for O-3/UV with 120minutes of reaction time using a rate of 1.57g O-3 h(-1). This process also achieved a higher chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency (64.05%), an increased aromaticity reduction efficiency (81%) and a toxicity reduction.

AB A method for simultaneous analysis of ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV) and norfloxacin (NOR) in mangrove sediment was developed using aqueous ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). The method showed excellent linear correlation coefficient for the three fluoroquinolones (r(2) > 0.999) using external calibration curve and good recovery in real sediment samples ranging from 73.73 to 88.85%. The precision showed a relative standard deviation lower than 20% and detection limits of 1.10, 3.33 and 0.26 mu g kg(-1) to CIP, LEV and NOR, respectively. There was no presence of interfering. After validation, the method was applied in the determination of pharmaceuticals in mangrove sediment in the Paciencia River, Maranhao Island, Brazil. Only the CIP antibiotic was found in three of six samples analyzed, with values ranging 56.55-70.45 mu g kg(-1).

AB This article presents the results of an investigation into the function of UV in a photo-assisted ozonation process for treatment of carbamazepine (CBZ) in treated domestic wastewaters. Experiments were conducted on synthetic spiked water and secondary treated municipal wastewater. Degradation of CBZ was studied for various combination of O-3 dosage ranging from 4.8 to 14.4mg/h and UV intensities with varying intensity and wavelength (UVC: =254nm and UVA: 352nm). In synthetic spiked water, CBZ was degraded to below detectable limits within 0.5min for ozone dose of 14.4mg/h. The rate of degradation of CBZ increased exponentially with increase in ozone dose following a zero-order rate at each dose level. The degradation rate of CBZ in wastewater was slower compared to deionized water (DI) water by 40-75% for various doses of ozone, presumably due to the presence of organic matter remaining in treated wastewater. Optimal UV intensities for UVA and UVC were obtained as 0.62 and 0.82mW/cm(2) for all doses of ozone in synthetic spiked water samples and UV intensities beyond this resulted in lower rates of degradation of CBZ. For photo-assisted ozonation with ozone doses of 9.6 and 14.4mg/L, rate constants were two times higher for UVA irradiations as compared to UVC irradiation. Contrary to observations in DI water, experiments in wastewater showed increase in rate of degradation with higher UV intensities. Overall, photo-assisted ozonation was found to be appropriate for both water and wastewater treatment by exploiting the benefit of direct attack of ozone and of produced (OH)-O-center dot radicals to yield a greater extent of mineralization of CBZ.

AB From the application of concepts derived from the gas-liquid absorption film model, the competition between ozone reactions with 72 water emerging or priority contaminants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) and the initiation steps of the hydroxyl radical decomposition of ozone in ozone alone and combined with hydrogen peroxide oxidation systems has been studied. With this information, the ozone preferential reaction, that is, the ozone direct reaction or the formation of free radicals and the kinetic absorption regime are known. In a second step, the ratio of removal rates of the contaminants studied by reacting with hydroxyl radical and ozone has also been estimated. With this, the way contaminants are preferentially removed (from their reaction with ozone or from the reaction with free radicals) can also be known and, hence, whether or not an ozone advanced oxidation system is convenient to be applied. For instance, most of the contaminants studied in this work at concentrations lower than 50gL(-1) and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations lower than 50mgL(-1) react with ozone under chemical control regime so that both direct and free radical reactions theoretically compete. However, under chemical control, typical concentration of scavengers present in wastewater or surface water would inhibit the free radical reactions and, at least theoretically, for many contaminants studied here, the direct ozone reaction is the principal removal way. When mass transfer controls the process rate only contaminants with a hydroxyl and ozone rate constant ratio 1.6x10(6) M(-1)s(-1) would be preferentially removed through free radical way.

AB A complex treatment of process wastewaters (PWW) of the pharmaceutical industry has been elaborated, the objective was their common disposal and utilization. The biodegradability of polluting components is concentration dependent, the mixing of PWWs with domestic wastewater at WWTP is possible, if no toxic and/or non-biodegradable components are present. So the organic content can serve as carbon source in the denitrification step. The characterization and the proper treatment methods of PWWs have been developed. Only 20-30 % of PWWs required pretreatment. The majority can be mixed directly with the domestic wastewater and send to the WWTP. The characterization includes COD, TOC, BOD, AOX, volatile content, toxicity, metal ion content measurements. The pretreatment methods could be: distillation, WO or catalytic WO. After the activated sludge treatment the degradation of emergent pollutants and the disinfection can be performed by UV-Fenton or high energy irradiation. The design of a complex treatment plant attached to a WWTP of 100000 m(3)/day capacity and its life-cycle analysis to determine the environmental benefits were carried out also.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed for the removal of antibiotics. Thus, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of antibiotics in wastewater treatment processes. However, most of these investigations did not consider the antibiotic contamination in the receiving waters. This study investigated the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in a wastewater treatment plant and the ecological risks posed by surface water receiving the effluent discharge. The results indicated that the levels of 18 antibiotics in the influent ranged from 37.21 ngL(-1) to 2935.40 ngL(-1), and sulfamethizole (SMZ) was the major component among the 18 antibiotics; SMZ occurred most frequently and at the highest concentrations. Mass balance analysis was performed to explore the mechanisms of antibiotic removal, and the findings indicated that biotic and abiotic degradation are the major removal mechanisms; however, removal of quinolones is primarily ascribed to sludge adsorption. Because activated sludge consists of negatively charged colloidal particles, it is more inclined to adsorb quinolones, which contain positively charged nitrogen atoms. The resulting loading of antibiotics from WWTP effluent discharge into the receiving water of the Yangjie River may result in their uptake by aquatic organisms and thus poses a risk to human health.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of synthetic antibiotics with a broad active spectrum towards mycoplasma and bacteria (both Gram positive and negative). The contamination of environmental water samples with FQs has been a concern due to the extensive use of them in the veterinary and pharmaceutical industries. Reliable and simple analytical methods are needed for the monitoring of these FQs. An off-line procedure of immunoaffinity extraction (IAE) followed by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectroscopy (CE-MS) has been developed for simultaneous determination of eight typical FQs in environment water. A broad-specific polyclonal antibody was home-prepared and immobilized on a Sepharose 4B stationary phase for sample affinity extraction and the enrichment factor of our columns was about 100. CE-MS was subsequently applied to FQs separation and quantification. The immunoaffinity column was evaluated in the parameters of selectivity, binding capacity, elution protocol, and recovery. Under the optimized conditions, the developed method was successfully applied to analyze FQs spiked with 2.5 nM to 30 nM of environmental water from a local lake, providing satisfactory recoveries from 72% to 112%, and LODs and LOQs ranging from 1.2 nM to 5.0 nM and 4.0 nM to 17 nM, respectively.

AB In this work, a new clean-up and pre-concentration method based on disk solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed to determine multi-class pharmaceutical residues covering a wide range of polarities (logK(ow) values from -0.5 to 5.1) in water systems, prior to ultra-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analyses. Electrospray ionisation in positive and negative modes was used for the simultaneous determination of both acidic and basic pharmaceuticals. The performances of disk SPE and cartridge SPE were compared. The targeted pharmaceutical compounds list included bronchodilators, antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, a lipid-lowering agent, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Based on our results, the disk SPE demonstrated a higher sensitivity and recovery value and less analysis time as compared to the cartridge SPE method. The limits of detection (LOD) for the new method ranged from 0.02-3.2 ng L-1, 0.02-3.1 ng L-1 and 0.02-4.7 ng L-1 for tap, effluent and influent wastewater, respectively. The method's absolute recovery values ranged from 70% to 122% for tap water, 62% to 121% for effluent wastewater and 62% to 121% for influent wastewater, except for metformin in which the absolute recovery value was approximately 48% for all samples. Intra-day precision for tap water, effluent and influent wastewater ranged from 3-12%, 4-9% and 2-8%, respectively. The method developed was applied for the determination of targeted pharmaceuticals in tap, effluent, and influent wastewater from one hospital treatment plant in Malaysia. The results revealed that the highest concentrations of certain pharmaceuticals were up to 49424 ng L-1 (acetaminophen) and 1763 ng L-1 (caffeine) in the influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. The results also showed a variation in the treatment efficiencies for the hospital treatment plant from one compound to another. Nevertheless, the removal efficiencies ranged from 0-99%.

AB The contribution of the sorption processes in the elimination of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) during the fungal treatment of wastewater has been evaluated in this work. The sorption of four PhACs (carbamazepine, diclofenac, iopromide and venlafaxine) by 6 different fungi was first evaluated in batch experiments. Concentrations of PhACs in both liquid and solid (biomass) matrices from the fungal treatment were measured. Contribution of the sorption to the total removal of pollutants ranged between 3% and 13% in relation to the initial amount. The sorption of 47 PhACs in fungi was also evaluated in a fungal treatment performed in 26 days in a continuous bioreactor treating wastewater from a veterinary hospital. PhACs levels measured in the fungal biomass were similar to those detected in conventional wastewater treatment (WWTP) sludge. This may suggest the necessity of manage fungal biomass as waste in the same manner that the WWTP sludge is managed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nanocomposite was characterized utilizing FT-IR spectroscopy, FESEM microscopy, EDX and XPS spectroscopy. Under the optimum conditions, a high adsorption capacity (31 mg g(-1)) was obtained toward naproxen at pH 5. The adsorption process was evaluated using isotherms; the Freundlich isotherm suggested a multilayer adsorption pattern for naproxen. Free energy confirmed a physisorption mechanism between naproxen and adsorbent. Lastly, the field application was performed in wastewater which obtained high removal efficiency percentages (83-94%).

AB Anthropogenic contamination of water resources with micro-organic pollutants has become a heightened concern as many of these compounds have been shown to have estrogen-like action on organismal function. Recent studies have demonstrated that wastewater effluent released to the environment contains estrogen at biologically relevant levels. It is therefore imperative to meet the demand for real-time/on-site detection of environmental estrogen. However, the technology that is currently used for this purpose is expensive, technically complicated, and not available for estrogen level determination at contaminated sites. The primary objective of this paper is to review the present-day technology involved in the design of a robust and rapid Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC), a device that automates multiple functions into a single integrated circuit, which could be implemented for the detection of estrogen in environmental water samples. This paper concisely encompasses different branches of science, e.g. micro/nano-bioelectronics, environmental health, toxicology, and biochemistry to analyze the underlying system dynamics of a LOC for viable detection of environmental pollutants. Particularly, we discuss the detection of environmental estrogen by piezoresistive microcantilever sensor and integration of the sensor with alternating current electrokinetics in a microfluidic chamber.

AB In this study, treatment of an antibiotic compound amoxicillin by medium-high frequency ultrasonic irradiation and/or ozonation has been studied. Ultrasonic irradiation process was carried out in a batch reactor for aqueous amoxicillin solutions at three different frequencies (575, 861 and 1141 kHz). The applied ultrasonic power was 75 W and the diffused power was calculated as 14.6 W/L. The highest removal was achieved at 575 kHz ultrasonic frequency (>99%) with the highest pseudo first order reaction rate constant 0.04 min(-1) at pH 10 but the mineralization achieved was around 10%. Presence of alkalinity and humic acid species had negative effect on the removal efficiency (50% decrease). To improve the poor outcomes, ozonation had been applied with or without ultrasound. Ozone removed the amoxicillin at a rate 50 times faster than ultrasound. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect, coupling of ozone and ultrasound gave rise to rate constant of 2.5 min(-1) (625 times higher than ultrasound). In the processes where ozone was used, humic acid did not show any significant effect because the rate constant was so high that ozone has easily overcome the scavenging effects of natural water constituents. Furthermore, the intermediate compounds, after the incomplete oxidation mechanisms, has been analyzed to reveal the possible degradation pathways of amoxicillin through ultrasonic irradiation and ozonation applications. The outcomes of the intermediate compounds experiments and the toxicity was investigated to give a clear explanation about the safety of the resulting solution. The relevance of all the results concluded that hybrid advanced oxidation system was the best option for amoxicillin removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely detected recalcitrant pharmaceutical in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent, has been studied in the present work using combination of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Due to its recalcitrant nature, it cannot be removed effectively by the conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which make CBZ a pharmaceutical of very high environmental relevance and impact as well as stressing the need for developing new treatment schemes. In the present study, the effect of inlet pressure (3-5 bar) and operating pH (3-11) on the extent of degradation have been initially studied with an objective of maximizing the degradation using HC alone. The established optimum conditions as pressure of 4 bar and pH of 4 resulted in maximum degradation of CBZ as 38.7%. The combined approaches of HC with ultraviolet irradiation (HC + UV), hydrogen peroxide (HC + H2O2), ozone (HC + O-3) as well as combination of HC, H2O2 and O-3 (HC + H2O2 + O-3) have been investigated under optimized pressure and operating pH. It was observed that a significant increase in the extent of degradation is obtained for the combined operations of HC + H2O2 + O-3, HC + O-3, HC + H2O2, and HC + UV with the actual extent of degradation being 100%, 91.4%, 58.3% and 52.9% respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed that degradation of CBZ fitted into first order kinetics model for all the approaches. The processes were also compared on the basis of cavitational yield and also in terms of total treatment cost. Overall, it has been demonstrated that combined process of HC, H2O2 and O-3 can be effectively used for treatment of wastewater containing CBZ.

AB This paper deals with the photochemical fate of two representative carbapenem antibiotics, namely imipenem and meropenem, in aqueous solutions under solar radiation. The analytical method employed for the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices, such as ultrapure water, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, and river water, at environmentally relevant concentrations, was liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry. The absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at pH values from 6 to 8, and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm, while their molar absorption coefficient was in the order from 9 x 10(3)-10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1). The kinetics of the photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors. It was found that the photochemical degradation of both compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10(-3) mol einsten(-1). Several parameters were studied, such as solution pH, the presence of nitrate ions and humic acids, and the effect of water matrix. In all cases, it was found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly, either positively or negatively, to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation. In a final set of photolysis experiments, the effect of the level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 W m(-2).

AB The electrochemical degradation of tetracaine hydrochloride has been studied in urban wastewater. Treatments in simulated matrix with similar ionic composition as well as in 0.050 M Na2SO4 were comparatively performed. The cell contained an air-diffusion cathode for H2O2 electrogeneration and an anode selected among active Pt, IrO2-based and RuO2-based materials and non-active boron-doped diamond (BDD). Electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) were comparatively assessed at pH 3.0 and constant current density. The pharmaceutical and its byproducts were oxidized by center dot OH formed from water oxidation at the anode surface and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction, which occurred upon addition of 0.50 mM Fe2+ in all media, along with active chlorine originated from the anodic oxidation of Cl- contained in the simulated matrix and urban wastewater. The PEF process was the most powerful treatment regardless of the electrolyte composition, owing to the additional photolysis of intermediates by UVA radiation. The use of BDD led to greater mineralization compared to other anodes, being feasible the total removal of all organics from urban wastewater by PEE at long electrolysis time. Chlorinated products were largely recalcitrant when Pt, IrO2-based or RuO2-based anodes were used, whereas they were effectively destroyed by BDD(center dot OH). Tetracaine decay always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics, being slightly faster with the RuO2-based anode in Cl- media because of the higher amounts of active chlorine produced. Total nitrogen and concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, ClO3-, Clog and active chlorine were determined to clarify the behavior of the different electrodes in PEF. Eight intermediates were identified by GC-MS and fumaric and oxalic acids were quantified as final carboxylic acids by ion-exclusion HPLC, allowing the proposal of a plausible reaction sequence for tetracaine mineralization by PEF in Cl--containing medium.

AB The performance of a biomass adapted to Oncological Ward Wastewater (OWW) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared with that of a municipal WWTP, on the removal of pharmaceutical molecules and more specifically on their overall resistance and purifying ability in the presence of pharmaceutical cocktails. Sorption and biotransformation mechanisms on two antineoplastics, one antibiotic and a painkiller were evaluated. Sludge acclimated to OWW allowed for a 34% increase in the removal rate and in the minimum inhibition concentration. The percentage of the amounts of specific pharmaceutical compounds removed by biotransformation or by sorption were measured. These results are positive, as they show that the observed removal of pharmaceutical molecules by biomass acclimated to OWW can mostly be attributed to developed biotransformation, unlike the biomass from the municipal WWTP for which sorption is sometimes the only removal mechanism. The biotransformation kinetic and the solid-water distribution coefficients in this study show good agreement with literature data, even for much higher pharmaceutical concentrations in OWW.

AB As attention is drawn towards the monitoring of the so-called emerging pollutants, some common household chemicals are not well researched. Household antimicrobials can also present wastewater treatment challenges if not taken cognisance of. Herein we report the application of a recently reported coupled dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) with supported liquid phase micro-extraction (LPME) for the extraction of triclosan from wastewater. A univariate approach was used to investigate various parameters amenable to DLLME while no attempt was made to optimise the LPME, achieving the following optimum conditions: 25 mu L of a 1:1 toluene-chloroform mixture with 10% sodium chloride into 1 mL aqueous triclosan solutions and extraction time of 15 min achieving an enrichment efficiency 167 times the reference solution prepared with distilled water, good linearity (R-2 = 0.9946) with the estimated limit of detection at 0.013 mu g/mL and good repeatability (%RSD <= 10). The method showed considerable ruggedness with a similar linearity (R-2 = 0.9957) and repeatability (%RSD < 10), with only the limit of detection being compromised (0.31 mu g/mL) when applied to a wastewater sample using a matrix-matched standard addition approach. Although the GC-FID method detected triclosan in the wastewater sample, the results were negated by those from the GC-MS; as such it therefore could not be concluded with confidence whether the water contained any triclosan or not. However, the results demonstrated the potential of this method in determination of triclosan in water-based samples when the extraction was coupled to a more rugged system such as a GC-MS.

AB Hormones in water samples have been classified as 'emerging pollutants' and may pose a potential risk for humans. Hormones can be found in both surface and ground water at low concentrations. These compounds enter water streams through wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and may elicit endocrine disruption to organisms. As a result of the low concentrations, a suitable analytical methodology is essential for their determination. In the past, residues of oestrogens in aqueous and solid environmental samples have commonly been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with mass spectrometry (MS). However, the necessary derivatisation steps are not only time consuming and laborious but also tedious. The first part of this case study was to develop a method to determine trace concentrations of the estrone (E1), 17 alpha-estradiol (E2 alpha), 17-beta-estradiol (E2 beta) and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormones using reverse phase ultra-fast liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UFLC). Using the developed method, the second part of the case study was to determine the concentrations of the hormones in raw and treated potable water samples from the Vaal River catchment area in the south of Johannesburg, South Africa. Analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE C-18 sorbent) cartridges and subsequently injected into ultra-fast liquid chromatography with the reverse phase column coupled to mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS) for analyte determinations. The limits of quantification were in the range of 0.24 to 0.32 ng center dot L-1 for the analytes. Accuracy was 95.6, 93.8, 97.6 and 100.9% for EE2, E2a, E2 beta and E1, respectively. In raw water samples taken during the rainy wet season, estrone was detected at concentrations of 0.90 and 4.43 ng center dot L-1. However, treated potable water samples did not contain detectable levels of hormones. This is potentially due to the ability of a water treatment process to remove endocrine disruptors during water purification.

AB Many emerging contaminants pass through conventional wastewater treatment plants, contaminating surface and drinking water. The implementation of advanced oxidation processes in existing plants for emerging contaminant remediation is one of the challenges for the enhancement of water quality in the industrialised countries. This paper reports on the production of a TiO2 nano-layer on quartz wool in a relevant amount, its characterisation by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and its use as a photocatalyst under ultraviolet radiation for the simultaneous mineralisation of five emerging organic contaminants (benzophenone-3, benzophenone-4, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and triton X-100) dissolved in deionised water and tap water. This treatment was compared with direct ultraviolet photolysis and with photocatalytic degradation on commercial TiO2 micropearls. The disappearance of every pollutant was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and mineralisation was assessed by the determination of total organic carbon. After 4 hours of treatment with the TiO2 nano-coated quartz wool, the mineralisation exceeds 90% in deionised water and is about 70% in tap water. This catalyst was reused for seven cycles without significant efficiency loss.

AB Natural resources, including abundant and cheap natural clays in the southern regionare one of the main wealth of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The chemical industry in Kazakhstanis being developedrapidly in recent years and there is an urgent need to find solutions for the treatment of wastewaters. This work aims to explore natural clays for the synthesis of low-cost pillared clays that can be used as catalysts in oxidation technologies for the treatment of wastewaters. Nitrophenols are commonly found in many types of wastewaters (plastic, pharmaceutical, paper or pesticide production).The purification of suchspecific wastewater according to classical schemes does not always ensure a safe level of pollution in waters discharged into water ponds. Thus, further development of the chemical industry will inevitably be associated with the need for more effective disposal of wastewater containing toxic products. 4-nitrophenol was used as a representative model compound in catalyst screening studies.Catalysts based on pillared clays modified with Zr4+ cations were synthesized from natural clays of Karatau and Kokshetau deposits and investigated for the catalytic wastewater peroxide oxidation (CWPO) of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) at 323 degrees K. Pillared clays with Zr4+ showed the higher catalytic activity in the removal of 4-NP and Total organic carbon (TOC)by CWPO and selectivity for the formation of CO2 and H2O than natural clays.The best 4-NP and TOC conversion results were obtained by using the pillared clay from Karatau deposit as a catalyst. A complete removal of the contaminant was achieved after 2 hours with 97.3 % conversion.

AB The presence of 17 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to various therapeutic categories was investigated in two hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in North West Province, South Africa. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that ofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and bezafibrate were generally below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the analysed samples. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were the dominant pharmaceuticals in the influent streams with corresponding concentrations ranging from 21 to 119 mu g/L and 0.3 to 63 mu g/L, respectively. Both WWTPs were shown to have the capability to remove some of the target PPCPs, including acetaminophen (76-98%), tetracycline (15-93%), ibuprofen (44-99%), and triclocarban (13-98%). The monitoring of the target PPCPs in both influent and effluent samples of the investigated WWTPs revealed that the discharge of inadequately treated effluents could be contributing to the possible increase in the concentrations of these contaminants in the receiving environmental compartments. Further studies must be focused on the broader characterisation of these matrices in order to assess the potential ecological impacts of this waste disposal practice.

AB A new and highly sensitive spectrophotometric based flow injection analysis method has been developed for the determination of copper (II). N, N'-o-phenylene-bis (3-methoxysalicylideneimine) (H2IF) was used as a new chromogenic reagent. The absorbance was measured at lambda(max) = 420 nm. Various factors affecting complex formation have been investigated. For example, the pH effect, reagent concentration was studied. Under optimum conditions, Beer's law was met in the range of 3.18-318 mu g L-1 copper (II) concentration. The system required no mixing chamber and allowed a sample throughput > 60 sample per hour for 20 mu L injection volume. The interaction of the various ions was investigated and the experimental results were reported. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the amount of copper (II) found in pharmaceutical samples and water samples. The validity and applicability of the method was confirmed by AAS and standard reference material SPS-WW2 (Wastewater) analysis.

DT Article
DE Anaerobic treatment; batch reactor; antibiotic; synthetic wastewater
AB Antibiotics are among the most successful group of pharmaceuticals used for human and veterinary therapy. However, large amounts of antibiotics are released into municipal wastewater due to incomplete metabolism in humans or due to disposal of unused antibiotics. Anaerobic treatment systems increasingly used for removal of antibiotics from wastewater.
   Today, anaerobic treatment systems commonly used for wastewater containing medium and high degree of organic matters. This study was carried out for the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing different antibiotic group in batch reactor for removal of COD. The treatment process was monitored based on the statistical optimisation data of the batch reactor studies. In the Full factorial tests, 27 different tests are established by considering the variables such as (i) different antibiotic groups (fluconazole, cefamycin and tetracycline); (ii) different initial antibiotic concentrations (25, 50, 75 mg/L) and (iii) a type of co-substrate (propionic acid, glucose, propionic acid-butyric acid-acetic acid mixture). As a result of the statistical study is significant type of antibiotics, antibiotic concentration and type of co substrate have a significant effect statistically on the COD removal (p<0.05). The maximum COD removal for the fluconazole (experiment 19) was 98,87%.

ID PHASE-III; VALIDATION
AB Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds which are used to preserve human and animal health. Once administered, these compounds are metabolized or can remain unaltered until excreted. Therefore, a mixture of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites enters municipal sewers and wastewater treatment plants where, depending on their polarity, water solubility, and persistence, they cannot be completely removed or transformed during the treatment process, so that unaltered pharmaceuticals and/or their metabolites can enter surface water. As a result, in recent years concern has grown about trace concentrations and the risk they pose to ecosystems, considering the annual increase in pharmaceutical production and use at world level.
   This chapter reviews the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Originally developed during the mid-1980s as a test for detecting the developmental toxicity of pure chemical products and complex mixtures in the laboratory, in recent years it has been used to evaluate the mechanisms of action, biotransformation, and detoxification of xenobiotics as well as in ecotoxicology studies using alternative species and in situ monitoring.

AB Pineapple waste contains various substances that are valuable for the development of new and emerging technologies, nutraceuticals, food, pharmaceuticals, as well as biogas and bioethanol production. Bromelain extraction from pineapple waste is a very highly looked into area, while dietary fibers and phenolic antioxidants could be used as impending nutraceutical resource, capable of offering significant low-cost nutritional dietary supplement for low-income communities. The booming market of functional food has created a vast vista for utilization of natural resources. In this regard, cheap substrates, such as pineapple wastes, have promising prospect. Thus, environmentally polluting by-products could be converted into products with a higher economic value than the main product; hence with sustainable utilization of pineapple waste and with application of novel scientific and technological methods, valuable products from pineapple wastes could be obtained.

AB An analytical method for the determination of eight pharmaceutical compounds in waters has been developed and validated. Target compounds included hormones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, P-blockers and psychiatric drugs. The analytical determination has been achieved through off-line solid phase extraction and analysis in liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. For the determination of the hormones, samples were also derivatized with 1,2-dimethylim-idazole-4-sulfonyl-chloride. The limits of detection of the drugs varied between 0.01 and 30 ng/L, according to the limits indicated by the European Commission. For each compound, the six-point calibration curves showed excellent linearity (r2 >= 0.995) and the inter-session repeatability for all compounds ranged from 1 to 10%. This method was also applied for the determination of the target pharmaceuticals in the influent and the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in order to assess their presence and their removal inside the plant. Every compound, except for 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, has been found in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant and none of them, except for acetaminophen, were removed within the plant.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antimicrobial agent, are in common use and can be often detected in the environment. The constructed wetland systems (CWs) are one of the technologies to remove them from the aquatic environment. The final effect of the treatment processes depends on many factors, including the interaction between plants and the plant-associated microorganisms present in the system. Bacteria living inside the plant as endophytes are exposed to secondary metabolites in the tissues. Therefore, they can possess the potential to degrade aromatic structures, including residues of pharmaceuticals. The endophytic strain MG7 identified as Microbacterium sp., obtained from root tissues of Phalaris arundinacea exposed to DCF and SMX was tested for the ability to remove 2 mg/l of SMX and DCF in monosubstrate cultures and in the presence of phenol as an additional carbon source. The MG7 strain was able to remove approximately 15% of DCF and 9% of SMX after 20 days of monosubstrate culture. However, a decrease in the optical density of the MG7 strain cultures was observed, caused by an insufficient carbon source for bacterial growth and proliferation. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto autoclaved cells was negligible, which confirmed that the tested strain was directly involved in the removal of DCF and SMX. In the presence of phenol as the additional carbon source, the MG7 strain was able to remove approximately 35% of DCF and 61% of SMX, while an increase in the optical density of the cultures was noted. The higher removal efficiency can be explained by adaptive mechanisms in microorganisms exposed to phenol (i.e. changes in the composition of membrane lipids) and by a co-metabolic mechanism, where non-growth substrates can be transformed by non-specific enzymes. The presence of both DCF and SMX and the influence of the supply frequency of CWs with the contaminated wastewater on the diversity of whole endophytic bacterial communities were demonstrated. The results of this study suggest the capability of the MG7 strain to degrade DCF and SMX. This finding deserves further investigations to improve wastewater treatment in CWs with the possible use of pharmaceuticals-degrading endophytes.

Six MPs were analyzed: the hormones estrone, 17--ethinyl estradiol and 17--estradiol, the plasticizer bisphenol A and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac. In order to study its influence on removal efficiencies, the system was operated at three different OLRs: high (0.670.15kg COD/m(3) d), medium (0.37 +/- 0.06kg COD/m(3) d) and low (0.11 +/- 0.02kg COD/m(3) d).The results demonstrated the synergistic effects due to the double biological treatment, with removal rates above 90% for the hormones and the plasticizer. Pharmaceuticals were the most resistant compounds, being only partially removed in the liquid phase. Removal rates of the MPs were higher at high OLR of the influent.

AB Pharmaceutical products including analgesics, antibiotics, and antiepileptics are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, lakes, and rivers and have been found in waterways of many countries. The adsorption of two common pharmaceuticals present in surface waters, clarithromycin (CLR) and atenolol (ATN), onto cuttlefish bone powder treated with HCl has been investigated. Adsorption experiments were carried out at different pH conditions and the experimental equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich. For the same experimental conditions (pH=7), the estimated adsorption capacities are from 34.5mgg(-1) for CLR and 39.5mgg(-1) for ATN. The influence of adsorption pH was established for each compound. The negative values of G at different temperatures for all samples indicate the spontaneous nature of the sorption process.

AB UV absorbers developed for finishing of textile materials play a significant role in protection against UV radiations but their discharge in wastewater during processing and laundry action also retain serious concern to living species due to their recalcitrant nature. The current study examined the mineralization and degradation of two vinylsulfone and nitrogen (N-) containing UV absorber compounds (1a, 2a) via two effective Fenton and UV/H2O2 oxidation. The results showed that both the Fenton and UV/H2O2 processes mineralized the synthesized UV absorbers effectively; however the mineralization process with Fenton oxidation was more effective than the UV/H2O2. The mineralization of synthesized UV absorbers was affected by process parameters (dosage of Fe2+ and H2O2, pH and reaction time). Under attained optimum conditions of Fenton oxidation, dose of Fe2+ (15 mg/L), H2O2 (500 mg/L), pH (3.0) and contact time (120 minutes), 75.43 and 77.54% of Chemical Oxygen Demand removal was achieved for la and 2a, respectively. Whereas, the optimum conditions of UV/H2O2 process were H2O2 (700 mg/L), pH(3.0) and irradiation time (200 minutes) that brought 54.33 and 57.65% COD removal in case of 1a and 2a, respectively. The results indicated that the Fenton oxidation can be successfully employed for the mineralization of triazine based UV absorbers.

AB In this work, ozone oxidation of the antibiotics amoxicillin (AMX), cephalexin, and ceftriaxone was investigated in different samples: (i) aqueous solutions (100 mg L-1), (ii) an industrial wastewater containing AMX at 125 mg L-1 (chemical oxygen demand 6000 mg O-2 L-1), and (iii) a heavily contaminated industrial wastewater containing the antibiotics at a total concentration of 320 mg L-1. High performance liquid chromatography, molecular absorption spectrophotometry in the ultraviolet/visible region, and total organic carbon measurements showed that ozonation of antibiotics solutions led to removal higher than 95% with 10-20% mineralization. Industrial wastewater also showed very good efficiency for antibiotic removal (80-98%) after ozonation. Moreover, Microtox (R) test showed 86% toxicity reduction for the industrial wastewater.

AB Pharmaceutics present in the environment are of growing concern for their potential consequences on human and ecosystem health. In long-term monitoring investigations of sewage and surface water samples, diclofenac was identified as one of the most important pharmaceutically active compounds. Pangasius sp. were exposed to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) of diclofenac. The histopathological studies in a fish hepatopancreas sample showed significant changes like nucleation, differentiation, and hepatocytes. The large lesions and infiltration in hepatocytes were distinctly seen due to the toxic effect of diclofenac. In HPLC analysis, the control fish liver tissue showed no significant changes, whereas the diclofenac-exposed fish liver tissue showed a significant peak with a quicker run time. The studies confirmed that the diclofenac compound affects hepatocytes to a noteworthy extent. Therefore, this calls for reduction of diclofenac usage and also to have a checkpoint especially for diclofenac in the pharmaceutical effluent released into the water bodies.

AB This study investigates the degradation of imazapyr herbicide from wastewater by photocatalytic ozonation using TiO2 as a semiconductor. Effects of operational parameters on imazapyr removal efficiency including TiO2 dosing, initial herbicide concentration and pH were also studied. Obtained results showed that more than 90% of removal efficiency representing the disappearance of imazapyr was maintained until 7 mu M in the presence of 200 mgL(-1) of UV100-TiO2. Otherwise, the degradation of imazapyr followed the first-order kinetics with a photocatalytic rate constant of 0.247 min(-1), and complete degradation was achieved within 20 min using photocatalytic ozonation for 5 mu M of Imazapyr at pH 7.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics in the environment from discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from the land application of antibiotic-laden manure from animal agriculture is a critical global issue because these residues have been associated with the increased emergence of antibiotic resistance in the environment. In addition, other classes of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been found in effluents of municipal WWTPs, many of which persist in the receiving environments. Analysis of antibiotics by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in samples from different countries presents unique challenges that should be considered, from ion suppression due to matrix effects, to lack of available stable isotopically labeled standards for accurate quantification. Understanding the caveats of LC-MS/MS is important for assessing samples with varying matrix complexity. Ion ratios between quantifying and qualifying ions have been used for quality assurance purposes; however, there is limited information regarding the significance of setting criteria for acceptable variabilities in their values in the literature. Upon investigation of 30 pharmaceuticals in WWTP in fluent and effluent samples, and in receiving surface water samples downstream and upstream of the WWTP, it was found that ion ratios have higher variabilities at lower concentrations in highly complex matrices, and the extent of variability may be exacerbated by the physicochemical properties of the analytes. In setting the acceptable ion ratio criterion, the overall mean, which was obtained by taking the average of the ion ratios at all concentrations (1.56 to 100 ppb), was used. Then, for many of the target analytes included in this study, the tolerance range was set at 40% for WWTP influent samples and 30% for WWTP effluent, upstream, and downstream samples. A separate tolerance range of 80% was set for tetracyclines and quinolones, which showed higher variations in the ion ratios compared to the other analytes.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants (ECs), including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), steroid hormones and pesticides, in municipal wastewater as well as in the aquatic environment has been an issue of concern from an environmental and human health point of view. These ECs have been found in municipal wastewater in the concentration range of several mu g/L. Considering the importance assumed by many of ECs, it is not possible to ban their usage. Therefore, it is essential to effectively remove these contaminants to protect the environment and drinking water resources. There is evidence that conventional treatment methods are not able to completely remove many ECs, therefore, advanced processes are demanded in order to degrade these ECs and protect both water environment and human health. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs), coupling biological degradation with membrane filtration, are one possible option due to the advantages that characterize this technology. The present chapter discusses the occurrence and fate of pesticides and hormones in wastewater and proposes a comparison between removal efficiency of conventional activated sludge treatments and MBRs, also defining common concentrations at which these ECs are found in wastewater.

AB The presence of common industrial organic compounds and emerging micropollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in industrial and municipal wastewaters, respectively, has been recognized as a serious environmental problem owing to the recalcitrance and persistence of these compounds in the aquatic environment. In the past two decades, carbon nanotubes and their composites have been gradually applied for the removal of undesirable organic contaminants from water via adsorption. This chapter describes the removal of established toxic chemicals from oil and gas produced water and emerging micropollutants from treated municipal wastewater through the application of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and their composites with titanium dioxide.

AB Pharmaceuticals have low biodegradahility and can retain their chemical structure for long periods of time leading to an accumulation in the environment causing irreversible changes. Electrochemical oxidation has been proved to be an environmentally friendly and economically viable solution for biorefractory of organic molecules as well as for the disinfection of wastewaters. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of specific energy consumption for a given reduction of toxic organic compound loads in a continuous flow bipolar packed-bed electrochemical reactor and compare this with a classical parallel plate reactor. The energy cost for both the parallel plate and bipolar electrochemical reactors are similar (around 1.6 kWh m(-3)) lower than other advanced oxidation process reported in literature. However, the bipolar configuration is particularly suitable for low conductivity waste water and/or for avoiding the formation of organochloride compounds in a chloride rich wastewater.

AB Pharmaceutical in natural waters could be an environmental problem because of their potential toxic risk on living organisms. Conventional wastewater treatment plant processes are not enough to remove pharmaceuticals therefore advanced oxidation process have become an attractive solution. Carbamazepine (CBZ), is an antiepileptic drug, is a most widely used medicine in almost every part of world. In present study, advance oxidation, using H2O2 and FeSO4 (Fenton process) is used to degrade the concentrations of CBZ from water. Fenton process is known to be most effective and common methods for the treatment of such wastewaters. This study investigated the degradation of CBZ by H2O2 and FeSO4 under changing pH and contact time of (3, 3.5, 4), (15, 20, 30 min) respectively. Results showed 75.86 % COD and 45.69 % TOC removal. But real degradation of CBZ were elucidated using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS) indicating 53.73 % removal.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are two of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical compounds in water and are hardly removed by biological treatment systems. The presence of H2O2 was investigated in the ozonation of these two compounds. Experiments were carried out with both using distilled water and secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with pharmaceuticals. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) abatement rate improved when H2O2 was added at the beginning of the ozonation process and when the ozone inlet concentration increased, attaining a maximum value of 91% and simultaneously a lower ozone waste for a H2O2 initial concentration of 5mM and an ozone inlet concentration of 20gNm(-3). For these operation conditions, the water matrix has no significant impact on SMX and DCF removal, which were totally degraded in 45 and 60min, respectively. Nevertheless, lower COD degradation and ozone usage were obtained when the secondary effluent was used. Inorganic ions such as chloride, sulphate and nitrate and short-chain organic compounds were detected as by-products of the SMX and DCF oxidation. Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and H2O2 reduced acute toxicity.

AB Antibiotics are one of the most consumed drugs and have become new emerging pollutants in the environment as antibiotics lead to long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem. They are produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of other bacteria in nature as a defense mechanism. Furthermore, after discovering their therapeutical features, synthetic production methods were developed. In general, antibiotics are widely used in human medicine, veterinary medicine, farming and aquaculture for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Approximately 90% of the consumed antibiotics are excreted via urinary or fecal pathways from the human body after partial, or no metabolism, and they are transferred to the domestic sewage plants or directly to the environment. Conventional biological treatment of domestic sewage provides very low-if any-reduction for the antibiotics, which usually by-pass treatment and accumulate in the receiving waters, sediments, plants, and animals. The concentration of these materials in domestic wastewaters and surface waters is observed in a range between 0.3 mu g/L and 150 mu g/L. However, pharmaceutical plants, hospitals, concentrated animal feeding operations, and aquaculture generate effluents having much higher antibiotics concentrations in the range 100-500 mg/L. Consequently, it is essential to gather information on the fate and effect of these compounds at high concentrations for setting the basis for related practical treatment schemes.
   Inhibitory action of the antibiotics is experimentally evaluated in two different approaches: Short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) tests: Acute experiments involve a microbial community selected and sustained by the selected organic substrate in the system and not previously exposed to the inhibitor. In long-term experiments with continuous feeding of the inhibitor, the test may reflect, aside from changes in substrate removal and utilization, adaptation and/or resistance of the microbial community or even shifts in microbial composition in response to continuous exposure to the selected inhibitor. However, a full insight on the inhibitory action can only be acquired when the response of the microbial community is tested for both acute and chronic inhibition impacts.
   In this chapter, the most commonly used antibiotic classes such as beta-lactams, tetracycline, macrolides, sulfonamides, quinolones are examined. Their fate and transformation during wastewater treatment as well as their inhibitory and toxic effects on the microbial community are discussed by using various toxicity and inhibition tests.

AB The literature on the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater over the period 1990-2015 has been reviewed to develop a sustainable treatment strategy. Analysis of the existing methods for treatment and disposal practices of pharmaceutical waste has been undertaken on the classification of the treatment methods under well-identified broad specific groups. The review reveals the associated merits and demerits of the traditional and the emerging methods and the challenges involved in overcoming the shortcomings. Considering the very diverse nature of the contaminants and the poor success rates of the existing technologies, it transpires that no single classical technology is capable of fully taking care of the hazards emanating from pharmaceutical waste discharges. On the other hand, some recent technologies such as membrane-integrated hybrid technologies are emerging as more successful ones than the conventional technologies. But, scale up confidence with respect to such new technologies is still very limited and needs to be substantially improved through extensive investigation on the pilot scale using real pharmaceutical wastewater rather than synthetic wastewater. This review directs the research focus to the development of sustainable treatment technologies.

AB An integrated anaerobic fluidized-bed membrane bioreactor (IAFMBR) was investigated to treat synthetic high-strength benzothiazole wastewater (50 mg/L) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24, 18, and 12 h. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency (from 93.6% to 90.9%), the methane percentage (from 70.9% to 69.27%), and the methane yield (from 0.309 m(3) CH,/kg.CODremoved to 0.316 m(3) CH4/kg.CODremoved) were not affected by decreasing HRTs. However, it had an adverse effect on membrane fouling (decreasing service period from 5.3 d to 3.2 d) and benzothiazole removal efficiency (reducing it from 97.5% to 82.3%). Three sludge samples that were collected on day 185, day 240, and day 297 were analyzed using an Illumina (R) MiSeq platform. It is striking that the dominant genus of archaea was always Methanosaeta despite of HRTs. The proportions of Methanosaeta were 80.6% (HRT 24), 91.9% (HRT 18), and 91.2% (HRT 12). The dominant bacterial genera were Clostridium in proportions of 23.9% (HRT 24), 16.4% (HRT 18), and 15.3% (HRT 12), respectively.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been used in effluent treatment in order to degrade the composites that persist in the environment even after conventional treatment. This work employs AOP (known as the photo-Fenton process) to study the degradation of the pharmaceutical acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, dipyrone and paracetamol in different effluents from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). The data collected from the different effluents, which were obtained by mean of a chromatographic analysis, showed that 3 out of the 4 pharmaceuticals analysed were detected in concentrations that ranged from 0.29mg.L-1 to 3.96mg.L-1. The photodegradation study using UV-C radiation showed that the photo-Fenton process managed to degrade between 71.9% and 100% of the pollutants. Furthermore, it promoted the conversion of 66.5% of organic material, as the lumped kinetic model satisfactorily represents the kinetics of the process. The toxicity trials verified that the photo Fenton process did not generate toxic intermediaries once the seeds had germinated.

AB In this study, nitrate ion (NO3-) was found to collaborate with ozone thereby accelerating the degradation of ketoprofen. NO3- was discovered to induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals (<bold>OH</bold>), which was crucial to the decomposition of PPCPs in wastewater treatment plants. Kinetic studies on the decomposition of ketoprofen were investigated under different concentrations of NO3-. The impact mechanisms and degradation by-products were experimentally determined. The results revealed that all reactions fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model well. The presence of NO3- had the capacity to accelerate the ozonation of ketoprofen. The reaction by-products were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and a total of five intermediates generated via the ozonation of ketoprofen were assessed. The transformation pathways were concluded to be hydroxylation, nitration, and debenzophenone and ketonized reactions. Additionally, the toxicity of the by-products was evaluated by employing Chlorella and Daphnia magna.

AB While the discharge of groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds to surface waters is widely reported, assessments of its ecological threat are rare in the scientific literature, largely being restricted to comparisons of riparian groundwater concentrations to water quality guidelines for protecting aquatic life. Here we investigated potential negative impacts on the benthic community from overlapping petroleum hydrocarbon - chlorinated solvent plumes discharging to an urban stream using in-field ecological assessment methods (targeting both meio- and macrobenthos) over multiple scales. Several lines of evidence were suggestive of detrimental impacts from the plumes, including reduced total abundance and richness of benthic taxa, reduced or enhanced abundances of individual benthic taxa, and an altered benthic community structure. However, the findings were not conclusive, as the evaluation was complicated by substantial small-scale (<20 m) spatial variation in concentrations of many other groundwater contaminants, making it difficult to determine reference areas (i.e., those with similar substrate and chemistry, but lacking exposure to plume compounds) and isolate impacts from a single factor. Furthermore, detections of the wastewater indicator acesulfame also demonstrated the issue of uncertain influences from unmeasured contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals). Some of the assessment methods showed greater promise than others (e.g., sampling along a gradient rather than having separate impacted and reference sites), which may provide guidance on future field applications. Overall, the study findings suggest a need for further inquiry into the most appropriate application of ecological and ecotoxicological assessment methods to groundwater-based contamination hazards.

AB The non-ionic water-soluble X-ray contrast agent iomeprol (IOM) enters the water supply through sewage treatment plants, which can cause considerable environmental harm. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. I-24 (I-24) was tested for its ability to remove IOM from water via co-metabolic pathways. The optimum removal rate of IOM by I-24 was 38.43% +/- 3.70% when starch served as the source of external carbon, and its co-metabolism of IOM conformed to the first-order kinetics. The highest activity of intracellular enzyme (degrading enzyme) extracted from I-24 was 0.143 +/- 0.005 mU in starch condition. The Michaelis constant of the degrading enzyme was found to be 91.08 mu mol L-1. However, glucose and maltose showed the best promotive effects on the growth and electron transport activity of I-24, indicating that overgrowth may result in competitive inhibition and a reduced degradation rate of IOM. Adding I-24 and degrading enzymes to biological aerated filters increased IOM removal rates without affecting CODMn removal.

AB A laboratory scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used with three different flat sheet (FS) membrane modules treating a high strength real industrial zone wastewater. Both the MBR and the conventional activated sludge (CAS) system treating carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were compared in terms of metals and micropollutants removal. Different types of micropollutants were selected; ibuprofen as a pharmaceutical, triclosan as a personal care product and four other pollutants as industrial ones: bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Ibuprofen and BPA removal results were consistent with the literature which were higher than 99%. PAHs are removed efficiently both in WWTP and the MBR. However, the MBR performed better than WWTP for many PAH types. No PCBs were detected in all analysis. This study showed that while MBR was a good option for PAHs and some phthalates, there is little or no difference between MBR and CAS for the most of the pollutants.

AB The paper has analyzed the presence of antibiotics in crude (hospital, medicine production and municipal) waste water, treated waste water, surface water and drinking water across the world. The concentrations of antibiotics in medicine production waste water reached a level of up to 900 mu/dm(3); in hospital waste water, up to 124 mu/dm(3); and in municipal waste water, up to 64 mu/dm(3). Antibiotic concentrations in treated waste water approached 260 ng/dm(3). The presence of antibiotics in surface water has also been covered. The most often identified medicines were: Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Norfloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. The maximum antibiotic concentrations in surface water are as high as up to 2 mu g/dm(3). In the majority of cases, identified antibiotics occurred in concentrations from several to several dozen ng/dm(3), and less often in several hundred ng/dm3. The presence of antibiotics in drinking water, similarly as for waste water, was identified worldwide, e.g. in China, USA, Germany, Canada, France. Very high antibiotic concentrations were noted in Guangzhou, China, which reached a level of up to 679.7 ng/dm(3) (Ciprofloxacin), but also in the USA (Triclosan) 734 ng/dm(3)). In the majority of instances, antibiotics are present in water in much lower concentrations. The consequence of environmental contamination with antibiotics is the drug resistance of many bacterial strains with the resultant deaths of 25 000 people in the European Union and 700 000 people across the globe. The other effects of the presence of antibiotics in the natural environment are not fully understood yet. For example, carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic effects are attributed to these contaminants.

AB Sewage effluents are the most important source of emergent pollutants in the aquatic environment. In the present study the toxicological impact of an untreated sewage effluent on the Prochilodus lineatus fish was assessed under field conditions using a caging experiment. The biomarkers which were measured here involved oxidative stress markers, hepatic function parameters, neurotoxicity indicators, energy reserves, histological alterations and brain cell proliferation. In addition, water quality parameters including the occurrence of some human pharmaceuticals were measured. Juveniles of P. lineatus were caged for 15 days at three sites: the effluent site, and 2 km upstream and downstream from the effluent discharge. Caffeine, atenolol, carbamazepine, en-alapril and sildenafil were detected in water river samples. The increased activation of caspase-3 and the decreased cell proliferation in the diencephalon showed that the brain of fish caged at the effluent was affected. These fish also displayed a rise in hepatic transaminase activity, and oxidative stress in liver and gills which was evidenced by an increased lipid peroxidation and activation of antioxidant enzymes. At tissue level, increased glycogen and decreased lipid contents in liver as well as the highest indexes of hepatic lesions were also observed in the fish caged at the effluent. Both biochemical and histopathological findings demonstrated that effects were more severe on the liver of such fish than on their gills. The in situ exposure method carried out in our study makes it possible to observe the real effects of the sewage effluent on fish. Furthermore, our results also provide a better understanding of the harmful effects of wastewater effluents on the aquatic wildlife.

AB Photocatalytic (PC) methods based on advanced oxidation processes have shown great potential for removal of water pollutants. Oxide semiconductors stand out as the most promising materials for UV-mediated photodegradation of persistent pollutants in wastewater. Although an immense number of studies have appeared so far concerning the PC activity mostly of TiO2 but also of ZnO, the efficiency of these and other mixed oxides in degrading a wide range of organic pollutants has not yet been extensively explored. In this work we compare the efficiency of ZnO, TiO2 and the 2ZnO-TiO2 mixed crystal prepared by mechanochemical solid-state treatment, to decompose a pharmaceutical (Naproxene) and a dye (methylene blue) compound. The phase morphology, composition, specific surface area and crystalline structure of the nanopowders were characterized in detail. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO under UV irradiation was systematically higher than the other materials. The activity of the mixture was found to depend on the type of the analyte molecule, being, however, higher than that of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Inadequate treatment of hospital wastewater could result in considerable risks to public health due to its macro- and micropollutant content. In order to eliminate this problem, a new nanoparticle composite was produced under laboratory conditions and a photocatalytic degradation approach was used. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP) (macro) and oflaxin (micro) pollutant removal were investigated with the nano graphene oxide magnetite (Nano-GO/M) particles by two different processes, namely adsorption and photodegradation. Low removal efficiencies (21-60%) were obtained in the adsorption process for the parameters given above, after 90 min contact time at a pH of 7.8 with 5 g/L Nano-GO/M composite. Using the photodegradation process, higher removal efficiencies were obtained with 2 g/L Nano-GO/M composite for COD (88%), TSS (82%), TKN (95%) and oflaxin (97%), at pH 7.8 after 60 min irradiation time at a UV power of 300 W. The synthesized nanoparticle was reused for two sequential treatments of pharmaceutical wastewater with no significant losses of removal efficiencies (for oflaxin 97%-90%). The quality of the treated hospital wastewater was first class according to the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulations criteria. This water could also be used for irrigation purposes.

AB The project DemO(3)AC (demonstration of large-scale wastewater ozonation at the Aachen-Soers wastewater treatment plant, Germany) of the Eifel-Rur Waterboard contains the construction of a large-scale ozonation plant for advanced treatment of the entire 25 million m(3)/yr of wastewater passing through its largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In dry periods, up to 70% of the receiving water consists of treated wastewater. Thus, it is expected that effects of ozonation on downstream water biocoenosis will become observable. Extensive monitoring of receiving water and the WWTP shows a severe pollution with micropollutants (already prior to WWTP inlet). (Eco-)Toxicological investigations showed increased toxicity at the inlet of the WWTP for all assays. However, endocrine-disrupting potential was also present at other sampling points at the WWTP and in the river and could not be eliminated sufficiently by the WWTP. Total cell counts at the WWTP are slightly below average. Investigations of antibiotic resistances show no increase after the WWTP outlet in the river. However, cells carrying antibiotic-resistant genes seem to be more stress resistant in general. Comparing investigations after implementation of ozonation should lead to an approximation of the correlation between micropollutants and water quality/biocoenosis and the effects that ozonation has on this matter.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a broad range antimicrobial agent used in many personal care products, which is commonly discharged to wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). This study examined the impact of TCS on wastewater treatment performance using laboratory bench-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) coupled with anaerobic digesters. The SBRs were continuously fed synthetic wastewater amended with or without 0.68 mu M TCS, with the aim of determining the effect of chronic TCS exposure as opposed to a pulse TCS addition as previously studied. Overall, the present study suggests inhibition of nitrogen removal during reactor startup. However, NH4+ removal fully rebounded after 63 days, suggesting acclimation of the associated microbial communities to TCS. An initial decrease in microbial community diversity was observed in the SBRs fed TCS as compared to the control SBRs, followed by an increase in community diversity, which coincided with the increase in NH4+ removal. Elevated levels of NO3- and NO2- were found in the reactor effluent after day 58, however, suggesting ammonia oxidizing bacteria rebounding more rapidly than nitrogen oxidizing bacteria. Similar effects on treatment efficiencies at actual WWTFs have not been widely observed, suggesting that continuous addition of TCS in their influent may have selected for TCS-resistant nitrogen oxidizing bacteria.

AB The current work deals with efficient removal of acetaminophen (AC) from hospital wastewater using electro-Fenton (EF) process. The degradation yield of 99.5% was obtained under optimal experimental conditions, namely 5.75 mg L-1 initial AC concentration, 2.75 pH solution, 3-cm inter-electrode distance, 100 mg L-1 KCl electrolyte, 122.5 mu L L-1 H2O2, 8 mA cm(-2) current density at equilibrium time of 8 min. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested that the effect of mentioned operating parameters was statistically significant on the AC removal. The low probability amount of P value (P < 0.0001), the Fisher's F-value of 65.91, and correlation coefficient of the model (R-2 = 0.9545) revealed a satisfactory correlation between the experimental and the predicted values of AC removal. The predicted removal efficiency of 99.4% was in satisfactory agreement with the obtained experimental removal efficiency of 98.7%. The AC degradation during the EF followed a first-order kinetic model with rate constants (K-app) of 0.6718 min(-1). Using the ordinary radical scavengers revealed that main mechanism of AC degradation controlled by the hydroxyl free radicals produced throughout the EF process. The excess amount of iron (II) scavenged the active radicals and diminished the concentration of OH available to react with AC. The optimum molar ratio of H2O2 to -Fe2+ was found to be 2.5. The developed EF process as a promising technique applied for treatment of real samples.

AB Eighteen selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), consisting of five non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (N-APs), four sulfonamides (SAs), four tetracyclines (TCs), four macrolides (MCs), and one quinolone (QN) were detected in surface water and sediments from Guanting Reservoir (GTR) and its upstream rivers in north China. Acetaminophen, caffeine, chlorotetracycline, and ofloxacin were detected with 100% frequency in the surface water of GTR and its upstream rivers, while diltiazem was also detected with 100% frequency in surface water from the reservoir's upstream rivers. Acetaminophen and caffeine were detected with 100% frequency in sediments from GTR and its upstream rivers, while high concentrations of ofloxacin in GTR, and carbamazepine, tetracycline, and chlortetracycline in upstream rivers were also detected in 100% of samples. Five N-APs, especially acetaminophen and caffeine, were prominent pollutants. The mean concentrations of acetaminophen were 155 and 302 ng L-1 in surface water and 529 and 202 ng g(-1) in sediments from GTR and upstream rivers, respectively. The mean concentrations of caffeine were 208 and 338 ng L-1 in surface water samples and 1430 and 1020 ng g(-1) in sediments from GTR and upstream rivers, respectively. The geographical differences in PPCP concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Zhangjiakou City and human activities around the GTR basin were the main sources of PPCPs in this area. An environmental risk assessment for the worst-case scenario was undertaken using calculated risk quotients, which indicated a medium risk from erythromycin in GTR and a high risk in its upstream rivers.

AB Large variations in removal efficiencies (REs) of chemicals have been reported for monitoring studies of activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this work, we conducted a meta-analysis on REs (1539 data points) for a set of 209 chemicals consisting of fragrances, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals in order to assess the drivers of the variability relating to inherent properties of the chemicals and operational parameters of activated sludge WWTPs. For a reduced dataset (n = 542), we developed a mixed-effect model (meta-regression) to explore the observed variability in REs for the chemicals using three chemical specific factors and four WWTP-related parameters. The overall removal efficiency of the set of chemicals was 82.1% (95% CI 75.2-87.1%, N = 1539). Our model accounted for 17% of the total variability in REs, while the process-based model SimpleTreat did not perform better than the average of the measured REs. We identified that, after accounting for other factors potentially influencing RE, readily biodegradable compounds were better removed than non-readily biodegradable ones. Further, we showed that REs increased with increasing sludge retention times (SRTs), especially for non-readily biodegradable compounds. Finally, our model highlighted a decrease in RE with increasing K-OC. The counterintuitive relationship to K-OC stresses the need for a better understanding of electrochemical interactions influencing the RE of ionisable chemicals. In addition, we highlighted the need to improve the modelling of chemicals that undergo deconjugation when predicting RE. Our meta-analysis represents a first step in better explaining the observed variability in measured REs of chemicals. It can be of particular help to prioritize the improvements required in existing process-based models to predict removal efficiencies of chemicals in WWTPs.
   Environmental significance
   The amount of chemicals released into water bodies from consumer product use in developed countries mainly depends on the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove chemicals from wastewater. Current modelling approaches fail to explain the large variability observed in monitored removal efficiencies (REs). Applying a meta-analytical and meta-regression approach on a database of 1539 REs for surfactants, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals, we found empirical evidence that the sludge retention time of the WWTP, and biodegradation potential and partitioning to solids of the chemicals were important when modelling REs. Our model results also suggest that a better understanding of chemical-specific processes, like deconjugation and electrochemical interactions with sludge, are crucial for a better prediction of REs in WWTPs.

AB Metronidazole (MNZ) is widely used in clinical applications and animal feed as an antibiotic agent and additive, respectively. Widespread occurrence of MNZ in wastewater treatment and hospital effluents has been reported. In this study, the mechanism of MNZ degradation in aqueous solutions via thermally activated persulfate (TAP) process was established under different conditions. The kinetic model was derived for MNZ degradation and followed pseudo-firstorder reaction kinetics and was consistent with the model fitted by experimental data (R-2 > 98.8%). The rate constant increased with the initial dosage of persulfate, as well as the temperature, and the yielding apparent activation energy was 23.9 kcal mol(-1). The pH of the solutions did not have significant effect on MNZ degradation. The degradation efficiency of MNZ reached 96.6% within 180 min for an initial MNZ concentration of 100 mg L-1 under the optional condition of [PS](0) = 20mM, T = 60 degrees C, and unadjusted pH. SO4- and HO center dot were confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra during TAP process. Radical quenching study revealed that SO4- was mainly responsible forMNZ degradation at an unadjusted pH. MNZ mineralization evaluation showed that the removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) reached more than 97.2%.

AB In this study, a saline effluent from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor was treated by nanofiltration in order to allow its agricultural reuse. Short-term tests were conducted to investigate membrane fouling and selective rejection of ions and emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). The study has been conducted with a negatively charged commercial thin-film composite membrane (DK, GE Osmonics). The effect of operating pressure (5-20 bar) and cross-flow velocity (0.12-0.37 m/s) on membrane performance have been researched. Dimensional analysis of steady permeate flux indicated that the gel layer or the polarization layer can be completely removed at critical cross-flow velocity. At a sub-critical velocity, membrane autopsies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy revealed a complex mixture of organic matter, phosphates and colloidal silica over the membranes surface. Since the rejection of monovalent cations (76-88%) was lower than that of multivalent cations (above 96%), the treated effluent was characterized by a very high levels of sodium adsorption ratio and ammonium. In addition, moderate rejection of low molecular weight EOCs (clofibric acid and caffeine) was observed. Therefore, the treated effluent did not achieve enough quality to be reused for agricultural irrigation. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical EngineersEnviron Prog, 37: 383-390, 2018
   During the last decade, interest in the application of nanofiltration in wastewater treatment has grown in response to stringent water quality standards and increasing concern about the presence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). Nevertheless, information remains scarce about membrane fouling and EOCs rejection. The current research addresses these issues during its application to a brackish effluent from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor to be reused for agricultural irrigation. Dimensional analysis has allowed establishing the optimum operation conditions in terms fouling control. As regard of EOCs rejection, low molecular weight compounds were not completely retained by the membrane.

AB Hydro-climatic changes and the increasing release of pollutants into rivers by human activities tend to affect the quality of watercourses, to alter aquatic ecosystems and to reduce the amount of useable water. The ecological and chemical states of rivers and their evolution is thus of growing concern. In Europe and Switzerland, water policies are progressively shifting towards a holistic approach of river systems. The European Commission notably established a framework to highlight rivers' ecological deficits and to enhance regional or local water management plans. In Switzerland, a similar framework is currently under development. In this paper, both procedures are compared and implemented in a Swiss catchment dominated by agricultural activities. The aim is to define the challenges that still need to be addressed to assess and sustain river health. The hydromorphological, ecological, and ecotoxicological quality of the river was evaluated. Both frameworks highlighted the fact that no section of the river can currently be classified as being in a good environmental state and that the state deteriorates as tributaries and wastewater discharge flow into the main riverbed. Chemical issues and water quality changes due to hydro-climatic variations and management strategies were also pinpointed. Both frameworks are thus useful tools to survey changes in rivers quality in space and over time. However, challenges remain regarding the appropriate strategies to monitor and analyze chemicals, the definition of target values and conditions, the evaluation and integration of human-induced pressures, and the overall evaluation of the state of a river. The development of integrated indicators or of ecosystem services approaches is considered as a potential solution to explore river health and to define efficient restoration measures by water managers.

AB An anaerobic/aerobic moving-bed biofilm (A/O-MBBR) reactor system was constructed, and the treatment efficiency of aqueous antibiotics in wastewater was investigated. The effects of antibiotics on the microbial communities in the A/O-MBBR were also investigated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, removal of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) was studied in a series of experiments. When a low concentration of tetracycline (TC) was added to the reactor system, high removal efficiency of conventional pollutants (TC concentration decreased from 10 turn to 2.8 mu g L-1) was achieved. When mixed TCs (50 mu g L-1) were added to the system, the removal efficiencies of chlortetracycline (CTC), TC and oxytetracycline (OTC) reached 52.03, 41.79, and 38.42%, respectively. TC degradation was decreased to 21.16% when the antibiotic concentration was 500 mu g L-1; exposure to this TC concentration destroyed the community structure of the activated sludge bacteria in the reactor. The products of the biodegradation analysis revealed the possible degradation pathways functioning in the experimental A/O-MBBRs.

AB Treatment of municipal wastewater reduces the concentrations of some pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, and drugs of abuse. However, reduced concentrations of these micropollutants in wastewater may not correlate with reduced toxicity because transformations of micropollutants and/or the formation of disinfection by-products may generate toxic compounds. In the present study, we prepared extracts by solid phase extraction of samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at various stages of treatment and tested these extracts for toxicity to early life stages of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Toxicity data for extracts prepared from a WWTP with secondary treatment showed that the numbers of exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) that did not hatch increased from 1 of 12 for the treatment with untreated effluent to 5 of 12 for the treatment with final treated effluent. For extracts prepared from a WWTP with tertiary treatment, toxicity among exposed embryos (n = 12 per treatment) also increased with each step of wastewater treatment, as shown by mortalities of 2 of 12 and 8 of 12 in treatments with extracts from untreated and final treated effluent, respectively, as well as an increase in the numbers of embryos that did not hatch from 2 of 12 to 9 of 12 in treatments with untreated and final treated effluent, respectively. Ozonation of treated wastewater collected from a third WWTP caused a high incidence of delayed hatch in exposed embryos (n = 24 per treatment). However, hatching success and the numbers of developmental abnormalities in embryos from this ozonation treatment were not different from controls. The present study shows the value of including toxicity testing to assess the effectiveness of technologies for treatment of municipal wastewater. (C) 2017 SETAC

TI Evaluation of Wastewater Treatment by Ozonation for Reducing the

AB Although conventional wastewater treatment technologies are effective at removing many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from municipal wastewater, some contaminants are not removed efficiently. Ozonation may be a treatment option for reducing the concentrations of recalcitrant CECs in wastewater, but this process may generate toxic transformation products. In the present study, we conducted semibatch experiments to ozonate municipal wastewater effluent spiked with 5 commonly detected CECs. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether ozonation increased or decreased biological responses indicative of sublethal toxicity in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with extracts prepared from ozonated and nonozonated wastewater effluent. Blood, liver, and brain tissues were collected from the fish at 72 h post injection for analysis of a battery of biomarkers. In fish i.p. injected with the extracts from nonozonated wastewater effluent, significant induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) was observed, but ozonation of the municipal wastewater effluent spiked with CECs significantly reduced this estrogenic response. However, in fish injected with extracts from spiked municipal wastewater effluent after ozonation, the balance of hepatic glutathione in its oxidized (glutathione disulfide [ GSSG]) form was altered, indicating oxidative stress. Levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin were significantly elevated in brain tissue from trout injected with the extracts from ozonated spiked municipal wastewater effluent, a biological response that has not been previously reported in fish. Other in vivo biomarkers showed no significant changes across treatments. These results indicate that ozonation reduces the estrogenicity of wastewater, but may increase other sublethal responses. The increase in biomarker responses after ozonation may be because of the formation of biologically active products of transformation of CECs, but further work is needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB Spreading organic waste products (OWP) issued from sewage sludge or manures into soil may disseminate antibiotics with unknown risks for human health and environment. Our objectives were to compare the fate of two sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its metabolite N-acetyl-sulfa-methoxazole (N-ac-SMX), and one fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin (CIP), in an unamended soil, and two soils regularly amended since 1998 with a sewage sludge and green waste compost and with farmyard manure respectively. Incubations of soil spiked with C-14 labelled SMX or N-ac-SMX (0.02 mg kg(-1)) or CIP (0.15 mg kg(-1)) allowed a quantification of radiolabeled molecules in the mineralized, easily, hardly and non-extractable fractions after 3 and 156 days. Nature of C-14 molecules was also analyzed by HPLC in extractable fractions after 3 and 156 days.
   SMX and N-ac-SMX dissipation was fast and due to i) mineralization (similar to 10% of recovered C-14 after 156 days) or incomplete degradation (production of metabolites), ii) adsorption, even if both sulfonamides present low Kd (<3 L kg(-1)) and iii) formation of non-extractable residues (NER), representing more than 50% of recovered radioactivity.
   N-ac-SMX was more mineralized than SMX, and formed more progressively NER, after a step of deacetylation. Adsorption of CIP was fast and formed mainly NER (>72%) whereas its mineralization was negligible. Repeated applications of OWP tend to enhance adsorption of antibiotics and lower their degradation, through the quantity and quality of the built up soil organic matter. If applications of sewage sludge compost favor adsorption and inhibit mineralization, applications of manure boost the formation of non -extractable residues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Endophytic fungi inhabit plant tissues asymptomatically and confer a high diversity. They are polyphyletic in nature and primarily belong to the division Ascomycota. Endophytes are an important component of sustainable development in community ecology as they support the rich biodiversity and bioremediation of organic pollutants, wastewater, poisonous gases, industrial sewage, and heavy metals or in agricultural sufficiency. Endophytes are known to produce different kinds of secondary metabolites, and many of them are similar to what the host plants produce. Around 80% of the world's population, mostly those in the developing countries, still rely on herbal medicines for their primary healthcare. Usage of plant sources for commercial production of bioactive compounds requires sacrifice of several trees to obtain satisfactory amounts. This is more so if they were to be isolated from endemic and endangered plant species. Such an aspect poses a grave threat to biodiversity conservation and forces us to go for a judicious usage of plant resources. Hence, production of bioactive compounds by the microorganisms that are intrinsic to the host plant tissues gives us hope. This is because microbial fermentation is comparably cheaper and economically stable and offers a sustainable source to pharmaceutical industries. In this chapter current perspectives of endophytic fungi in sustainable usage such as bioactive compounds of therapeutic use, biotransformations, plant defense and protection mechanisms, biocontrol, and crop production and in sustainable development including nutrient recycling and ecosystem functioning are reviewed and discussed.

AB This study evaluated micropollutants removal and membrane fouling behaviour of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (24, 18, 12 and 6 h). The results revealed that HRT of 18 h was the optimal condition regarding the removal of most selected micropollutants. As the primary removal mechanism in the hybrid system was biodegradation, the attached growth pattern was desirable for enriching slow growing bacteria and developing a diversity of biocoenosis. Thus, the efficient removal of micropollutants was obtained. In terms of membrane fouling propensity analysis, a longer HRT (e.g. HRTs of 24 and 18 h) could significantly mitigate membrane fouling when compared with the shortest HRT of 6 h. Hence, enhanced system performance could be achieved when the MBBR-MBR system was operated at HRT of 18 h.

AB In this work, periphyton photobioreactors were built and were used for the treatment of synthetic wastewater spiked with PPCPs under different operational conditions. The removal rates of total nitrogen were relatively stable and varied from 39% to 77% overtime in different treatments. However, the removal rates of soluble reactive phosphorus decreased overtime from 42% to 68% on day 2 to 15.8% to 44% on day 22. For the selected PPCPs, only bisphenol A was effectively removed (72%-86.4%), hydrochlorothiazide and ibuprofen were moderately removed (26.2%-48.7%), and carbamazepine and gemfibrozil were poorly removed (6.45%-20.6%). Longer hydraulic retention time enhanced the treatment efficiency but illumination period showed contrasting effects on the removal of the nutrients and the PPCPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Exposure of wildlife to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) is likely to occur but studies of risk are limited. One exposure pathway that has received attention is trophic transfer of APIs in a water-fish osprey food chain. Samples of water, fish plasma and osprey plasma were collected from Delaware River and Bay, and analyzed for 21 APIs. Only 2 of 21 analytes exceeded method detection limits in osprey plasma (acetaminophen and diclofenac) with plasma levels typically 2-3 orders of magnitude below human therapeutic concentrations (HTC). We built upon a screening level model used to predict osprey exposure to APIs in Chesapeake Bay and evaluated whether exposure levels could have been predicted in Delaware Bay had we just measured concentrations in water or fish. Use of surface water and BCFs did not predict API concentrations in fish well, likely due to fish movement patterns, and partitioning and bioaccumulation uncertainties associated with these ionizable chemicals. Input of highest measured API concentration in fish plasma combined with pharmacokinetic data accurately predicted that diclofenac and acetaminophen would be the APIs most likely detected in osprey plasma. For the majority of APIs modeled, levels were not predicted to exceed 1 ng/mL or method detection limits in osprey plasma. Based on the target analytes examined, there is little evidence that APIs represent a significant risk to ospreys nesting in Delaware Bay. If an API is present in fish orders of magnitude below HTC, sampling of fish-eating birds is unlikely to be necessary. However, several human pharmaceuticals accumulated in fish plasma within a recommended safety factor for HTC. It is now important to expand the scope of diet based API exposure modeling to include alternative exposure pathways (e.g., uptake from landfills, dumps and wastewater treatment plants) and geographic locations (developing countries) where API contamination of the environment may represent greater risk.

AB The removal of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) present in urban wastewater by membrane bioreactors (MBRs) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) membranes has been frequently addressed in the literature. However, data regarding the removal of their main human metabolites and transformation products (TPs) is still scarce. In this study, the presence of 13 PhACs and 20 of their metabolites and TPs was monitored during 2 consecutive years in the different treatment steps of urban raw wastewater (sewer, primary treatment, MBR and RO/NF). Rejection of the selected contaminants when using low pressure NF membranes (NF-90) or RO membranes (ESPA 2) after the MBR step was also investigated. The analgesic acetaminophen, which was found at the highest concentrations in the sewer and influent samples (18-74 mu g L-1) over the two experimental periods, was fully eliminated during MBR treatment. Those PhACs that were only partially removed after the MBR, were almost completely removed (> 99%) by the RO membrane working under different process conditions. At a similar average permeate fluxes (18 L m(-2) h(-1)), the NF membrane showed high removal efficiencies (> 90%) for all of the PhACs and their metabolites, though lower than those achieved by the RO membrane. When the flux of the NF90 membrane was increased to 30 L m(-2) h(-1) (while still operating at a feed pressure lower than the RO membrane at 18 L m(-2) h(-1)) the performance of the membrane increased, achieving 98% rejection of PhACs.

AB The electrolysis with diamond anodes of synthetic urines containing different concentrations of ibuprofen and cloxacillin is evaluated in this work, with the aim of determining if this technology is effective in the mineralization of both species in urine matrix and the main characteristics of the competitive oxidation among these two products and the natural organic compounds contained in urine (uric acid, creatinine and urea). Results point out that electrolytic technology can mineralize all organic contained in the urine very efficiently and that oxidation of the two pharmaceuticals is faster than that of the natural products contained in urine, opening the possibility of a selective treatment of the urine up to the point in which it can be merged safely with domestic wastewater without generating a negative impact on environment. Occurrence of perchlorate is the main drawback of this technology, although its impact is not believed to be as serious as the impact of the pharmaceuticals on environment.

AB An increasing area of agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater worldwide due to the scarcity of fresh water resources. Whether wastewater irrigations can affect the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of natural organic matter in soils is unclear. In this study, we assess the responses of the electron-accepting capacity (EAC) and electron-donating capacity (EDC) of soil humic substances (HS) to irrigations with wastewaters from different sources. We show that the EAC of soil HS increases and the EDC of soil HS decreases after irrigation with domestic wastewater. Conversely, the EAC of soil HS decreases and the EDC of soil HS increases after irrigation with industrial wastewater. The EAC and EDC of soil HS exert no changes after irrigation with pharmaceutical wastewater. Irrigations with wastewaters from different sources can cause the distinct directions of changes in the activities of lignin peroxidase and laccase by altering the content of labile organic carbon, heavy metals or antibiotics in soils, thereby changing the chemical structures and finally the ETC of HS along different directions. These results can provide insights into the role of HS in environmentally relevant processes in agricultural soils under the context of wastewater irrigations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pressure on groundwater resources has increased during the last decades due to the growing demand, especially in arid and semiarid regions, such as the Mediterranean basin, with frequent drought periods. In order to partially remediate this environmental problem of world concern, irrigation of agricultural lands with adequately treated wastewaters (TWW) is becoming a common management practice. The complex composition of these low-quality waters may influence the behavior of organic contaminants in soils. A calcareous soil with low organic carbon content was selected for the assessment of the adsorption and leaching of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid (THC). Different solutions were evaluated: TWW after a secondary treatment, a saline solution and solutions with a range of dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC, 3-300 mg L-1). The addition of an organic fertilizer (fertiormont) to the soilwas also assessed, in an attempt to reduce THC mobility. Sorption of thiacloprid, a relatively polar pesticide, was similar under all the conditions considered, though an adsorption decrease was observed when DOC concentration increased. The transport of THC through soil columns was retarded with all the treatments, with the lower effects corresponding to TWW and the saline solution. Addition of fertiormont and irrigation with DOC at 3 mg L-1 resulted in a reduction of pesticide leached (34% and 38%, respectively) in comparison with the control (66%), but surprisingly not for DOC at high concentration (55%), possibly due to co-elution of the pesticide with DOC. Therefore the transport of polar compounds, like THC, could be affected by the composition of the irrigation solutions, altering their impact to environmental water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A highly sensitive and robust method was developed for routine analysis of two progestin metabolites, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnanolone (17OH-Delta 5P) and pregnanediol (PD), and 31 other natural and synthetic steroids and related metabolites (estrogens, androgens, corticosteroids, progestins) in river water, as well as influents and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) using HPLC-MS/MS combined with solid-phase extraction. For the various matrixes considered, the optimized method showed satisfactory performance with recoveries of 70-120% for most of target steroids. The method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0.01 to 3 ng/L for river water, 0.02 to 10 ng/L for WWTP effluents, and 0.1 to 40 ng/L for influents with good linearity and reproducibility. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of steroids in rivers and WWTP influent and effluents. WWTP influents concentrations of 17OH-Delta 5P and PD were 51-256ng/L and upto 400ng/L, respectively, along with androstenedione (concentration range: 38-220 ng/L), testosterone (11-26 ng/L), estrone (2.3-37 ng/L), 17 beta-estradiol (N.D.-8.7 ng/L), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (N.D.-66 ng/L), medroxyprogesterone acetate (N.D.-5.3 ng/L), and progesterone (2.0-22 ng/L), while only androstenedione (ADD), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3) were detected in effluent with concentrations ranging up to 1.7 ng/L, 0.90 ng/L and 0.8 ng/L, respectively. In river water samples, only ADD and E1 were detected with concentrations up to 1.0 ng/L and 0.91 ng/L. Our procedure represents the first method for analyzing 17OH-Delta 5P and PD in environmental samples along with a large series of steroids. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are inefficient for the removal of parabens. The aim of this study was finding a suitable solution using ozone and UVA irradiation combined with TiO2 catalysts doped with different noble metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic ozonation required lower amounts of ozone for higher efficiency on the removal of parabens, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC). The best catalyst for the initial contaminants degradation was 05% Ag-TiO2 leading to total parabens removal using 46 mgO(3)/L. Due to the relative low mineralization achieved, the toxicity of the treated solutions was still compared with the initial one over several species Vibriofscheri, Lepidiurn sativurri and Corbic-ula fluminen). All the treatments applied led to a clear decrease on the toxicity compared with initial mixture of parabens. From an economical point of view, it was concluded that the presence of UVA irradiation increased the energy consumption compared with catalytic ozonation with these catalysts but it can decrease the time of reaction. From the by-products analysis, it was concluded that hydroxylation appears to be the most significant reaction pathway and the main responsible for parabens degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are being increasingly included in Life Cycle Assessment studies (LCAs) since they have brought into evidence both human and ecological adverse effects due to their presence in different environmental compartments, wastewater facilities and industry. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to estimate the characterization factors (CFs) of 27 PPCPs widely used worldwide in order to incorporate their values into Life Cycle Impact Assessment studies (LCIA) or to generate a toxicity impact score ranking. Physicochemical properties, degradation rates, bioaccumulation, ecotoxicity and human health effects were collected from experimental data, recognized databases or estimated using EPI Suite (TM) and the USEtox (TM) software, and were subsequently used for estimating CFs. In addition, a Spanish toxicity impact score ranking was carried out for 49 PPCPs using the 27 newly calculated CFs, and 22 CFs already available in the literature, besides the data related to the occurrence of PPCPs in the environment in Spain. It has been highlighted that emissions into the continental freshwater compartment showed the highest CFs values for human effects (ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-3) Cases.kg(-1)), followed by emissions into the air (10(-9) to 10(-5) Cases.kg(-1)), soil (10(-11) to 10(5) Cases.kg(-1)) and seawater (10(-12) to 10(-4) Cases.kg(-1)). CFs regarding the affectation of freshwater aquatic environments were the highest of those proceeding from emissions into continental freshwater (between 1 to 104 PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)) due to the direct contact between the source of emission and the compartment affected, followed by soil (among 10(-1) to 104 PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)), and air (among 10(-2) to 10(4)-PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)) while the lowest were the CFs of continental seawater (among 10(-28) to 10(-3) PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)). Freshwater aquatic ecotoxicological CFs are much higher than human toxicity CFs, demonstrating that the ecological impact of PPCPs in aquatic environments must be a matter of urgent attention. According to the Spanish toxicity impact score calculated, the PPCPs with the highest impact are hormones, antidepressants, fragrances, antibiotics, angiotensin receptor blockers and blood lipid regulators, which have already been found in other kinds of score rankings. These results, which were not available until now, will be useful in order to perform better LCIA studies, incorporating the micro-pollutants whose CFs have been estimated, or in order to carry out single hazard/risk environmental impact assessments.

AB Illicit and legal drugs of abuse, including alcohol, continue to be in the focus of many governmental national and international studies due to the important consequences of their consumption at both individual and social level. Estimation of drug use at the community level from the concentrations of the drugs themselves or their major metabolites measured in wastewater has become an increasingly accepted and extended tool, complementary to the methods traditionally used for this purpose. The present work describes the application of this approach, generally known as wastewater epidemiology, to investigate the latest drug consumption patterns and trends in the European city of Barcelona. To this end, a total of 19 selected drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored at the inlet of one of the main wastewater treatment plants of Barcelona every day during one week in March between 2011 and 2015. Analysis of the selected drugs and metabolites in the wastewater samples was performed by means of two methodologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the concentrations obtained were translated into consumption data. In agreement with official records, alcohol, followed by cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds, and methadone were the most consumed drugs. Alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine consumption were on average 18 mL(14 g)/day/inhabitant (>15), 38 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15-64, and 2.4 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15-64, respectively. As for drug use trends, consumption increased over the 5 years monitored for all drugs, but for heroin and diazepam. Weekly profiles characterized by higher consumption over the weekend as compared to weekdays were observed only for alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA. Extrapolation of the data obtained for the area under study to the national Spanish territory yields consumption figures of 142 t of illicit drugs per year and >2500 million euro turnover per year in the black market.

AB Veterinary pharmaceuticals, widely used in intensive livestock production, may contaminate surface waters. Identifying their sources and pathways in watersheds is difficult because i) most veterinary pharmaceuticals are used in human medicine as well and ii) septic or sewer wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can release pharmaceuticals into surface water, even in agricultural headwater watersheds. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of animal-specific, mixed-use, and human-specific pharmaceuticals, from agricultural headwaters with intensive livestock production and a WWTP to a watershed used for Water Framework Directive monitoring. Grab sampling was performed during one hydrological year upstream and downstream from a WWTP and at three dates in seven nested watersheds with areas of 1.9-84.1 km(2). Twenty pharmaceuticals were analyzed. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected at all sampling dates upstream and downstream from theWWTP and at concentrations higher than those of human-specific pharmaceuticals. The predominance of animal-specific and mixed-use pharmaceuticals vs. human-specific pharmaceuticals observed at these sampling points was confirmed at the other sampling points. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected mainly during runoff events and periods of manure spreading. A large percentage of mixed-use pharmaceuticals could come from animal sources, but it was difficult to determine. Mixed-use and human-specific pharmaceuticals predominated in the largest watersheds when runoff decreased. In areas of intensive livestock production, mitigation actions should focus on agricultural headwater watersheds to decrease the number of pathways and the transfer volume of veterinary pharmaceuticals, which can be the main contaminants.

AB A select few prescription drugs can be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose when not used as prescribed. Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that expired, unwanted, or otherwise unused portions of most of these drugs be disposed of quickly through a take-back program. If such an option is not readily available, FDA recommends that they be flushed down the sink or toilet. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate the ecological and human-health risks associated with the environmental release of the 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) currently on the FDA "flush list". The evaluation suggests that even when highly conservative assumptions are used-including that the entire API mass supplied for clinical use is flushed, all relevant sources in addition to clinical use of the API are considered, and no metabolic loss, environmental degradation, or dilution of wastewater effluents are used in estimating environmental concentrations-most of these APIs present a negligible eco-toxicological risk, both as individual compounds and as a mixture. For a few of these APIs, additional eco-toxicological data will need to be developed. Using similar conservative assumptions for human-health risks, all 15 APIs present negligible risk through ingestion of water and fish. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence and temporal-spatial distributions of 13 antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones) in the water of a high-intensity aquaculture lake, Honghu Lake, and its associated river network and ponds were investigated. Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and sulfadiazine are the four dominant antibiotics in this region, with maximum and median concentrations of 1454.8 and 304.8 ng/L, 2796.6 and 161.9 ng/L, 1431.3 and 349.9 ng/L, and 499.5 and 106.5 ng/L, respectively. The median concentrations of the other nine antibiotics are lower than 57.1 ng/L. The highest contaminated sites are located in the Four-lake main canal and its lake inlets. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in November than in May and the concentrations were strongly correlated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrates according to redundancy analysis. The source analysis indicated that besides untreated domestic and husbandry sewage, the aquaculture in the lake and ponds is a main source of antibiotics in the study region. The environmental hazards posed by the selected antibiotics were assessed by using the methods of hazard quotient and mixture hazard quotient. The results suggested that tetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, and ciprofloxacin pose medium to high ecological hazard to algae in almost all of the water samples, and the high combination ecological hazards of antibiotics are mainly posed by the high individual hazard quotient of tetracycline in the study area.

AB Recycling organic waste products in agriculture is a potential route for the dispersion of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. In this study, the concentrations of thirteen pharmaceuticals and the personal care product triclosan (PPCPs) were determined in different environmental matrices from long-term experimental fields amended with different organic waste products (OWPs), including sludge, composted sludge with green wastes, livestock effluents and composted urban wastes applied at usual agricultural rates.
   PPCP concentrations were different in OWPs, varying from a few micrograms to milligrams per kilogram drymatter or per litre for slurry. OWPs from sludge or livestock effluents primarily contained antibiotics, whereas composted urban wastes primarily contained anti-inflammatory compounds.
   PPCP contents in soils amended for several years were less than a few micrograms per kilogram. The most persistent compounds (fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine) were quantified or detected in soils amended with sludge or composted sludge. In soils amended with composted municipal solid waste, carbamazepine was quantified, and fluoroquinolones, ibuprofen and diclofenac were sometimes detected. The small increases in fluoroquinolones and carbamazepine in soils after individual OWP applications were consistent with the fluxes from the applied OWP. The measured concentrations of pharmaceuticals in soil after several successive OWP applications were lower than the predicted concentrations because of degradation, strong sorption to soil constituents and/or leaching. Dissipation half-lives (DT50) were approximately 750-2500, 900 and <300 days for fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine and ibuprofen, respectively, in temperate soils and <350 and <80 days for fluoroquinolones and doxycycline, respectively, in tropical soils.
   Detection frequencies in soil leachates were very low (below 7%), and concentrations ranged from the limits of detection (0.002-0.03 mu g/L) and exceptionally to 0.27 mu g/L. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were carbamazepine and ibuprofen.
   Based on the risk quotient, the estimated ecotoxicological risks for different soil organisms were low. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dams are universally constructed to change hydrodynamic forces and impound water in urban rivers, but few efforts have been made to expound the impact of dams on the transport of antibiotics in rivers. In this study, the main object and focus was to elucidate the intercept effect of rubber dam and the gate dam on the sediment-water phase redistribution of eight typical antibiotics along an urban river with the water replenished from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results show that the eight antibiotics were widely detected in the whole river segment, and the WWTPs were found to be the main sources. Among the eight antibiotics, fluoroquinolones had the highest concentrations in the surface water, while tetracyclines constituted the dominant composition in the sediments. Due to the retention effect, the rubber dam encouraged the enrichment and degradation of the antibiotics in the river. However, the role of gate dams depended mainly on the opening and closing of the sluice gate. For all eight antibiotics, each dam or WWTP exhibited a generally consistent impact on the changes (e.g., an increase or decrease) of the sediment-water partitioning coefficients, although obvious differences existed between effect degree. Moreover, the changes in the coefficients caused by the rubber damwere completely opposite to those affected by gate dams. Contrary to the other six antibiotics, the two sulfonamides showed significant relationships with the dissolved organic matter in the surface water but had no significant relationships with the organic matter in the sediments.

AB Human-use drug residues (DR) are only partially eliminated by waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), so that residual amounts can reach natural waters and cause environmental hazards. In order to properly manage these hazards in the aquatic environment, a database is made available that integrates the concentration ranges for DR, which cause adverse effects for aquatic organisms, and the temporal variations of the ecotoxicological risks. To implement this database for the ecotoxicological risk assessment (ERA database), the required information for each DR is the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs), along with the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). The risk assessment is based on the ratio between the PNECs and the PECs. Adverse effect data or PNECs have been found in the publicly available literature for 45 substances. These ecotoxicity test data have been extracted from 125 different sources. This ERA database contains 1157 adverse effect data and 287 PNECs. The efficiency of this ERA database was tested with a data set coming from a simultaneous survey of WWTPs and the natural environment. In this data set, 26 DR were searched for in two WWTPs and in the river. On five sampling dates, concentrations measured in the river for 10 DR could pose environmental problems of which 7 were measured only downstream of WWTP outlets. From scientific literature and measurements, data implementation with unit homogenisation in a single database facilitates the actual ecotoxicological risk assessment, and may be useful for further risk coming from data arising from the future field survey. Moreover, the accumulation of a large ecotoxicity data set in a single database should not only improve knowledge of higher risk molecules but also supply an objective tool to help the rapid and efficient evaluation of the risk.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is considered to be a useful tool for monitoring chemical consumption in the population. However, the lack of information on potential transformation of biomarkers in the sewer system can compromise the accuracy of the consumption estimation. The present study contributes to addressing this issue by investigating the in-sewer stability of biomarkers from a number of commonly used drugs using laboratory sewer reactors that canmimic different sewer conditions. A stable and an unstable chemical (carbamazepine and caffeine) were also used as benchmarking chemicals to reflect the chemical degradation potential in different sewer conditions. The results suggested that ketamine and norketamine were unstable in gravity and rising main sewers, ketamine was unstable in bulk liquid while norketamine was stable under the same condition. Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the rising main sewer. Morphine and codeine glucuronide were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties.

AB Pharmaceuticals occurrence and environmental risk assessment were assessed in Portuguese surface waters, evaluating the impact of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and river flow rates. Twenty three pharmaceuticals from 6 therapeutic groups, including metabolites and 1 transformation product, were analysed in 72 samples collected from 20 different sites, upstream and downstream the selected WWTPs, in two different seasons. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy.
   Pharmaceuticals were detected in 27.8% of the samples. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-inflammatories and antibiotics presented the highest detection frequencies (27.8, 23.6 and 23.6%, respectively) and average concentrations (37.9, 36.1 and 33.5 ng L-1, respectively). When assessing the impact of WWTPs, an increase of 21.4% in the average concentrations was observed in the samples located downstream these facilities, when compared with the upstream samples.
   Increased detection frequencies and concentrations were observed at lower flow rates, both when comparing summer and winter campaigns and by evaluating the different rivers.
   Risk quotients (RQs) higher than one were found for two pharmaceuticals, concerning two trophic levels. However, since Iberian rivers are highly influenced by water scarcity, in drought periods, the flow rates in these rivers can decrease at least ten times from the lowest value observed in the sampling campaigns. In these conditions, RQs higher than 1 would be observed for 5 pharmaceuticals, additionally, all the detected pharmaceuticals (11) would present RQs higher than 0.1.
   These results emphasize that the river flow rate represents an important parameter influencing pharmaceuticals concentrations, highlighting the ecotoxicological pressure, especially due to water scarcity in drought periods. This should be a priority issue in the environmental policies for minimizing its impact in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is a risk of 'ecological surprises' if multiple potentially interacting stressors are managed individually, which is a question attracting significant current interest. Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a 'basemodel' with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna.

AB Recent studies revealed the benefits of oligotrophic and oxic conditions for the biological removal of many trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during soil-aquifer treatment. These findings indicate an unused tuning potential that might also be applicable in engineered biofiltration systems with drastically reduced hydraulic retention times for an enhanced mitigation of TOrCs during wastewater treatment. This study introduces the novel approach of sequential biofiltration (SBF) for the advanced treatment of secondary effluent using two granular media filters operated in series with an intermediate aeration step aiming for oxic and oligotrophic conditions in the second filter stage. Results from the experiments conducted at pilot-scale confirm a reduced substrate availability and predominantly oxic conditions in the second filter stage of the SBF setup. An increased removal of several TOrCs was observed in an SBF system as compared to a conventional single-stage biofiltration unit operated at the same overall empty bed contact time (EBCT). Short-term tests with varying EBCTs in the first filter stage revealed a high degree of system robustness of TOrC mitigation when confronted with sudden hydraulic load variations. Higher removal of several TOrCs at increased EBCTs in the second filter stage indicates that EBCT might play a crucial role for the degradation of certain compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although ternary chalcogenide compounds are effective photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation, their photocatalytic activity and stability are still low and far from practical application. In this study, two-dimensional AgInS2/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions were fabricated by one-step hydrothermal method. AgIn52/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions have strong visible-light absorption and narrow band gap of 2.27-2.35 eV, and exhibit excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of 2-nitrophenol (2NP) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC.HCl) compared with pure AgInS2 and pure SnIn4S8, which is attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The practical application of AgInS2/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions was further studied. 20 mg AgInS2/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions can effectively treat 100 mL real pharmaceutical industry wastewater in presence of H2O2 with 65.98% mineralization efficiency, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of pharmaceutical industry wastewater decreases to 153 mg/L, which meets the discharge standards of industrial effluent. Moreover, AgInS2/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions can maintain long-term activity without obvious inactivation after five consecutive catalytic cycles without using regeneration means.

AB The development of efficient materials for removing pharmaceuticals from water has been a matter of great concern. As a new class of porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable attention in the field of environmental remediation. In this article, a photocatalytic adsorbent MIL-53(Fe) was successfully prepared by solvothermal method and used for the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals clofibric acid (CA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from water. MIL-53(Fe) exhibited good adsorption performance and the maximum adsorption capacities of CA and CBZ are about 0.80 mmol/g and 0.57 mmol/g, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms of CA and CBZ are mainly due to electrostatic interaction and pi-pi interaction, respectively. Further, MIL-53(Fe) exhibited high photocatalytic activity and stability under visible light. The photocatalytic efficiency could be improved significantly with the addition of a small amount of H2O2, and the corresponding photodegradation efficiencies for CA and CBZ both reached up to 90%, which are higher than those of Fe(II)/H2O2 and TiO2 under visible light. The photocatalytic performance was strongly dependent on the solution pH. The Fenton-like reaction, charge carriers directly generated in the photo-excited MIL-53(Fe) and the synergistic effect of H2O2 were the main mechanisms. The formation of humic acids-like and fulvic acids-like organic matter in the degradation process was detected by 3D EMMs. MIL-53(Fe) also revealed excellent performance for the removal of CA and CBZ from real municipal wastewater and river water. Therefore, MIL-53(Fe) may be used as a promising photocatalytic adsorbent for wastewater purification. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wastewater reuse is important to address the challenge of water shortage but direct reuse could still introduce undesired contaminants to final products, e.g., via agricultural irrigation. Advanced membrane treatment such as forward osmosis can further purify the treated wastewater with recovery of high quality water. Herein, a forward osmosis - electrodialysis (FO-ED) hybrid system has been investigated by using diammonium phosphate (DAP), a common fertilizer, as a non-regeneration draw solute to achieve water reclamation and mitigation of salinity buildup. The system achieved consistent water recovery in the FO with low specific reverse solute flux for both NH4+-N (0.063 g L-1) and PO43--P (0.083 g L-1). Intensified fouling condition was observed when actual treated wastewater was applied as the feed, requiring periodical membrane cleaning. There were only Na+, Cl-, and small amounts of organics being presented in the recovered water (diluted draw solution of FO) at an acceptable level towards water reuse for agricultural irrigation. The ED accomplished successful recovery of 96.6 +/- 3.0% reverse-fluxed DAP under 3.0 V 1-h daily operation, which could be reused in the FO. The energy consumption of the hybrid system was as low as 0.72 kWh m(-3) or 0.45 kWh kg(-1) DAP. These results have demonstrated a synergy between FO and ED for creating an energy-efficient solution to enhance wastewater reuse.

AB Heroin consumption in major cities across China was estimated for the first time via wastewater-based epidemiology. Influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from 49 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 24 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Concentrations of morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, and codeine were measured. Near complete removal of morphine by wastewater treatment processes was observed, whereas removal rates of codeine were slightly lower. Morphine loads were much higher than codeine loads at most WWTPs in China, a trend opposite to that in many European countries. In addition, morphine and codeine loads were strongly correlated at most WWTPs, indicating morphine and codeine in wastewater were predominantly from the same source, street heroin. At WWTPs in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, codeine loads were considerably higher than morphine loads, consistent with previous reports of codeine abuse (e.g., as cough syrup) among middle and high school students in Guangdong province. Heroin consumption was derived based on morphine loads and taking into account therapeutic use of morphine and codeine, as well as contribution of codeine and acetylcodeine in street heroin. Highest heroin consumption was observed in northwestern and southwestern China. The average heroin consumption of the sampled cities was 64.6 +/- 78.7 mg/1000 inh/d. The nation-wide average heroin consumption was much lower than that of methamphetamine, consistent with seizure data and numbers of registered heroin and methamphetamine users in China.

AB Contamination of receiving waters with pharmaceutical compounds is of pressing concern. This constitutes the first study to report on the development of a semi-quantitative risk assessment (RA) model for evaluating the environmental threat posed by three EU watch list pharmaceutical compounds namely, diclofenac, 17-betaestradiol and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, to aquatic ecosystems using Irish data as a case study. This RA model adopts the Irish Environmental Protection Agency Source-Pathway-Receptor concept to define relevant parameters for calculating low, medium or high risk score for each agglomeration of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which include catchment, treatments, operational and management factors. This RA model may potentially be used on a national scale to (i) identify WWTPs that pose a particular risk as regards releasing disproportionally high levels of these pharmaceutical compounds, and (ii) help identify priority locations for introducing or upgrading control measures (e.g. tertiary treatment, source reduction). To assess risks for these substances of emerging concern, the model was applied to 16 urban WWTPs located in different regions in Ireland that were scored for the three different compounds and ranked as low, medium or high risk. As a validation proxy, this case study used limited monitoring data recorded at some these plants receiving waters. It is envisaged that this semi-quantitative RA approach may aid other EU countries investigate and screen for potential risks where limited measured or predicted environmental pollutant concentrations and/or hydrological data are available. This model is semi-quantitative, as other factors such as influence of climate change and drug usage or prescription data will need to be considered in a future point for estimating and predicting risks.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) frequently enter surface waters via discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as from industrial and agricultural activities, creating environmental and health concerns. In this study, selected EDCs were measured in water and sediments along two transboundary streams flowing from the Palestinian Authority (PA) into Israel (the Zomar-Alexander and Hebron-Beer Sheva Streams). We assessed how the complicated conflict situation between Israel and the PA and the absence of a coordinated strategy and joint stream management commission influence effective EDC control. Both streams receive raw Palestinian wastewater in their headwaters, which flows through rural areas and is treated via sediment settling facilities after crossing the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line. Four sampling campaigns were conducted over two years, with concentrations of selected EDCs measured in both the water and the sediments. Results show asymmetrical pollution profiles due to socio-economic differences and contrasting treatment capacities. No in-stream attenuation was observed along the stream and in the sediments within the Palestinian region. After sediment settling in treatment facilities at the Israeli border, however, significant reductions in the EDC concentrations were measured both in the sediments and in the water. Differences in sedimentation technologies had a substantial effect on EDC removal at the treatment location, positively affecting the streams' ability to further remove EDCs downstream. The prevailing approach to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian transboundary wastewater contamination reveals a narrow perspective among water managers who on occasion only take local interests into consideration, with interventions focused solely on improving stream water quality in isolated segments. Application of the "proximity principle" through the establishment of WWTPs at contamination sources constitutes a preferable strategy for reducing contamination by EDCs and other pollutants to ensure minimization of public health risks due to the pollution of streams and underlying potable groundwater.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals, particularly antibiotics, in water bodies and water streams has raised increasing worries about the potential risks to human health and ecosystems. Norfloxacin is a popularly used fluoroquinolone antibiotic and considered as an emerging pharmaceutical contaminant. In this paper, adsorption of norfloxacin from artificial wastewater was done by the pretreated barley straw (PBS) that was made from raw barley straw with H3PO4 impregnation and microwave heating. The experimentally maximum norfloxacin adsorption capacity of PBS was 349 +/- 17 mg/g at 298.15 K and pH 6.96. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms with respect to temperature were evaluated. The results indicated that adsorption of norfloxacin on PBS was an endothermic process. The adsorption site energy and its distribution based on the Langmuir-Freundlich model were determined to describe the adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the percentage of adsorption sites, the site energy of which are greater than or equal to a specific energy E*, was estimated. The proposed dominant driving forces, electron-donor-acceptor interactions (n-pi and pi-pi) between the polarizable PBS (carboxyl and aromatic groups, as n- and pi-electron-donors) and norfloxacin (carbon atom in benzene ring attached to F, as a pi-electron-acceptor), were investigated by the C and O K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy.

AB The continuous release of antibiotic compounds through wastewater effluent into environment has raised concerns about their potential problems for different organisms. Enzymatic degradation with laccase is a green option for removal of pharmaceutical compounds from aqueous media. In this study, laccase was immobilized onto homemade Polyacrylonitrile-biochar composite nanofibrous membrane and the obtained biocatalyst was employed for removal of chlortetracycline, a widely used antibiotic, from aqueous media in continuous mode. The results showed that the immobilized laccase has improved storage, temperature and pH stability compared to free laccase. Also, it retained more than 50% of its initial activity after 7 cycles of ABTS oxidation which indicated improved enzyme reusability. Finally, while using immobilized laccase for degradation of chlortetracycline in continuous mode exhibited 58.3%, 40.7% and 22.6% chlortetracycline removal efficiency at flux rates of 1, 2 and 3 mL/h.cm(2).

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are increasingly being reported in wastewater effluents and surface waters around the world. The presence of these products, designed to modulate human physiology and behaviour, has created concern over whether PhACs similarly affect aquatic organisms. Though laboratory studies are beginning to address the effects of individual PhACs on fish behaviour, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on fish behaviour. In this study, we exposed a wild, invasive fish species-the round goby (Neogobiusmelanostomus)-to treated wastewater effluent (0%, 50% or 100% effluent dilutions) for 28 days. We then determined the impact of exposure on fish aggression, an important behaviour for territory acquisition and defense. We found that exposure to 100% wastewater effluent reduced the number of aggressive acts that round goby performed. We complimented our behavioural assay with measures of pharmaceutical uptake in fish tissues. We detected 11 of 93 pharmaceutical compounds that we tested for in round goby tissues, and we found that concentration was greatest in the brain followed by plasma, then gonads, then liver, and muscle. Fish exposed to 50% and 100% effluent had higher tissue concentrations of pharmaceuticals and concentrated a greater number of pharmaceutical compounds compare to control fish exposed to no (0%) effluent. Exposed fish also showed increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, suggesting that fish were exposed to planar halogenated/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHHs/PAHs) in the wastewater effluent. Our findings suggest that fish in effluent-dominated systems may have altered behaviours and greater tissue concentration of PhACs. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of characterizing exposure to multiple pollutants, and support using behaviour as a sensitive tool for assessing animal responses to complex contaminant mixtures, like wastewater effluent.

AB This study is focused on the Guadalete River basin (SW, Spain), where extreme weather conditions have become common, with and alternation between periods of drought and extreme rainfall events. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) occur when heavy rainfall events exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), as well as pollution episodes in parts of the basin due to uncontrolled sewage spills and the use of reclaimed water and sludge from the local WWTP.The sampling was carried out along two seasons and three campaigns during dry (March 2007) and extreme rainfall (April and December 2010) in the Guadalete River, alluvial aquifer and Jerez de la Frontera aquifer.Results showed minimum concentrations for synthetic surfactants in groundwater (< 37.4 mu g.L- 1) during the first campaign (dry weather conditions), whereas groundwater contaminants increased in December 2010 as the heavy rainfall caused the river to overflow.In surface water, surfactant concentrations showed similar trends to groundwater observations.In addition to surfactants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were analyzed in the third campaign, 22 of which were detected in surface waters. Two fragrances (OTNE and galaxolide) and one analgesic/anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) were the most abundant PPCPs (up to 6540, 2748 and 1747 ng.L-1, respectively).Regarding ground water, most PPCPswere detected in Jerez de la Frontera aquifer, where a synthetic fragrance (OTNE) was predominant (up to 1285 ng.L-1).

AB Wastewater transport along sewers favors the colonization of inner pipe surfaces by wastewater-derived microorganisms that grow forming biofilms. These biofilms are composed of rich and diverse microbial communities that are continuously exposed to antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) from urban wastewater. Sewer biofilms thus appear as an optimal habitat for the dispersal and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, the concentration of antibiotics, integron (intI1) and antibiotic resistance genes (qnrS, sul1, sul2, bla(TEM), bla(KPC), ermB, tetM and tetW), and potential bacterial pathogens were analyzed in wastewater and biofilm samples collected at the inlet and outlet sections of a pressurized sewer pipe. The most abundant ARGs detected in both wastewater and biofilm samples were sul1 and sul2 with roughly 1 resistance gene for each 10 copies of 16s RNA gene. Significant differences in the relative abundance of gene intI1 and genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and betalactams (bla(TEM)) were only measured between inlet and outlet biofilm samples. Composition of bacterial communities also showed spatial differences in biofilms and a higher prevalence of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with high sequence identity (>98%) to well-known human pathogens was observed in biofilms collected at the inlet pipe section. Our study highlights the role of sewer biofilms as source and sink of ARB and ARGs and supports the idea that community composition rather than antibiotic concentration is the main factor driving the diversity of the sewage resistome.

AB A critical evaluation of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was performed on 16 of Portugal's most consumed pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents (WWEs), the main route for aquatic contamination. The predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were formulated based on the Guideline, after incorporating several refinements. The best approach was selected by comparing the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) to the PECs in WWEs. Finally, risk was assessed by comparing PECs to predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs).
   The results showed that the default value of the penetration factor (Fpen) used by the EMA (0.01) was surpassed and that national consumption and excretion data were the two most important parameters for PEC calculations. The risk quotient between PECs and PNECs was higher than 1 for 12 pharmaceuticals, indicating a risk to all three trophic levels of aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish).
   To improve the current ERA framework, suggestions were made for incorporating consumption and excretion data, changing the default value of Fpen to 0.04 and adding a safety factor of 10. Moreover, this evaluation should be performed for pharmaceuticals already on the market, and future ERAs should incorporate a risk-benefit analysis, an important risk-management step.

AB In this study a probabilistic risk assessment was applied to investigate the environmental risks for the European aquatic environment associated with triclosan (TCS) occurrence in treated wastewater. The concentrations of TCS in effluents of European Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) were recorded through literature review, while toxicity data was collected for three groups of aquatic organisms (algae, Daphnia magna and fish). The ratio of Measured Environmental Concentration (MEC) and Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC), expressed as a Risk Quotient (RQ), was calculated for risk characterization, while Monte Carlo simulation was applied to quantify the associated uncertainty. TCS monitoring data was available for 349 STPs located in 15 out of the 50 European countries. Its mean concentrations in STPs effluents ranged between 2.2 ng L-1 and 47,800 ng L-1. Higher TCS concentrations were observed in primarily treated wastewater; whereas no differences among countries or among secondary and tertiary effluents on the basis of the whole set of collected data were found. The 95th percentile of RQ for TCS was higher than 1 (in algae) for rivers with dilution factors (DFs) equal to or lower than 100, when the maximum concentration values were used, whereas the 95th percentile of RQ exceeded 1 for rivers with DFs up to 10, in cases where the calculations were based on mean concentration values. The probability that RQ exceeds 1 in rivers (for algae) ranged from 0.2% (DF = 1000) to 45% (DF = 2), when calculations are based on mean concentration values. The corresponding probabilities in rivers with DFs equal to 2 for Daphnia magna and fish were 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. We propose that TCS monitoring should be intensified, especially on smaller rivers, to verify the findings of this study for possible environmental risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vitamin B-12 wastewater, as a pharmaceutical wastewater, is difficult to treat due to its high concentrations of bioresistant organic matters, salinity, chromaticity, and poor biodegradability. A laboratory-scale microelectrolysis (ME) process with aeration device was designed to treat this wastewater. Our results suggested that, under obtained optimal condition of hydraulic retention time of 80min, initial pH of 3, and air/water ratio of 100:1, the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen (NH3N), and chromaticity in the wastewater by ME process was achieved by 43.9%, 7.9%, and 82.6%, respectively. Organic matter with benzene ring was largely removed or degraded and, therefore, C=C and C=O bonds were destroyed, and substituents of aromatic rings contained more aliphatic chains after treatment by ME process. All wastewater samples were divided into three parallel factor analysis components: one protein-like (component 1 [C1]) and two humic-like components (component 2 [C2] and component 3 [C3]). Fluorescence analysis results demonstrated that humic-like and fulvic-like substances with macromolecular weight and complex structure were decomposed or degraded into smaller molecular weight substances by ME process, in addition to those easily degradable protein-like components. We further demonstrated that biodegradability of vitamin B-12 wastewater after treatment by ME process was increased using biodegradability index, suggesting that the ME process can greatly improve the removal efficiency of contaminants in wastewater by subsequent treatment process.

AB The bioaccumulation of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and personal care product chemicals (PPCPs) was studied in Cootes Paradise Marsh (CPM), an urban wetland that receives tertiary treated municipal waste waters as well as urban storm runoff. We measured PPCPs in caged and wild goldfish, as well as wild carp, and compared observed bioaccumulation factors (BAF(P)) using concentrations in surface waters and fish blood plasma, with modeled BAFs. Thirty-two PPCPs were detected in water from the central CPM site (CPM3) while 64 PPCPs were found at higher concentrations at a site immediately downstream of the effluent outflow (CPM1). Following a 3-week deployment, 15 PPCPs were detected in the plasma of caged goldfish at CPM1, and 14 at CPM3, compared to only 3 in goldfish caged at a reference site. The highest BAF(P) in goldfish were for the antidepressant Sigma fluoxetine averaging 386 L/kg in caged and 906 L/kg in wild goldfish, respectively. In carp, Sigma Diazepam (diazepam and oxazepam) had the highest BAF(P) (927 L/kg). This study identified a broader range of PPCPs in fish and surface waters than previously reported. However, modeled BAFs did not show good agreement with observed whole body or plasma BAFs, demonstrating that more work is needed to better explain bioaccumulation of PPCPs.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and their recipient watersheds. To assess the potential of WWTP effluents to alter fish behaviour, we caged male goldfish (Carassius auratus) for 21-days at three sites along a contamination gradient downstream from a WWTP which discharges into Cootes Paradise Marsh, on the western tip of Lake Ontario. We also included a fourth caging site as an external reference site within Lake Ontario at the Jordan Harbour Conservation Area. We then measured concentrations of PPCPs and monoamine neurotransmitters in caged goldfish plasma, and conducted behavioural assays measuring activity, startle response, and feeding. We detected fifteen different PPCPs in goldfish plasma including six serotonin reuptake inhibitors (amitriptyline, citalopram, fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and diphenhydramine). Plasma concentrations of serotonin were significantly greater in plasma of fish caged closer to the WWTP effluent outfall site. The fish caged near and downstream of the WWTP effluent were bolder, more exploratory, and more active overall than fish caged at the reference site. Taken together, our results suggest that fish downstream of WWTPs are accumulating PPCPs at levels sufficient to alter neurotransmitter concentrations and to also impair ecologically-relevant behaviours.

AB Population growth has led to increased global discharges of wastewater. Contaminants that are not fully removed during wastewater treatment, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), may negatively affect aquatic ecosystems. PPCPs can bioaccumulate causing adverse health effects and behavioural changes in exposed fish. To assess the impact of PPCPs on wild fish, and to assess whether caged fish could be used as a surrogate for resident wild fish in future monitoring, we caged goldfish in a marsh affected by discharges of wastewater effluents (Cootes Paradise, Lake Ontario, Canada). We collected plasma from resident wild goldfish, and from goldfish that we caged in the marsh for three weeks. We analyzed the plasma proteome and metabolome of both wild and caged fish. We also compared proteomic and metabolic responses in caged and wild fish from the marsh to fish caged at a reference site (Jordan Harbour Conservation Area). We identified significant changes in expression of over 250 molecules that were related to liver necrosis, accumulation and synthesis of lipids, synthesis of cyclic AMP, and the quantity of intracellular calcium in fish from the wastewater affected marsh. Our results suggest that PPCPs could be affecting the health of wild fish populations.

AB The characterization of the pharmaceutical wastewater by physicochemical analysis of some parameters showed a significant pollution load, expressed particularly by organic pollutants (chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand). The removal of chemical oxygen demand by adsorption on anthracite is investigated in this study. The adsorption isotherms are realized in batch system; several working parameters, such as mass of adsorbent, contact time, temperature and particle size of anthracite were studied in an attempt to achieve a higher removal efficiency.
   The adsorption treatment achieved a maximum reduction of 70% for chemical oxygen demand under the following experimental conditions: 20 degrees C, 3 g of adsorbent, contact time: 1 hour and particle size of 0.6 mm. The adsorption follows well the Freundlich model and the adsorption kinetics is the pseudo-first-order type. The free energy change of COD adsorption on anthracite was calculated, and it indicates that adsorption is a spontaneous and physical process.

AB Pilot-scale tests were run with ozonation for reduction of 24 pharmaceuticals at 10 full-scale wastewater treatment plants in southern Sweden. Reduction was evaluated based on doses of 3, 5 and 7 g O-3/m(3) at all plants. The reduction of pharmaceuticals reached on average 65% at 3 g O-3/m(3), 78% at 5 g O-3/m(3) and 88% for 7 g O-3/m(3) in terms of total concentration of pharmaceuticals. Specific ozone dose (ratio O-3: TOC) was found to be highly influential on pharmaceutical removal. At two WWTPs, the pharmaceutical removal was severely reduced.

AB Complexity, presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and need to meet stringent rules have made treating of pharmaceutical wastewater highly challenging, which lead to an increase in attention towards these wastewaters seeking alternate and new methods. Some of the most commonly and widely accepted such treatment methods are activated carbon, membrane filtration and reverse osmosis. The present study focusses on treating wastewater from pharmaceutical industry using a combination of sequential batch reactor (SBR) and reverse osmosis (RO). After a series of four SBR treatments (SBR -I, II, III and IV) 53.7% of COD reduction was obtained by the end of SBR -IV. 99% removal in TDS, 99% reduction in COD and 83% reduction in Ammonia were obtained after treating the effluent from SBR by reverse osmosis. From the result it is concluded that series of SBR treatment proved to be suitable pretreatment for Reverse Osmosis which has shown promising results in reduction of the tested pollution parameters.

AB This study focused on the removal of antibiotic by coupling of heterogeneous photocatalysis with ozonation and hydrogen peroxide. The main objective was to intensify the efficiency of photocatalytic activity for better and faster antibiotic elimination/mineralization in wastewater. To fulfill this purpose a photocatalytic process based on falling film reactor was designed and optimized. The effects of operating parameters such as wastewater flow rate in the falling film reactor, the presence of an oxidizing agent (H2O2 and O-3), inlet concentrations, including catalyst dosage and light intensity were investigated and discussed. Experiments were mainly conducted with Flumequine and Clarithromycin. The first molecule (Flumequine) will serve as an example of fiuoroquinolone antibiotics and the second (Clarithromycin) as an example of macrolide antibiotics. Experimentally, the results have shown interesting degradation and mineralization efficiency (on the order of 94% for degradation and 76% for mineralization). Evidence for redox catalysis was shown using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after pollutant degradation. Moreover, special attention was also paid to identify the reaction products and the plausible degradation pathway during Flumequine degradation.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners, steroid hormones, and current-use pesticides have been detected in surface waters around the world, but to date, there have been no reports in the peer-reviewed literature on the levels of these classes of contaminants in freshwater resources in the Caribbean region. In the present study, multi-residue solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) were used to analyze grab samples of surface waters collected from five different watersheds in Barbados, West Indies. The artificial sweeteners (AS), acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose were widely detected in the watersheds, indicating contamination from domestic wastewater, and the concentrations of these chemical tracers in water were correlated with the concentrations of the non-prescription pharmaceutical, ibuprofen (R-2 values of 0.4-0.6). Surprisingly, the concentrations of another chemical tracer of domestic wastewater, caffeine were not correlated with ibuprofen or AS concentrations. Several other prescription pharmaceuticals and the steroid hormones, estrone and androstenedione, were detected in selected watersheds at low ng/L concentrations. The fungicide, chlorothalonil was widely detected in surface waters at low (<10 ng/L) concentrations, but the levels of this pesticide were not correlated with the concentrations of the other target analytes, indicating that the source of this pesticide is not domestic wastewater. An informal survey of disposal practices for out of date or unused drugs by pharmacies in Barbados indicated that disposal into trash destined for the landfill and flushing down the sink might be significant sources of contamination of water resources by pharmaceuticals.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) with a high potentiality for tunable morphology is gaining immense research interests for targeted environmental remediation of emerging micropollutants in source waters. Various three-dimensional (3D) flower-like nanostructures of ZnO were synthesized by following a facile and low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis approach, using Zn(CH3COO)(2)center dot 2H(2)O as the starting precursor reagent, in the presence of different bases at varying concentrations as the structure-directing reagents. BET studies indicated that the ZnO-flowers 1 were more superior than ZnO-flowers 2 and 3, as it possessed the highest specific surface area (10.83 m(2)/g), pore volume (0.054 cm(3)/g) and pore size (23.52 nm). Subsequently, the photoactivities of ZnO-flowers on the degradation of emerging salicylic acid micropollutant under UV-A illumination were examined. Batch studies suggested that the ZnO-flowers were photoactive and photocatalysed optimally under neutral pH condition that are aligned with the cost-effective and practical implementation for water/wastewater treatment. ZnO-flowers 1 demonstrated the highest photoactivity according to its reaction rate constant, where the kinetics data was well-fitted using the pseudo-first order Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equation. This finding was well correlated to the BET studies, where the high photoactivity in ZnO-flowers 1 could be ascribed to its exceptional surface morphology that maximises the surface contact area with salicylic acid during photodegradation. Finally, the radicals trapping experiments were carried out in order to validate the role of primary photogenerated holes (h(+)) and various secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the photodegradation of salicylic acid using ZnO-flowers photocatalysts. It was confirmed that the active species of photogenerated h(+), center dot OH, and center dot O-2(-) were responsible for the photodegradation process. The plausible mechanistic pathways for the reaction between scavenging reagents and the reactive transitory species to form by-products and intermediates were also proposed.

AB Sewage effluents contain pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals, exposing aquatic organisms to complex mixtures. The consequences of exposure to combinations of different classes of drugs in fish are largely unknown. In this study, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males and females for two weeks to low, environmentally relevant concentrations of the endocrine disrupting chemical 17 alpha-etinylestradiol (EE2) and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, alone and in combination, and analyzed behaviors of importance for population fitness, scototaxis (light/dark preference), the novel tank test and shoal cohesion. Control water contained 0.4 ng/L EE2 and the measured exposure concentrations were 0.9 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.1) and 1 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.5). The measured concentrations of citalopram were 0.1 (nominal 0.1) and 0.4 mu g/L (nominal 0.5). Both EE2 exposures increased anxiety in males in the scototaxis test, with significantly longer latency periods before entering and fewer visits to the white zone of the tank. The combined exposures (0.9 ng/L EE2 + 0.1 mu g/L citalopram and 1 ng/L EE2 + 0.4 mu g/L citalopram) resulted in abolishment of effects of EE2, with shorter latency period and more transitions to white than for fish exposed to EE2 alone. In the novel tank test, the results surprisingly indicated lower anxiety after both EE2 and citalopram exposure. Significantly more transitions to the upper half of the tank observed in males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram alone compared to control males. Males exposed to EE2 (0.9 ng/L) had shorter latency period to the upper half. Combination exposure resulted in a longer latency and fewer transitions to the upper half compared to both control, EE2- and citalopram-exposed males. Males exposed to the combination spent significantly less time in the upper half than males EE2 or citalopram-exposed males. Females exposed to 1 ng/L EE2 had fewer transitions to the upper half than the control group and females exposed to 0.4 mu g/L citalopram. In the shoaling test, males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram + 0.9 ng/L EE2 showed more transitions away from peers than males exposed to 0.1 mu g/L citalopram alone. In conclusion, low concentrations of EE2, closely above the predicted no effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.1 ng/L, created anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish males. Citalopram showed marginal effects at these low concentrations but in the combination exposure the behavioral effects of EE2 were abolished. This is an initial effort to understand the effects of cocktails of anthropogenic substances contaminating aquatic environments.

AB The synthetic progestin levonorgestrel is commonly utilized in human oral contraceptives. It enters the environment as a component of wastewater treatment plant effluent, and has been measured at low ng/L concentrations in surface waters. It has been shown to activate fish androgen receptors, causing the physical masculinization of females, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreases in fecundity. In the present study, the effects of levonorgestrel exposure on early-stage oogenesis in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was examined. Adult females were exposed to 0, 10, or 100ng/L levonorgestrel for 14 d using a flow-through exposure system. The ovaries from each female were then removed via dissection and weighed for gonadosomatic index (GSI) calculations, and oocytes from one lobe preserved in Serra's fixative. Total numbers of late-stage vitellogenic oocytes exhibiting a germinal vesicle were then quantified. In a second exposure, blood plasma samples were collected from adult females and analyzed for vitellogenin concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Females exposed to both concentrations of levonorgestrel developed male secondary sexual characteristics in a dose-dependent manner, and ovaries contained significantly fewer late stage oocytes. Exposure to 100ng/L of levonorgestrel resulted in decreased GSI and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations. The results suggest that female exposure to levonorgestrel alone may have profound effects on reproduction in progestin-contaminated environments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3299-3304.

AB The application of nano-TiO2 as adsorbent combined with ultrasound for the degradation of N-acetylpara-aminophenol (AAP) from aqueous solution was investigated. The nano-TiO2 was characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflectionFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Experimental results revealed that the adsorption of AAP by nano-TiO2 fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, the equilibrium could be explained by the Freundlich isotherm and the treatment process is exothermic. The optimum removal efficiency of AAP (128.89 mg/g (77.33%)) was achieved at pH 4 when 0.03 g of nano-TiO2 was mixed with 50 mL of 100 mg/L AAP aqueous solution at ambient temperature, 60 min contact time, and a stirring speed of 120 rpm. Ultrasound at 20 kHz and pH 3 was favorable and it resulted in 52.61% and 57.43% removal efficiency with and without the addition of nano-TiO2, respectively. The degradation of AAP by ultrasound followed by nano-TiO2 treatment resulted in approximately 99.50% removal efficiency. This study showed that a sequential ultrasound and nano-TiO2 treatment process could be employed for the removal of AAP or other emerging water and wastewater contaminants.

AB In this study, coagulation process was applied to treat the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater using polymeric ferric sulfate as a coagulant. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) was applied to investigate the fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from pharmaceutical wastewater and the reduction of contaminant and fluorescent variations in the coagulation process. It shows that coagulation was effective to remove contaminants in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater, and the optimum coagulate dosage was 0.5 g/L, where the removal efficiency of total organic matter (TOC), UV254, turbidity and NH4+-N were achieved 44.2%, 43.3%, 87.0% and 10.27%, respectively. Five fluorescence components were identified by EEMs-PARAFAC, including one fulviclike component (C1), one xenobiotic-like component (C2), two humic-like components (C3 and C5) and one protein-like component (C4); DOM of pharmaceutical wastewater was dominated by C3, C4 and C2. Under the optimum coagulation condition, the decreasing order of removal efficiencies was C5 (49.92%), C3 (40.95%), C4 (10.58%), C2 (9.68%) and C1 (5.05%). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed C3, C5 had remarkable correlations with TOC and UV254, suggesting that C3 and C5 may be a good indicator for the reduction of TOC and UV254. PCA indicated that the EEM-PARAFAC could be successfully applied to the evaluation of the coagulation efficiency for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB A comprehensive screening method for 311 organic compounds with a wide range of physicochemical properties (log Pow -2.2-8.53) in water samples was developed by combining solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography- high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Method optimization using 128 pesticides revealed that tandem extraction with styrene-divinylbenzene polymer and activated carbon solid-phase extraction cartridges at pH 7.0 was optimal. The developed screening method was able to extract 190 model compounds with average recovery of 80.8% and average relative standard deviations (RSD) of 13.5% from spiked reagent water at 0.20 mu g L-1, and 87.1% recovery and 10.8% RSD at 0.05 mu g L-1. Spike-recovery testing (0.20 mu g L-1) using real sewage treatment plant effluents resulted in an average recovery and average RSD of 190 model compounds of 77.4 and 13.1%, respectively. The method was applied to the influent and effluent of five sewage treatment plants in Kitakyushu, Japan, with 29 out of 311 analytes being observed at least once. The results showed that this method can screen for a large number of chemicals with a wide range of physicochemical properties quickly and at low operational cost, something that is difficult to achieve using conventional analytical methods. This method will find utility in target screening of hazardous chemicals with a high risk in environmental waters, and for confirming the safety of water after environmental incidents.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals in surface water and groundwater cause concern especially when the water is used in drinking water production. Due to their continuous release or spill-over at waste water treatment plants, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are constantly present in aquatic environment and despite their low concentrations, APIs can still cause effects on the organisms. In the present study, Chemcatcher passive sampling was applied in surface water, surface water intake site, and groundwater observation wells to estimate whether the selected APIs are able to end up in drinking water supply through an artificial groundwater recharge system. The API concentrations measured in conventional wastewater, surface water, and groundwater grab samples were assessed with the results obtained with passive samplers. Out of the 25 APIs studied with passive sampling, four were observed in groundwater and 21 in surface water. This suggests that many anthropogenic APIs released to waste water proceed downstream and can be detectable in groundwater recharge. Chemcatcher passive samplers have previously been used in monitoring several harmful chemicals in surface and wastewaters, but the path of chemicals to groundwater has not been studied. This study provides novel information on the suitability of the Chemcatcher passive samplers for detecting APIs in groundwater wells.

AB Locally weighted partial least square (LW-PLS) model has been commonly used to develop adaptive soft sensors and process monitoring for numerous industries which include pharmaceutical, petrochemical, semiconductor, wastewater treatment system and biochemical. The advantages of LW-PLS model are its ability to deal with a large number of input variables, collinearity among the variables and outliers. Nevertheless, since most industrial processes are highly nonlinear, a traditional LW-PLS which is based on a linear model becomes incapable of handling nonlinear processes. Hence, an improved LW-PLS model is required to enhance the adaptive soft sensors in dealing with data nonlinearity. In this work, Kernel function which has nonlinear features was incorporated into LW-PLS model and this proposed model is named locally weighted kernel partial least square (LW-KPLS). Comparisons between LW-PLS and LW-KPLS models in terms of predictive performance and their computational loads were carried out by evaluating both models using data generated from a simulated plant. From the results, it is apparent that in terms of predictive performance LW-KPLS is superior compared to LW-PLS. However, it is found that computational load of LW-KPLS is higher than LW-PLS. After adapting ensemble method with LW-KPLS, computational loads of both models were found to be comparable. These indicate that LW-KPLS performs better than LW-PLS in nonlinear process applications. In addition, evaluation on localization parameter in both LW-PLS and LW-KPLS is also carried out.

AB Municipal wastewater contains multi-component mixtures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This could shape microbial communities in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and the effluent-receiving ecosystems. In this paper we assess the risk of antimicrobial effects in STPs and the aquatic environment for a mixture of 18 APIs that was previously detected in the effluent of a European municipal STP. Effects on microbial consortia (collected from a separate STP) were determined using respirometry, enumeration of culturable microorganisms and community-level physiological profiling. The mixture toxicity against selected bacteria was assessed using assays with Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio fischeri. Additional data on the toxicity to environmental bacteria were compiled from literature in order to assess the individual and expected joint bacterial toxicity of the pharmaceuticals in the mixture. The reported effluent concentration of the mixture was 15.4 nmol/l and the lowest experimentally obtained effect concentrations (EC10) were 242 nmol/l for microbial consortia in STPs, 225 nmol/l for P. putida and 73 nmol/l for V. fischeri. The lowest published effect concentrations (EC50) of the individual antibiotics in the mixture range between 15 and 150 nmol/l, whereas 0.9-190 mu mol/l was the range of bacterial EC50, values found for the non-antibiotic mixture components. Pharmaceutical cocktails could shape microbial communities at concentrations relevant to STPs and the effluent receiving aquatic environment. The risk of antimicrobial mixture effects was completely dominated by the presence of antibiotics, whereas other pharmaceutical classes contributed only negligibly to the mixture toxicity. The joint bacterial toxicity can be accurately predicted from the individual toxicity of the mixture components, provided that standardized data on representative bacterial strains becomes available for all relevant compounds. These findings argue for a more sophisticated bacterial toxicity assessment of environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals, especially for those with a mode of action that is known to specifically affect prokaryotic microorganisms.

AB As a porous-adsorbent material, activated carbon was used to remove the environmental pollution in the pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. In the present paper, granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) were subjected as an adsorbent to reduce the concentration of estradiol valerate (EV) and progesterone (PRO) hormones. The effects of adsorbent amount, initial pH of solution, contact time, initial concentration of pollutant and temperature were studied. Among the pseudo-first-order- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, the latter fit accurately the experimental data. The highest level of adsorption percentage of the contaminants occurs within the first 480 min. The maximum adsorption capacity and thermodynamic parameters were shown that GAC and PAC can be selected as appropriate and effective pharmaceutical wastewater treatment techniques. In addition, some additional experimental characterizations such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to detect the possible structural changes due to the adsorption of EV and PRO onto the GAC and PAC, which show these hormones have been successfully added onto the adsorbent surface.

AB A promising green strategy for the fabrication of fully biobased chitosan adsorbents for wastewater purification is presented. Nanographene oxide (nGO)-type carbon dots were derived from chitosan (nGOCS) or from cellulose (nGOCL) through a two-step process including microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization and oxidation. Finally, nGO were evaluated as biobased property enhancers in chitosan hydrogel adsorbents. Macroporous chitosan hydrogels were synthesized by cross-linking with genipin, and the incorporation of nGO into these hydrogels was shown to facilitate the cross-linking reaction leading to more robust 3D cross-linked networks. This was evidenced by the increased storage modulus and by the swelling ratio that decreased from 5.7 for pristine chitosan hydrogel to 2.6 for hydrogel with 5 mg/mL nGOCS and 3.3 for hydrogel with 5 mg/mL nGOCL. As a further proof of the concept the hydrogels were shown to be effective adsorbent for the common anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium (DCF). Here, the addition of nGO promoted the DCF adsorption process leading to 100% removal of DCF after only 5 h. The synergistic effect of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking could explain the high adsorption of DCF on the hydrogels. The developed biobased CS/nGO hydrogels are thus promising adsorbents with great potential for purification of trace pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Antibiotics are added to agricultural fields worldwide through wastewater irrigation or manure application, resulting in antibiotic contamination and elevated environmental risks to terrestrial environments and humans. Most studies focused on antibiotic detection in different matrices or were conducted in a hydroponic environment. Little is known about the transfer of antibiotics from antibiotic contaminated irrigation wastewater and animal manure to agricultural soil and edible crops. In this study, we evaluated the transfer of five different antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethazine, norfloxacin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol) to different crops under two levels of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater irrigation and animal manure fertilization. The final distribution of tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR) and chloramphenicol (CAP) in the crop tissues under these four treatments were as follows: fruit > leaf/shoot > root, while an opposite order was found for sulfamethazine (SMZ) and erythromycin (ERY): root > leaf/shoot > fruit. The growth of crops could accelerate the dissipation of antibiotics by absorption from contaminated soil. A higher accumulation of antibiotics was observed in crop tissues under the wastewater treatment than under manure treatment, which was due to the continual irrigation that increased adsorption in soil and uptake by crops. The translocation of antibiotics in crops mainly depended on their physicochemical properties (e.g. log K-ow), crop species, and the concentrations of antibiotics applied to the soil. The levels of antibiotics ingested through the consumption of edible crops under the different treatments were much lower than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the effects of carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen on the behavior of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system treating urban wastewater that was doped continuously with three different concentrations of this mix of pharmaceuticals under a hydraulic retention time of 6h.
   RESULTS: The degradation capacity of these chemicals and the heterotrophic kinetics regarding the organic matter removal were evaluated in the control and doping cycles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the MLSS decreased drastically, these differences were not observed in the organic matter removal as the increase of cell growth rate cancelled out the increase in cell decay rate due to the chemical stress caused by the addition of pharmaceuticals, as shown by the increased organic matter degradation rate from 86.27 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) in the control cycle to values within the limits 183.97 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) and 192.88 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) in doping cycles. The degradation rates were 0.0154, 0.0152 and 0.0160 mu gS/((mu gS(in)/L)*h*mgMLSS) for carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen, respectively, involving removal yields higher than 71.9, 88.7 and 94.7% for carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen, respectively, at the three different concentrations tested. Therefore, MBR technology can be used as a reliable process to significantly reduce this mix of pharmaceuticals without reducing its organic matter removal capacity.

AB With increasing antibiotic use, more antibiotics are being discharged into wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to effectively remove emerging pollutants. A fate model based on a Monte Carlo simulation was established by combining secondary and tertiary treatment processes to investigate the fate of six types of antibiotics during various treatment processes. The results showed that the distribution of the antibiotic concentrations in wastewater influent was strongly dependent on antibiotic type. During the secondary and tertiary wastewater processes, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed higher average removals (71.5 +/- 3.8% and 78.4 +/- 6.9%) during secondary treatment than the other four types of antibiotics. The total antibiotic removal efficiencies depended mainly on the tertiary process, with average removals of 97.9% by reverse osmosis, 93.0% by ozone oxidation, and 84.2% by powder activated carbon adsorption when combined with conventional sludge-based wastewater treatment. Reverse osmosis showed high removal efficiencies for all six antibiotics, with no particular selectivity. Ozone treatment showed significant negative correlations between antibiotics removal and molecular weight (r: -0.965, p = 0.002), Log octanol-water partition coefficient (r: -0.921, p = 0.009), and acid dissociation constant (r: -0.847, p = 0.033). After the reverse osmosis-based combination treatment, all antibiotics had risk quotients <1, indicated that reverse osmosis could significantly reduce the toxicity of antibiotics to the environment. After ozone- and powder activated carbon-based combination treatments, the remaining erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in effluent still had risk quotients >1. These results can be used to support the optimization of combined treatment of wastewater and risk assessments of antibiotics in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   OUTPUTS
AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove mainly the organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and suspended solids from wastewater but are not capable of removing chemicals of human origin, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The presence of PPCPs in wastewater has environmental effects on the water bodies receiving the WWTP effluents and renders the effluent as unsuitable as a nonconventional water source. Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using the output distance function to measure the environmental benefits of removing five PPCPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and trimethoprim) from WWTP effluents discharged to three different ecosystems (wetland, river and sea). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen show the highest shadow prices of the sample for wetland areas. Their values are 128.2 and 11.0 (sic)/mg respectively. These results represent a proxy in monetary terms of the environmental benefit achieved from avoiding the discharge of these PPCPs in wetlands. These results suggest which PPCPs are urgent to remove from wastewater and which ecosystems are most vulnerable to their presence. The findings of this study will be useful for the plant managers in order to make decisions about prioritization in the removal of different pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage sludge/biosolids are by-wastes of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. As sources of nutrients (C, N, P) they are widely used in intensive farming where large supplementation of organic matter to maintain fertility and enhance crop yields is needed. However, according to the report of European Commission published in 2010, only 39% of produced sewage sludge is recycled into agriculture in the European Union. This situation occurs mainly due to the fact, that the sewage sludge may contain a dangerous volume of different contaminants. For over decades, a great deal of attention has been focused on total concentration of few heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The Sewage Sludge Directive (86/278/EEC) regulates the allowable limits of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg and pathogens and allows for recovery of sludge on land under defined sanitary and environmentally sound conditions. In this paper, a review on quality of sewage sludge based on the publications after 2010 has been presented. Nowadays there are several papers focusing on new serious threats to human health and ecosystem occurring in sewage sludge-both chemicals (such as toxic trace elements-Se, Ag, Ti; nanoparticles; polyaromatic hydrocarbons; polychlorinated biphenyl; per fluorinated surfactants, polycyclic musks, siloxanes, pesticides, phenols, sweeteners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, benzotriazoles) and biological traits (Legionella, Yersinia, Escherichia coli 0157:H7).

AB Emergence and spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) present a major threat to public health. In this study, we characterized -lactam-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from six wastewater samples obtained from two pharmaceutical industries located in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. Bacteria were isolated by using MacConkey agar; species identification and antibacterial susceptibility testing were performed by Vitek 2. Etest was used for ESBL phenotype confirmation. The presence of -lactamase genes was investigated by PCR and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was done by XbaI-macrorestriction and subsequent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as well as multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Thirty-five bacterial species were isolated from the six samples; among them, we identified seven K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to -lactams and co-resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and folate pathway inhibitors. The ESBL phenotype was confirmed in six K. pneumoniae isolates that harbored ESBL genes bla(CTX-M-15) (n=5), bla(SHV-2) (n=1), and bla(SHV-12) (n=1). PFGE and MLST analysis revealed five clones belonging to four sequence types (ST11, ST15, ST37, ST101), and clone K. pneumoniae-ST101 was present in the wastewater samples from two different pharmaceutical industries. Additionally performed conjugation assays confirmed the location of -lactamase genes on conjugative plasmids. This is the first confirmation of K. pneumoniae isolates producing CTX-M-15-ESBL from pharmaceutical wastewaters in Nigeria. The co-resistance observed might be a reflection of the different drugs produced by these industries. Continuous surveillance of the environmental reservoirs of multidrug-resistant bacteria is necessary to prevent their further spread.

AB The synergistic impact of salts and organic matter on adsorption of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by three types of biochar and an activated carbon was investigated using reclaimed water reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate and synthetic solutions spiked with target organic compounds and non-target water constituents (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, alkalinity, humic acid (HA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Kinetic modeling was used to better understand the adsorption process between the carbon adsorbents and pharmaceuticals and to elucidate the impact of water chemistry on pharmaceuticals adsorption. The adsorption capacity of pharmaceuticals by biochar was affected by their physicochemical properties including ash content, specific surface area, charge, pore volume, as well as hydrophobicity, pi-energy, and speciation of pharmaceuticals. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals in concentrate was pH-dependent, the kinetic rate constant increased with deceasing pH due to the electrical interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and adsorbents. High salinity and electrolyte ions in RO concentrate improved adsorption, whereas the presence of carbonate species, HA, and BSA hindered the removal of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. This study revealed the correlation of concentrate water quality on adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biochar and activated carbon. Biochar provides a promising alternative to activated carbon for removal of organic contaminants of emerging concerns in various wastewater and concentrate streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The increased use of beauty and other daily use products, in particular those containing UV filters (UV-Fs) and benzotriazoles, results in their introduction in significant amounts into the aquatic environment. In this study, we aim to assess the occurrence and impact of UV-Fs and benzotriazoles in aquatic ecosystems in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. River water samples from the Llobregat and Besos Rivers were analysed together with sediment, suspended particulate matter, and wastewater samples from 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along their basins. The analysis of 6 UV-Fs and 2 benzotriazoles in water samples was performed using an automatized on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) method. The analysis of the target compounds in the suspended solids and in the sediments was performed by HPLC-MS/MS. The analysis of the water samples showed the ubiquitous presence of UV-Fs. Benzotriazole (BZT; partition coefficient octanol-water Log K-ow = 1.23) and methylbenzotriazole (MeBZT; Log K-ow = 1.89) had the highest levels in both river water and wastewater. Removal rates in the selected WWTPs were highly variable (4-100%). Concentrations of lipophilic UV-Fs (Log K-ow 4.95-7.53) in suspended particulate matter from wastewaters were high (up to 1,031,868.2 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw)), whereas in sediment the concentrations were always below 300 ng g(-1) dw. The risk assessment expressed in terms of hazard quotients (HQs) revealed that most UV-Fs were not likely to produce adverse ecotoxicological effects against the living organisms assayed in river waters and influent wastewaters at the concentrations observed.

AB One of the main risks associated with effluents from both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and on-site sewage treatment facilities (OSSFs) is the release of micropollutants (MPs) in receiving water bodies. However, the impact of MPs present in the effluents of OSSFs in the aquatic environment has not been studied so far. The current study evaluates the impact of the effluents of OSSFs and small-to-large scale WWTPs on natural waters. The discharge of 74 MPs was assessed including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The sampling was carried out within a Swedish catchment and included three sites that are exclusively affected by OSSFs and other sites that are mainly affected by WWTPs or a mixture of sources (7 sites, 28 samples). Results show that although OSSFs serve a much smaller total number of people, the MPs emitted from OSSFs reached the aquatic environment in significant quantities (concentrations of >150 ng L-1 of Sigma MPs). The composition profiles for sites affected by WWTPs were similar and were dominated by sucralose (27% of the Sigma MPs), caffeine (27% of the Sigma MPs), lamotrigine (10% of the Sigma MPs), desvenlafaxine (5% of the Sigma MPs), and diclofenac (4% of the Sigma MPs). In contrast, the sites affected by OSSFs showed high variability, exhibiting a different profile from those affected by WWTPs and also from each other, demonstrating that OSSFs are not homogeneous sources of MPs. Some specific compounds, such as diethyltoluamide (DEET) and caffeine, were proportionally much more important at sites affected by OSSFs than at sites affected by WWTPs (representing a much higher percentage of the Sigma MPs in the OSSFs). In contrast, PFASs did not show high concentration variation among the different sampling sites and the composition profiles were relatively similar, indicating that these substances follow different routes of entry into the aquatic environment.

AB Low river discharges of the rivers Rhine and Meuse are expected to occur more often and more prolonged in a changing climate. During these dry periods the dilution of point sources such as sewage effluents is reduced leading to a decline in chemical water quality. This study projects chemical water quality of the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the year 2050, based on projections of chemical emissions and two climate scenarios: moderate and fast climate change. It focuses on specific compounds known to be relevant to drinking water production, i.e. four pharmaceuticals, a herbicide and its metabolite and an artificial sweetener. Hydrological variability, climate change, and increased emission show a significant influence on the water quality in the Rhine and Meuse. The combined effect of changing future emissions of these compounds and reduced dilution due to climate change has leaded to increasing ( peak) concentrations in the river water by a factor of two to four. Current water treatment efficiencies in the Netherlands are not sufficient to reduce these projected concentrations in drinking water produced from surface water below precautionary water target values. If future emissions are not sufficiently reduced or treatment efficiencies are not improved, these compounds will increasingly be found in drinking water, albeit at levels which pose no threat to human health.

AB The presence and fate of pharmaceutical residues in environmental samples are of great interest. There is a vast number of studies published regarding their input, presence, effects and risks in ecosystems. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the primary source of input of these contaminants in the environment is from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). It is therefore essential to evaluate the efficiency of commonly used treatments and the necessity of applying novel purification processes in order to eliminate or reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals from wastewater or from the effluent of WWTPs. The aim of this work was to quantify twenty-three pharmaceutical compounds in the aqueous phase at different stages of a conventional and a natural WWTP situated in Gran Canaria (Spain). The results indicate concentration levels in the range of 0.004 +/- 0.001 to 59.2 +/- 11.7 mu g L-1 and 0.018 +/- 0.001 to 148 +/- 14.7 mu g L-1 from conventional and natural WWTPs, respectively. Better efficiency was, however, offered by the conventional WWTP with a removal median of 99.7%. In addition, the impact on different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish) was assessed in terms of risk quotients. The results reveal a possible highly harmful effect towards organisms by gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and, ofloxacin. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study provided the first comprehensive data on the occurrence and removal of twenty-five target emerging contaminants (ECs) in a full-scale water reclamation plant (WRP) in the Southeast Asian region. Nineteen out of the twenty-five ECs were ubiquitously detected in raw influent samples. Concentrations of the detected ECs in raw influent samples ranged substantially from 443 to 124,966 ng/L, depending upon the compound and sampling date. The elimination of ECs in full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems at a local WRP was evaluated and compared. Several ECs, such as acetaminophen, atenolol, fenoprofen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and oxybenzone, exhibited excellent removal efficiencies (>90%) in biological wastewater treatment processes, while some of the investigated compounds (carbamazepine, crotamiton, diclofenac, and iopamidol) appeared to be persistent in the both CAS and MBR systems. Field-based monitoring results showed that MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of most target ECs. The relationship between molecular characteristics of ECs (Le. physicochemical properties and structural features) and their removal efficiencies during biological wastewater treatment was also elucidated. Excellent removal efficiencies (>90%) were often noted for ECs with the sole presence of electron donating groups (i.e. phenolic [-OH], amine [-NH2], methoxy [-O-CH3], phenoxy [-O-C6H5], or alkyl groups). Conversely, ECs with the absence of electron donating groups or the predominance of strong electron withdrawing groups (e.g. halogenated, carbonyl, carboxyl, and sulfonamide) tended to show poor removal efficiencies (<30%) in biological wastewater treatment processes.

AB Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the following study, we came up with and validated a prompt, sensitive and precise method for the simultaneous determination of 56 antimicrobial drugs (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, macrolides and quinolones) using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). This method was implemented with success to determine antibiotics in samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants and five coasts in Tunisia. Results showed the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics that ranged from 0.1 to 646 ng mL(-1), which can induce many negative impacts on health and the environment. For this reason, we have opted to evaluate toxicity of wastewater samples using a battery of biotests. In fact, genotoxicity was assessed using three tests: Vitotox, comet and micronucleus assays. The input and output of wastewater treatment plants induced a strongly genotoxic effect on the Salmonella typhimurium TA104 prokaryotic Vitotox assay. This result was confirmed using the comet and the micronucleus assays performed on the human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The genotoxic power of the tested wastewater treatment plants' samples could be attributed to the presence of the higher quantities of antibiotics that are detected in these samples and to the antibiotic and organic compound cocktails.

AB This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the fate of fluoroquinolone antibacterial ofloxacin (OFX) which is the free available chlorine (FAC) in order to determine its effect during water chlorination process. The Direct reactions of FAC with OFX were quite rapid. A half-life of 7.7 s was measured under pseudo-first order conditions in the presence of an excess of total chlorine ([FAC](0) = 13 mu M and [OFX](0) = 0.55 mu M at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C in buffered reagent water. Free chlorine reactions rates were of first-order type in both substrate and oxidant with specific second-order rate constants of 6.8 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1). No induced back reactions or other interference by using thiosulfate to stop the chlorination reaction was shown. The seven products of the reaction were determined by using the LC/MS/MS analysis. Structures were investigated due to the explication of transitions obtained at different CID energies by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Pathways of the formations of these by-products were presented in this study and pathways of the fragmentations of pseudo molecular ions of the structures proposed were presented in supplementary files.

AB Tetracycline (TET) is commonly used to treat bacterial diseases in humans and chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), is largely excreted, and is found at elevated concentrations in treated sewage sludge (bio-solids) and poultry litter (excrement plus bedding materials). Routine application of these nutrient-and carbon-enriched materials to soils improves fertility and other characteristics, but the presence of antibiotics (and other pharmaceuticals) in amendments raises questions about potential adverse effects on biota and development of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Hazard risks are largely dictated by sorption-desorption and diffusion behavior in amendments, so these processes were evaluated from sorption-desorption equilibrium isotherm and diffusion cell experiments with four types amendments (biosolids, poultry manure, wood chip litter, and rice hull litter) at three temperatures (8 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C). Linear sorption-desorption equilibrium distribution constants (Kd) in native amendments ranged between 124-2418 L kg(-1). TET sorption was significantly increased after treatment with alum, and there was a strong exponential relationship between Kd and the concentration of bound Al3+ in amendments (R-2 = 0.94), which indicated that amendments contained functional groups capable of chelating Al3+ and forming metal bridges with TET. Effective diffusion coefficients of TET in amendments ranged between 0.1 and 5.2 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), which were positively related to temperature and inversely related to Kd by a multiple regression model (R-2 = 0.86). Treatment of organic amendments with alum greatly increased Kd, would decrease D-s, and so would greatly reduce hazard risks of applying these organic amendments with this antibiotic to soils.

AB A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems. The quantitative models of contaminant removal described in this study can be used to design natural treatment systems that balance the needs for local water quality requirements, available land and site-specific requirements.

AB The biomass growth, pharmaceutical removal and light conversion efficiency of Chlorella sorokiniana under the presence of paracetamol (PC) and salicylic acid (SaC) were assessed and compared at two different concentrations of these pharmaceuticals (I: 25 mg l(-1), II: 250 mg l(-1)). Microalgae were resistant to these concentrations and, moreover, their growth was significantly stimulated (p <= 0.05) under these drugs (biomass concentration increased above 33% PCI, 35% SaCI, 13% PCII and 45% SaCII, as compared with the respective positive controls). At the steady state of the semicontinuous culture, C sorokiniana showed removal efficiencies above 41% and 69% for PCI and PCII, respectively; and above 93% and 98% for SaCI and SaCII, respectively. Under an irradiance of 370 mu E m(-2) s(-1), higher quantum yields were reached by microalgae under the presence of drugs, either at dose I or II, than by the respective positive controls. These results point to C. sorokiniana as a robust strain for the bioremediation of paracetamol and salicylic acid concentrated wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, it is estimated that over 1 billion people are short of adequate portable water and this is expected to increase to 2.5 billion in the year 2025. Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are now accepted as important tools to extend the availability of water by facilitating the reuse of wastewaters. Sludge Retention Time (SRT) and liquid flux rate are the two most important parameters for controlling the MBR process. In this study, the removal of selected endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs), diltiazem, progesterone, estrone (E-1), carbamazepine (Cbz) and acetaminophen (Acet), by one full scale (VRM) and one pilot scale (clear-box) MBR plants was investigated. During the study, sludge age was set at 10 days and the sludge concentration was fixed at about 5.0 g/L. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) got higher with either increasing flux or sludge concentration in the membrane chamber. Therefore, changing the flux from 13 to 30 L/m(2)-h in both plants caused enhancement in TMP from -25 to -300 mbar in the clear box and from 160 to over 350 in the full scale MBRs. It was understood that flux had very little effect on the removal of EDCs at very low concentrations. Moreover, diltiazem was completely removed in the full scale whereas no removal was achieved in the pilot scale. Estrone and progesterone were completely removed by biodegradation in both plants. Acetaminophen was completely removed in the full scale plant whereas over 95% removal was achieved in the pilot scale MBR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-potable reuse of treated wastewater is becoming widespread as means to address growing water scarcity. Removal of micropollutants (MPs) from such water often requires advanced oxidation processes using center dot OH radicals. center dot OH can be generated in-situ via water photolysis under vacuum-UV (lambda < 200 nm) irradiation.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of unmasking V-UV radiation from low pressure Hg lamps (emitting at 185 and 254 nm), commonly used in decentralized treatment systems, for enhancing MPs removal efficiency. Triclosan, a biocide of limited biodegradability, served as a model compound for MPs that are not very biodegradable. Its degradation kinetics and identification of intermediate products were investigated under 254 nm and under combined 254/185 nm irradiation both in dry thin films and in aqueous solutions. In the latter, degradation was faster under combined 254/185 nm radiation, although the 185 nm radiation accounted for only 4% of the total UV light intensity. In contrast, triclosan photodegradation in dry film did not show significant differences between these irradiation wavelengths, suggesting that the enhanced degradation of dissolved triclosan under combined radiation is mainly due to oxidation by center dot OH formed via water photolysis under V-UV. This conclusion was supported by slower TCS degradation in aqueous solution when methanol was added as center dot OH scavenger. Under both irradiation types (254, 254/185 nm) three transformation products (TPs) were identified: 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 5-chloro-2-(4- or 2-chlorophenoxy) phenol, and 2-hydroxy-8-chlorodibenzodioxin. In-silico QSAR toxicity assessment predicted potential toxicity and moderate-to-low biodegradability of these TPs. Removal of these TPs was faster under 254/185 nm irradiation.
   Considering the low cost, simple operation (i.e. no chemicals addition) and small size of such low-pressure mercury lamps, this is a promising direction. Further investigation of the process in flow-through reactors and real wastewater/greywater effluent is needed for its future implementation in small on-site systems for post-treatment of persistent pollutants.

AB The presence of micropollutants in the environment and their toxic impacts on the aquatic environment have raised concern about their inefficient removal in wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the fate of micropollutants of four different classes was simulated in a conventional activated sludge plant using a bioreactor micropollutant fate model coupled to a settler model. The latter was based on the Burger-Diehl model extended for the first time to include micropollutant fate processes. Calibration of model parameters was completed by matching modelling results with full-scale measurements (i.e. including aqueous and particulate phase concentrations of micropollutants) obtained from a 4-day sampling campaign. Modelling results showed that further biodegradation takes place in the sludge blanket of the settler for the highly biodegradable caffeine, underlining the need for a reactive settler model. The adopted Monte Carlo based calibration approach also provided an overview of the model's global sensitivity to the parameters. This analysis showed that for each micropollutant and according to the dominant fate process, a different set of one or more parameters had a significant impact on the model fit, justifying the selection of parameter subsets for model calibration. A dynamic local sensitivity analysis was also performed with the calibrated parameters. This analysis supported the conclusions from the global sensitivity and provided guidance for future sampling campaigns. This study expands the understanding of micropollutant fate models when applied to different micropollutants, in terms of global and local sensitivity to model parameters, as well as the identifiability of the parameters.

AB Unplanned indirect (de facto) wastewater reuse occurs when wastewater is discharged into surface waters upstream of potable drinking water treatment plant intakes. This paper aims to predict percentages and trends of de facto reuse throughout the Yangtze River watershed in order to understand the relative contribution of wastewater discharges into the river and its tributaries towards averting water scarcity concerns. The Yangtze River is the third longest in the world and supports more than 1/15 of the world's population, yet the importance of wastewater on the river remains ill-defined. Municipal wastewater produced in the Yangtze River Basin increased by 41% between 1998 and 2014, from 2580 m(3)/s to 3646 m(3)/s. Under low flow conditions in the Yangtze River near Shanghai, treated wastewater contributions to river flows increased from 8% in 1998 to 14% in 2014. The highest levels of de facto reuse appeared along a major tributary (Han River) of the Yangtze River, where de facto reuse can exceed 20%. While this initial analysis of de facto reuse used water supply and wastewater data from 110 cities in the basin and 11 gauging stations with >50 years of historic streamflow data, the outcome was limited by the lack of gauging stations at more locations (i.e., data had to be predicted using digital elevation mapping) and lack of precise geospatial location of drinking water intakes or wastewater discharges. This limited the predictive capabilityof the model relative to larger datasets available in other countries (e.g., USA). This assessment is the first analysis of de facto wastewater reuse in the Yangtze River Basin. It will help identify sections of the river at higher risk for wastewater-related pollutants due to presence of and reliance on wastewater discharge that could be the focus of field studies and model predictions of higher spatial and temporal resolution.

AB Rivers in urban areas have been associated with water quality problems because of the practice of discharging untreated domestic and industrial waste into the water bodies. However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

AB Chemical analysis of raw wastewater in order to assess the presence of biological markers entering a wastewater treatment, plant can provide objective information about the health and lifestyle of the population connected to the sewer system. This work was performed in a tropical country of Central America, Costa Rica, with the aim of extending this knowledge to new world regions. This work is the first to report wastewater-based epidemiological data on the use of illicit drugs in this region of the world. Composite wastewater samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment facilities and surface water samples from surrounding areas were collected applying the best practice protocol and analysed to investigate the occurrence and fate of selected illicit drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Results showed the presence of chemical indicators of the classic drugs cocaine and cannabis at high concentration levels, besides the moderate presence of the opiates codeine and morphine. Neither the worldwide commonly used psychoactive substances of abuse such as synthetic phenethylamines, nor pharmaceuticals from the family of benzodiazepines were detected, demonstrating the spatial differences in drug use among different world regions. In addition, effluent wastewater samples were analysed and compared to influent concentrations in order to evaluate the decrease in concentration of the targeted analytes through two treatment technologies. As a final step, a wide-scope qualitative screening, including hundreds of suspect compounds, was applied in order to have a better knowledge on the presence of pharmaceuticals in waters and to assess the potential impact of the treated wastewater into the receiving aquatic ecosystems.

AB We quantified pesticide contamination and its ecological impact up- and downstream of seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in rural and suburban areas of central Germany. During two sampling campaigns, time-weighted average pesticide concentrations (c-(TWA)) were obtained using Chemcatche (R) passive samplers; pesticide peak concentrations were quantified with event-driven samplers. At downstream sites, receiving waters were additionally grab sampled for five selected pharmaceuticals. Ecological effects on macroinvertebrate structure and ecosystem function were assessed using the biological indicator system SPEAR(pesticides) (SPEcies At Risk) and leaf litter breakdown rates, respectively. WWTP effluents substantially increased insecticide and fungicide concentrations in receiving waters; in many cases, treated wastewater was the exclusive source for the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid in the investigated streams. During the ten weeks of the investigation, five out of the seven WWTPs increased in-stream pesticide toxicity by a factor of three. As a consequence, at downstream sites, SPEAR values and leaf litter degradation rates were reduced by 40% and 53%, respectively. The reduced leaf litter breakdown was related to changes in the macroinvertebrate communities described by SPEARpesticides and not to altered microbial activity. Neonicotinoids showed the highest ecological relevance for the composition of invertebrate communities, occasionally exceeding the Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RACs). In general, considerable ecological effects of insecticides were observed above and below regulatory thresholds. Fungicides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals contributed only marginally to acute toxicity. We conclude that pesticide retention of WWTPs needs to be improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The continuous release of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is of concern due to their potential toxicological effects on living organisms, even at low concentrations. The insufficient removal of bioactive contaminants such as pharmaceuticals by conventional wastewater treatment processes has led scientists to investigate and develop efficient technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to address the issue. The objective of the present work was to study the applicability of thermally prepared Sb-doped Sn-80%-W-20%-oxide thin film coated electrodes for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of a recalcitrant pharmaceutical compound, carbamazepine (CBZ). The efficiency of photolytic and photocatalytic processes for removal of CBZ were also evaluated for comparison. The formation of transformation products was investigated and the results showed lower levels of transformation products in the water treated by the photoelectrocatalytic method compared to the photolytic and photocatalytic methods, by the end of 60-min treatment. This suggests a potentially lower overall toxicity of the final solution treated by the photoelectrocatalytic method. An estimation of the energy consumption to reach an order of magnitude reduction in the concentration of CBZ for each type of process indicated a lower energy requirement for the photoelectrocatalytic method, with the highest energy efficiency observed at the applied current density of 6 mA/cm(2).

AB The global contamination of water resources with inorganic and organic micropollutants, such as metals and pharmaceuticals, poses a critical threat to the environment and human health. Herein, we report on a bio-derived chitosan-EDTA-beta-cyclodextrin (CS-ED-CD) trifunctional adsorbent fabricated via a facile and green one-pot synthesis method using EDTA as a cross-linker, for the adsorption of toxic metals and organic micropollutants from wastewater. In this system, chitosan chain is considered as the backbone, and the immobilized cyclodextrin cavities capture the organic compounds via host-guest inclusion complexation, while EDTA-groups complex metals. The thoroughly characterized CS-ED-CD was employed for batch adsorption experiments. The adsorbent displayed a monolayer adsorption capacity of 0.803, 1.258 mmol g(-1) for Pb(II) and Cd(II) respectively, while a heterogeneous sorption capacity of 0.177, 0.142, 0.203, 0.149 mmol g(-1) for bisphenol-S, ciprofloxacin, procaine, and imipramine, respectively. The adsorption mechanism was verified by FT-IR and elemental mapping. Importantly, the adsorbent perform is effective in the simultaneous removal of metals and organic pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations. All these findings demonstrate the promise of CS-ED-CD for practical applications in the treatment of micropollutants. This work adds a new insight to design and preparation of efficient trifunctional adsorbents from sustainable materials for water purification.

AB Six pilot-scale subsurface flow treatment wetlands loaded with primary treated municipal wastewater were monitored over one year for classical wastewater parameters and a set of emerging organic compounds (ECOs) serving as process indicators for biodegradation: caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame, and carbamazepine. The wetland technologies investigated included conventional horizontal flow, unsaturated vertical flow (single and two-stage), horizontal flow with aeration, vertical flow with aeration, and reciprocating. Treatment efficiency for classical wastewater parameters and EOCs generally increased with increasing design complexity and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The two aerated wetlands and the two-stage vertical flow system showed the highest EOC removal, and the best performance in warm season and most robust performance in the cold season. These three systems performed better than the adjacent conventional WWTP with respect to EOC removal. Acesulfame was observed to be removed (>90%) by intensified wetland systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter during the warm season. Elevated temperature and high oxygen content (aerobic conditions) proved beneficial for EOC removal. For EOCs of moderate to low biodegradability, the co-occurrence of aerobic conditions and low content of readily available carbon appears essential for efficient removal. Such conditions occurred in the aerated systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the marine environment is of great concern. This study was done to determine the emergence of eight pharmaceuticals and eleven ultraviolet filters (UV-Filters) in 5 rivers/streams discharging into the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, a focus was put on the influence of wastewater treatment plant as indirect source and the occurrence of the PPCPs in close beach proximity. Two pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, salicylic acid) and two UV-filters (2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, octocrylene) were detected in all analyzed water samples, with concentration ranging from 0.6ng/L to 836.3 ng/L. In all rivers the PPCP concentration decreases towards the Baltic Sea. Sulfamethoxazole was detected at comparable concentration along the coast, which leads to the assumption of stable concentration in beach proximity. Along the coast UV-filters appeared in varying concentrations, leading to the conclusion that the direct input into the marine environment plays a bigger role than the indirect input.

TI Fate of organic microcontaminants in wastewater treatment and river

AB The growing awareness of the relevance of organic microcontaminants on the environment has led to a growing number of studies on attenuation of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rivers. However, the effects of the sampling strategies (frequency and duration of composite samples) on the attenuation estimates are largely unknown. Our goal was to assess how frequency and duration of composite samples influence uncertainty of the attenuation estimates in WWTPs and rivers. Furthermore, we also assessed how compound consumption rate and degradability influence uncertainty. The assessment was conducted through simulating the integrated wastewater system of Puigcerda (NE Iberian Peninsula) using a sewer pattern generator and a coupled model of WWTP and river. Results showed that the sampling strategy is especially critical at the influent of WWTP, particularly when the number of toilet flushes containing the compound of interest is small (<= 100 toilet flushes with compound day(-1)), and less critical at the effluent of the WWTP and in the river due to the mixing effects of the WWTP. For example, at the WWTP, when evaluating a compound that is present in 50 pulses d(-1) using a sampling frequency of 15-min to collect a 24-h composite sample, the attenuation uncertainty can range from 94% (0% degradability) to 9% (90% degradability). The estimation of attenuation in rivers is less critical than in WWTPs, as the attenuation uncertainty was lower than 10% for all evaluated scenarios. Interestingly, the errors in the estimates of attenuation are usually lower than those of loads for most sampling strategies and compound characteristics (e.g. consumption and degradability), although the opposite occurs for compounds with low consumption and inappropriate sampling strategies at the WWTP. Hence, when designing a sampling campaign, one should consider the influence of compounds' consumption and degradability as well as the desired level of accuracy in attenuation estimations.

AB Limited knowledge of optimal microbial community composition for PPCP biotreatment, and of the microbial phylotypes that drive biotransformation within mixed microbial communities, has hindered the rational design and operation of effective and reliable biological PPCP treatment technologies. Herein, bacterial community composition was investigated as an isolated variable within batch biofilm reactors via comparison of PPCP removals for three distinct inocula. Inocula pre-acclimated to model PPCPs were derived from activated sludge (AS), ditch sediment historically-impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluent (Sd), and material from laboratory-scale soil aquifer treatment (SAT) columns. PPCP removals were found to be substantially higher for AS- and Sd-derived inocula compared to the SAT-derived inocula despite comparable biomass. Removal patterns differed among the 6 model compounds examined (diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and triclosan) indicating differences in biotransformation mechanisms. Sphingomonas, Beijerinckia, Methylophilus, and unknown Cytophagaceae were linked with successful PPCP biodegradation via next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes over time. Results indicate the criticality of applying engineering approaches to control bacterial community compositions in biotreatment systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ever-increasing occurrence and persistence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in soils, sediments, drinking water supplies and wastewater effluents are a matter of serious environmental concern for governments and researchers worldwide. Nanofiltration as tertiary treatment method can be a viable and practical tool to remove these pollutants from aquatic environments. However, organic matter present in water sources can foul the membrane surface during operation, thus being potentially able to affect the membrane performance. Therefore, fouling mechanisms could heavily influence on the removal efficiencies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the implementation of three nano filtration membranes (TFC-SR2, NF-270 and MPS-34) and to study both the rejection of trace PhACs and the fouling mechanisms for each membrane as a function of feed solution pH. Fouling mechanisms were predicted by Hermia's model adapted to cross-flow configurations. Results demonstrated that higher removals were obtained at slightly alkaline pH, especially for anionic trace PhACs. At the same conditions, more severe fouling was observed, which resulted in strong flux declines and an increase in hydrophobicity. This indicates that the attached organic matter on the membrane surface acts as a secondary selective barrier for separation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Incomplete removal during wastewater treatment leads to frequent detection of compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in municipal effluents. A fixed standard dilution factor of 10 for effluents entering receiving water bodies is used during the exposure assessment of several chemical risk assessments. However, the dilution potential of German receiving waters under low flow conditions is largely unknown and information is sparse for other European countries. We calculated dilution factors for two datasets differing in spatial extent and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) size: a national dataset comprising 1225 large WWTPs in Central and Northern Germany and a federal dataset for 678 WWTPs of a single state in Southwest Germany. We found that the fixed factor approach overestimates the dilution potential of 60% and 40% of receiving waters in the national and the federal dataset, with median dilution factors of 5 and 14.5, respectively. Under mean flow conditions, 8% of calculated dilution factors were below 10, with a median dilution factor of 106. We also calculated regional dilution factors that accounted for effluent inputs from upstream WVVTPs. For the national and the federal dataset, 70% and 60% of calculated regional dilution factors fell below 10 under mean low flow conditions, respectively. Decrease of regional dilution potential in small receiving streams was mainly driven by the next VVVVTP upstream with a 25 fold drop of median regional dilution factors. Our results show that using the standard dilution factor of 10 would result in the underestimation of environmental concentrations for authorised chemicals by a factor of 3-5 for about 10% of WWTPs, especially during low flow conditions. Consequently, measured environmental concentrations might exceed predicted environmental concentrations and ecological risks posed by effluents could be much higher, suggesting that a revision of current risk assessment practices may be required.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are generally poorly removed during conventional wastewater treatment. There is a need for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive methods to monitor the quality of treated wastewater effluent. The purpose of this study was to assess the applicability of the LuminoTox as a tool to monitor municipal secondary effluent (SE) and to determine its sensitivity to the presence of CECs.The effect of exposure method on a 14 CECs mix was explored; 20 min in the dark or 30 min under light were both recommended as they were sensitive to the detection of CECs in wastewater while providing a short run time. Stabilized aqueous photosynthetic systems (SAPS) detected the 14 CECs mix in the wastewater matrices when they were present at a concentration in the 6 mu g/L to 50 mu g/L range. Interference on the biosensors were examined in a range of wastewater characteristics commonly observed in SE and, for most cases, biosensors were not inhibited which suggests that, in most cases, wastewater characteristics would not cause toxic interferences. SAPS detected CECs in SE with different modes of action with the degree of sensitivity of individual CECs developed from experimental and literature values as follows: inhibitors of the plastoquinone binding site within photosystem II > direct or indirect inhibitors of photosynthesis acting on binding sites other than that of the QB. SAPS were assessed for their ability to detect residual CECs in SE without sample preparation, however, the effluent examined exhibited minimal inhibition for SAPS II (7 +/- 1%) and no inhibition for SAPS I. These results highlight the need for the development of a sample pre-concentration method to increase the biosensor sensitivity towards native CECs. This would allow the LuminoTox to be an effective tool for monitoring wastewater quality with the intent of residual CECs detection. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This case study presents the fate of selected organic, priority and emerging pollutants along a 3.6 km sector of a vegetated, agricultural ditch situated in Sinaloa (Mexico). The ditch receives runoff of agriculture and domestic wastewater from an adjacent community. During 2013, the occurrence of 38 organic pollutants (pesticides, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), artificial sweeteners and pharmaceutical residues) was monitored monthly at five selected points in the ditch water. Additionally, sediment and Typha domingensis (cattail) plants were collected in March, June, and September 2013 and investigated concerning their ability to absorb and accumulate pollutants. The concentrations of the selected pollutants in the ditch water ranged from sub ng L-1 (metolachlor, atrazine) tow (metalaxyl, acesulfame). The metabolites endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan lactone exceeded mostly the concentration of the precursor insecticide endosulfan. Sorption on sediments was of minor relevance for accumulation of pollutants in the ditch system. Concentrations in the sediments varied seasonally and ranged from 0.2 to 12,432 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.). T. domingensis accumulated ten of the studied pollutants mainly in roots (5-1065 lig kg(-1) d.w.). Overall, the monitoring results of the ditch compartments indicated that downstream the concentrations of the target pollutants decreased. Under no -flow conditions in the hot season, the ditch revealed a noticeable potential to mitigate pollutants. Among the high microbial activity in the water and the subtropical climate conditions, the ditch vegetation contributed to natural attenuation of the selected pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many countries are utilizing reclaimed wastewater for agriculture because drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations are increasing water demands. Unfortunately, wastewater often contains biologically active, pseudopersistent pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Runoff from farms and output from wastewater treatment plants also contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on an agricultural pest, Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Larvae were reared on artificial diets spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Trichoplusia ni showed increased developmental time and mortality when reared on artificial diets containing antibiotics, hormones, or a mixture of contaminants. Mortality was also increased when T. ni were reared on tomatoes grown hydroponically with the same concentrations of antibiotics. The antibiotic-treated plants translocated ciprofloxacin through their tissues to roots, shoots, and leaves. Microbial communities of T. ni changed substantially between developmental stages and when exposed to CECs in their diets. Our results suggest that use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of crops can affect the developmental biology and microbial communities of an insect of agricultural importance.

AB Due to their particular properties, detergents are widely used in household cleaning products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in agriculture as adjuvants tailoring the features of pesticides or other crop protection agents. The continuously growing use of these various products means that water soluble detergents have become one of the most problematic groups of pollutants for the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Thus it is important to identify bacteria having the ability to survive in the presence of large quantities of detergent and efficiently decompose it to non-surface active compounds. In this study, we used peaty soil sampled from a surface flow constructed wetland in a wastewater treatment plant to isolate bacteria that degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We identified and initially characterized 36 Pseudomonas spp. strains that varied significantly in their ability to use SDS as their sole carbon source. Five isolates having the closest taxonomic relationship to the Pseudomonas jessenii subgroup appeared to be the most efficient SDS degraders, decomposing from 80 to 100% of the SDS present in an initial concentration 1 g/L in less than 24 h. These isolates exhibited significant differences in degree of SDS degradation, their resistance to high detergent concentration (ranging from 2.5 g/L up to 10 g/L or higher), and in chemotaxis toward SDS on a plate test. Mass spectrometry revealed several SDS degradation products, 1-dodecanol being dominant; however, traces of dodecanal, 2-dodecanol, and 3-dodecanol were also observed, but no dodecanoic acid. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography revealed that all of the selected isolates possessed alkylsulfatase-like activity. Three isolates, AP3_10, AP3_20, and AP3_22, showed a single band on native PAGE zymography, that could be the result of alkylsulfatase activity, whereas for isolates AP3_16 and AP3_19 two bands were observed. Moreover, the AP3_22 strain exhibited a band in presence of both glucose and SDS, whereas in other isolates, the band was visible solely in presence of detergent in the culture medium. This suggests that these microorganisms isolated from peaty soil exhibit exceptional capabilities to survive in, and break down SDS, and they should be considered as a valuable source of biotechnological tools for future bioremediation and industrial applications.

AB The widespread use of pharmaceuticals in both human and animal populations, and the resultant contamination of surface waters from the outflow of water treatment facilities is an issue of growing concern. This has raised the need for analytical methods that can both perform rapid sample analysis and overcome the limitations of conventional analysis procedures, such as multistep workflows and tedious procedures. Coated blade spray (CBS) is a solid-phase microextraction based technique that enables the direct-to mass-spectrometry analysis of extracted compounds via the use of limited organic solvent to desorb analytes and perform electrospray ionization. This paper documents how CBS can be applied for the concomitant tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of nine pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater. The total analysis times of less than 11 min provided limits of detection lower than 50 ng L-1 for all target compounds in river water. The CBS methodology was then compared to a conventional solid-phase extraction technique for the analysis of the final effluent of six wastewater treatment facilities. The experimental results strongly suggest that CBS offers scientists a viable alternative method for analyzing water samples that is both rapid and relatively solvent-free.

AB Tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (TCEP), an emerging contaminant of concern, is largely recalcitrant to removal due to its relatively high water solubility and non-degradability. Adsorption from wastewater is an option for separation, with a suitable adsorbent. In this study, equilibrium adsorption of TCEP onto zeolite-beta (300: 1 Si: Al ratio) is reported for simulated environmental waters with commonly occurring competing adsorbates. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent to TCEP in pure water which is about 103 mg/g is reduced by approximately 30% in the presence of natural organic material (NOM) and several common salts. The data show that increasing NOM and salt concentrations do not have a proportionately increased effect. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of TCEP was reduced, by up to 70% under competitive conditions with methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), another common contaminant in industrial wastewaters. Solid state NMR analyses of the zeolite subsequent to TCEP adsorption provide insight to the preferred zeolite adsorption sites. The NMR data for both Si and C appear to indicate that a hydrophobic surface interaction between the organic carbon and zeolite silica surfaces is the most likely adsorption mechanism.

AB The aim of this research is to evaluate the effective parameters such as pH, current density (mA/cm(2)), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, volume ratio of H2O2 to pharmaceutical wastewater (PhW) (ml/l) and reaction time (min) on the electro-Fenton process for the ibuprofen (as a pharmaceutical waste in water) removal. Since a synthetic wastewater with the same concentration of ibuprofen in a real pharmaceutical wastewater (400 ppm) was chosen in this research, the sample was tested in terms of the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The parameters were statistically optimized under response surface mythology (RSM). The software was also applied to minimize the number of runs. The optimum conditions for 98.29% COD removal experimentally were at pH of 2.43, current density of 23.08 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 2.69, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.84 ml/l and reaction time of 28.08 min.

AB In order to address increased interest from scientists and regulators in quantifying environmental risks associated with release of common down-the-drain consumer products, a single-medium contaminant fate model for the lower St. Lawrence drainage basin in Southern Ontario was developed. The model was built within the pre-existing framework of the iSTREEM (R) in-stream environmental exposure model, which previously only contained US geographies. Data for the model were obtained from Canadian Government sources. In order to assess the model's strengths and limitations, concentrations of the chemicals triclosan and carbamazepine in surface water were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) generated by the model for both mean and low flow scenarios. Results of the PECs and the measured surface water concentrations were comparable, with the surface water concentrations generally falling in between the mean and low flow PECs on a cumulative distribution curve.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBP) adsorption onto acids (HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4) pre-treated onion skin (OS) was studied as a function of pH, adsorbent dosage, drugs initial concentrations and contact time. The H2SO4-OS (adsorbent) showed higher drugs adsorption efficiency followed by H3PO4- OS and HCl-OS and NAT-OS (native). The drugs loaded and un-loaded OS were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray and scanning electron microscope techniques, which revealed a considerable change in OS composition and changed surface morphology. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted well to both the drugs adsorption data. Freundlich isotherm explained well the drugs adsorption onto OS adsorbents. The optimum conditions of pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time were 6.5, 0.05 mg/g and 220 min, respectively. At optimum condition, the DCF and IBP adsorptions were 134.003 and 91.99 mg/g, respectively, which were 81.90% and 65.99% removal of the initial concentrations. Results revealed that OS pre-treated with mineral acids is a potential adsorbent and could possibly be used for the remediation of drugs wastewater.

AB This scientific note reviews current approaches for using membrane technology to treat wastewater from food processing, for example, as a means to produce water by recovering components with high added value. In addition, with regard to the availability of wastewater, processes that contain membranes have been shown to be advantageous in terms of treating waste, recovering solutes, and producing water. With regard to the latter, processes that contain membranes can be considered to be a sustainable methodology given the valorization of waste. Lastly, this note provides a brief general view emphasizing a real need to apply membrane technology in the food industry, and indicates that its application is undoubtedly to come.

AB Water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) and hospitals are major point sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in aquatic environments. This study investigated the removal efficiencies of 23 known or suspected EDCs through the San Marcos WRRF to determine which treatment process was the most effective at removal. Results from samples collected at the hospital indicate that the hospital discharge is contributing to the concentration of these compounds in the San Marcos wastewater collection system (0.05-140 g/L concentrations). The most frequently detected compounds in the WRRF influent included acetaminophen, nonylphenol, caffeine, benzophenone, N, N-diethyl-mtoluamide (DEET), bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan. Comparison of influent and effluent concentrations showed that the San Marcos WRRF is effectively removing (> 92%) of these compounds, with the exception of carbamazepine and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). These preliminary results will be used to guide future improvements within the WRRF.

AB The photolysis of diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), and trimethoprim (TMP) was investigated using a low-pressure (LP) mercury ultraviolet (UV) lamp (254 nm) and a combination of UV with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For each experiment, 5 mg/L of each pharmaceutical was prepared in pure water and individually degraded by either UV alone or UV/H2O2. DCF and SMX were highly susceptible to UV treatment and completely degraded to below their LC-MS detection limit (1 mu g/L) after only 8 min of UV irradiation. TMP and CBZ were more resistant to UV treatment, with only 58.2 and 25.2% degradation (after 1h UV exposure). The combination of H2O2 addition (up to 0.2 g/L) with UV significantly improved the removal rate of TMP and CBZ up to 91.2 and 99.7% of the initial concentration, respectively. A number of novel transformation compounds were identified as UV or UV/H2O2 degradation products using LC-MS. The range and amount of these transformation compounds strongly depended on the applied treatment conditions. The toxicity of each pharmaceutical solution before and after treatment was also evaluated and all parent compounds were non-toxic at the tested concentration (i.e. 5 mg/L). DCF, in particular, but also CBZ and SMX, showed an increase in solution toxicity after treatment with UV only, indicating the presence of photolytic degradation products that are more toxic than the parent compounds. Treatment with UV/H2O2 reduced the toxicity of all solutions to below the detection limit of the assay. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The consumption of drugs of abuse has been recently investigated in Martinique using the back-calculation approach, also called the "sewage epidemiology" method. Results demonstrated a very high consumption considering the international data. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are located just behind the Martinique island shoreline, and effluents could impact the vulnerable corals and marine seagrass ecosystem. The present article aims to determine a WWTP's efficiency by comparing the influent and effluent of two WWTPs, with different residence times and biological treatments, located either outdoors or indoors. In parallel, a degradation study is conducted using spiked wastewater exposed to tropical and ambient temperatures. Results demonstrate the consistent efficiency of the two processes, especially for the outdoor WWTP which uses the activated sludge process. The positive effect of the tropical temperature is showed by the increase of cocaine degradation at 31 degrees C. Thus, low illicit drug residue concentrations in effluent would indicate that wastewater treatment is efficient and even enhanced under tropical context. This fact should be confirmed with others molecules. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for subsequent studies of sludge contamination because of their local recycling as compost.

AB In the present study, the efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) upgraded with a powdered activated carbon unit for the reduction of micropollutants and the related advantages for fish health have been analyzed by means of different biomarkers, i.e. histopathological investigations, analyses of glycogen content and stress proteins, as well as by chemical analyses in different matrices. Comparative analyses were conducted prior and subsequent to the installation of the additional purification unit.
   Chemical analyses revealed a significant reduction of several pharmaceuticals, including diclofenac, carbamazepine and metoprolol, in samples of effluent and surface water downstream of the WWTP after its upgrade. In addition, diminished concentrations of diclofenac and PFOS were detected in tissues of analyzed fish.
   Histopathological investigations of fish liver, gills, and kidney revealed improved tissue integrity in fish after improved wastewater treatment. In parallel, biochemical measurements of glycogen revealed increased energy resources in fish liver and, furthermore, hsp70 levels in livers of exposed rainbow trout and in kidneys of exposed brown trout were lower after than before the WWTP upgrade. In summary, additional treatment with powdered activated carbon led to a reduction of potentially hazardous chemicals in the effluent and the adjacent river and, consequently, to an improvement of fish health in the receiving water course.

AB In this study, three-phase fluidized bed equipment for the solar photocatalysis-membrane separation (E-SPME), comprising solar photocatalytic degradation and membrane separation zones, was first introduced, and the photocatalytic degradation of acid red B wastewater (ARBW) with a TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated using the E-SPME. The experimental results indicated the circulating flow of wastewater between the two zones and the increase in the ARBW photocatalytic degradation efficiency with decreasing membrane flux. The same experimental phenomenon was observed with the change in the aeration rate in the lower water tank from 0.10 to 0.40m(3)h(-1), but the degradation efficiency started to decrease with further increase in the aeration rate to 0.50m(3)h(-1). The degradation efficiency on a clear day was greater than that on a cloudy day; however, it was significantly improved with the opened UV lamps on a cloudy day. The steady operation of the E-SPME was still possible by the opening of the UV lamps on completely cloudy and clear days with a solar light intensity of <13.0Wm(-2).

AB Practical aspects of Lagenaria vulgaris shell conversion to activated carbon were examined along with its use in ranitidine adsorption. Kinetics and isotherms of adsorption onto Lagenaria vulgaris carbon (LVC) were correlated to several theoretical adsorption models. The best fit was found in the case of Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model indicating monolayer adsorption. The influence of pH under kinetic study showed slightly hindered adsorption below pH 4. The optimal adsorbent dosage was set to 1 g/L. LVC was characterized by several complementary techniques, including wet chemical techniques such as Boehm's titrations and determination of pH(pzc) and pH of LVC, which revealed neutral nature of the adsorbent. N-2 sorptometry determined specific surface area of 665 m(2)/g and significant ratio of micropores in the sample with maximum wall's diameter of 2.2 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the role of lignin and cellulose in the formation of the final LVC structure. Porous structure of the material was proved by using scanning electron microscopy. Preparation of LVC material drew attention as an easy and low-cost process for production of a highly efficient adsorbent which exhibited fast kinetics of ranitidine removal in the first minutes of contacting and large adsorption capacity (315.5 mg/g) at equilibrium.

AB Pharmaceuticals are included in a group of compounds considered as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in environmental matrices. The quantification of CECs is typically accomplished using chromatographic methods that require several sample pretreatment steps. The current study proposes a voltammetric method to quantify directly nimesulide (NIM) in aqueous samples. The voltammetric parameters were optimized and chosen based on the profile of the voltammograms and peak current intensity. The adequacy of the analytical method was evaluated using validation criteria, such as accuracy, selectivity, linearity, detection, and quantification limits. Linearity was assessed by a standard addition curve at a concentration range of 0.5-130 A mu g L-1 of NIM. The limit of quantification was 0.50 A mu g L-1, with 60 s of preconcentration time. Accuracy was expressed as recovery percentages of NIM and ranged from 111.4 to 119.8%. The voltammetric method herein proposed has several advantages over others already used to determine NIM, such as fewer sample pretreatment steps, faster, and cheaper analyses. NIM was detected in wastewater samples at concentration levels ranging from 101.7 to 385.0 A mu g L-1. This result is the first evidence about NIM occurrences in environmental matrices in the area surrounding the Itaipu Lake reservoir in Brazil.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is a typical persistent refractory organic industrial wastewater. In this work, a simple, one-step method for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was developed using wet oxidation (WO) in a subcritical water apparatus, with detailed studies on the effects of operating parameters, including the temperature of the system, the ratio of reactants, and pH of the wastewater. Under optimized experimental conditions, efficient treatment of actual pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved, with removal of 100% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 98% nitrate ion, 98% nitrite ion, and 68% ammonium ion. Our results suggest that the WO process, using a subcritical water apparatus, is a promising method of treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Treated wastewater from small communities is discharged into rivers or streams with a high biodiversity value. This is particularly important in Mediterranean countries, where most of the streams are dry almost all year round. This preliminary study assessed the occurrence and attenuation of 23 emerging contaminants (ECs) in 4 wastewater-dominated streams in which treated wastewater accounted for the entire stream flow. The concentration of ECs was monitored in the warm and cold seasons in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and at 6 downstream locations. The concentration of ECs in the WWTP effluents ranged from undetected to 12 mu g L-1. The attenuation of ECs 1 km downstream ranged from no removal to up to 80% (48% on average). The half-lives of ECs in the 4 streams ranged from 0.4 to 20 h (3.9 +/- 3.5 h on average). Compounds such as benzodiazepine drugs and flame retardants were the most recalcitrant (half-lives >5 h). The highest attenuation of ECs and ammonia was observed in the stream completely covered by vegetation. The cumulative hazardous quotient 1 km downstream was reduced on average by more than 60%. Therefore, the results suggest that both seasonality and vegetation play an important role in in-stream attenuation of ECs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in surface water are a threat to drinking water supplies. The removal of 12 pharmaceuticals was investigated in a full scale constructed wetland processing hospital wastewaters in East Ukraine. Passive integrative samplers POCIS were used to monitor target compounds in the wastewater inlet and outlet at the beginning of the constructed wetland operation in 2012 and three years later in 2015. Pharmaceuticals were effectively removed; however, their removal efficiency differed among the compounds and years of the operation. An increase of removal efficiency was observed for androstenedione, carbamazepine, caffeine, diclofenac, estrone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, propranolol and triclosan with greater water residence time and an increase in macrophyte cover. Removal patterns of pharmaceuticals were discussed based on specific physical chemical properties of molecules, changes in the operational conditions of the constructed wetland and inlet pollutant concentrations. Further research is needed to fully understand how the maturation of constructed wetlands influences the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater.

AB This study identified transformation products of doxycycline that formed during chlorine disinfection and evaluated the antibacterial properties of the products. Samples were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS to identify the products. Antibacterial activity assays were used to determine the antibacterial properties of the products that formed during chlorine disinfection. Samples were run in both ultrapure water and final effluent collected from a local wastewater treatment facility. The ultrapure water experiments allowed the products to be easily detected, and the identified products were compared to those found in the wastewater matrix. Wastewater effluent was used as a realistic background matrix for a full-scale wastewater chlorination process. Products with antibiotic properties formed in ultrapure water. In the wastewater effluent, antibacterially active products did not form to a measurable extent. Five transformation products were seen in ultrapure and wastewater effluent samples. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated transformation products were observed. While the same products were found in both matrices, their relative abundance was different; the non-chlorinated product forming preferentially in the wastewater matrix and chlorinated products forming in greater abundance in the ultrapure water matrix. This can be attributed to the competition for chlorine with the wastewater background, inhibiting the formation of active products. Furthermore, bromide was added at concentrations of 0.5-5 mg L-1 to both ultrapure water and wastewater matrices to assess the antibacterial activity of brominated products. The brominated products were observed, although none of them exhibited antibacterial activity. The results suggest that not only trace antibiotics but also their products could be the source of antibiotic resistance in the environment. The fate of other common antibiotics in water chlorination should be examined.

AB Increasing emphasis on resource recovery from wastewater highlights the importance of capturing valuable products, e.g., nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, while removing contaminants, e.g., organic micropollutants. The objective of this research was to evaluate the fate of the micropollutants triclosan (present as a mixture of neutral and anionic species at neutral pH), 17 beta-estradiol (neutral at neutral pH), and sulfamethoxazole (anionic at neutral pH) during nutrient recovery using ion exchange-precipitation. Adsorption of the three micropollutants to the phosphate-selective ion exchange resins LayneRT and DOWHFO-Cu ranged from 54% to 88% in Milli-Q water tests and 50% to 71% in wastewater tests using anaerobic effluent. The micropollutants did not sorb to the ammonium-selective exchanger, clinoptilolite. The presence of the micropollutants reduced the kinetic rates of nutrient exchange onto ion exchangers. However, the micropollutants did not interfere with nutrient capacity on the ion exchangers, likely due to the low concentration of micropollutants and potentially different mechanisms of adsorption (i.e., Coulombic and non-Coulombic attractions for micropollutants) compared to the target ions. Micropollutants that sorbed to the phosphate exchangers were released with phosphate ions during regeneration. Concentrations of NaOH and NaCl in regeneration solutions did not correlate with micropollutant desorption. Among the micropollutants studied, the more hydrophobic triclosan and 17 beta-estradiol adsorbed to the resins to greater extents. These compounds also demonstrated lower desorption rates than sulfamethoxazole during regeneration in Milli-Q water tests. Batch struvite precipitation tests revealed that the micropollutants were not enmeshed in precipitated struvite crystals nor sorbed during crystallization, indicating that the struvite product was free of triclosan, 17 beta-estradiol, and sulfamethoxazole.

AB A multiresidue method was developed to estimate community drug use during two weekends of the 2014 Soccer World Cup via wastewater analyses. Five of the 16 investigated substances were detected in all eight samples. Benzoilecgonine (BE), the major cocaine metabolite, was the most abundant substance (1.9 +/- 0.3 to 4.2 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1) followed by anhydroecgonine (AE) (1.5 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1), phenacetin (PHE) (0.62 +/- 0.06 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mu g L-1), levamisole (LEV) (0.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.23 +/- 0.09 mu g L-1), and cocaine (COC) (0.46 +/- 0.07 to 0.8 +/- 0.1 mu g L-1). COC and BE levels suggested a human consumption origin for the investigated drugs. AE/BE ratios revealed a significant use of smoked crack/free base cocaine. Relationships between the adulterants PHE and LEV evidenced a higher use of crack cocaine in the South-Wing WWTP region. An estimative for cocaine use revealed slightly higher drug consumption during the Soccer World Cup weekends in comparison with a typical weekend in 2012.

AB Water pollution is one of the major concerns over long-term sustainability of the environment. Effective and efficient treatment of polluted wastewater is still a serious challenge for global researchers. In the last 2-3 decades, due to the incessant emergence of micropollutants in surface and ground water bodies, several endeavors have been made to resolve the water pollution issues either through chemical, physical and biological degradation processes or through removal/separation processes using different adsorbents and membranes. It has been found that most of the studies are mainly limited to single or binary pollutant analysis in a pure water matrix. Therefore, in this novel investigation, a mixture of five different pollutants has been studied for UV/TiO2-based photocatalytic degradation. In the present study, a commercially available TiO2, an antibiotic, i.e. Ciprofloxacin and four different synthetic dyes, i.e. Rhodamine B, Methylene Blue, Methyl Orange and Amaranth have been used as a photocatalyst, a pharmaceutical and various industrial dyes, respectively, in a batch photocatalytic reactor system with a stirrer. It is important to note that the commercial TiO2 photocatalyst has also been characterized with the help of several characterization techniques. The present study is mainly focused on the degradation of different micropollutants present in the simulated wastewater matrix and their individual degradation kinetics. It is interesting to observe that MB and RhB have shown the maximum degradation followed by CIP (96.21, 96.15 and 89.62%, respectively). In addition, a microbiological assay has also been performed to check the toxicity variation in the degraded products. It is quite interesting to observe that the simulated wastewater matrix has completely lost its microbial toxicity within 120 min of UV/TiO2-based photocatalytic treatment. Finally, total organic carbon evaluations of various treated samples have also been performed and the obtained results substantiate the theory of assimilable organic carbon.

AB Antibiotics-bacteria interactions depend on antibiotic concentration at the scale of bacteria. This study investigates how vancomycin penetrates into activated sludge flocs and can be sorbed on the bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The 3D structure of flocs was imaged using EPS auto fluorescence. The green fluorescent BODIPY (R) FL vancomycin was introduced in a microscopic chamber containing activated sludge and penetration of vancomycin into the flocs by diffusion was observed using time-lapse microscopy. The penetration depended on the floc structure, as long and large pores could go through the whole flocs making preferential path. The antibiotic concentration into the flocs was also found to depend on the sorption rate. BODIPY (R) FL vancomycin was found to bind preferentially into Gram(+) bacteria than on EPS. The vancomycin adsorption constant on bacteria according to the linear adsorption model, Kd(bacteria) was estimated to be 5 times higher (SD 2.6) than the adsorption constant on EPS Kd(EPS). These results suggest that antibiotic removal by sorption into wastewater treatment plants could change according to the amount of bacteria in the sludge. Moreover, antibiotic concentration at the scale of bacteria could be significantly higher than the concentration in the bulk solution and this should be taken into account when studying antibiotic activity or biodegradation.

AB The effect of high cross flow velocity (CFV) on the operational efficiency of a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating antibiotic solvent effluents was explored. The average of total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) removal efficiencies during four Runs were 96.5% and 98.7%. Meanwhile, biological removal contributions were 74.3% and 78%, the rest part was attributed by the physical removal process of the membrane block, VFA (Volatile Fatty Acids) and alpha value (VFA/alkalinity) increased with the increase of CFV, resulted alkalinity decreased. Biomass concentration mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) as well as the polysaccharide increased smoothly in the suspended sludge with the CFV increasing, and the protein content decreased gradually. However, the concentration of biomass, polysaccharide and protein presented opposite trends in the attached sludge of the membrane. The results indicated that AnMBR can effectively treat the antibiotic solvent wastewater under high CFV. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater is a major source of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), which are not all removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. White rot fungi can degrade PhACs, but their application has been limited to non-sterile conditions due to the competition with other microorganisms for growth. In this study, immobilization of Trametes versicolor on different lignocellulosic supports was studied as strategy to ensure fungal survival under continuous treatment conditions. A fluidized bed reactor and a trickling packed-bed reactor with T. versicolor immobilized on pallet wood were employed for the removal of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen. Best results were obtained with the trickling packed-bed reactor, which operated for 49 days with high removal values in real hospital wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enzymatic degradation with ligninolytic enzyme, e.g., laccase, is a potential green solution for removal of pharmaceutical compounds that are released into the environment through wastewater effluent. However, the deficiencies of using the enzyme in its free forms, such as reusability and stability, should be addressed before industrial applications. In this study, laccase was immobilized onto tailor-made polyacrylonitrile biochar composite nanofibrous membrane through covalent bonding, and the parameters of immobilization were optimized. The obtained biocatalyst was utilized for removal of chlortetracycline (CTC), carbamazepine (CBZ), and diclofenac (DCF) at an environmentally relevant concentration in batch mode. These pharmaceutical compounds represented three main categories of pharmaceutical compounds, i.e., antibiotics, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory. The results showed that the immobilized laccase has improved storage, temperature, and pH stability compared to free laccase. Also, it maintained more than 17% of its initial activity after 10 cycles of ABTS oxidation which indicated improved reusability of the enzyme. Using immobilized laccase for degradation, three pharmaceutical compounds in batch experiments exhibited 72.7%, 63.3%, and 48.6% degradation efficiency for DCF, CTC, and CBZ, respectively, after 8 h of reaction. The decreasing trend of adsorption extent during reaction time for all compounds confirmed the regenerative effect of laccase on adsorption sites of biochar.

AB Exposure of wild organisms to anthropogenic substances never follows a definite time-course and pulsed events can often determine biological responses to such chemicals, confounding the interpretation of toxicological data. This is the case of specific chemicals such as pharmaceutical drugs, which are commonly released by sewage systems into sensitive areas, including estuaries. The presence and amount of these chemicals in the wild can be modulated by events such as dilution due to heavy rain, floods, or by varying patterns of domestic water use (daily vs. seasonal). The present study aimed to obtain additional data about the toxicity of paracetamol towards the marine clam species Ruditapes philippinarum, following realistic modes of exposure. Thus, the toxicity assessment was made after an acute exposure to different concentrations of paracetamol, followed by a recovery period. The adopted toxicological endpoints included energy-related parameters (glycogen content, GLY; protein content, PROT; electron transport system activity, ETS), activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; Glutathione-S-transferases, GSTs), levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), neurotoxicity (cholinesterases activity, ChEs), and indicators of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, LPO). The here obtained results showed an increase in SOD and GPx activities after exposure. In organisms exposed to the highest concentration tested it was also possible to observe a significant increase in GSTs activity. However, these alterations in the antioxidant defence system were not able to prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress in exposed organisms. Furthermore, exposure to paracetamol induced neurotoxicity in clams, with a concentration-dependent ChEs inhibition along the exposure concentrations. Exposure to paracetamol also led to an increase of GLY content which resulted from metabolic activity depression along the increasing exposure gradient. In recovering organisms the activities of SOD, GPx and GSTs decreased back towards control values presenting lower values than the ones observed in organisms after acute exposure to paracetamol. No LPO was registered in organisms after the recovery period. In addition, after recovery, clams showed no signs of neurotoxicity, with ChEs activities in previously exposed organisms similar to control clams. After recovery clams seemed to re-establish their metabolic capacity, especially evidenced in clams previously exposed to the highest paracetamol concentration as demonstrated by the increase of ETS activity up to control values. Furthermore, the decrease of GLY content after recovery may indicate that clams increased their metabolic activity and started to use their energetic reserves to re-establish their oxidative status. This set of data shows that an acute exposure to paracetamol can exert deleterious effects that may compromise specific biochemical pathways in sensitive aquatic species, such as R. philippinarwn, but organisms can re-establish their biochemical status to control levels after a recovery period.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) throughout the Netherlands contain significant concentrations of pharmaceuticals (25-65 mu g/L) and about 10-20 mg C/L dissolved non-biodegradable organic matter. By means of IEX mainly the humic acid fraction of the effluent organic matter can be removed, whereas O-3/biofiltration mainly removes the hydrophobic fraction. For the first time the combination of these processes with O-3/H2O2, UV/H2O2 or UV/O-3 was tested for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluent. Based on initial laboratory experiments, a pilot installation was built in which IEX followed by UV/H2O2 was applied to real WWTP effluent. The process appeared to be very robust, and able to remove a very broad range of different pharmaceuticals. The additional costs for this treatment are estimated at approximately (sic)0.34/m(3)-treated effluent, which is in the same order of magnitude as estimated for other additional, but less versatile, treatment processes.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater treatment plant effluent poses a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems. Constructed wetlands have recently been used to control PhACs. However, the microbial communities that are involved in these processes have not been comprehensively investigated.
   This study aimed to evaluate the removal of PhACs and microbial response in constructed wetlands during the treatment of PhACs. The effects of PhACs on bacterial communities in constructed wetland mesocosms were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Results indicated that removal efficiencies of PhACs were enhanced over time, and constructed wetlands offer higher removal efficiencies for the PhACs studied compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants. Plants improved microbial richness and diversity while both indices were negatively correlated with PhAC concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 mu g/L in constructed wetland mesocosms. The microbial communities of the constructed wetland mesocosms were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes under PhAC exposure, while Desulfobulbus and Treponema were the dominant genera. In particular, Proteobacteria were correlated with PhAC concentrations. Overall, this study provides valuable microbial community ecology data to understand how microbial populations respond to PhAC stress in constructed wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are the environmental pollutants of growing concern. The aim of this study was to indicate the effects of typical PPCPs on the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus. We treated male frogs with waterborne ibuprofen (IBU, 250 ng.L-1), triclosan (TCS, 500 ng.L-1 1), or estrone (E1, 100 ng.L-1) for 14 days. Common vulnerability of the frogs was detected from dramatic decrease of Zn, total and metalated metallothionein (MT) concentrations, Zn/Cu ratio, the elevation of activity of glutathione-S-transferase, cathepsin D and DNA instability in the liver, the depletion of cholinesterase in the brain and cortisol in the blood plasma in all exposures. Nevertheless, lipofuscin concentration in the liver was always decreased. The groups were best distinguished by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity determined by ELISA. The exposure to IBU caused lesser damage, but elevated the levels of oxyradicals and glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and lysosomal membrane instability. Exposures to TCS and El provoked the endocrine disturbance (increased levels of vitellogenin and thyrotropin in blood plasma), decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and increased level of pyruvate in the liver. TCS caused the increase of GSSG by 7.3 times and lactate levels. Only El lead to decrease of deiodinase activity in the liver, activation of CYP450 and caspase-3 and efflux of cathepsin D from lysosomes. Spectrophotometric and ELISA assays of MTs and CYP450 gave distinct results in E1-group. Broad disruption of the hormonal pathways caused by E1 could be of concern for the health status of frogs in their habitats.

AB Due to concerns regarding the release of pharmaceuticals into the environment and the understudied impact of stereochemistry of pharmaceuticals on their fate and biological potency, we focussed in this paper on stereoselective transformation pathways of selected chiral pharmaceuticals (16 pairs) at both microcosm (receiving waters and activated sludge wastewater treatment simulating microcosms) and macrocosm (wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) utilising activated sludge technology and receiving waters) scales in order to test the hypothesis that biodegradation of chiral drugs is stereoselective. Our monitoring programme of a full scale activated sludge WWTP and receiving environment revealed that several chiral drugs, those being marketed mostly as racemates, are present in wastewater and receiving waters enriched with one enantiomeric form (e.g. fluoxetine, mirtazapine, salbutamol, MDMA). This is most likely due to biological metabolic processes occurring in humans and other organisms. Both activated sludge and receiving waters simulating microcosms confirmed our hypothesis that chiral drugs are subject to stereoselective microbial degradation. It led, in this research, to preferential degradation of S-(+)-enantiomers of amphetamines, R-(+)-enantiomers of beta-blockers and S-(+)-enantiomers of antidepressants. In the case of three parent compound metabolite pairs (venlafaxine desmethylvenlafaxine, citalopram desmethylcitalopram and MDMA - MDA), while parent compounds showed higher resistance to both microbial metabolism and photodegradation, their desmethyl metabolites showed much higher degradation rate both in terms of stereoselective metabolic and non-stereoselective photochemical processes. It is also worth noting that metabolites tend to be, as expected, enriched with enantiomers of opposite configuration to their parent compounds, which might have significant toxicological consequences when evaluating the metabolic residues of chiral pollutants.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are released into aquatic environments, largely as a result of ineffectual removal during wastewater treatment. Here we present a screening strategy based on the use of three commercially available mass spectral databases, combined into a single searchable entity and parallelized by cluster computing. In addition to this, a targeted solid phase extraction method with Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF) was used to quantify 99 pharmaceuticals in South African surface water on a national level. Limits of quantification were in the low ng/L range for the majority of the compounds and it was found that nationally both Lamotrigine and Nevirapine occurred most often. Prednisolone and Ritonavir were present at the highest average concentration; 623 and 489 ng/L respectively. It is however shown that more than 50% of the targets chosen for analysis are not detectable in any of the samples, which highlights the utility of untargeted, database driven screening; prior to the use of costly analytical standards. Untargeted screening detected 45% of the compounds detected in targeted mode, and furthermore tentatively identified a total of 4273 unique compounds across the samples. Automatically triggered MS/MS analyses yielded 92 unique hits with greater than 95% confidence. It is therefore suggested that untargeted screening should precede the targeted approach as a matter of economy and to guide the selection of targets for quantification. There is however great room for improvement in current commercial database search methodologies as a large bottleneck exists due to processing time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Fish Plasma Model (FPM) was applied to water exposure and tissue concentrations in fish collected from two wastewater treatment plant impacted estuarine sites. In this study we compared predicted fish plasma concentrations to Cmax values for humans, which represents the maximum plasma concentration for the minimum therapeutic dose. The results of this study show that predictions of plasma concentrations for a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from effluent concentrations resulted in 37 compounds (54%) exceeding the response ratio (RR = Fish [Plasma]/1% Cmax(total)) of 1 compared to 3 compounds (14%) detected with values generated with estuarine receiving water concentrations. When plasma concentrations were modeled from observed whole-body tissue residues, 16 compounds out of 24 detected for Chinook (67%) and 7 of 14 (50%) for sculpin resulted in an RRtissue value greater than 1, which highlights the importance of this dose metric over that using estuarine water. Because the tissue residue approach resulted in a high percentage of compounds with calculated response ratios exceeding a value of unity, we believe this is a more accurate representation for exposure in the field. Predicting plasma concentrations from tissue residues improves our ability to assess the potential for adverse effects in fish because exposure from all sources is captured. Tissue residues are also more likely to represent steady-state conditions compared to those from water exposure because of the inherent reduction in variability usually observed for field data and the time course for bioaccumulation. We also examined the RR in a toxic unit approach to highlight the importance of considering multiple compounds exhibiting a similar mechanism of action. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Urban surface waters face several stressors associated with industry and urban water management. Over much of the past century, the wastewater treatment in Berlin, Germany, relied on inefficient sewage farms, which resulted in severe eutrophication and sediment contamination in the recipient surface waterbodies. A prominent example is Lake Tegel, where a multitude of management measures were applied in the last decades for the purpose of ecosystem restoration. In this study, we analyzed sediment cores of three lakes with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy: Lake Tegel, Lake Groer Wannsee, which is environmentally similar but has a different management history, and Lake Userin, which serves as a reference located in a nature protection area. Multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and self-organizing maps) were used to assess the sediment quality and to reconstruct the management history of Lake Tegel. Principal component analysis established two main gradients of sediment composition: heavy metals and lithogenic elements. The impact of the management measures was visualized in the lake sediment composition changing from high abundance of heavy metals and reducing redox conditions to less-impacted sediments in recent layers. The clustering techniques suggested heterogeneity among sites within Lake Tegel that probably reflect urban water management measures. The abundance of heavy metals in recent lake sediments of Lake Tegel is similar to a lake with low urban impact and is lower than in Lake Groer Wannsee suggesting that the management measures were successful in the reduction of heavy metals, which are still a threat for surface waters worldwide.

AB A novel cryptomelane-Ir (cry-Ir) electrode is prepared for Ir to enter into the cryptomelane (named as cry-Mn) structure and used for aspirin degradation. This catalyst can efficiently reduce the Ir usage from 85 to 34%. Also, the onset potential of cry-Ir is about 1.40 V and the over potential is about 0.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating that cry-Ir has an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity to produce oxidizing species and can decrease electrolytic voltage during the electro-oxidation process. So, the electrical efficiency per log order (EE/O) for cry-Ir electrode is only 5% of PbO2 electrode, which is the best electrode for organic degradation. Also, cry-Ir has large tunnel size which favors insertion of aspirin molecule into cry-Ir structure and enhances the contact between reactive intermediates and the contaminant. Using cry-Ir as anode, 100% aspirin removal and 55% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal could be obtained at 4 V. We also compare cry-Ir electrode with IrO2 and find that IrO2 anode can only eliminate 20% aspirin under the same condition. As a result, cry-Ir is a promising anode material for organic pollutant degradation.

AB While our current generation continues to make efforts to remediate and minimize traditional pollutants in the environment, other "emerging'' environmental contaminants are now warranting attention. These include perfluorinated compounds, nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, antibacterials, hormones, flame retardants, disinfection by-products (DBPs), artificial sweeteners, benzotriazoles, 1,4-dioxane, and algal toxins, as well as emerging contaminants on the horizon: prions and ionic liquids. Wastewater effluents are a major source for many of these emerging contaminants, due to their use in products we use in our households, from pharmaceuticals, detergents, fabric coatings, foam cushions, lotions, sunscreens, cosmetics, hair products, foods and beverages, and food packaging. After use, these chemicals are released in wastewater, and because many are incompletely removed in wastewater treatment, they enter our rivers and drinking water supplies. Surface run-off and agricultural run-off can also be important sources of their entry into the environment. Moreover, many of these contaminants can transform in the environment, from such processes as microbial degradation, photolysis, and hydrolysis, and they can also react with disinfectants in drinking water or wastewater treatment to form disinfection by-products. Issues surrounding these emerging contaminants, include widespread occurrence, bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity. Climate change can also serve to exasperate their effects by concentrating them in rivers during times of drought and by causing resuspension of some (like nanomaterials) during floods. This review will discuss these issues surrounding emerging contaminants and also propose some engineering solutions for the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been widely documented that municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents are a major source of artificial sweeteners to surface waters. However, in rural areas, the extent to which septic systems contribute these same compounds to groundwater aquifers is largely unknown. We examined the occurrence of four commonly used artificial sweeteners in an unconfined sand aquifer that serves as a water supply for rural residents, as a receptor of domestic wastewater from septic systems, and as a source of baseflow to the Nottawasaga River, ON, Canada. Groundwater from the Lake Algonquin Sand Aquifer in the southern Nottawasaga River Watershed was collected from private domestic wells and as groundwater seeps discharging along the banks of the Nottawasaga River. Approximately 30% of samples had detectable levels of one or more artificial sweeteners, indicating the presence of water derived from septic system effluent. Using acesulfame concentrations to estimate the fraction of septic effluent in groundwater samples, similar to 3.4 to 13.6% of the domestic wells had 1% or more of their well water being derived from septic system effluent. Similarly, 2.0 to 4.7% of the groundwater seeps had a septic effluent contribution of 1% or more. No relationship was found between the concentration of acesulfame and the concentration of nitrate, ammonium, or soluble reactive phosphorus in the groundwater, indicating that septic effluent is not the dominant source of nutrients in the aquifer. It is expected that the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in shallow groundwater is widespread throughout rural areas in Canada.

AB Models of microcontaminant fate and transport in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rivers have been developed and used to assist decision-making in the field of water management. These models come with parameter uncertainties that must be properly incorporated in the decision-making process. The main goal of this study is to evaluate how the magnitudes of key model parameter uncertainties influence the selection of end-of-pipe interventions (at WWTPs) designed to reduce the micro contaminant loads in rivers. We developed a model that describes the fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs and the river network based on 3 key parameters: human pharmaceutical consumption and excretion (F) and the pharmaceutical degradation constants in WWTPs (k(wwrp)) and rivers (k(river)). We modelled the fate and transport of diclofenac in the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). We calibrated the model using a Bayesian approach, which resulted in an accurate prediction of measured diclofenac loads at 9 locations along the Llobregat River and at the influents and effluents of 2 WWTPs (R-2 = 0.95). Using different scenarios, we evaluated three levels of uncertainty in the key model parameters. The first level of uncertainty corresponded to the reference distributions obtained from the Bayesian calibration. Then, for each parameter, we generated a narrower PDF (decreased uncertainty with respect to the reference) and a wider PDF (increased uncertainty). For each level of uncertainty, we evaluated increasing removal efficiencies of diclofenac at the WWTPs, from 38% to 98%. We assumed that removal efficiencies of up to 75% can be achieved by upgrading secondary treatment: beyond 75%, tertiary treatment is needed. The scenario analysis showed that achieving diclofenac removal efficiencies corresponding to tertiary treatment results in apparent concentration reductions (statistically significant differences relative to the reference situation), regardless of the level of uncertainty applied to the model parameters. However, upgrades in the secondary treatment resulted in apparent reductions only in the case of reduced uncertainty. We concluded that model uncertainty greatly influences the decisions that river basin authorities must make to reduce the microcontaminant loads released by WWTPs into rivers. In addition, we discussed research priorities to help reduce model uncertainty and thereby make more appropriate decisions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The treated effluent from sewage treatment plants (STP) is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that enter the aquatic environment. Bioaccumulation of 11 selected psychoactive pharmaceuticals (citalopram, clomipramine, haloperidol, hydroxyzine, levomepromazine, mianserin, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, tramadol and venlafaxine) was examined in Zivny Stream (tributary of the Blanice River, the Czech Republic), which is a small stream highly affected by effluent from the Prachatice STP. Six of the 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in grab water samples and in passive samplers. All pharmaceuticals were found in fish exposed to the stream for a defined time. The organs with highest presence of the selected pharmaceuticals were the liver and kidney; whereas only one pharmaceutical (sertraline) was detected in the brain of exposed fish. Fish plasma and muscle samples were not adequate in revealing exposure because the number of hits was much lower than that in the liver or kidney. Using the criterion of a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) >= 500, citalopram, mianserin, mirtazapine and sertraline could be classified as potential bioaccumulative compounds. In combination, data from integrative passive samplers and fish liver or kidney tissue samples were complimentary in detection of target compounds and simultaneously helped to distinguish between bioconcentration and bioaccumulation.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two sonochemical processes were compared for the removal of ibuprofen in different water matrixes (distilled water and effluent from wastewater treatment plant). The effect of various operating parameters, such as pH (2.6-8.0), ultrasound power density (25-100 W/L), sonication frequency (12-862 kHz), addition of radical promoters (H2O2 and Fenton's reagent) or scavengers (n-butanol and acetic acid), was evaluated.
   Sono-degradation of ibuprofen followed a first-order kinetic trend, whose rate constant increased with ultrasound density and frequency. For this hydrophobic and low volatile molecule, a free-radical mechanism at the bubble interface was established. Coupling ultrasound with Fenton reaction showed a positive synergy, especially in terms of mineralization yield, while adding H2O2 alone had no significant beneficial effect. Dedicated experiments proved this synergy to be due to the enhanced regeneration of ferrous ions by ultrasound.
   Efficacy of the sonolysis process was hampered in wastewater matrix, mainly as the consequence of higher pH increasing the molecule solubility. However, after convenient acidification, sono-Fenton oxidation results remained almost unchanged, indicating no significant radical scavenging effects from the effluent compounds.

AB A coagulation-flotation method using an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH], was designed for rapid removal of tetracycline antibiotics from water. The method was conducted by adding electrically equivalent amounts of SDS and PAH followed by feeding air bubbles. The air bubbles vigorously mixed water and induced the coagulation of SDS-PAH complex to from agglutinative coagulum on water surfaces. In the presence of Al(III) ions, tetracycline in water was collected to the coagulum as an hydrophobic ion-pair of the Al(III)-chelate with a dodecyl sulfate ion (m/z = 736). Fluorometric study using a molecular probe, N-phenyl-1naphthylamine, suggested the formation of hydrophobic region in SDS-PAH complex as well as air/water interfaces for the sorption of the hydrophobic ion-pair. Combined use of 20 mg L-1 SDS, 6.5 mg L-1 PAH, and 1 mg L-1 Al(III) ions allowed nearly complete ( > 99%) removal of tetracycline from water within 5 min. SDS concentration remaining in the treated water was 0.12 0.05 mg L-1, being lower than Japanese water regulation (0.2 mg L-1) of total anionic surfactants. Other tetracyclines and fluoroquinolone antibiotics as well as different acidic and basic pharmaceuticals were nearly completely (>96%) removed from water. Applicability to wastewater treatment was examined by using secondary effluents and synthesized hospital wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been extensively reused for various purposes in many regions of the world, including landscape and agricultural irrigation. However, the elimination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in conventional WWTPs is not complete and consequently they may be present in effluent which, can be used for soil irrigation. This work discusses the efficiency of electro based processes, applied to soil slurry aiming PPCPs removal. Three different cell designs were tested, with three-, two-and one-compartment(s) (3C-, 2C- and 1C-cell, respectively). In the case of the 3C- and 2C-cells, ion exchange membranes were used for compartment division. Three PPCPs with different physical and chemical characteristics were studied: bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) and oxybenzone (MBPh). All experiments were carried out for 3 days with a current density of 0.02 mA cm (2). After the electro based experiments, 44%-100% of the three contaminants were removed (mobilized and/or degraded) from the soil slurry. The highest removal rates (> 83%) were achieved for BPA and EE2. BPA and MBPh were mainly mobilized towards an anode compartment, whereas EE2 was mainly degraded. Among all the tested cell designs, 1C-cell showed a broader range to contaminants removal from soil through electrodegradation. The 1C-cell also presents the main advantage of degrading the PPCPs of removing and accumulating them in another compartment, where degradation might not occur. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The degradation of 150 mL of 0.561 mM tetracaine hydrochloride at pH 3.0 by electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2) has been studied at a low current density of 33.3 mA cm(2) in three different matrices: 0.050 M Na2SO4, real urban wastewater and a simulated matrix mimicking its electrolyte composition. Comparative trials were performed in an undivided cell with a 3 cm(2) borondoped diamond (BDD), Pt, IrO2-based or RuO2-based anode and a 3 cm(2) air-diffusion cathode that allowed continuous H2O2 electrogeneration. In 0.050 M Na2SO4, much faster and overall removal of tetracaine occurred using BDD because of the large oxidation ability of BDD((OH)-O-center dot) formed from anodic water oxidation. In either simulated matrix or real wastewater, the RuO2-based anode yielded the quickest tetracaine decay due to a large production of active chlorine from anodic oxidation of Cl . For the mineralization of the organic matter content, the BDD/air-diffusion cell was the best choice in all aqueous matrices, always reaching more than 50% of total organic carbon abatement after 360 min of electrolysis, as expected if BDD((OH)-O-center dot) mineralizes more easily the chloroderivatives formed from tetracaine oxidation in the presence of active chlorine. The initial N of tetracaine was partly transformed into NO3, although the total nitrogen of all solutions always decayed by the release of volatile by-products. In the Cl - containing matrices, significant amounts of ClO3 and ClO4 were obtained using BDD, whereas active chlorine was much largely produced using the RuO2-based anode. Five aromatic by-products, one of them being chlorinated, along with low concentrations of oxalic acid were identified. The change in toxicity during EO-H2O2 with BDD in the sulfate and simulated matrices was also assessed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Octahedral CdS/SnIn4S8 nano-heterojunctions were fabricated by a facile and simple one-step in situ hydrothermal method, and the molar ratio of CdS to SnIn4S8 was optimized. The optimal (0.5:1)CdS/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions exhibit the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with 97.1% degradation efficiency of 2-nitrophenol in 120 min, which is much higher than those of individual CdS and SnIn4S8. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charges originating from the well-matched band gap structures. Of special significance is that (0.5:1)CdS/SnIn4S8 can effectively mineralize 2-nitrophenol and real pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, CdS/SnIn4S8 nano-heterojunctions show excellent reusability in five cycles due to the stable surface composition and chemical valence state. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a microcosm experiment was conducted to merely mimic thermophilic phase in aerobic composting with pig manures in order to explore: (i) the effect of thermophilic phase in composting on the abundances of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs); and (ii) the impacts of the treated manures on the abundances of TRGs in soil. It was found that 4 days of thermophilic process reduced the abundance of TRGs in pig manures by similar to 1 lg unit compared to the samples without treatments, suggesting that other phases in composting may play significant roles in removal of TRGs. Once pig manures with thermophilic treatment were applied to soil, TRGs abundances decreased to the levels in unfertilized soil. With correlation analyses, it was concluded that pig manure derived tetracycline-resistant bacteria (TRB) and nutrients exerted different effects on TRGs abundances in soil. In conclusion, short-term thermophilic treatment cannot remove tetracycline resistance genes in pig manures but exhibits controlling effects on their accumulation and spread in soil. Nutrients enrichment in soil following manuring of treated pig manures, together with a large proportion of gram-positive TRB left in treated pig manures with less risk to TRGs spread, contributed to the controlling effects.

AB Removal efficiencies of sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and its degradation intermediates formed by treatment with zeolite/TiO2 composites through adsorption and photocatalysis were investigated in fresh aquaculture wastewater (FAWW). Coexistent substances in the FAWW showed no inhibitory effects against SMM adsorption. Although coexistent substances in the FAWW inhibited the photocatalytic decomposition of SMM, the composites mitigated the inhibition, possibly because of concentration of SMM on their surface by adsorption. LC/MS/MS analyses revealed that hydroxylation of amino phenyl and pyrimidinyl portions, transformation of the amino group in the amino phenyl portion into a nitroso group, and substitution of the methoxy group with a hydroxyl group occurring in the initial reaction resulted in the formation of various intermediates during the photocatalysis of SMM. All detected intermediates had a ring structure, and almost all intermediates disappeared at the same time SMM was completely decomposed. Ph-OH formed by hydroxylation of the phenyl portion was detected upon decomposition of SMM during photocatalysis. The removal of Ph-OH by the composites proceeded more rapidly than that by TiO2 alone under ultraviolet irradiation. The SMM and Ph-OH were completely degraded by the composites within 30 min, showing that the zeolite/TiO2 composites were effective in removing SMM and its intermediates from FAWW.

AB The occurrence of 25 drug target residues (illicit drugs or pharmaceutically active compounds) was investigated during 85 consecutive days in the influents of a wastewater treatment plant in the Region Centre-Val de Loire, France. This long tracking period allowed a better understanding of the patterns affecting the occurrence of this type of contaminants. Among them, 2 were never detected (i.e. heroin and amphetamine). Concerning illicit drugs two patterns were found. Cocaine and ecstasy median loads varied considerably between weekdays and weekend days (i.e. 18.3 and 35.9% respectively) whereas cannabis and heroin (based on 6-mono-acetylmorphine loads) loads were within the same order of magnitude with a significant statistical correlation with pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen or ketoprofen.
   The consumption of selected drugs was back-calculated from the loads. Among illicit drugs the highest consumption was found for cannabis with a median consumption of 51mg . day(-1) . inhabitant(-1) (inh) whereas the median consumption for cocaine (based on benzoylecgonine loads) and ecstasy was 32 and 6 mg . day(-1) . 10(3) . inh(-1) respectively.
   The highest consumption values of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) were found for acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acidwith 108.8 and 34.1 mg . day(-1) . inh(-1) respectively, in good agreementwith national sales data. A statistically significant weekly pattern was found for several PACs such as metoprolol and trimethoprim, but with the opposite pattern to that of illicit drugs. The variations in daily PAC loads could provide information about themobility of people in the catchment, especially on the basis of daily taken PACs (i.e. to treat chronicle diseases).

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a disinfection oxidant used in many industries including wastewater treatment. beta-Lactams, a group of widely prescribed antibiotics, are frequently detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven beta-lactams (cefalexin (CFX), cefadroxil (CFR), cefapirin (CFP), cephalothin (CFT), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX) and penicillin G (PG)) toward PM were investigated to elucidate the behavior of beta-lactams during PAA oxidation processes. The reaction follows second-order kinetics and is much faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to speciation of PM. Reactivity to PAA follows the order of CFR similar to CFX > AMP similar to AMX > CFT CFP similar to PG and is related to beta-lactam's nucleophilicity. The thioether sulfur of beta-lactams is attacked by PAA to generate sulfoxide products. Presence of the phenylglycinyl amino group on beta-lactams can significantly influence electron distribution and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) location and energy in ways that enhance the reactivity to PM. Reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to accurately model the decay of beta-lactams by PM in surface water matrix and only slightly overestimate the decay in wastewater matrix. Results of this study indicate that the oxidative transformation of beta-lactams by PM can be expected under appropriate wastewater treatment conditions. 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Septic systems may contribute micropollutants to shallow groundwater and surface water. We constructed two in situ conventional drainfields (drip dispersal and gravel trench) and an advanced drain field of septic systems to investigate the fate and transport of micropollutants to shallow groundwater. Unsaturated soil-water and groundwater samples were collected, over 32 sampling events Uanuary 2013 to June 2014), from the drainfields (0.31-1.07 m deep) and piezometers (3.1-3.4 m deep). In addition to soil-water and groundwater, effluent samples collected from the septic tank were also analyzed for 20 selected micropollutants, including wastewater markers, hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), a plasticizer, and their transformation products. The removal efficiencies of micro pollutants from septic tank effluent to groundwater were similar among three septic systems and were 51-89% for sucralose and 53 >99% for other micropollutants. Even with high removal rates within the drainfields, six PPCPs and sucralose with concentrations ranging from <03 to 154 ng/L and 121 to 32,000 ng/L reached shallow groundwater, respectively. The human health risk assessment showed that the risk to human health due to consumption of groundwater is negligible for the micropollutants monitored in the study. A better understanding of ecotoxicological effects of micropollutant mixtures from septic systems to ecosystem and human health is warranted for the long-term sustainability of septic systems.

AB Solid-liquid partitioning is one of the main fate processes determining the removal of micropollutants in wastewater. Little is known on the sorption of micropollutants in biofilms, where molecular diffusion may significantly influence partitioning kinetics. In this study, the diffusion and the sorption of 23 micropollutants were investigated in novel moving bed biofllm reactor (MBBR) carriers with controlled biofllm thickness (50, 200 and 500 gm) using targeted batch experiments (initial concentration = 1 mu g L-1, for X-ray contrast media 15 mu g L-1) and mathematical modelling. We assessed the influence of biofilm thickness and density on the dimensionless effective diffusivity coefficient f (equal to the biofilm-to-aqueous diffusivity ratio) and the distribution coefficient K-d,K-eq (L g(-1)). Sorption was significant only for eight positively charged micropollutants (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, citalopram, venlafaxine, erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin), revealing the importance of electrostatic interactions with solids. Sorption equilibria were likely not reached within the duration of batch experiments (4 h), particularly for the thickest biofllm, requiring the calculation of the distribution coefficient K-d,K-eq based on the approximation of the asymptotic equilibrium concentration (t > 4 h). K-d,K-eq values increased with increasing biofilm thickness for all sorptive micropollutants (except atenolol), possibly due to higher porosity and accessible surface area in the thickest biofilm. Positive correlations between K-d,K-eq and micropollutant properties (polarity and molecular size descriptors) were identified but not for all biofilm thicknesses, thus confirming the challenge of improving predictive sorption models for positively charged compounds. A diffusion-sorption model was developed and calibrated against experimental data, and estimated fvalues also increased with increasing biofllm thickness. This indicates that diffusion in thin biofilms may be strongly limited (f << 0.1) by the high biomass density (reduced porosity). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the limited efficiency of conventional biological treatment, innovative solutions are being explored to improve the removal of trace organic chemicals in wastewater. Controlling biomass exposure to growth substrate represents an appealing option for process optimization, as substrate availability likely impacts microbial activity, hence organic trace chemical removal. This study investigated the elimination of pharmaceuticals in pre-denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), where biofilm exposure to different organic substrate loading and composition was controlled by reactor staging. A three-stage MBBR and a single-stage reference MBBR (with the same operating volume and filling ratio) were operated under continuous-flow conditions (18 months). Two sets of batch experiments (day 100 and 471) were performed to quantify and compare pharmaceutical removal and denitrification kinetics in the different MBBRs. Experimental results revealed the possible influence of retransformation (e.g., from conjugated metabolites) and enantioselectivity on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals. In the second set of experiments, specific trends in denitrification and biotransformation kinetics were observed, with highest and lowest rates/rate constants in the first (S1) and the last (S3) staged sub reactors, respectively. These observations were confirmed by removal efficiency data obtained during continuous-flow operation, with limited removal (<10%) of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and highest removal in S1 within the three-stage MBBR. Notably, biotransformation rate constants obtained for non recalcitrant pharmaceuticals correlated with mean specific denitrification rates, maximum specific growth rates and observed growth yield values. Overall, these findings suggest that: (i) the long-term exposure to tiered substrate accessibility in the three-stage configuration shaped the denitrification and biotransformation capacity of biofilms, with significant reduction under substrate limitation; (ii) biotransformation of pharmaceuticals may have occurred as a result of cometabolism by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria.

AB In this study, the occurrence and fate of 49 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2/O) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for seven consecutive days using 24-h composite sampling technique. Special emphasis was placed to understand the distribution of PPCPs in dissolved and adsorbed phase, and to evaluate PPCP fate in different treatment units. Among the 49 PPCPs, 40 PPCPs in influent, 36 in effluent, 29 in sludge and 23 in suspended solids were detected at least once during sampling. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a stimulant were predominant PPCPs in influent whereas antibiotics were predominant in sludge, effluent and suspended solids. Removal efficiencies from the aqueous phase based on the dissolved PPCPs showed variable contribution in removing different PPCPs under screen and grit chamber, anaerobic treatment, anoxic treatment, oxic treatment and sedimentation-UV treatments, with the highest removal percentage by anaerobic process in terms of both individual and overall treatment. Mass load analysis showed that 352 g PPCPs enter the WWTP daily while 14.5 g and 58.1 g were discharged through effluent and excess sludge to the receiving sea water and soil applications, respectively. Mass balance analysis based on both aqueous and suspended PPCPs showed 280 g (79.4%) mass of influent PPCPs was lost along the wastewater treatment processes, mainly due to degradation/transformation.

AB Tracking sewage wastewater in a large lake is difficult. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals that can be used as indicator compounds are quickly diluted and not easy to measure. In this study, we examined the potential of using medically-derived iodine-131 (I-131, t1/2 = 8.02 d) as a tracer for Milwaukee sewage effluent in Lake Michigan. 131I activities in sewage effluent from two Milwaukee wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were measured in conjunction with 131I activities in water, sediment and biota in the Milwaukee Outer Harbor and Lake Michigan. 131I discharge rates from both WWTPS ranged from 34 +/- 15 to 1807 +/- 24 MBq d(-1), with average and median 131I discharges of 278 and 129 MBq d(-1). A budget of 131I in the Milwaukee Outer Harbor - based on measured sediment and water column inventories - showed that similar to 11% of the 131I discharged to the harbor was scavenged to bottom sediments, similar to 19% decayed in the harbor water column, and similar to 70% was flushed out of the harbor to Lake Michigan. From this budget, we derived a harbor flushing rate of 3.1 days. In Lake Michigan, 131I activity was found in Cladophora algae (undetected to 91 +/- 2 Bq kg(-1)) along similar to 40 km of shoreline. Benthic trawl samples showed 131I activity up to 8 km from shore. Calculated 131I length scales were 30 km alongshore and 3.4 km offshore and corresponded to sewage effluent dispersion rates of similar to 2.6 km d(-1) and similar to 0.3 km d(-1) in along- and offshore directions. Using 131I as a tracer of sewage effluent from other coastal municipalities to the Laurentian Great Lakes appears feasible, particularly for larger (>10(5)) population centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An attempt was made to cohesively assess the aerobic nitrification treatment (ANT) and bioelectrochemical denitrification treatment (DNT) of real-field pharmaceutical wastewater. The ANT resulted in the removal of 73% ammonium and 78.5% organic carbon content. Subsequently, the outlet of ANT reactor was fed to DNT reactor and the relative influence of external circuitry was investigated. The DNT reactor operated with closed circuit mode (CCM) resulted in similar to 83% of nitrates and % similar to 61% of organic content removal even at low C/N ratio of 2.18. The other pollutant concentrations viz., phosphates, sulfates and total dissolved salts were also significantly removed by both ANT and DNT processes. In this study, a sequential integration of both ANT and DNT processes exhibited high potential for self-sustained energy-positive nutrient removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of five benzotriazoles (1H-benzotriazole, BTR; 4-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 4TTR; 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, 5TTR; xylytriazole, XTR and 5-chlorobenzotriazole, CBTR) was studied in batch and continuous-flow Lemna minor systems and the role of different mechanisms on their removal was evaluated. Single and joint toxicity experiments were initially conducted using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) protocol 221 and no inhibition on specific growth rate of Lemna minor was observed for concentrations up to 200 mu g L-1. All tested substances were significantly removed in batch experiments with Lemna minor. Excepting 4TTR, full elimination of CBTR, XTR, 5TTR and BTR was observed up to the end of these experiments (36 d), while the half-life values ranged between 1.6 +/- 0.3 d (CBTR) and 25 +/- 3.6 d (4-TTR). Calculation of kinetic constants for hydrolysis, photodegradation, and plant uptake revealed that for all BTRs the kinetic constants of plant uptake were by far higher comparing to those of the other mechanisms, reaching 0.394 +/- 0.161 d(-1) for CBTR. The operation of a continuous-flow Lemna minor system consisted of three mini ponds and a total hydraulic residence time of 8.3 d showed sufficient removal for most target substances, ranging between 26% (4TTR) and 72% (CBTR). Application of a model for describing micropollutants removal in the examined system showed that plant uptake was the major mechanism governing BTRs removal in Lemna minor systems.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an established approach for quantifying community drug use and has recently been applied to estimate population exposure to contaminants such as pesticides and phthalate plasticizers. A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating the number of people present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31%. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55% in static normalized data. Mobile device-based population activity patterns allow for dynamic normalization that yields much improved temporal and spatial trend analysis.

AB Conventional activated sludge treatment plants have limited capability to remove micropollutants from municipal wastewater, and as a consequence, concentrations of micropollutants in water bodies are increasing. This creates concerns due to their potentially harmful effects on the aquatic environment, as well as needs to improve or replace the traditional wastewater treatment processes with novel process concepts. In this study, two novel process concept alternatives for enhanced removal of micropollutants are examined. The experiments were done in pilot scale with real wastewater of a small municipality. In the first concept, a membrane bioreactor process (MBR) without phosphorus precipitation was combined with high permeability nanofiltration (NF), and in the other, the MBR with the precipitation of phosphorus was combined with advanced oxidation implemented by pulsed corona discharge (PCD). The results showed that the MBR processes were insufficient for removing unreadily biodegradable micropollutants, such as carbamazepine and diclofenac. However, combining the nanofiltration or PCD oxidation step with the MBR enabled significant enhancement in the removal of micropollutants. Over 84% removal was reached with nanofiltration (NF270) for most of the studied micropollutants, except caffeine and hydrochlorothiazide. The performance of PCD oxidation (oxidation energy 0.2 kWhim(3)) in the removal of micropollutants exceeded the one of nanofiltration; over 90% removal of most of the studied micropollutants was reached, and the pollutants were degraded below 0.1 mu g/L concentration. Thus, the total removal of micropollutants was better in the concept combining MBR and oxidation treatment. However, the concept combining MBR and nanofiltration provided better overall removal of organic compounds (removal of COD and DOC > 99%), and it also enabled the recovery of phosphorus as a concentrated solution.

AB Enrofloxacin (ENRO), a fluoroquinolone, was quantified in overflows from an animal lot and residential sewage lagoons and in a receiving-stream (Gans Creek). The concentrations of ENRO in samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In total, ninety samples including duplicates were analyzed during several monthly sampling campaigns. The samples collected represented the residential sewage lagoon overflow (RLO), animal lot lagoon overflow (ALLO), the combined overflows (RLO and ALLO), and Gans Creek (upstream, midstream and downstream positions). The frequency of detection of ENRO was 90% for RLO and 100% for both ALLO and Gans Creek. The highest concentration of ENRO (0.44 mu g/L) was found in ALLO sample collected during high precipitation. ENRO levels found in RLO samples ranged from < LOQ to 259 ng/L and the highest value observed also coincided with high flow. The levels of ENRO found in Gans Creek ranged from 17-216 ng/L. A preliminary ecotoxicological assessment was conducted through calculation of the risk quotients (RQs) for organisms based on the ratio of the measured environmental concentrations in this study to the predicted-no-effect-concentrations (acute and chronic effect) data. From the RQs, high risks were observed for Microcystis aeruginosa (cyanobacteria; RQ = 4.4); Anabaena flosaquae (cyanobacteria; RQ = 1.3); and Lemna minor (aquatic vascular plant; RQ = 2.0). The long-term effects of mixtures of PHCs on Gans Creek watershed are probable.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis in presence of nanoparticles has become a promising pathway for treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical components. In the present research work, degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibacterial drug, has been investigated using TiO2 nanoparticles suspension in the annular photo reactor (APR) under continuous mode having the provision of catalyst recovery. During the degradation of CHD, the effects of major influencing parameters, i.e., substrate to catalyst ratio, flow rate, recycle ratio and temperature on the performance of the photo reactor and its optimization has been performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiency of the reactor has been validated by studying the degradation of other antibiotic drugs i.e. ibuprofen (IBP), atenolol (ATL) and carbamazepine (CBZ). The continuous mode operation in photo reactor has ensured the applicability of the present system in the large volume wastewater treatment. The percentage removal of drugs using such reactor having the facility of catalyst recovery is almost same as compared to typical batch photocatalytic system. Thus, the present developed system can be utilized for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical components which are photo catalytically degradable.

AB Batch experiments were conducted for advanced treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater (after biological treatment) in a series of Fenton-like systems. Fe3O4-H2O2 system had the highest reactivity for COD removal comparing to classic Fenton and Fe-0-H2O2 systems. Effects of crucial experimental factors were investigated, including H2O2 and Fe3O4 dosage, pH, and reaction time. To reach 20% COD removal, the optimal conditions were pH of 3.0, Fe3O4 dosage of 1.0 g/L, and H2O2 dosage of 10 mg/L. Comparing with the classical Fenton's reaction, the Fe3O4-H2O2 system saved 75% H2O2, reduced 47% excess sludge, and slightly improved the COD removal. Furthermore, in order to meet the upcoming new local standard, Fe2+ and Fe-0 were introduced into Fe3O4-H2O2 system to form a hybrid system, Fe3O4/Fe-0/Fe2+-H2O2 (pH of 3.0, Fe3O4 of 1.0 g/L, Fe-0 of 0.23 g/L, Fe2+ of 34 mg/L, and H2O2 of 40 mg/L). Fe-0 and Fe2+ not only improved the COD removal and decreased iron sludge, but also enhanced the reuse of catalysts. Compared to the classic Fenton process, 80% H2O2 dosage was saved and 94% iron sludge was decreased. Meanwhile, the cost decrease by 1.66 RMB/m(3)-wastewater.

AB The increase in population and industrialization has led to increase wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Turkey's pharmaceutical sector has grown by over 30% in the last decade, therefore the levels of estrogenic hormones are also expected to increase in wastewater. When exposed from external sources, estrogenic hormones may cause endocrine disturbance. This paper assesses the levels of 17 beta-estradiol and estrone levels in treatment plants. A total 16 treatment plants and 4 water reservoirs were analysed for 17 beta-estradiol and estrone using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) test method. 17 beta-estradiol and estrone values were detected in the range of 37-382 ng/L and <1-187 ng/L, respectively. Pre-treatment plants had the highest levels estrogenic hormones, while reservoirs had the least levels.

AB Recently widespread usage of cephalosporin antibiotics in medical and veterinary fields has received growing attentions as severe contaminants of aquatic ecosystems. Since there is no report on the removal of cefazolin (CFZ) using electrocoagulation and adsorption (EC/AD) coupling treatment process, the present work deals with efficient removal of CFZ from hospital wastewater using EC/AD process. To achieve the optimal condition, response surface methodology (RSM) was applied successfully with the removal efficiency of 100% under optimal operating condition of 7.8 pH, 15.5 mA cm-2 current density, 60 mg L-1 initial CFZ concentration, 1.0 cm inter-electrode distance, 0.7 g L-1 chitosan dosage and electrolyte dose of 0.07 M NaCl within the equilibrium treatment time of 23 min which is in adequate agreement with the predicted model using analysis of variance. Kinetic and isotherm models were studied to figure out the exact mechanism of the CFZ removal. Kinetic studies revealed that the second-order model (R-2 = 0.9715) best fitted with the experimental results. Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 = 0.9851) predicted the maximum adsorption capacity of 1,250 mg g(-1). The obtained results suggested that charge neutralization of the negatively charged CFZ through binding with cationic hydrolysis products and sweep flocculation as the determinant mechanisms control the adsorption of CFZ molecules on aluminum hydroxide precipitates. Under the optimal condition, electrode consumption and electrical energy consumption were found to be 0.024 g during a single run and 1.251 kWh m(-3), respectively. The predicted treatment model for the synthetic wastewater is in satisfactory agreement with removal efficiency of the hospital wastewater.

AB Excessive use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their release into the water environment have become a major challenge since most of the wastewater treatment options are not equipped to treat these micro-contaminants. Some advanced technologies are reported to be effective for PPCPs treatment in wastewater but cost of those technologies remains as major drawback. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a low-cost technology for wastewater treatment; however, their performance in term of PPCPs removal has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of selected aquatic plants and iron-rich media for removal of PPCPs from wastewater. Four aquatic plants were selected in the preliminary testing, where vetiver was recognized to be the most appropriate plant since it responded well to high dose of PPCPs. The experimental results revealed the increased efficiency of PPCPs removal at a low PPCPs dose. The removal of acetaminophen, amoxicillin and beta-estradiol were found to be 97.5%-98.4%, 73.7%-92.2% and 75.0%-89.2%, respectively.

AB Wastewater discharges introduce antibiotic residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) into surface waters. Both inputs directly affect the streambed resistome, either by exerting a selective pressure that favour the proliferation of resistant phenotypes or by enriching the resident communities with wastewater-associated ARB. Here, we investigated the impact of raw and treated urban wastewater discharges on epilithic (growing on rocks) and epipsammic (growing on sandy substrata) streambed biofilms. The effects were assessed by comparing control and impact sites (i) on the composition of bacterial communities; (ii) on the abundance of twelve antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) encoding resistance to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides and vancomycin, as well as the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intl1); (iii) on the occurrence of wastewater-associated bacteria, including putative pathogens, and their potential linkage to target ARGs. We measured more pronounced effects of raw sewage than treated wastewater at the three studied levels. This effect was especially noticeable in epilithic biofilms, which showed a higher contribution of wastewater-associated bacteria and ARB than in epipsammic biofilms. Comparison of correlation coefficients obtained between the relative abundance of both target ARGs and operational taxonomic units classified as either potential pathogens or nonpathogens yielded significant higher correlations between the former category and genes intl1, sul1, sul2 and ermB. Altogether, these results indicate that wastewater-associated micro-organisms, including potential pathogens, contribute to maintain the streambed resistome and that epilithic biofilms appear as sensitive biosensors of the effect of wastewater pollution in surface waters.

AB Here, we report eggshell membrane (ESM)-derived MgFe2O4 as effective adsorbent for the capture, transfer, and removal of doxycycline (DC) antibiotic and its subsequent recycling for cyclic utilization. The resultant material has meshwork morphology and consists of interconnected and penetrated fibers assembled by MgFe2O4 nanoparticles. The maximal adsorption capacity of ESM-derived MgFe2O4 is about 308 mg g(-1) for DC, and the adsorbed MgFe2O4 can be reused after magnetic separation from water and acid treatment. The strong adsorption ability is attributed to the hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interaction between ESM-derived MgFe2O4 and DC, as well as its porous structure with high surface area.

AB The persistence of antibiotics in sewage wastewater treatment plants in recent years has emerged as a serious issue. This study therefore evaluated three types of natural zeolites (i.e., NZ01, NZ02, and NZ03) for the removal of selected antibiotics namely tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from aqueous solution. The physical and chemical properties of the natural zeolites were characterized using various analytical techniques and the antibiotic removal studies were carried out in a batch adsorption experiment evaluated at various experimental conditions. The highest adsorption capacity was 62.5 and 76.3 mu mol/g for TC and OTC, respectively, observed for NZ02 at pH values between 7 and 8. The adsorption of TC and OTC followed the Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models, respectively, whereas the adsorption kinetic data obeyed the Elovich kinetic model. The regeneration study on NZ02 indicated that it can still remove TC and OTC after five adsorption/desorption cycles. The removal efficiency of TC and OTC also improved from approximately 5-39 and 28%, respectively, by addition of NZ02 during the coagulation/flocculation process. These results thus demonstrated the applicability of the natural zeolites, especially NZ02, for the removal of TC and OTC from aqueous solution; hence the potential for the application in sewage treatment process for removal of antibiotics through either conventional adsorption/desorption or adsorptive coagulation/flocculation (ACF) process.

AB Antibiotics are pharmaceuticals widely consumed and frequently detected in environmental water, where they can induce toxic effects and development of resistant bacteria. Their structural variety makes the problem of antibiotics in natural water more complex. In this work, six highly used antibiotics (at 40 mu mol L-1) belonging to three different classes (penicillins, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones) were treated using an electrochemical system with a Ti/IrO2 anode and a Zr cathode in the presence of NaCl (0.05 mu mol L-1). The attack of electrogenerated active chlorine was found to be the main degradation route. After only 20 min of treatment, the process decreased more than 90% of the initial concentration of antibiotics, following the degradation order: fluoroquinolones > penicillins > cephalosporins. The primary interactions of the degrading agent with fluoroquinolones occurred at the cyclic amine (i.e., piperazyl ring) and the benzene ring. Meanwhile, the cephalosporins and penicillins were initially attacked on the beta-lactam and sulfide groups. However, the tested penicillins presented an additional reaction on the central amide. In all cases, the transformations of antibiotics led to the antimicrobial activity decreasing. On the contrary, the toxicity level showed diverse results: increasing, decreasing, and no change, depending on the antibiotic type. In fact, due to the conservation of quinolone nucleus in the fluoroquinolone by-products, the toxicity of the treated solutions remained unchanged. With penicillins, the production of chloro-phenyl-isoxazole fragments increased the toxicity level of the resultant solution. However, the opening of beta-lactam ring of cephalosporin antibiotics decreased the toxicity level of the treated solutions. Finally, the application of the treatment to synthetic hospital wastewater and seawater containing a representative antibiotic showed that the high amount of chloride ions in seawater accelerates the pollutant degradation. In contrast, the urea and ammonium presence in the hospital wastewater retarded the removal of this pharmaceutical.

AB Gemifloxacin (GEM) is a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic. The presence of GEM residuals in industrial and hospital wastewater has been associated with genotoxicity and antibiotic resistance. In this contribution, the photodegradation of GEM using titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs)/H2O2 as a catalyst was optimized to eliminate residual drug and its photodegradates with antibacterial activity. A half-factorial design was implemented, investigating the effects of pH, initial concentration, H2O2 concentration, TiO2NP loading, and irradiation time. Owing to the time-dependent, multi-transformation of GEM into a wide range of structurally related photodegradation products, the monitoring of GEM throughout the experiments was achieved using both HPLC and potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISE). The sensor enabled in-line tracking of residual GEM in the presence of its photodegradates in real time. Results indicated that the pH, irradiation time, and GEM initial concentration were the most significant factors. At the optimum set of experimental conditions, the reaction followed first-order reaction kinetics with a mean percentage degradation of similar to 95% in less than 30 min of irradiation time and almost complete loss of antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The promising results demonstrated the efficiency of UV/TiO2NP/H2O2 as a photocatalyst for the breakdown of the pharmacophore of fluoroquinolones from water samples. The high selectivity, minimal solvent consumption, and lack of harmful waste generation confirmed the superiority of in-line monitoring using ISE. Optimization and in-line monitoring protocol should be applicable also at the pharmaceutical industry scale to eliminate the risk of antibiotic resistance.

AB This study examined the effects of thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge on biogas production and removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs). Thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening resulted in approximately 15% increase in biogas production. However, the effects of thermal pretreatement and recuperative thickening on anaerobic digestion performance in respect to the removal of TrOCs were less obvious and varied widely depending on the molecular properties of each compound. Of the 40 TrOCs monitored in this study, 16 TrOCs were detected in all primary sludge samples. Removal from the aqueous phase was negligible for most of these 16 TrOCs. Caffeine and paracetamol were the only two TrOCs with a high removal from the aqueous phase. In comparison to the aqueous phase, TrOC removal from the solid phase was considerably higher. Through a mass balance calculation, it was shown that thermal pre-treatment or a combination of thermal pre-treatment and recuperative thickening could enhance the biodegradation of five persistent TrOCs, namely TCEP, verapamil, clozapine, triclosan, and triclocarban by 17-50%.

AB In this work, the feasibility of the CWPO-Photoassisted process for the on-site treatment of real hospital wastewaters has been evaluated using the low-cost mineral ilmenite. The ability of the process for the degradation of pharmaceuticals was firstly demonstrated in both deionized water and hospital wastewater matrices. Although the latter led to slow constant rates due to scavenging effects (0.42 and 0.02 min(-1), respectively), the complete elimination of the pharmaceuticals was reached in both cases operating at 30 degrees C and using 1 g L-1 ilmenite. The complete removal of coliforms in the hospital wastewater was also achieved. The treatment of the hospital wastewater was fairly efficient (TOC conversion above 80% in 5 h reaction time) operating at 50 degrees C with a catalyst load of 1 g L-1 and the stoichiometric amount of H2O2, which was attributed to the combination of both CWPO and photocatalytic reactions. A lumped kinetic model allowed to describe fairly well the evolution of the global parameters viz. TOC and H2O2 along the process where both CWPO and photocatalytic reactions were considered. The unique properties of ilmenite allowed the fast degradation of the organic pollutants by CWPO into hydroxylated species, while further photocatalysis led to the formation of short-chain organic acids and their subsequent mineralization. Finally, the stability of ilmenite was confirmed upon three sequential runs.

AB Verapamil (VRPM) is a kind of pharmaceuticals that widely used over the world and frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants effluents and downstream river waters. VRPM also can be a kind of precursor for carbonaceous (C-) and nitrogenous (N-) disinfection by-products (DBPs) during disinfection in water treatment. The formation of trihalomethanes, dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) from chlorination and chloramination of VRPM was firstly examined and compared in this study. The impacts of chlorine or monochloramine dose, contact time, pH, bromide, chloramination mode, temperature, and preoxidation were evaluated as well. It was found that chloroform (CF) was the major DBPs during chlorination, while N-DBPs became dominant in chloramination.
   The yields of CF, DCAN and TCNM were increased significantly with increasing monochloramine dose. Unlike CF and DCAN, the yield of TCNM increased firstly and then deceased with contact time. The effect of pH on DBPs formation was significant both for chlorination and chloramination of VRPM. Bromide was proposed to play an important role in DBPs formation during disinfection. Compared to ultraviolet/persulfate, ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide was a better pre-oxidation to not only efficiently oxidize VRPM, but also significantly reduce DBPs formation.

AB In this research, the degradation by heterogeneous photocatalysis of organic pharmaceutical waste compounds using TiO2 nanoparticles immobilized on polymeric commercial hollow fiber (HF) ultrafiltration membranes was studied. Three immobilization methods that were tested; spray-, vacuum-and sol-gel-coating. The latter was found most successful as it didn't compromise the permeability of the membrane as much as the other two methods. The sol-gel coated membranes were characterized by multiple analytical techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The compatibility of the membrane components with the aqueous feed containing pharmaceutical waste compounds was confirmed using the Hansen solubility parameters. The effectiveness of TiO2-coated membranes was then assessed in the degradation studies of two organic compounds; Methylene Blue (MB) and Chlorhexidine Digluconate (CHD), serving as the model and the target pharmaceutical compound, respectively. Spray and vacuum coating were unsuccessful in obtaining a stable TiO2 coated membranes, whereas sol-gel coating yielded a stable TiO2 layer and hence was chosen for further optimization. The immobilization of TiO2 was confirmed by SEM images and Raman spectra. Degradation of more than 30 and 40% of MB and CHD, respectively, was achieved under filtration conditions with simulated solar light radiation.

AB Knowledge on the functional characteristics and temporal variation of anaerobic bacterial populations is important for better understanding of the microbial process of two-stage anaerobic reactors. However, owing to the high diversity of anaerobic bacteria, close attention should be prioritized to the frequently abundant bacteria that were defined as core bacteria and putatively functionally important. In this study, using MiSeq sequencing technology, the core bacterial community of 98 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was determined in a two-stage upflow blanket filter reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater. The core bacterial community accounted for 61.66% of the total sequences and accurately predicted the sample location in the principal coordinates analysis scatter plot as the total bacterial OTUs did. The core bacterial community in the first-stage (FS) and second-stage (SS) reactors were generally distinct, in that the FS core bacterial community was indicated to be more related to a higher-level fermentation process, and the SS core bacterial community contained more microbes in syntrophic cooperation with methanogens. Moreover, the different responses of the FS and SS core bacterial communities to the temperature shock and influent disturbance caused by solid contamination were fully investigated. Co-occurring analysis at the Order level implied that Bacteroidales, Selenomonadales, Anaerolineales, Syneristales, and Thermotogales might play key roles in anaerobic digestion due to their high abundance and tight correlation with other microbes. These findings advance our knowledge about the core bacterial community and its temporal variability for future comparative research and improvement of the two-stage anaerobic system operation.

AB The manufacturing of the antiepileptics, carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (oxCBZ), results in generation of wastewater containing these micropollutants which exhibit toxicity even at trace levels. Therefore, we focused on monitoring their fate and removal in various units of a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using mass balance approach. An apparent CBZ removal of 50 +/- 3% was observed by conventional activated sludge process in the biological treatment unit, whereas oxCBZ still persisted after the biological treatment and showed negative mass balance. However, reverse osmosis resulted in 91% oxCBZ removal, whereas CBZ still continued to persist as a result of lower solubility of CBZ as compared to oxCBZ. Only 3% CBZ exhibited sorption onto the suspended solids and sludge, which was negligible for oxCBZ, thus demonstrating their tendency to remain in aqueous phase. Additionally, we attempted to understand the fundamental mechanism behind the removal of these pharmaceuticals and it was apparently the collective effect of sorption, mineralization, biotransformation, biodegradation, phototransformation/photodegradation, etc. Thus, the integrative data presented in the present study on productivity of these pharmaceuticals, their mass loading in influent and effluents allied with their removal efficiency will be significantly constructive in benchmarking the operational effectiveness through operational optimization and design improvement of the current conventional treatment plant.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate thermal and physicochemical parameters of sewage sludge palm waste mixtures contaminated by different families of antibiotics (tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) during co-composting. Sludge was spiked with chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), roxithromycin (RXY), enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Antibiotics were spiked at a low level, medium level, high level and a control without antibiotics was conducted. The results showed that the organic matter degradation was delayed and the carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratio was affected by an increase of the antibiotics concentration. The presence of antibiotics, especially at high level, delayed the coming of the temperature maxima, and disturbed the thermophilic phase. The calorific model showed that the heat release is affected during the thermophilic phase when high antibiotics concentrations were used. In addition, the microbiological approach showed that the adsorption of antibiotics on the rachis could be probably responsible of the fungi inhibition especially during the maturation phase. Therefore, the medium and high levels of antibiotics affected the thermal, physical and chemical parameters as well as the compost quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The electrochemical oxidation (ECO) of carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, has been carried out in this study. A response surface methodology approach (RSM) was used in order to optimize the treatment process for CBZ removal on synthetic effluent. Four different operating parameters (current intensity, treatment time, recycling flow rate, and anode type) were chosen as key factors while a single response (CBZ removal) was considered. In the first part of the study, a factorial design (FD) methodology was carried out in order to evaluate the effects and interactions between the selected factors. Results showed that anode type is the most important parameters affecting CBZ degradation (with 67% of the overall effect) followed by the treatment time, the current intensity, and then the recirculation flow rate. Subsequently, a central composite design (CCD) was conducted in order to optimize the overall process taking into account efficiency (CBZ removal) and energy consumption. The contribution of direct and indirect effects of CBZ electro-oxidation was also investigated. As expected, direct oxidation was the most dominant mechanism during ECO with approximately 66% whereas indirect oxidation contributed with only 12%. Finally, the determined optimal conditions were applied on real pharmaceutical wastewater. Despite the effect matrix, 84% of CBZ was obtained after only 100 min of treatment with 23% of mineralization. Finally, CBZ by-products such as salicylic acid, catechol, and anthranilic have been detected during the oxidation process.

AB This study demonstrates continuous enantiomeric inversion and further biotransformation of chiral profens including ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen by an enzymatic membrane bioreactor (EMBR) dosed with laccase. The EMBR showed non-enantioselective transformations, with high and consistent transformation of both (R)-and (S)-ibuprofen (93 +/- 6%, n = 10), but lower removals of both enantiomers of naproxen (46 +/- 16%, n = 10) and ketoprofen (48 +/- 17%, n = 10). Enantiomeric analysis revealed a bidirectional but uneven inversion of the profens, for example 14% inversion of (R)- to (S)- compared to 4% from (S)-to (R)-naproxen. With redox-mediator addition, the enzymatic chiral inversion of both (R)-and (S)-profens remained unchanged, although the overall conversion became enantioselective; except for (S)-naproxen, the addition of redox mediator promoted the degradation of (R)-profens only.

AB The antibiotic contaminants from drug abuse, aquaculture wastewater and pharmaceutical industry effluent have enormous threat to microecology and human beings. In this paper, a porous hexagonal boron nitride (p-BN), which has high surface area up to 1062.88 m(2) g(-1) and abundant pore structure, was prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR and physical-chemical isothermal adsorption. A systematical and comprehensive study of the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics and isotherms of tetracycline (TC) on p-BN has been completed. Meanwhile, the effects of pH, temperature and salinity were also considered. It still had a rapidly adsorption rate and effective removal percentage (94.25%) to TC at high concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity can achieve to 322.16 mg g(-1) at the concentration of 160 mg L-1. Pseudo-second-order model and intra-particle diffusion model correlate with the experiment data better, the molecular diffusion of TC in the p-BN micropores is the rate-limiting step. Adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic due to the thermodynamic calculation, lower temperatures is favorable to the adsorption process. Salting out effect made the adsorption capacity increases with the added Na+ ion. The adsorption isotherms were more accordant with the Freundlich and Tempkin model. The adsorption mechanisms were mainly pi-pi interaction and electrostatic force. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic micro pollutants can be removed from water by ozonation. In this article we studied the performance of ozonation under real life conditions and compared results of the same ozonation pilot plant installed at different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) thus operating with different waters. The comparability of the removal and reaction rate constants from one waste water treatment plant were low in respect to reaction rate, removal as well as to response to the specific ozone dose. Neither pH-value nor residual nitrite concentrations were the driving force considering these differences. Further tests with different loadings were conducted at the same WWTP under different weather conditions. For the different hydraulic loading of the biological plant, the ozonation was running with rather similar removal rates concerning the same specific (TOC normalized) ozone dose. The compounds that were removed quantitatively under dry weather were still removed well with three times dry weather flow. Using a dataset from one WWTP to optimize operation in another one is thus questionable. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment may pose a potential risk for humans and ecosystems. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are recognized as one of the main sources of these chemicals into both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The objectives of the study were to determine the presence of a wide variety of PhACs (n = 45) in sewage-impacted sediments and soils from the Guadalete River basin (SW Spain) by developing and applying an environmentally friendly multi-residue method based on pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE). Different parameters were optimized, including extraction temperature, pH, solvents, and clean-up. Extraction recoveries were analyte dependent, varying between 50% and 140% for most of the analytes when using pure water as extraction solvent at 100 degrees C. Determination of PhACs was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), enabling method detection (mLODs) and quantification (mLOQs) limits between <0.01 and 0.83 ng g(-1) and from 0.02 to 2.75 ng g(-1), respectively. Regarding the sampling area, 14 out of 45 target compounds were detected in soils and sediments. Analgesicianti-inflammatories was the therapeutic group most commonly detected, reaching concentrations up to 20 ng g(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human presence in the Antarctic is increasing due to research activities and the rise in tourism. These activities contribute a number of potentially hazardous substances. The aim of this study is to conduct the first characterisation of the pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs present in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, and to assess the potential environmental risk they pose to the environment. The study consisted of a single sampling of ten water samples from different sources, including streams, ponds, glacier drains, and a wastewater discharge into the sea. Twenty-five selected pharmaceuticals and 21 recreational drugs were analysed. The highest concentrations were found for the analgesics acetaminophen (48.74 mu g L-1), diclofenac (15.09 mu g L-1) and ibuprofen (10.05 mu g L-1), and for the stimulant caffeine (71.33 mu g L-1). All these substances were detected in waters that were discharged directly into the ocean without any prior purification processes. The hazard quotient (HQ) values for ibuprofen, diclofenac and acetaminophen were far in excess of 10 at several sampling points. The concentrations of each substance measured and used as measured environmental concentration values for the HQ calculations are based on a one-time sampling. The Toxic Unit values indicate that analgesics and anti-inflammatories are the therapeutic group responsible for the highest toxic burden.
   This study is the first to analyse a wide range of substances and to determine the presence of pharmaceuticals and psychotropic drugs in the Antarctic Peninsula region. We believe it can serve as a starting point to focus attention on the need for continued environmental monitoring of these substances in the water cycle, especially in protected regions such as the Antarctic. This will determine whether pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs are hazardous to the environment and, if so, can be used as the basis for risk-assessment studies to prioritise the exposure to risk.

AB Pollution by chemical substances is of concern for the maintenance of healthy and sustainable aquatic environments. While the occurrence and fate of numerous emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceuticals, is well documented in freshwater, their occurrence and behavior in coastal and marine waters is much less studied and understood. This study investigates the occurrence of 58 chemicals in the open surface water of the Western Mediterranean Sea for the first time. 70 samples in total were collected in 10 different sampling areas. 3 pesticides, 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 2 artificial sweeteners were detected at sub-ng to ng/L levels. Among them, the herbicide terbuthylazine, the pharmaceuticals caffeine, carbamazepine, naproxen and paracetamol, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the antibacterial triclocarban and the two artificial sweeteners acesulfame and saccharin were detected in all samples. The compound detected at the highest concentration was saccharin (up to 5.23 ng/L). Generally small spatial differences among individual sampling areas point to a diffuse character of sources which are likely dominated by WWTP effluents and runoffs from agricultural areas or even, at least for pharmaceuticals and artificial food additives, from offshore sources such as ferries and cruising ships. The implications of the ubiquitous presence in the open sea of chemicals that are bioactive or toxic at low doses on photosynthetic organisms and/or bacteria (i.e., terbuthylazine, sulfamethoxazole or triclocarban) deserve scientific attention, especially concerning possible subtle impacts from chronic exposure of pelagic microorganisms.

AB Prioritization methodologies are often used for identifying those pharmaceuticals that pose the greatest risk to the natural environment and to focus laboratory testing or environmental monitoring toward pharmaceuticals of greatest concern. Risk-based prioritization approaches, employing models to derive exposure concentrations, are commonly used, but the reliability of these models is unclear. The present study evaluated the accuracy of exposure models commonly used for pharmaceutical prioritization. Targeted monitoring was conducted for 95 pharmaceuticals in the Rivers Foss and Ouse in the City of York (UK). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) ranges were estimated based on localized prescription, hydrological data, reported metabolism, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) removal rates, and were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). For the River Foss, PECs, obtained using highest metabolism and lowest WWTP removal, were similar to MECs. In contrast, this trend was not observed for the River Ouse, possibly because of pharmaceutical inputs unaccounted for by our modeling. Pharmaceuticals were ranked by risk based on either MECs or PECs. With 2 exceptions (dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine), risk ranking based on both MECs and PECs produced similar results in the River Foss. Overall, these findings indicate that PECs may well be appropriate for prioritization of pharmaceuticals in the environment when robust and local data on the system of interest are available and reflective of most source inputs.

AB CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microsphere with excellent and stable photocatalytic activity for degradation tetracyclines was successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal route. The photocatalytic experiments indicated that CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microspheres exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to pure Bi2WO6 in both the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. The 1CeO(2)/2Bi(2)WO(6) exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for degradation of TCH, reaching 91% after 60 min reaction. The results suggested that the particular morphological conformation of the microspheres resulted in smaller size and more uniform morphology so as to increase the specific surface area. Meanwhile, the heterojunction was formed by coupling CeO2 and Bi2WO6 in the as-prepared microspheres, so that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes was dramatically improved and the lifetimes of charge carriers were prolonged. Hence, introduction of CeO2 could significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of CeO2/Bi2WO6 heterostructured microspheres and facilitate the degradation of TCH. This work provided not only a principle method to synthesize CeO2/Bi2WO6 with the excellent photocatalytic performance for actual produce, but also a excellent property of the photocatalyst for potential application in photocatalytic treatment of tetracyclines wastewater from pharmaceutical factory.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) represent a large group of micropollutants in wastewaters (WW) worldwide. Many PCs are resistant to conventional WW treatment. Moreover, for some PCs the removal process is reversible. The aim of this study was to test three newly developed ceramic carriers for biofilm formation and PCs removal. The testing of untreated WW samples by liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry allowed to detect the occurrence of 18 PCs in the range from 26 ng/L to 20,688 ng/L, with the highest concentrations found for caffeine. Besides, among PCs with concentrations above 1,000 ng/L, ibuprofen (19,234 ng/L), naproxen (1,405 ng/L), xylazine (1,366 ng/L), and diclofenac (1,311 ng/L) were found. Two aliquots of municipal WW were treated on laboratory scale by contacting with the filtering medium for 2 h and 7 days. The majority of PCs detected in WW were removed more effectively during the first 2h when using filtering media coated with a previously developed biofilm derived from activated sludge. The removal of PCs from the second portion of WW by the biofilm-coated filtering media over 7 days was comparable to the results obtained over 2 h. Particular attention was paid to the reversible occurrence of some PCs in WW. Thus, a higher number of PCs with negative removal yield was observed when using filtering media without biofilm, as compared to the biofilm-coated media, namely, losartan, ketoprofen, valsartan, atorvastatin, and naproxen. However, sulfamethoxazole showed an increased concentration in WW after 7 days in contact with biofilm-coated media. An increase of diclofenac in WW after 7 days incubation was detected regardless of the presence of biofilm. One of three ceramic materials tested, i.e., oxide ceramics sintered at 1700 degrees C from alumina, kaolin, and silica demonstrated the best results in terms of minimizing the reversible occurrence of PCs in WW (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Environmental antiandrogenic (AA) contaminants in effluents from wastewater treatment plants have the potential for negative impacts on wildlife and human health. The aim of our study was to identify chemical contaminants with likely AA activity in the biological effluents and evaluate the removal of these antiandrogens (AAs) during advanced treatment comprising adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC). In this study, profiling of AA contaminants in biological effluents and tertiary effluents was conducted using effect-directed analysis (EDA) including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation, a recombinant yeast screen containing androgen receptor (YAS), in combination with mass spectrometry analyses. Analysis of a wastewater secondary effluent from a membrane bioreactor revealed complex profiles of AA activity comprising 14 HPLC fractions and simpler profiles of GAC effluents with only 2 to 4 moderately polar HPLC fractions depending on GAC treatment conditions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-nanospray mass spectrometry analyses of AA fractions in the secondary effluent resulted in detection of over 10 chemical contaminants, which showed inhibition of YAS activity and were potential AAs. The putative AAs included biocides, food additives, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals and industrial contaminants. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the AA properties of N-ethyl-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WS3), cetirizine, and oxcarbazepine are reported. The EDA used in this study was proven to be a powerful tool to identify novel chemical structures with AA activity in the complex aquatic environment. The adsorption process to GAC of all the identified antiandrogens, except WS3 and triclosan, fit well with the pseudo-second order kinetics models. Adsorption to GAC could further remove most of the AAs identified in the biological effluents with high efficiencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, three penicillins (ampicillin "AMP", oxacillin "OXA" and cloxacillin "CLO"), two cephalosporins (cephalexin "CPX" and cephadroxyl "CPD") and three fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin "LEV", norfloxacin "NOR" and ciprofloxacin "CIP") were initially treated by UV254 and persulfate activated by UV254 (UV/PS). Significant differences in degradation kinetics under UV254 irradiation were found. Photodegradation followed the order: OXA > CPX > CPD > CLO > CIP > NOR > AMP >> LEV. Then, in order to study the participation of direct photolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photo degradation a model antibiotic of each class (OXA, CPX and CIP) was considered. OXA and CPX were mainly degraded by direct photolysis, whereas the CIP removal involved ROS and photolysis. On the other hand, the persulfate addition (UV/PS process) improved the removals due to sulfate radical formation, especially, in the case of antibiotics with lower photodegradation levels (i.e. LEV, AMP and NOR). Computational calculations on the representative antibiotics were applied to determine the regions susceptible to electrophilic attacks by degrading agents. The functional groups of OXA and CPX followed the reactivity order: thioether >> 0-lactam ring > benzene ring. For CIP, the piperazyl moiety presented higher reactivity than the quinolone ring. Also, the antimicrobial activity (AA) evolution during the treatments was tested. In the cases of CPX and CIP, both UV254 and UV/PS removed the AA; which were associated with structural changes in their reactive moieties: beta-lactam ring and piperazyl ring, respectively. However, in the case of OXA only the UV/PS system decreased AA, which was attributed to transformations in its penicillin electron-rich nucleus (thioether + 0-lactam). Finally, the applicability of UV254 and UV/PS was assessed using synthetic hospital wastewater (HWW). The processes comparison showed that for practical purposes, OXA and CIP in HWW should be treated by UV/PS, while CPX in HWW could be treated by both UV254 and UV/PS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Iopromide is frequently detected in water bodies due to its widespread use as an X-ray contrast agent in medicine. Due to its rapid clearance from the human body and its incomplete removal by wastewater treatment, an elevation of its concentration in the environment is observed that might lead to a serious impact on human and environmental health. Alternative or additional removal technologies may be more effective to remove iopromide from the effluents of wastewater treatment facilities, like phytoremediation with aquatic macrophytes. To test this, a hydroponic experiment was carried out to assess the fate of iopromide in Typha latifolia. The transformation products (TPs) in the plant were investigated to predict possible transformation mechanisms. The removal process followed first order kinetics with a linear regression R-2 value of 0.983. The iopromide concentration in roots and rhizomes reached a maximum value of 20.70 +/- 0.81 and 16.82 +/- 1.78 nmol g(-1) on the 7th day, respectively, thereafter decreased until the end of experiment. A different result was found in leaves, where iopromide concentration decreased over the whole experimental period. A total of eight transformation products were detected in T. latifolia, including 23 isomers. The relative content of aldehyde and ketone TPs decreased in roots and rhizomes while the relative content of carboxylic TPs increased. However, the relative content of aldehyde and ketone TPs only showed a slight decrease in leaves while the relative content of carboxylic TPs remained stable during the experimental period. In addition, a significant increase of decarboxylated TPs was found in leaves, but not in roots and rhizomes. These results indicate that a difference in transformation mechanisms exists among plant tissues. The findings of this study are important to better understand the transformation mechanisms of iopromide in plants and to improve phytoremediation technologies for such kind of compounds.

TI Modeling in-sewer transformations at catchment scale - implications on

AB To which extent illicit drugs are transformed during in-sewer transport, depends on a number of factors: i) substance-specific transformation rates, ii) environmental conditions, iii) point of discharge (location of drug user) and iv) sewer network properties, primarily hydraulic residence time (HRT) and the ratio of biofilm contact area to wastewater volume (A/V-eq).
   Assessing associated uncertainties typically requires numerous simulations. Therefore, we propose a new two-step modeling framework: 1) Quantify hydrodynamic conditions. This computationally demanding step was performed once in SWMM to derive HRT and A/V-eq for each potential point of discharge (node) in three catchments of different size. 2) Estimate biomarker loss. In this step, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for defined scenarios. Depending on assumptions about drug user distribution and prevalence, a number of nodes was sampled. For each node an empirical first-order transformation model was applied with flow-path-corresponding HRT and A/V-eq from step 1. Biotic and abiotic transformation rates were sampled from distributions combining variability of different biofilms.
   In our modeling study, median losses were >30% for amphetamine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and 6-acetylcodeine in all three catchments with high uncertainty (5%-100% loss), which would imply a systematic underestimation of consumption when neglecting in-sewer processes. Median losses for 21 other investigated biomarkers were <10% with different uncertainty ranges - "no substantial transformation" was confirmed for nine substances in a real sewer segment with a 2-h residence time. Transferability of these results must be tested for other catchments. To further reduce uncertainty, mainly additional knowledge on transformation rates, particularly in biofilm, and their distribution across a sewer network is needed to update model input objectively. Our approach allows efficient testing and, furthermore, can be expanded for many other human biomarkers. Accounting for biomarker stability during in-sewer transport will avoid biased estimates and further improve wastewater-based epidemiology. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Venlafaxine is an antidepressant drug that has been detected in municipal wastewater effluents at low pg/L. concentrations. To assess the potential of this compound to affect the survival, development and reproductive capacity of fish, we exposed fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) over a full lifecycle in a flow-through system to nominal venlafaxine concentrations of 0.88, 8.8, and 88 mu g/L. Mean measured venlafaxine concentrations in these treatments were 1.0, 93 and 75 mu g/L. During the 167-168 d exposure, no significant changes were observed in survival, or the weights and lengths of fathead minnows. At maturity, there were no significant differences relative to controls in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in the venlafaxine exposed male or female fish. Fathead minnows from the highest venlafaxine treatment (i.e. 88 mu g/L) produced 46% more eggs per female than control fish (p = 0.031). Egg quality, % fertilization, % hatching, and % deformities in Fl fry were unaffected by exposure of the parent fish to venlafaxine at any of the test concentrations. Venlafaxine exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 0.88 and 8.8 mu g/L.) caused no adverse effects in fathead minnows. This study is the first to assess the potential for effects in fish exposed to the antidepressant venlafaxine over a full lifecycle. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB For reducing organic micropollutants (MP) in municipal wastewater effluents, granular activated carbon (GAC) has been tested in various studies. We did systematic literature research and found 44 studies dealing with the adsorption of MPs (carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole) from municipal wastewater on GAC in pilot- and large-scale plants. Within our meta-analysis we plot the bed volumes (BV [m(water)(3)/m(GAc)(3)]) until the breakthrough criterion of MP-BV20% was reached, dependent on potential relevant parameters (empty bed contact time EBCT, influent DOC DOC0 and manufacturing method). Moreover, we performed statistical tests (ANOVA5) to check the results for significance. Single adsorbers operating time differs i.e. by 2500% until breakthrough of diclofenac-BV20% was reached (800-20,000 BV). There was still elimination of the "very well/well" adsorbable MPs such as carbamazepine and diclofenac even when the equilibrium of DOC had already been reached. No strong statistical significance of EBCT and DOC0 on MP-BV20% could be found due to lack of data and the high heterogeneity of the studies using GAC of different qualities. In further studies, adsorbers should be operated >> 20,000 BV for exact calculation of breakthrough curves, and the following parameters should be recorded: selected MPs; DOC0; UVA(254); EBCT; product name, manufacturing method and raw material of GAC; suspended solids (TSS); backwash interval; backwash program and pressure drop within adsorber. Based on our investigations we generally recommend using reactivated GAC to reduce the environmental impact and to carry out tests on pilot scale to collect reliable data for process design.

AB In order to investigate long-term effect of cefalexin (CFX) on the performance of expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) system and microbial community structure, two 1.47 L EGSB reactors E1 and E2 were designed and run for 224 days treating with synthetic antibiotic wastewater. For the purpose of comparison, E1 was fed with synthetic antibiotic industry wastewater with CFX added as the test reactor, while, E2 was fed without any CFX added as the control reactor (E2). The addition of CFX resulted in the continual increasing of soluble COD (sCOD) and accumulation of VFAs in the effluent of E1 system. Besides, it was found that the accumulation of CFX by-products D-1, D-2 and D-3 was negative correlation with sCOD removal efficiency. Furthermore, the microbial community structures were also investigated. For the bacterial community, Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus which can ferment propionate and other organic pollutants as their substrate were obviously enriched in E1 system. For the archaea, there was more functional diversity in E1 system than in E2 system. Furthermore, fungi also played an important role on the removal of complex organics in E1 system.

AB Anticancer drugs, used in chemotherapy, have emerged as new water contaminants due to their increasing consumption trends and poor elimination efficiency in conventional water treatment processes. As a result, anticancer drugs have been reported in surface and even drinking waters, posing the environment and human health at risk. However, the occurrence and distribution of anticancer drugs depend on the area studied and the hydrological dynamics, which determine the risk towards the environment.
   The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the risk of anticancer drugs in Portugal. This work includes an extensive analysis of the consumption trends of 171 anticancer drugs, sold or dispensed in Portugal between 2007 and 2015. The consumption data was processed aiming at the estimation of predicted environmental loads of anticancer drugs and 11 compounds were identified as potentially priority drugs based on an exposure-based approach (PECb> 10 ng L-1 and/or PECc> 1 ng L-1). In a national perspective, mycophenolic acid and mycophenolate mofetil are suspected to pose high risk to aquatic biota. Moderate and low risk was also associated to cyclophosphamide and bicalutamide exposition, respectively. Although no evidences of risk exist yet for the other anticancer drugs, concerns may be associated with long term effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human activities introduce a variety of chemicals to the Laurentian Great Lakes including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, plasticizers, and solvents (collectively referred to as contaminants of emerging concern or CECs) potentially threatening the vitality of these valuable ecosystems. We conducted a basin-wide study to identify the presence of CECs and other chemicals of interest in 12 U.S. tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes during 2013 and 2014. A total of 292 surface-water and 80 sediment samples were collected and analyzed for approximately 200 chemicals. A total of 32 and 28 chemicals were detected in at least 30% of water and sediment samples, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 0.0284 (indole) to 72.2 (cholesterol) mu g/L in water and 1.75 (diphenhydramine) to 20,800 mu g/kg (fluoranthene) in sediment. Cluster analyses revealed chemicals that frequently co-occurred such as pharmaceuticals and flame retardants at sites receiving similar inputs such as wastewater treatment plant effluent. Comparison of environmental concentrations to water and sediment-quality benchmarks revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations often exceeded benchmarks in both water and sediment. Additionally, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dichlorvos concentrations exceeded water-quality benchmarks in several rivers. Results from this study can be used to understand organism exposure, prioritize river basins for future management efforts, and guide detailed assessments of factors influencing transport and fate of CECs in the Great Lakes Basin.

AB In-sewer transformation of drug biomarkers (excreted parent drugs and metabolites) can be influenced by the presence of biomass in suspended form as well as attached to sewer walls (biofilms). Biofilms are likely the most abundant and biologically active biomass fraction in sewers. In this study, 16 drug biomarkers were selected, including the parent forms and the major human metabolites of mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Transformation and sorption of these substances were assessed in targeted batch experiments using laboratory-scale biofilm reactors operated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A one-dimensional model was developed to simulate diffusive transport, abiotic and biotic transformation, and partitioning of drug biomarkers. Model calibration to experimental results allowed estimating biotransformation rate constants in sewer biofilms, which were compared to those obtained for suspended biomass. Our results suggest that sewer biofilms can enhance the biotransformation compounds. Through scenario simulations, we demonstrated that the estimation of biotransformation rate constants in biofilm can be significantly biased if the boundary layer thickness is not accurately estimated. This study complements our previous investigation on the transformation and sorption of drug biomarkers in the presence of only suspended biomass in untreated sewage. A better understanding of the role of sewer biofilms also relative to the in-sewer suspended solids and improved prediction of associated fate processes can result in more accurate estimation of daily drug consumption in urban areas in wastewater-based epidemiological assessments.

AB The continuous release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into freshwater systems impacts the health of aquatic organisms. This study evaluates the concentrations and bioaccumulation of PPCPs and the selective uptake of antidepressants in fish from the Niagara River, which connects two of the North American Great lakes (Erie and Ontario). The Niagara River receives PPCPs from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) situated along the river and Lake Erie. Of the 22 targeted PPCPs, 11 were found at part-per-billion levels in WWTP effluents and at part per-trillion levels in river water samples. The major pollutants observed were the antidepressants (citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion, and their metabolites norfluoxetine and norsertraline) and the antihistamine diphenhydramine. These PPCPs accumulate in various fish organs, with norsertraline exhibiting the highest bioaccumulation factor (up to about 3000) in the liver of rudd (Scardinius elythrophthalmus), which is an invasive species to the Great Lakes. The antidepressants were selectively taken up by various fish species at different trophic levels, and were further metabolized once inside the organism. The highest bioaccumulation was found in the brain, followed by liver, muscle, and gonads, and can be attributed to direct exposure to WWTP effluent.

AB Considerable interest has been given to using nanofiltration (NF) in lieu of reverse osmosis for water reclamation schemes due to lower energy consumption, higher flux rates while ensuring good micropollutants rejection. The application NF results in the generation of a large concentrated waste stream. Treatment of the concentrate is a major hurdle for the implementation of membrane technologies since the concentrate is usually unusable due to a large pollutants content. This work focuses on the application of ozonation as pretreatment of urban NF concentrates, the generation of transformation products and their relative toxicity. Three pharmaceutical micropollutants largely encountered in water cycle were selected as target molecules: acetaminophen, carbamazepine and atenolol. Through accurate-mass Q-TOF LC-MS/MS analyses, more than twenty ozonation products were detected, structure proposals and formation pathways were elaborated. Attempts were made to understand the correlation between the transformation products and acute toxicity on Vibrio fischeri strain. It is the first time that an integrated study reported on the ozonation of pharmaceuticals in urban membrane concentrates, in terms of transformation products, kinetics, degradation mechanisms, as well as toxicity assessment.

AB A passive sampling device, the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS), was calibrated in-situ over a 4-week period in Oslo (Norway) for 10 illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals with the goal of developing an approach for monitoring long-term wastewater drug loads. The calibrations were performed in triplicate using three different overlapping calibration sets under changing environmental conditions that allowed the uncertainty of the sampling rates to be evaluated. All 10 compounds exhibited linear uptake kinetics and provided sampling rates of between 0.023 and 0.192 L d(-1). POCIS were deployed for consecutive 2-week periods during 2012 and 2013 and the calculated time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations used to define different drug use trends. The relative uncertainty related to the POCIS data was approximately 40% and, except for citalopram, 85% of all the long-term measurements of pharmaceuticals were within the confidence interval levels calculated to evaluate the effects of changing environmental conditions on the TWA estimations. POCIS was demonstrated to be sufficiently robust to provide reliable annual drug use estimates with a smaller number of samplers (n = 24) than recommended for active sampling (n = 56) within an acceptable level of sample size related uncertainty < 10%. POCIS is demonstrated to be a valuable and reliable tool for the long-term monitoring of certain drugs and pharmaceuticals within a defined population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Olive processing wastewaters (OPW), namely olive mill wastewater (OMW) and table-olive wastewaters (TOW) were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against five Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria using the standard disc diffusion and thin layer chromatography (TLC)-bioautography assays. Disc diffusion screening and bioautography of OMW were compared to the phenolic extracts of table-olive brines. Positive activity against S. aureus was demonstrated. The optimization of chromatographic separation revealed that hexane/acetone in the ratio of 4: 6 was the most effective for phenolic compounds separation. A HPLC-MS analysis was performed showing that only two compounds, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the predominant phenolic compounds in all OPW. The phenolic extract of OMW generated by a semi-modern process showed the highest free radical-scavenging activity (DPPH assay) compared to the other phenolic extracts. It is apparent from the present study that OPW are a rich source of antioxidants suitable for use in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.

AB Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a widely used antibiotic that has been frequently found in the aquatic environment. The potential reactions and kinetics of OTC degradation by chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were studied in laboratory scale. The feasibility of a combined process of ClO2 oxidation and biological activated carbon (BAC) treating real OTC wastewater from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant was also investigated. Experimental results show that OTC reacts stoichiometrically with ClO2 and the highest OTC removal rate was 98.3% at pH 2 and ClO2/OTC ratio 1.5:1. The reaction between OTC and ClO2 was of second-order overall and the apparent second-order rate constants was 0.84 M-1 s(-1) at pH 2 and room temperature (24 degrees C-26 degrees C).The combined process of ClO2 pre-oxidation and BAC bio-treatment was proved to be a sustainable technology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The ClO2 pre-oxidation process could improve the biodegradability of OTC wastewater as the BOD5/COD ratio increases from 0.04 to 0.23 at 0.2 mM ClO2 oxidation of 30 min. Under the optimal conditions of ClO2 0.2 mM, hydraulic retention time 8 h and organic loading rate below 0.8 kg COD/m(3).d, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 68.1% and the effluent COD concentration was between 79.6 and 110.3 mg/L.

AB In this study, the aim was to evaluate the adsorption capacity of a volcanic rock commonly used in Mexico as filter medium in constructed wetlands (locally named tezontle) for carbamazepine (CBZ) adsorption, as well as to analyze the change in its capacity with biofilm growth. Adsorption essays were carried out under batch conditions by evaluating two particle sizes of tezontle, two values of the solution pH, and two temperatures; from these essays, optimal conditions for carbamazepine adsorption were obtained. The optimal conditions (pH 8, 25 degrees C and 0.85-2.0 mm particle-size) were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity of tezontle with biofilm, which was promoted through tezontle exposition to wastewater in glass columns, for six months. The maximum adsorption capacity of clean tezontle was 3.48 mu g/g; while for the tezontle with biofilm, the minimum value was 1.75 mu g/g (after the second week) and the maximum, was 3.3 mu g/g (after six months) with a clear tendency of increasing over time. The adsorption kinetic was fitted to a pseudo-second model for both tezontle without biofilm and with biofilm, thus indicating a chemisorption process. On clean tezontle, both acid active sites (AAS) and basic active sites (BAS) were found in 0.087 and 0.147 meq/g, respectively. The increase in the adsorption capacity of tezontle with biofilm, along the time was correlated with a higher concentration of BAS, presumably from a greater development of biofilm. The presence of biofilm onto tezontle surface was confirmed through FTIR and FE-SEM. These results confirm the essential role of filter media for pharmaceutical removal in constructed wetlands (CWs).

AB Wastewater containing pharmaceutical residual components must be treated before being discharged to the environment. This study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of tungstencarbon nanocomposite in diclofenac removal using design of experiment (DOE). The 27 batch adsorption experiments were done by choosing three effective parameters (pH, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration) at three levels. The nanocomposite was prepared by tungsten oxide and activated carbon powder in a ratio of 1 to 4 mass. The remaining concentration of diclofenac was measured by a spectrometer with adding reagents of 2, 2'-bipyridine, and ferric chloride. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine the main and interaction effects. The equilibrium time for removal process was determined as 30 min. It was observed that the pH had the lowest influence on the removal efficiency of diclofenac. Nanocomposite gave a high removal at low concentration of 5.0 mg/L. The maximum removal for an initial concentration of 5.0 mg/L was 88.0% at contact time of 30 min. The results of ANOVA showed that adsorbent mass was among the most effective variables. Using DOE as an efficient method revealed that tungsten-carbon nanocomposite has high efficiency in the removal of residual diclofenac from the aqueous solution.

AB Diphenhydramine (DPH) is one of the pharmaceuticals commonly found in the effluent stream after wastewater treatment, and the cause of its environmental persistence needs to be addressed urgently. Smectite minerals are common soil components with large surface area, expandable interlayer, and high cation exchange capacity (CEC), thus are capable of adsorbing or intercalating inorganic or organic cations on the surface or in the interlayer. In this study the intercalation of DPH in the interlayer of a Ca-smectite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, infra-red, and thermogravimetric analyses supported by molecular dynamic simulation. At the low (0.2-0.3 CEC) and high (0.6-0.7 CEC) adsorption levels, the intercalated DPH might take a horizontal monolayer or a bilayer configuration, resulting in a d(001) expansion to 15 or 17 angstrom, respectively. As the amount of DPH intercalation increased, a gradual, yet systematic, dehydration due to removal of hydrated inorganic cation Ca2+ from the interlayer was observed. In addition, the intercalated DPH had a slightly higher thermal stability due to the shield effect of the host mineral smectite against heat. The uptake of DPH by the smectite was attributed to both electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged mineral surfaces and the positively charged tertiary amine and cation exchange interactions between DPH+ and hydrated Ca2+. Thus, smectite minerals could serve as a sink to remove dissolved DPH from water on the one hand, and as a carrier to transport intercalated DPH in the environment on the other hand.

Section one of the study underscores the environmental advantages of employing GC for such analyses. Section two presents the innovative methods for determining pharmaceuticals in the environment. The last section discusses the results of the analysis of the GC and GC-MS market in Poland.
   According to the literature data, the described methods were applied for the analysis of real samples: wastewaters, surface waters, soil samples. The samples were collected from the Pomerania region and the Gulf of Gdansk. The pharmaceuticals were determined in various environmental samples. The highest concentrations were found in raw wastewater, medium in a treated wastewater, and the lowest - in surface water. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were: ibuprofen, paracetamol, diclofenac and naproxen, all belonging to NSAIDs.
   Furthermore, the results of the study of the Polish GC market indicate that a very limited number of entities are currently using chromatographic techniques, and pharmaceutical residues tests are exceptions, mainly due to the lack of the legal requirements in this field and the lack of own laboratories.

AB This paper reports the seasonal variation and environmental quality control data for five fingerprint pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (acetaminophen ciprofloxacin, caffeine, irgasan and benzophenone) in the influent and the effluent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) and surface water bodies (six major lakes) in and around Nagpur, one of the "A class city" in the central India over a period of 1 year. The target compounds were analysed using developed offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC-PDA) method. All the five PPCPs were found in the influent, whereas four were found in the effluent of the STP. However, in the surface water bodies, three PPCPs were detected in all the seasons. Above PPCPs were present in the concentration range of 1-174 mu g L-1 in the surface water bodies, 12373 mu g L-1 in the influent and 11-233 mu g L-1 in the effluent of the STP. Amongst the five PPCPs, caffeine was found to be in higher concentration as compared to others. The seasonal trends indicate higher concentrations of PPCPs in summer season and lowest in the rainy season. Additionally, physico-chemical characterisations (inorganic and organic parameters) of the collected samples were performed to access the anthropogenic pollution. Ecotoxicological risk assessment was done to appraise the degree of toxicity of the targeted compounds. Hazard quotient (HQ) values were found to be < 1 indicating no adverse effect on the targeted organism.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the biological effect of the secondary effluent (SE) of a wastewater treatment plant and reclaimed water treated via ultrafiltration (UF) followed by either reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration or nanofiltration (NF) to be used for environmental use by comparing the results of algal growth inhibition tests of concentrated samples of the SE and permeates of RO and NF with those of six rivers in southern Okinawa Island. Although the SE water had no adverse effects on the growth of the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, it could lead to water quality degradation of rivers in terms of its toxic unit value, whereas the use of RO and NF permeates would not lead to such degradation. The recharge of rivers, into which domestic wastewater and livestock effluents might be discharged in southern Okinawa Island, with reclaimed water subjected to advanced treatment could dilute the concentrations of chemicals that cause biological effects and improve the water quality of the rivers, based on the results of the bioassay using P. subcapitata. Comparing the results of bioassays of reclaimed water with those of the ambient water at a site might be effective in assessing the water quality of reclaimed water for environmental use at the site.

AB Water quality is currently a subject of increasing concern, especially because of the emerging pollutants contaminating aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of emerging pollutants in the IguaScu River, from source to mouth, such as: pharmaceuticals, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid, ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), gemfibrozil and fenofibrate; female sex hormones, including estradiol (E1), ethinylestradiol (EET) and estrone (E2); UV filters, including 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octylmethoxycinnamate; and caffeine (CAF). The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

AB BACKGROUND: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibiotic largely used to treat bacterial infections and found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. Zero valent iron (ZVI, Fe2+) technology has great potential for the degradation of residual pharmaceuticals. The effect of some parameters (anaerobic/aerobic, particle size, iron ligands and anions) were evaluated for CIP degradation in distilled water (DW) and finally compared to that obtained in STP effluent.
   RESULTS: The smaller ZVI particle (200 mesh) resulted in a lower degradation rate than the larger particle (20 mesh) in both anaerobic and aerobic treatment. This is due mainly to the fast generation of Fe2+, hindering the degradation process due to (OH)-O-center dot scavenging. A linear increase of CIP degradation ratewas observed when the reactionwas carried out with increasing EDTA concentrations. The Cl- anions had a positive effect on CIP degradation in the ZVI process. On the other hand, the presence of NO3- resulted in a decrease of degradation rate, both with 20 and 200 mesh particles. CIP could be degraded in two STP effluents mediated by ZVI (20 mesh).
   CONCLUSIONS: The ZVI process can be used efficiently for the degradation of CIP in two types of STP effluent (anaerobic treatment or anaerobic/aerobic treatment), revealing a possible applicability of the ZVI process to this type of matrix. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Antidepressants are gaining public attention because of increasing reports of their occurrence in environment and their potential impact on ecosystems and human health. Continuous input of pharmaceuticals into rivers, through psychiatric hospital or wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) effluent, may cause adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems of the receiving water bodies. This work investigates the occurrence and sources of 8 antidepressants in main stream and tributaries of Huangpu River in Shanghai. The detected concentrations of the selected antidepressants ranged from low nanogram per liter to 42.9 ng L-1 (fluoxetine) in main stream and ranged from low nanogram per liter to 33.7 ng L-1 (fluoxetine) in tributaries. To study the effect of hospital or wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on environment, the upstream and downstream samples were analyzed. Generally, antidepressants had greater concentrations in downstream than that in upstream of the WWTPs or hospitals. It is suggesting that WWTPs and hospitals may introduce pollution into water environment. A preliminary risk assessment was conducted: none of the eight target compounds yielded risk quotient (RQ) values more than 0.1, thus indicating that no adverse effect is expected in water environment. These results will provide background data for future antidepressants pollution control and management in Shanghai, China.

AB Hospital wastewaters contain large amounts of pharmaceutical residues, which may eventually be discharged into the aquatic environment through wastewater treatment plants, raising the question of their impact on human and environmental health. This has prompted the launch of several monitoring studies into the most commonly administered compounds in urban wastewater. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the cytotoxic potential of wastewaters samples collected from seven hospitals in Tunisia. The physicochemical analyses showed a large fluctuation of certain parameters in the collected samples, such as chemical oxygen demand (ranged from 860 to 1720 mg L-1), biochemical oxygen demand (ranged from 385 to 747 mg L-1), total organic carbon (ranged from 256 to 562 g L-1), total suspended solids (ranged from 905 to 1450 mg L-1), conductivity (ranged from 3.31 to 7.14 mu sm/cm), and turbidity (ranged from 100 to 480 NTU). The analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) also showed that hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of Hg (ranged from 0.0024 to 0.019 mg L-1). This could be explained by the variation of the activity and the services in certain hospitals compared to others. All hospital wastewater samples induced the proliferation of human breast cancer cell line MDA-231, even at low concentrations (20 mu L/assay). Moreover, the maximum induction reached at the concentration of 60 mu L/assay in wastewater samples from hospitals located in Monastir, Sidi Bouzid, Mahdia, and Sfax with percentages of induction up to 42.33, 14, 7.61, and 5.42%, respectively. These observations could be due to the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these wastewaters. Given this, our results evidenced the potential risk of these hospital effluents to environmental and public health.

AB In this work, a multi-class analytical method for determination of 22 frequently used pharmaceuticals was developed and validated. Analytes were from different classes for example macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, anthelmintics, anesthetics, and others. Method was intended for analysis of aqueous samples so the sample preparation was done using solid-phase extraction (SPE). Different sorbents (C8, C18, polymeric, and ion exchange sorbents) combining different eluents (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate) were investigated during development of sample preparation step. Samples were analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS, and therefore, chromatographic and mass spectrometer conditions were investigated. Optimal extraction efficiencies for most of the investigated analytes were obtained with Oasis HLB polymeric sorbents with acetonitrile as eluent. A study of matrix effect was carried out for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent. The method was validated for linearity, detection limits and quantification limits, repeatability, and reproducibility. Method detection limits were in the range of 2.0-204.0 ng L-1 for WWTP influent except for sulfaguanidine and dexamethasone. Also, method detection limits for WWTP effluent were from 1.0 to 115.4 ng L-1. Method was successfully applied for analysis of real wastewater samples from municipal wastewater treatment plant. In the influent, pharmaceuticals from all investigated groups were present and the concentrations were from 50.0 to 4914.3 ng L-1 for influent and 26.9 to 1699.2 ng L-1 for effluent. It was also reported that some pharmaceuticals showed higher concentrations in the wastewater effluent than in the influent.

AB This paper reports an experimental degradation study of nineteen multi-class pharmaceutical products present in the influent wastewater arriving at the Daugavgriva wastewater treatment plant. Collected wastewater samples were filtered and irradiated by electron beam and gamma radiation both generated from a 5 MeV linear particle accelerator. The samples were exposed to ten absorbed doses (0.5-25 kGy) produced at high dose rates (600 and 1200 kGy h(-1) for accelerated electrons, as well as 22.5 and 37.5 kGy h(-1) for gamma radiation). The analysis by a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method indicated that the initial concentrations of pharmaceutical residues were effectively reduced by up to 90-100% in eighty per cent of the cases when samples were exposed to 0.5-5 kGy of electron beam or gamma radiation treatment. Higher doses (> 5 kGy) were needed to decompose macrolide antibiotics. The use of electron beam radiation showed some advantages due to the reduced exposure time, thus enabling a more energy efficient treatment resulting in the degradation of pharmaceutical residues comparable to that achieved by gamma irradiation. Microbiological studies indicated the pronounced degradation effect on bacterial contamination of wastewater, which was successfully eliminated upon increasing the radiation, dose up to 7-12 kGy.

AB We present and evaluate a framework for estimating concentrations of pharmaceuticals over time in wildlife feeding at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The framework is composed of a series of predictive steps involving the estimation of pharmaceutical concentration in wastewater, accumulation into wildlife food items, and uptake by wildlife with subsequent distribution into, and elimination from, tissues. Because many pharmacokinetic parameters for wildlife are unavailable for the majority of drugs in use, a read-across approach was employed using either rodent or human data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Comparison of the different steps in the framework against experimental data for the scenario where birds are feeding on a WWTP contaminated with fluoxetine showed that estimated concentrations in wastewater treatment works were lower than measured concentrations; concentrations in food could be reasonably estimated if experimental bioaccumulation data are available; and read-across from rodent data worked better than human to bird read-across. The framework provides adequate predictions of plasma concentrations and of elimination behavior in birds but yields poor predictions of distribution in tissues. The approach holds promise, but it is important that we improve our understanding of the physiological similarities and differences between wild birds and domesticated laboratory mammals used in pharmaceutical efficacy/safety trials, so that the wealth of data available can be applied more effectively in ecological risk assessments.

AB The sorption behavior of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) on graphene was investigated and compared with that on activated carbon. The kinetic studies showed that BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon reached equilibrium within 240 min, whereas TCS sorption on these two materials achieved equilibrium in 60 and 120 min. The maximum sorption capacity (q(m)) of BPA on graphene or activated carbon reached approximately 2.0 x 10(3) mu g/g, which indicated that graphene was not superior to traditional activated carbon for BPA removal. By contrast, the strong partitioning ability of TCS on graphene suggested the potential use of graphene materials to remove TCS from wastewater. Although the pH change from 4.0 to 7.0 did not greatly affect BPA or TCS sorption, the sorption decreased dramatically when the pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0. This phenomenon should be attributed to the establishment of electrostatic repulsion between anionic BPA (or TCS) molecules and the graphene (or activated carbon) surface under higher pH conditions. The increase of ion (NaCl and CaCl2) concentrations may lead to substantial increase of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon due to the salting-out effect. By contrast, ion concentrations had no significant effect on TCS sorption because of the dominant hydrophobic interaction.

AB Beta adrenergic antagonists like carvedilol are typical environmental pollutants detected in wastewater and surface water. Human metabolism of carvedilol is well investigated, while its environmental fates are still unknown. In recent years, there have been appearing reports on high toxicity of beta-blockers toward aquatic organisms. In this paper the ability of the filamentous fungus C echinulata to eliminate the beta-blocker has been described for the first time. An 83% loss of carvedilol was observed after 120 h incubation of the tested fungus with the compound, where hydroxylated carvedilol metabolites were identified as the major biotransformation products. Carvedilol degradation by C. echinulata was proceeded by hydroxylation and conjugation reactions similar to its mammalian metabolism. Glucose conjugate was found in the fungi cultures, whereas glucuronide conjugates were detected in mammals. The impact of carvedilol on the functionality of fungal cells was also evaluated. A 2-fold decrease in the PC/PE ratio was noticed in the C. echinulata cell membrane after the exposition to carvedilol compared to control mycelium incubated without the beta-blocker. The change can denote perturbation of fungal cell membrane integration by carvedilol. Moreover, 2.8-fold lower toxicity of postcultures supernatants toward D. magna were shown in contrast to abiotic control. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depurated effluents can be employed as reclaimed water for irrigation in regions with low precipitations, while nutrients-rich biosolids are usually applied as fertilizer for agricultural purposes. However, both practices may result in the accumulation of micropollutants in the soil compartment, the contamination of groundwater, and/or their biotransfer to different living organisms until they finally may reach human receptors. The fate and transport of seven pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) with different physicochemical properties was analysed for these scenarios employing two different models: the buckets model and the HYDRUS-1D software package. The results indicated that these compounds have a low potential to contaminate groundwater in the type of soil under study (silty loam), although triclosan tended to accumulate in the top layers of the soil. Similar conclusions were reached through both models, although they predicted different solute plant uptake and accumulation patterns of the evaluated compounds. Therefore, the buckets model can be considered as an adequate option to perform a screening level assessment of these compounds. However, HYDRUS-1D could provide more information on the fate of pharmaceuticals in soil, thus contributing to reduce the uncertainty already associated to PPCPs. Additionally, the significant difference of the Hazard Index (HI) obtained from a human health risk assessment performed using the estimated soil concentrations from both models also contributed to recommend the use of a model that considers all the relevant mechanisms of mass transfer to reduce overestimation of risk.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are widely used as pain relief medicines are causing increasing environmental concern due to their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plant and potential toxicity on endocrine, kidney and reproduction in teleost fish. This study focused on the effects of widely used ibuprofen, diclofenac and paracetamol on the hatch and motor ability of early stage zebrafish, by exposing embryos to the target chemicals at 5, 50 and 500 mu g/L starting from 6 h postfertilization (hpf). A significant reduction in hatch rate at 55 hpf was caused by both ibuprofen (-63%) and diclofenac (-58%) at 500 mu g/L. Exposure to high concentration of ibuprofen significantly decreased the spontaneous movement by 25%, and reduced the free swimming distance, duration and speed under dark condition by 41%, 29% and 30%, respectively. High concentration of diclofenac also caused 23% decrease in spontaneous movement, and reduced the swimming distance as well as active duration by 17% and 13% under light stimulation. In comparison, the exposure to paracetamol did not cause any notable effect. Among neuron related genes tested, the expression of neurog1 was down-regulated from ibuprofen and diclofenac exposure by 19% and 26%, while the expression of neurod1 was up-regulated only by ibuprofen (31%). These findings indicated that ibuprofen and diclofenac significantly affected embryo locomotivity and were potentially neurotoxic, thus posing threats to zebrafish development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Antibiotics are considered among the major pollutants in water environments. The antibiotics along with the sewage, pharmaceutical industries water waste, veterinary clinics and hospital sewages noticeably enter into the water resources and the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate ciprofloxacin removal efficiency from aqueous solutions by using cupric oxide nanoparticles. The effects of pH (3- 11), CuO nanoparticles dosage (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.1 g/L), contact time (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min) and the initial antibiotic concentration (10, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/L) were assessed on ciprofloxacin removal efficiency in laboratory. Under optimal conditions of concentration 10 mg/L, pH = 7, CuO nanoparticles dosage 0.1 g/L and contact time 60 min, the removal efficiency was 77% and q m of the CuO nanoparticles was 105 mg/g. The process of ciprofloxacin adsorption on CuO nanoparticles was depended on Freundlich adsorption isotherm more than other isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin and Harkins-Jura). On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that CuO nanoparticles adsorption process can be used as a novel method for treating wastewater contaminated with drug sources.

AB Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) is a major anionic surfactant used in detergents worldwide and as such is a ubiquitous constituent of domestic and municipal wastewaters. Increasingly, constructed wet-lands are being employed as a low cost and sustainable alternative to traditional wastewater treatment processes. Plants are known to play a vital role both directly and indirectly in the removal of contaminants in wastewater treatment constructed wetlands. However, relatively little research has been conducted into the manipulation of the plant component in order to optimise constructed wetland performance. Furthermore, little is known about the role of plants in the removal of specific contaminants including LAS. The present study investigated the effects of plant biomass and plant species on LAS removal in a series of experimental subsurface flow wetlands. Our results confirm that the presence of vegetation enhances LAS removal, with higher biomass systems associated with higher LAS removal rates. Differences in LAS removal were also observed between different plant species, although these were not found to be statistically significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in the natural water sources has been reported as early as in the year 1980. Until now, the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment has been frequently reported in the literature. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that these contaminants have posed a threat to both humans and ecosystems. In this regard, the present review paper seeks to offer an overview of this environmental issue of pharmaceutical pollution where the subject matters to be reviewed include the effects, sources and mitigation strategies of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Besides, a review of the fundamentals and mechanisms of heterogeneous photocatalysis technology is also presented in this paper. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a rapidly expanding technology which has been extensively investigated and applied in wastewater treatment for the remediation of persistent pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds during the last decade. Furthermore, the ideal photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO2), which can collaborate and perform well in the photocatalysis treatment process, is also discussed. The advantages and limitations associated with the application of this treatment method are summarized and discussed in details. Finally, this review paper focuses on the future trend of the photocatalysis technology and identifies the barriers and lacking parts which need to be resolved in the near future.

AB The presence of micro-pollutants in wastewater and in drinking water and its sources, is posing both environmental and health concerns. This work describes the development of weak polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) based hollow fiber nanofiltration (NF) membranes to remove micro-pollutants from aqueous sources. The charge density of weak polyelectrolytes (PEs) can be controlled by the pH of the coating solution, providing an additional parameter to tune the performance of the prepared membranes. In this study, PEMs of weak PEs poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were coated in a layer by layer (LbL) fashion on top of an ultrafiltration support to obtain PEM based NF membranes. Before coating the membranes, the role of the pH during coating on the buildup of multilayers was studied on model surfaces via reflectometry. Detailed investigations were then carried out on the membrane performance, by studying the pure water permeability, salt retention (NaCl, CaCl2 and Na2SO4) and the retention of micro-pollutants of varying size (similar to 200-400 g mol(-1)), charge and hydrophilicity. Variation of the coating pH provided a large degree of control over the separation performance of the weak PEM based membranes. The rejection was found to be dominated by size exclusion together with Donnan exclusion. A PEM membrane prepared at pH 6 showed a high micropollutant retention (60-80%) while showing only low ion retentions. Such a membrane would be well suited to reduce the problem of micro-pollutants, without significant alteration of the ionic composition of the feed.

AB Widespread use of pharmaceuticals and suboptimal wastewater treatment have led to increased levels of these substances in aquatic ecosystems. Lipid-lowering drugs such as gemfibrozil, which are among the most abundant human pharmaceuticals in the environment, may have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms. We examined the genotoxicity of gemfibrozil in a fish species, the gilthead seabream (Sparta aurata), which is commercially important in southern Europe. Following 96-h waterborne exposure, molecular (erythrocyte DNA strand breaks) and cytogenetic (micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities in cells) endpoints were measured. Gemfibrozil was positive in both endpoints, at environmentally relevant concentrations, a result that raises concerns about the potential genotoxic effects of the drug in recipient waters.

AB Diclofenac, both from human and veterinary consumption, may arrive in landfills or in the wastewater treatment plants, becoming an environmental pollutant. Therefore, we aimed to study the influence of diclofenac on plants growth and development. We chose as model plant the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that was watered with different concentrations of aqueous diclofenac solutions (0-0.4 g/L). The plants exhibited linear decreased values of net assimilation rates and stomatal conductance to water vapors with increased diclofenac's concentrations. Emission of 3-hexenol was determined to scale up with diclofenac concentration, therefore this compound may be proposed as stress marker. Also in the emission of bean plants were detected 3 different monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, camphene and 3-carene), their concentration increasing with elevated concentration of diclofenac. We can conclude that diclofenac may affect the plants photosynthetic parameters and also might disturb the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) in plastids.

AB Five parabens used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in sewage sludges collected at 14 U.S. wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in nine states. Detected concentration ranges (ng/g, dry weight) and frequencies were as follows: methyl paraben (15.9 to 203.0; 100%), propyl paraben (0.5 to 7.7; 100%), ethyl paraben (<0.6 to 2.6; 63%), butyl paraben (<0.4 to 43; 42%) and benzyl paraben (<0.4 to 33; 26%). The estrogenicity inherent to the sum of parabens detected in sewage sludge (ranging from 10.1 to 500.1 pg/kg 17 beta-estradiol equivalents) was insignificant when compared to the 10(6)-times higher value calculated for natural estrogens reported in the literature to occur in sewage sludge. Temporal monitoring at one WWTP provided insights into temporal and seasonal variations in paraben concentrations.

AB Parabens (p-hydroxy benzoic acid esters) are antimicrobial agents, used widely as preservatives in personal care products (PCPs), pharmaceuticals, foods, and beverages. PCPs that contain parabens are a major source of these chemicals in sewage treatment plants (STPs). Very few studies have demonstrated the occurrence of parabens in wastewater. In this study, the occurrence and fate of six parabens, methyl-(MeP), ethyl-(EtP), propyl-(PrP), butyl-(BuP), hepty-(HpP) and benzyl-(BzP) parabens, and five of their metabolites (4-HB, 3,4-DHB, OH-MeP, OH-EtP and BA) were studied in five STPs in India. The concentrations of parent parabens (E(6)parent parabens) in five STPs ranged between 131 and 920 ng/L in influent; 16 and 67 ng/L in effluent; and 104 and 1090 ng/g, dry weight, in sludge samples. The sum concentrations of five paraben metabolites (E(5)paraben metabolites) in five STPs ranged between 4110 and 34,600 ng/L in influent; 2560 and 3800 ng/L in effluent; and 1220 and 35,900 ng/g, dry weight, in sludge samples. These values were higher than those reported for many industrialized countries. We calculated the mass loadings, removal efficiencies, and environmental emissions of parabens based on the measured concentrations in influents, effluents, and sludge. The mean removal efficiencies of parent parabens and their metabolites ranged from 80% to 100% and 28% to 76%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate assessment of racemic pharmaceuticals requires enantioselective analytical methods. This study presents the development and validation of an enantioselective liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detection method for the concomitant quantification of the enantiomers of tramadol and their metabolites, N-desmethyltramadol and O-desmethyltramadol, in wastewater samples. Optimized conditions were achieved using a Lux Cellulose-4 column 150 Chi 4.6 mm, 3 mu m isocratic elution, and 0.1% diethylamine in hexane and ethanol (96: 4, v/v) at 0.7 mL min 1. The samples were extracted using 150 mg Oasis (R) mixed-mode cation exchange (MCX) cartridges. The method was validated using a synthetic effluent of a laboratory-scale aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor. The method demonstrated to be selective, accurate, and linear (r(2) > 0.99) over the range of 56 ng L (-1) to 392 ng L (-1). The detection and the quantification limits of each enantiomer were 8 ng L 1 and 28 ng L (-1) for tramadol and N-desmethyltramadol, and 20 ng L (-1) And 56 ng L- 1 for O-desmethyltramadol. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated in a screening study in influent and effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant. The results demonstrated the occurrence of tramadol enantiomers up to 325.1 ng L (-1) and 357.9 ng L (-1), in the effluent and influent samples, respectively. Both metabolites were detected in influents and effluents.

AB Pharmaceutical residues in wastewater pose a challenge to wastewater treatment technologies. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are common wastewater treatment systems in rural areas and they discharge often in small water courses in which the ecology can be adversely affected by the discharged pharmaceuticals. Hence, there is a need for studies aiming to improve the removal of pharmaceuticals in CWs. In this study, the performance of a full-scale aerated sub-surface flow hybrid CW treating wastewater from a healthcare facility was studied in terms of common water parameters and pharmaceutical removal. In addition, a preliminary aquatic risk assessment based on hazard quotients was performed to estimate the likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the forest creek where this CW discharges. The (combined) effect of aeration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) was evaluated in a laboratory-scale batch experiment. Excellent removal of the targeted pharmaceuticals was obtained in the full-scale CW (>90%) and, as a result, the aquatic risk was estimated low. The removal efficiency of only a few of the targeted pharmaceuticals was found to be dependent on the applied aeration (namely gabapentin, metformin and sotalol). Longer and the HRT increased the removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac and tramadol.

AB Hollow fiber (HF) and flat sheet (FS) Sponge MBRs were operated at 10-20 LMH flux treating hospital wastewater. Simultaneous nitrification denitrification (SND) occurred considerably with TN removal rate of 0.011-0.020 mg TN mg VSS (1)d(1). Furthermore, there was a remarkable removal of antibiotics in both Sponge MBRs, namely Norfloxacin (93-99% (FS); 62-86% (HF)), Ofloxacin (73-93% (FS); 68-93% (HF)), Ciprofloxacin (76-93% (FS); 54-70% (HF)), Tetracycline (approximately 100% for both FS and HF) and Trimethoprim (60-97% (FS); 47-93% (HF). Whereas there was a quite high removal efficiency of Erythromycin in Sponge MBRs, with 67-78% (FS) and 22-48% (HF). Moreover, a slightly higher removal of antibiotics in FS than in HF achieved, with the removal rate being of 0.67-32.40 and 0.44-30.42 mg mg VSS (1)d(1), respectively. In addition, a significant reduction of membrane fouling of 2-50 times was achieved in HF-Sponge MBR for the flux range. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Till now, no attention has been paid to pharmaceuticals (PCs) in the air, though they are known to affect waters, soils, foods and biota. This paper describes the first attempt to characterize the PC occurrence in the air. Airborne particulates (PM10 or PM2.5 fractions, from Amsterdam, Netherland, Rome and Rende, Italy) were sampled on quartz fiber filter by means of pumping systems operating at medium-volume conditions (16 or 38.5 L min(-1)). The samples were solvent extracted through sonication with a dichloromethane:acetone:methanol mixture and reduced close to dryness; three fractions of the residue were separated through column chromatography; they comprised non polar, low polar and very polar organic compounds, respectively, and PCs were in the third one. Chemical analysis was performed by means of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MSD), after treatment of solutions with methyl,tertzbutylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) to form silyl derivatives of most PCs. The following substances were investigated: acetaminophenol, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprefen, naproxen, fenofibrate, diclofenac, acetylcysteine and sulfanilamide; p-hydroxybenzoic acid and salicylic acid; and parabens (methyl, ethyl and propyl). Except aspirin, acetamidophenol, acetylcysteine and sulfanilamide, the target compounds could be quantified with good repeatability, reproducibility and percent recoveries (on the average, similar to 7.5%, similar to 7.1% and 91%, respectively). The PC concentrations ranged < 0.1-8.6 ng m(-3); season dependent drug profiles could be observed in Rome and Rende. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of antimicrobial agent triclosan (TCS) in the global aquatic and terrestrial environment is an emerging concern. While risk assessment for TCS is available in certain countries, no studies have attempted to assess the risk of TCS worldwide. This could be due to lack of method to characterize the global exposure. The present study therefore proposed a probabilistic-based approach to approximate the percent-ranked measured environmental concentrations (MECs) by estimating exposure concentration distribution (ECD) for different environmental compartments on a global scale, incorporating approximate 1200 single MECs. Hazard of TCS was assessed from species sensitivity distribution as well as predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from ecotoxicological and toxicological endpoints. We draw on experiences from previous risk assessment exercises and present a holistic approach for characterizing the risk of TCS to microorganism in sewage treatment plant, aquatic and soil organisms, avian and mammalian species, and humans. Using the approach, we estimated risk of TCS to organisms dwelling in sediment and living in surface waters, and the risk quotients (MEC/PNEC) were within the range of 0.95-33.3 and 0.49-9.5, respectively. While the risk quotients for other environmental compartments were below a value of 1, there are large uncertainties likely due to an insufficient dataset of exposure and hazard of TCS.

AB Ketamine has been increasingly used in medicine and has the potential for abuse or illicit use around the world. Ketamine cannot be removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants. Although ketamine and its metabolite norketamine have been detected to a significant degree in effluents and aquatic environments, their ecotoxicity effects in aquatic organisms remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of ketamine and its metabolite, along with the chronic reproductive toxicity of ketamine (5-100 mu g/L) to Daphnia magna. Multiple environmental scenarios were also evaluated, including drug mixtures and sunlight irradiation toxicity. Ketamine and norketamine caused acute toxicity to D. magna, with half lethal concentration (LC50) values of 30.93 and 25.35 mg/L, respectively, after 48 h of exposure. Irradiated solutions of ketamine (20 mg/L) significantly increased the mortality of D. magna; pre-irradiation durations up to 2 h rapidly increased the death rate to 100%. A new photolysis byproduct (M.W. 241) of norketamine that accumulates during irradiation was identified for the first time. The relevant environmental concentration of ketamine produced significant reproductive toxicity effects in D. magna, as revealed by the reduction of the number of total live offspring by 33.6-49.8% (p < 0.05). The toxicity results indicate that the environmental hazardous risks of the relevant ketamine concentration cannot be ignored and warrant further examination.

AB This study investigated the potential effect of four frequently used inorganic regenerant properties (i.e., ionic strength, cation type, anion type, and regeneration solution volume) on the desorption and adsorption performance of 14 pharmaceuticals, belonging to 12 therapeutic classes with different predominant chemical forms and hydrophobicities, using polymeric anion exchange resin (AER)-packed fixed-bed column tests. After preconditioning with NaCl, NaOH, or saline-alkaline (SA) solutions, all resulting mobile counterion types of AERs effectively adsorbed all 14 pharmaceuticals, where the preferential magnitude of OH--type = Cl- + OH--type > Cl--type. During regeneration, ionic strength (1 M versus 3 M NaCl) had no significant influence on desorption performance for any of the 14 pharmaceuticals, while no regenerant cation (HCl versus NaCl) or anion type (NaCl versus NaOH and SA) achieved higher desorption efficiencies for all pharmaceuticals. A volumetric increase in 1 M or 3 M NaCl solutions significantly improved the desorption efficiencies of most pharmaceuticals, irrespective of ionic strength. The results indicate that regeneration protocols, including regenerant cation type, anion type and volume, should be optimized to improve pharmaceutical removal by AERs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of different Advanced Oxidation Processes based on solar and ultraviolet C radiation to remove the antibiotic tinidazole (TNZ) from water. Specifically the systems studied were: UVC, solar radiation, UVC/H2O2, solar/H2O2, UVC/K2S2O8, solar/K2S2O8, UVC/photo-Fenton and solar/photo-Fenton. Some aspects of these processes such as the degradation percentage of TNZ, its mineralisation degree, and the degradation products, were analysed. The direct photodegradation of TNZ showed low yields, with a removal percentage lower than 50%. With the UVC/H2O2 system, the percentage of TNZ degraded increased with the H2O2 concentration, but when solar radiation was used, the addition of H2O2 did not favour the process efficiency. The UVC/K2S2O8 system was more efficient than UVC/H2O2 for TNZ degradation. The presence of K2S2O8 in the solar photodegradation also enhanced TNZ degradation in comparison to the direct photolysis process. In the photo-Fenton systems, for both UVC and solar radiations, high levels of TNZ degradation and mineralisation were obtained. Therefore, the photo-Fenton systems are the most recommended to treat water contaminated with TNZ. Some clues of the mineralisation process appear from the degradation products detected by means of coupled ultra-pressure liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.

AB The spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and other emerging contaminants (ECs) such as plasticisers, perflourinated compounds (PFCs) and illicit drug metabolites in water and bound to suspended particulate material (SPM) is not well-understood. Here, we quantify levels of thirteen selected contaminants in water (n = 88) and their partition to suspended particulate material (SPM, n = 16) in three previously-unstudied rivers of Greater London and Southern England during a key reproduction/spawning period. Analysis was conducted using an in-house validated method for Solid Phase Extraction followed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass-Spectrometry. Analytes were extracted from SPM using an optimised method for ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction. Detection frequencies of contaminants dissolved in water ranged from 3% (ethinylestradiol) to 100% (bisphenol-A). Overall mean concentrations in the aqueous-phase ranged from 14.7 ng/L (benzoylecgonine) to 159 ng/L (bisphenol-A). Sewage treatment works (STW) effluent was the predominant source of pharmaceuticals, while plasticisers/perfluorinated compounds may additionally enter rivers via other sources. In SPM, detection frequencies ranged from 44% (PFOA) to 94% (hydroxyacetophenone). Mean quantifiable levels of analytes bound to SPM ranged from 13.5 ng/g dry SPM (0.33 ng bound/L water) perfluorononanoic acid to 2830 ng/g dry SPM (14.3 ng bound/L water) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. Long chain (>C7) amphipathic and acidic PFCs were found to more preferentially bind to SPM than short chain PFCs and other contaminants (Kd = 34.1-75.5 vs <5 respectively). Per capita daily contributions of studied contaminants entering rivers ranged from 0.157 mu g/person/day of benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) to 58.6 mu g/person/day of bisphenol-A. The large sample size of this work (n = 104) enabled ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc tests to establish significant trends in PPCP/EC spatial distribution from headwaters through downstream stretches of studied rivers. Novel findings include environmental Kd calculations, the occurrence of contaminants in river headwaters, increases in contaminant metabolite concentrations downstream of STW effluents revealing possible in-river degradation or de-conjugation, the influence of polarity and acidity in the partition of contaminants to particulate-material, among others.

AB Foams are concentrated dispersions of gas bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. They are ubiquitous in nature and familiar from beet, frothed milk, and bubble baths; moreover, they play important roles in industrial applications ranging from petrochemicals to pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetics. Recently, we reported the discovery of "capillary foams", a new class of stable foams obtained by frothing a suspension of colloidal particles in the presence of a small amount of oil. In this study, we explored in more detail the formation stages of capillary foams and found that particle networks are formed first, which then entrap the gas bubbles (in this case, air bubbles). We further investigated the influence of particle concentration and wettability on the formation of capillary foams. As the fraction of particles is increased, the foam volume first increases and then reaches a plateau value. Finally, capillary foams were prepared at different oil fractions, using oils with different interfacial properties. Our study shows that oil spreading has a strong effect on both the amount of oil needed to obtain stable foams and on the foam stability. A detailed understanding of the foam formation and the effects of material and process parameters lays a foundation for the targeted development of capillary foams toward future applications, which may range from the fabrication of load-bearing, lightweight porous materials, to enhanced oil recovery, advanced froth flotation, wastewater treatment, and oil spill remediation.

AB This study presents a novel statistical approach for identifying sequenced chemical transformation pathways in combination with reaction kinetics models. The proposed method relies on sound uncertainty propagation by considering parameter ranges and associated probability distribution obtained at any given transformation pathway levels as priors for parameter estimation at any subsequent transformation levels. The method was applied to calibrate a model predicting the transformation in untreated wastewater of six biomarkers, excreted following human metabolism of heroin and codeine. The method developed was compared to parameter estimation methods commonly encountered in literature (i.e., estimation of all parameters at the same time and parameter estimation with fix values for upstream parameters) by assessing the model prediction accuracy, parameter identifiability and uncertainty analysis. Results obtained suggest that the method developed has the potential to outperform conventional approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, transformation pathway identification and parameter identifiability. This method can be used in conjunction with optimal experimental designs to effectively identify model structures and parameters. This method can also offer a platform to promote a closer interaction between analytical chemists and modellers to identify models for biochemical transformation pathways, being a prominent example for the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology.

AB Drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations are increasing water demands. Many countries are extending potable water supplies by irrigating crops with wastewater. Unfortunately, wastewater contains biologically active, long-lived pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Run-off from farms and wastewater treatment plant overflows contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on a cosmopolitan saprophagous insect, Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae). Larvae were reared on artificial diets spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Female flies showed no oviposition preference for treated or untreated diets. Larvae exposed to caffeine in diets showed increased mortality, and larvae fed antibiotics and hormones showed signs of slowed development, especially in females. The normal sex ratio observed in M. scalaris from control diets was affected by exposure to caffeine and pharmaceutical mixture treatments. There was an overall effect of treatment on the flies' microbial communities; notably, caffeine fed insects displayed higher microbial variability. Eight bacterial families accounted for approximately 95% of the total microbes in diet and insects. Our results suggest that CECs at environmentally relevant concentrations can affect the biology and microbial communities of an insect of ecological and medical importance.

AB Illicit drugs constitute a class of emergmg contaminants that has been drawing significant concern due to its potent pharmacological and biological activities. In this study, an in situ passive sampling approach that uses diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) was successfully tested for measuring ketamine (KET), methamphetamine (METH), and amphetamine (AMP) in water. The diffusion coefficients of KET, METH, and AMP in diffusive gel were (8.13 +/- 0.12) X 10(-6), (8.55 +/- 0.14) X 10(-6), and (7.72 +/- 0.18) X 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) at 22 degrees C, respectively. The capacities of an XAD binding gel for KET, METH, and AMP were 92, 57, and 45 mu g per binding gel disc, which were suitable for long-term environmental monitoring. The DGT measurement of these drugs was not influenced by the pH (4 to 9) and the ionic strength (0.001 M - 0.1 M) and unaffected by the water flow, demonstrating the effectiveness of the XAD-based DGT for the in situ Monitoring of illicit drugs. DGT samplers were deployed in a WWTP influent and natural rivers in Beijing, China. The ng L-1 levels of the drugs were high in the wastewater influent and low in river waters, with an insignificant fluctuation during the seven-day monitoring. The DGT measured concentrations were comparable to the average concentrations determined by SPE method, which suggested that the average data measured by DGT could be substituted for high-frequency grab sampling. This study has demonstrated systematically for the first time that DGT is effective and accurate for monitoring illicit drugs in wastewater and surface waters, and provides a powerful tool to investigating the presence, transport, and environmental behaviors of these drugs in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Concentration of the global population is increasingly occurring in megacities and other developing regions, where access to medicines is increasing more rapidly than waste management systems are implemented. Because freshwater and coastal systems are influenced by wastewater effluent discharges of differential quality, exposures in aquatic systems must be considered. Here, we performed a global scanning assessment of antihistamines(AHs), a common class of medicines, in surface waters and effluents. Antihistamines were identified, literature occurrence and ecotox-icology data on AHs collated, therapeutichazardvalues(THVs) calculated, and environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) of AHs compared to ecotoxicity thresholds and drug specific THVs to estimate hazards in surface waters and effluents. Literature searches of 62 different AHs in environmental matrices identified 111 unique occurrence publications of 24 specific AHs, largely from Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. However, the majority of surface water (63%) and effluent (85%) observations were from Europe and North America, which highlights relatively limited information from many regions, including developing countries and rapidly urbanizing are asin Africa, Latin America and Asia. Less than 10% of all observations were for estuarine or marine systems, though the majority of human populations reside close to coastal habitats. EED 5th and 95th centiles for all AHs were 2 and 212 ng/L in surface water, 5 and 1308 ng/L in effluent and 6 and 4287 ng/L in influent, respectively. Unfortunately, global hazards and risks of AHs to non-target species remain poorly understood. However, loratadine observations in surface waters exceeded a THV without an uncertainty factor 40% of the time, indicating future research is needed to understand aquatic toxicology, hazards and risks as sociated with this AH. This unique global scanning study further illustrates the utility of global asessments of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants to identify chemicals requiring toxicology study and regions where environmental monitoring, assessment and management efforts appear limited and necessary.

AB The behaviour and removal efficiency of ibuprofen (IBU), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KPF), and naproxen (NPX) during the real urban wastewater treatment by an experimental full-scale MBR working at high sludge and hydraulic retention time (SRT, HRT) were determined. The MBR worked in denitrification/nitrification conformation at 35.4h of HRT 0.45 m(3)/h), 37 d of SRT and a recirculation flow rate of 4Q The experiments were made under steady-state conditions, reaching a biodegradable organic matter removal higher than 99.5%. The MBR system showed similar removal capacity for IBU, NPX, and KTP (>95%), whose main transformation occurred in the aerobic reactor with a low contribution from the anoxic reactor. The system worked with complete nitrification, also achieving an effective retention of the unbiodegradable organic matter due to recirculation. DCF removal was low with negative removal yields for several samplings. Both removal and increase transformation of DCF also occurred in the aerobic reactor, this not being observed in the anoxic one. DCF tends to accumulate in the system and to be recirculated. Thus, during the sampling in which DCF influent concentration decreases, removal yields turn negative. The increase of DCF concentration in the aerobic bioreactor also contributes to the negative removal yields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, treatability of etodolac chemical synthesis wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry was investigated in a hybrid ozonation-Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) system. The AnMBR was successfully operated up to 7500 mg/L of chemical oxygen demand (COD), but sulfite inhibition occurred at this loading. A pre-ozonation process was applied to overcome the problem of sulfite inhibition resulted from raw wastewater by decreasing the sulfite concentration through oxidation to sulphate. Furthermore, it was shown that this process was also effective obtaining high etodolac removal efficiencies up to 99%. Approximately 90% COD removal efficiency was achieved by the combined system. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) decreased in the conditions of long sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low organic loading rate (OLR) values. Therefore, the granule size also decreased during the entire operation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that high sulfite concentration affected the microbial population in the order of methanogens, acedogens and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB).

AB In this study, a 1200 L outdoor pilot scale microalgal photobioreactor (PBR) was used for toilet wastewater (WW) treatment and evaluate its ability to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The PBR was operated at two different hydraulic retention times (HRTs), which were 8 and 12 days, during Period I (September-October) and Period II (October-December), respectively. Algal biomass concentrations varied by operating period because of seasonal changes. Nutrients (ammonia, nitrogen and total phosphorous) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were monitored and efficiently removed in both periods (> 80%), attaining the legislation limits. At the theoretical hydraulic steady state in both periods, pharmaceutical removal reached high levels (> 48%). Two harvesting techniques were applied to the PBR microalgae effluent. Gravity sedimentation was efficient for biomass removal (> 99% in 7 min) in Period I when large particles, flocs and aggregates were present. In contrast, a longer sedimentation time was required when biomass was mainly composed of single cells (88% clarification in a 24 h in Period II). The second harvesting technique investigated was the co-pelletization of algal biomass with the ligninolytic fungus Trametes versicolor, attaining > 98% clarification for Period II biomass once pellets were formed. The novel technology of co-pelletization enabled the complete harvesting of single algae cells from the liquid medium in a sustainable way, which benefits the subsequent use of both biomass and the clarified effluent.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely used in wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In this work, the OH-initiated transformation as well as the hydrolysis of a typical PPCPs, aspirin, was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and laboratory experiments. For DFT calculations, the frontier electron densities and bond dissociation energies were analyzed. Profiles of the potential energy surface were constructed, and all the possible pathways were discussed. Additionally, rate constants for each pathway were calculated with transition state theory (TST) method. UV/H2O2 experiments of aspirin were performed and degradation intermediates were identified by UPLC-MS-MS analysis. Different findings from previous experimental works were reported that the H-abstraction pathways at methyl position were dominated and OH-addition pathways on benzene ring were also favored. Meantime, hydroxyl ASA was confirmed as the main stable intermediate. Moreover, it was the first time to use DFT method to investigate the hydrolysis mechanisms of organic ester compound.

AB Two different electrochemical reduction processes for the removal of dimetridazole, a nitroimidazolebased antibiotic, were examined in this-work. A direct electrochemical reduction was first carried out in a home-made flow cell in acidic medium at potentials chosen to minimize the formation of amino derivatives and then the formation of azo dimer. Analysis of the electrolyzed solution showed a total degradation of dimetridazole and the BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.13 to 0.24. An indirect electrochemical reduction in the presence of titanocene dichloride ((C5H5)(2)TiCl2), which is used to reduce selectively nitro compounds, was then investigated to favour the formation of amino compounds over hydroxylamines and then to prevent the formation of azo and azoxy dimers. UPLC-MS/MS analyses showed a higher selectivity towards the formation of the amino compound for indirect electrolyses performed at pH 2. To confirm the effectiveness of the electrochemical reduction, a biological treatment involving activated sludge was then carried out after direct and indirect electrolyses at different pH. The enhancement of the biodegradability was clearly shown since mineralization yields of all electrolyzed solutions increased significantly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Direct photolysis (UV) and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) treatment using KrCl excilamp (222 nm) were studied and compared in terms of energy requirements for removal of organic micropollutants atrazine (ATZ) and triclosan (TCS) spiked into Milli-Q water, municipal wastewater effluents, deep and surface lake water with dissolved organic carbon of 1 mg/L. The obtained fluence-based rate constants in the range of 2.1-6.2 x 10(-2) cm(2)/mJ and UV fluences for 90% removal (UV90) in the range of 42-153 mJ/cm(2) showed that UV/H2O2 process was more efficient than direct UV in degrading both micropollutants in all water matrices except wastewater. In terms of electrical energy per order (E-EO), the addition of H2O2 decreased the required energy by a factor of 1.4-2.4 for ATZ removal from Milli-Q water and lake waters. For TCS, the E-EO was relatively constant (0.44-0.51 kWh/m(3)) for both UV and UV/H2O2 treatments of Milli-Q water and lake waters. Regarding wastewater, similar UV90 fluences and the additional energy requirement for H2O2 increased the E-EO values for removal of ATZ and TCS. Despite the much lower required UV90 fluences compared with low-pressure mercury lamps, the low radiant efficiency of KrCl excilamp of 5% resulted in E-EO requirements up to 2.0 kWh/m(3).

   TOXICITY
AB The photocatalytic oxidation with UV-A irradiation was tested for the treatment of a mixture of five parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben and benzylparaben) that may be present industrial wastewater. A wide variety of noble metals such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag) and gold (Au), supported on titanium dioxide (TiO2) were used, and their activity was compared with that of pure TiO2 and photolysis. The degradation rate of single parabens followed a pseudo-first order kinetics. Besides, the photocatalytic reaction rate constant based on fluence was also determined. The kinetic constant increased with the number of carbons on the chain linked to the aromatic ring. Direct photolysis led to only 4% of parabens degradation whilst the presence of catalysts improved parabens depletion as well as TOC and COD removal. For the best catalysts, Ag and Pd on TiO2, a reduction higher than 50% of the initial parabens concentration was achieved after 180 min of reaction. The highest degradation rate was attained for BeP with Pd-TiO2 (75%). These catalysts (Ag and Pd) led to a COD removal of 17 and 19%, whereas TOC removal reached 22 and 25%, respectively. The toxicity of the parabens solutions before and after all treatments was evaluated using three different species. For Vibrio fischeri the toxicity after treatment remains high. The germination index of Lepidium sativum increased in the presence of treated effluents while Corbicula fluminea mortality decreased for the solutions treated by photocatalysis using Pd-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2. The fact that total COD removal and mineralization were not achieved, indicates the presence of some final refractory compounds. The toxicity analysis points out that, for the best catalysts, the treated solutions are less environmentally harmful than the initial mixture, since the parabens concentration could be substantially reduced. These results reveal that, even using low catalyst loads, Ag-TiO2 and Pd-TiO2 are interesting catalytic materials for photocatalytic degradation of industrial wastewater containing parabens.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenols (NPs), with a high potential to cause endocrine disruption, have been identified at levels of nanograms per liter and even micrograms per liter in effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a cost-effective wastewater treatment alternative due to the low operational cost, reduced energy consumption, and lower sludge production, and have shown promising performance for treating these compounds. A CW pilot study was undertaken todetermine its potential to remove BPA and NP from municipal wastewater. Three CWs were used: the first CW was planted with Heliconia sp., a second CW was planted with Phragmites sp., and the third CW was an unplanted control. The removal efficiency of the Heliconia-CW was 73 +/- 19% for BPA and 63 +/- 20% for NP, which was more efficient than the Phragmites-CW (BPA 70 +/- 28% and NP 52 +/- 23%) and the unplanted-CW (BPA 62 +/- 33% and NP 25 +/- 37%). The higher capacity of the Heliconia-CW for BPA and NP removal suggests that a native plant from the tropics can contribute to a better performance of CW for removing these compounds.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate from wastewater reuse facilities contains concentrated emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. In this research, a paper-like composite sheet consisting of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zeolite was synthesized, and removal of the antipruritic agent crotamiton from RO concentrate was studied using the TiO2/zeolite composite sheet. The RO concentrate was obtained from a pilot-scale municipal secondary effluent reclamation plant. Effective immobilization of the two powders in the sheet made it easy to handle and to separate the photocatalyst and adsorbent from purified water. The TiO2/zeolite composite sheet showed excellent performance for crotamiton adsorption without obvious inhibition by other components in the RO concentrate. With ultraviolet irradiation, crotamiton was simultaneously removed through adsorption and photocatalysis. The photocatalytic decomposition of crotamiton in the RO concentrate was significantly inhibited by the water matrix at high initial crotamiton concentrations, whereas rapid decomposition was achieved at low initial crotamiton concentrations. The major degradation intermediates were also adsorbed by the composite sheet. This result provides a promising method of mitigating secondary pollution caused by the harmful intermediates produced during advanced oxidation processes. The cyclic use of the HSZ-385/P25 composite sheet indicated the feasibility of continuously removing crotamiton from RO concentrate.

AB The presence of emerging organic micropollutants (such as pharmaceuticals) in sewage has been, for a long time, an issue of great concern within the international scientific debate. This item represents one of the main challenges related to a sustainable development, with particular concern to the public health control. While most of the work has been concentrated on their detection and the evaluation of their average level, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of concentrations of these compounds in the effluent and its capability to affect the concentrations in time of the receiving water body. In this study, three sampling campaigns were carried out at two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Varese area (Northern Italy) with the aim of monitoring the occurrence of some pharmaceuticals to evaluate their removal efficiency. The detected pharmaceuticals were: Ofloxacin, Ibuprofen, Atenolol, Bezafibrate, Carbamazepine, Salbutamol, Cyclophosphamide and Hydrochlorothiazide. The results obtained, together with the analysis of the characteristics of the chemicals and of the two WWTPs, allowed evaluating the factors affecting the spatial and temporal concentration variability in effluent waters and the potential influence of this variability in driving the exposure of the aquatic ecosystems in the receiving water body.

AB This study investigated five different trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) (one hormone: 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), two pharmaceuticals: salicylic acid (SA) and trimethoprim (TMP), one analgesic drug: carbamazepine (CBZ), and one surfactant metabolite: nonylphenol (NP)) removal efficiency at a full-scale Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP). The AWTP achieved average EE2, SA and NP removal over 80% at the biological carbon removal stages. The results also showed a 66% removal of TMP at the nitrogen removal stages. CBZ was recalcitrant throughout the plant, due to its high solubility and low distribution coefficient between wastewater and sludge. Batch experiments were conducted on active and inactive secondary, nitrification and denitrification sludge by adding TOrCs to understand the removal mechanism through sorption and biodegradation. Sorption was the dominant mechanism to remove EE2, SA and NP in secondary treatment processes. In nitrification and denitrification processes, higher percentage of TOrCs removal through biodegradation were observed compared to removal through sorption.

AB There is a lack of knowledge in environmental pollution of the anthropogenic contaminants in wastewater and surface water. Several organic compounds merit special attention, because of their potential risk to the aquatic environment. Therefore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based screening analyses were performed in order to identify anthropogenic organic contaminants and to reveal information on the structural diversity of individual compounds and to characterize their environmental behavior. Wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants in Germany, representing various capacities, and surface water samples from corresponding receiving waters were analyzed. Numerous substances were identified in the samples. Several compounds were treated inadequately during wastewater treatment, and their identification in surface waters highlights their potential impact on the aquatic environment. Contaminants were selected according to available information about their environmental relevance (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential), their possible application or usage and their occurrence within the environment. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that non-target screening analyses be undertaken to identify the structural diversity of anthropogenic organic contaminants and that further investigations of specific anthropogenic compounds be undertaken as a high priority.

AB Sewage sludge is an important amendment that enriches soils with organic matter and provides plants with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. However, knowledge on the fate and effects of organic pollutants present in the sludge on soil organismsis limited. In the present study, the uptake of triclosan, galaxolide, and tonalide in the earthworm Dendrobaena veneta was measured 1 wk after amendment of agricultural soil with sewage sludge, while elimination kinetics were assessed over a 21-d period after transferring worms to clean soil. After 1-wk exposure, earthworms had accumulated 2.6 +/- 0.6 mu g g(-1) galaxolide, 0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g g(-1) tonalide, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1) triclosan. Both synthetic musks were efficiently excreted and below the limit of quantification after 3 and 14 d of depuration for tonalide and galaxolide, respectively. Triclosan concentrations, on the other hand, did not decrease significantly over the depuration period, which may lead to the transfer of triclosan in the food web. (C) 2017 SETAC

   Environmental risk assessment
AB Potential environmental risks of the old antiviral pharmaceuticals ganciclovir (GCV) and valganciclovir (VGCV) were reassessed based on new environmental fate and chronic ecotoxicity tests and on actual use data for Europe. Valganciclovir is hydrolyzed to GCV by intestinal and hepatic esterases, and hence the new environmental tests only refer to GCV. A sorption study showed that GCV will not sorb significantly, excluding the soil as a relevant environmental compartment. Despite earlier data suggesting nondegradability, a new water/sediment fate test showed GCV to be primarily and ultimately degraded and to be nonpersistent. The chronic ecotoxicity tests with algae and daphnids resulted in no inhibition at the highest tested concentrations, whereas a fish partial life cycle test, selected in view of mammalian mutagenicity and reprotoxicity data, showed effects on growth of the young fish, but not on gametogenesis, fertilization, embryogenesis, or teratogenicity. Predicted environmental concentrations were derived based on actual per capita use data for European countries for 2004 to 2014, and the highest was selected for the risk assessment. A comparison of predicted environmental concentrations with predicted no-effect concentrations shows no significant risk for wastewater treatment, surface waters, groundwater, or sediment. In addition, potential risks to (semi) aquatic top predators or to human consumers of water and fish are exceedingly low. (C) 2017 The Author.

AB Diclofenac (hereafter DCF) is an extensively used anti-inflammatory drug; therefore, it is found in many sewage treatment plant effluents and it is one of the most usually reported environmental pharmaceutical contaminants. In this work, the degradation of diclofenac in pure water under UV light was studied, and the influence of some variables, such as humic acids (HA), nitrate anions (NO3-) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) on DCF photodegradation was investigated. The experimental activity was carried out in a batch reactor of 100 mL equipped with fixed UV light of 254 nm and an irradiation intensity of 400 mJ/m(2). Diclofenac initial concentration was equal to 10 mg/L in pure water, and its removal was evaluated by varying HA concentration in the range 1020 mg/L and NO3- concentration in the range 25-50 mg/L. Furthermore, the heterogeneous catalysis with TiO2 (150 mg/L) was studied. Temperature in all experiments was kept constant at 20 degrees C. Experimental results show that while HA have a significant influence on DCF photodegradation, nitrate and titanium dioxide seem to be ineffective, at least in the tested conditions. Finally, DCF photolysis modelling was carried out and a pseudo-firstorder kinetic model was used.

AB The wide use of Acetaminophen (ACT) for pain relief and lack of ability of most wastewater treatment plants to treat ACT residues have increased the risk of surface and groundwater contamination. Constructed wetlands (CW) are a low cost technology for effective wastewater treatment to treat micro-pollutants through the roles of CW media such as adsorption and Fenton reaction. This study aimed to characterize the potential of laterite soil as a CW media for ACT removal from wastewater through Fenton reaction. The experimental data showed enrichment of rhizosphere with exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under ACT contaminant water (hospital wastewater). The contributions of plant uptake and Fenton reaction for ACT removal were found to be 0.04-1.35 and 35.34%, respectively. Media adsorption together with other factors (i.e., microbial degradation and by-product transformation) constituted about 60.76-64.61% of ACT removal. The laterite soil media coupling Fenton reaction was found promising due to advanced degradation of ACT, yielding inorganic, and less toxic final products.

AB Diclofenac, a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is considered for regulation under the European water framework directive. This is because effects on fish have been reported at concentrations around those regularly found in treated sewage effluents (similar to 1 mu g/L). However, a recent publication reports no effects on fish at 320 mu g/L. In this study, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to 0, 4.6, 22, 82 and 271 mu g/L diclofenac in flow-through systems for 28 days using triplicate aquaria per concentration. At the highest concentration, significant mortalities were observed already after 21 days (no mortalities found up to 22 mu g/L). Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of renal hematopoietic tissue (renal hematopoietic hyperplasia) after 28 days at the lowest concentration and at all higher concentrations, following a clear dose-response pattern. Skin ulcerations of the jaw were noted by macroscopic observations, primarily at the two highest concentrations. No histological changes were observed in the liver. There was an increase in the relative hepatic mRNA levels of c7 (complement component 7), a gene involved in the innate immune system, at 22 mu g/L and at all higher concentrations, again following a clear dose-response. The bio-concentration factor was stable across concentrations, but lower than reported for rainbow trout, suggesting lower internal exposure to the drug in the stickleback. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that diclofenac causes histological changes in the three-spined stickleback at low mu g/L concentrations, which cause concern for fish populations exposed to treated sewage effluents.

AB Competitive sorption of sulfamethazine (SMT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfathiazole (STZ) and chloramphenicol (CP) toward functionalized biochar (fBC) was highly pH dependent with maximum sorption at pH similar to 4.0-4.25. Equilibrium data were well represented by the Langmuir and Freundlich models in the order STZ > SMX > CP > SMT. Kinetics data were slightly better fitted by the pseudo second-order model than pseudo first-order and intra-particle-diffusion models. Maximum sorptive interactions occurred at pH 4.0-4.25 through H-bonds formations for neutral sulfonamides species and through negative charge assisted H-bond (CAHB) formation for CP, in addition to pi pi p electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions. EDA was the main mechanism for the sorption of positive sulfonamides species and CP at pH < 2.0. Sorption of negative sulfonamides species and CP at pH > 7.0 was regulated by H-bond formation and proton exchange with water by forming CAHB, respectively. The results suggested fBC to be highly efficient in removing antibiotics mixture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB dThe azole fungicide fluconazole (FLC) is persistent in conventional wastewater treatment plants, thus posing potential threats to human and ecosystem health. This study investigated the oxidation of FLC in aqueous solution by thermally activated persulfate (TAP) under different operation conditions. Higher temperature greatly improved the removal rate of FLC (0.057 h(-1) for 30 degrees C and 0.223 h(-1) for 60 degrees C) and the relationship between pseudo-first-order rate constant (k(obs)) and temperature fit the Arrhenius equation, with a comparatively low activation energy of 37.8 kJ mol(-1). The degradation rate constants were enhanced with the increase of PS concentration during FLC oxidation (0.072 h(-1) for 1.0 mM PS and 0.50 h(-1) for 20 mM PS). Solution pH influenced the k(obs) of FLC degradation and the highest and lowest degradation rates were obtained at pH 3 (0.51 h(-1)) and pH 5 (0.23 h(-1)), respectively. Increasing the level of natural water constituents (HCO3-, Cl-, and humic acid) significantly inhibited FLC degradation. Geometry optimization of FLC was performed using density functional theory (DFT) and the data indicated that the C3 atom in the benzene ring was the most reactive site. SPE-HPLC/MS/ MS analysis showed that intermediate products could form during FLC oxidation by PS and the total organic carbon (TOC) results indicated that FLC could be mineralized into CO2 and H2O. Accordingly, a plausible pathway for the degradation of FLC by the thermally activated PS could be proposed. The results of this study suggested that TAP is an applicable approach for the removal of azole fungicides in water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of five selected pharmaceutical compounds was investigated in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating synthetic sewage. Trimethoprim (Tmp) and sulfamethoxazole (Smx) were consistently removed at efficiencies of 94.2 +/- 5.5%, and 67.8 +/- 13.9%, respectively, while in contrast, only marginal removals of carbamazepine (Cbz) (0.3 +/- 19.0%) and diclofenac (Dcf) (15.0 +/- 7.2%) were achieved. Finally, three distinct stages of triclosan (Tcs) removal were observed: 82.3 +/- 15.0% within the first 10 days; 54.4 +/- 10.4% in the following 30 days; and 31.4 +/- 12.6% in the last 30 days. Adsorption to the sludge was the major contributing factor for its initial high removal. When powdered activated carbon (PAC) was added to the AnMBR, the removal of all five pharmaceuticals improved, especially for Smx and Tcs, which showed removal efficiencies of 95.5 +/- 4.6% and 93.2 +/- 6.6%, respectively. Higher removals of Cbz (92.4 +/- 53%) and Dcf (82.6 +/- 11.1%) were also observed, but only within the initial 5 days of PAC addition, and enhancement in their biotransformation by PAC adsorption was determined to be the major contributing factor for these improved removals.

AB Little is known about the occurrence of emerging environmental contaminants, such as benzotriazoles (BTRs), benzothiazoles (BTHs), benzophenones (BzPs), and bisphenol analogues (BPs) in India. In this study, we determined the occurrence and removal of BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs in five Indian sewage treatment plants (STPs). The respective measured mean concentrations (N = 5) in influents and effluents were 370 and 57.4 ng L-1 for BTRs, 50800 and 20200 ng L-1 for BTHs, 351 and 163 ng L-1 for BzPs, and 98.0 and 9.6 ng L-1 for BPs. Among the target chemicals analyzed, BTHs were found at elevated levels, and the measured levels were some of the highest ever reported in the literature. The mean concentrations (N = 5) of BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs in sludge were 442, 51200, 124, and 200 ng g(-1) dry wt, respectively. The removal efficiencies for BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs ranged as follows: 54.2-85.6%, 23.4-85.0%, 51.8-71%, and 76.0-97.0%, respectively, and were comparable to those reported for other countries. Elevated concentrations of BTHs in Indian STPs can be related to consumption of these chemicals in a wide range of products including paper, textile and rubber materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB People typically discard pharmaceutical products into the trash, or garbage or sewage systems to ultimately ending up in municipal wastewater treatment plants, which traditionally use non-photochemical ozonation to decompose contaminants, but often failing to completely eliminate them. Accordingly, photochemical advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed to remedy such situations. Unfortunately, these remain at the developmental stages and have yet to be implemented in practical applications. This review describes UV/ozonation, UV/peroxidation, UV/ozonation/peroxidation, photo-Fenton processes, and photo-catalytic oxidation processes (e.g. UV/TiO2) all of which depend on generating highly reactive oxygen species (e.g., center dot OH radicals, hydroperoxy radicals, superoxide anion radicals) to dispose of emerging aquatic contaminants. Albeit non-exhaustive, the review explores the progress made in the last 2-3 years by focusing on light-driven degradation processes to eliminate such pharmaceutical contaminants as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics and hormones, many of which have been detected in aqueous ecosystems.

AB The distributions of 31 pharmaceuticals grouped into nine therapeutic classes, including six anticancer drugs, were investigated in the waters and sediments of an urban river in Japan. The coefficients of sorption (logK(d)) to the river sediments were also determined from the results of a field survey and laboratory-scale experiment. Three anticancer drugs-bicalutamide, doxifluridine, and tamoxifen-were detected in the river sediments at maximum concentrations of 391, 392, and 250 ng/kg, respectively. In addition, the transformation products of psychotropic carbamazepine (2-hydroxy carbamazepine, acridine, and acridone) were detected in the range of 108 ng/kg (2-hydroxy carbamazepine) to 2365 ng/kg (acridine), and the phytoestrogen glycitein was detected in the range of N. D. to 821 ng/kg. The logK(d) values of the targeted pharmaceuticals in river sediments in the field survey ranged from 0.5 (theophylline) to 3.3 (azithromycin). These results were in accord with those of the laboratory-scale sorption experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of the anticancer drugs bicalutamide and tamoxifen, the transformation products of carbamazepine (2-hydroxy carbamazepine, acridine, and acridone), and the phytoestrogen genistein in river sediments.

AB In this research, ZnO-ZnAl2O4 mixed phases were prepared by calcination of Zn-Al-CO3 layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursors. Firstly, a series of Zn-Al-CO3 LDH were synthesized at different Zn/Al molar ratios (r = 1, 3 and 5) and then calcined at different temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C) for 6 h. The materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA/DTA, ICP-AES and TEM. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated for the degradation of caffeine as a model pharmaceutical pollutant in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. The effect of the Zn/Al molar ratio, calcination temperature and initial pH of aqueous solution was investigated. The experimental results show that the sample obtained from the molar ratio of 3 and calcined at 500 degrees C with a large capacity of adsorption obtained by reconstruction process was photocatalytically much higher than standard Degussa P-25 titanium dioxide.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses a range of risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Consumers contribute to pharmaceutical pollution via use and disposal of medications, though data on such behaviors is limited. This paper investigates the purchasing, use, and disposal practices among a population that has been researched only minimally to date, yet will determine pharmaceutical pollution for decades to come: young adults represented by a university student population. We employed an online, 21-question survey to examine behaviors related to pharmaceuticals among students at the University of Vermont (n = 358). Results indicate that the majority of respondents had purchased medications in the previous 12 months (94%), and had leftover drugs (61%). Contrary to previous studies of older populations, only a small proportion of students had disposed of drugs (18%); municipal trash was the primary route of drug disposal (25%), and very few students disposed drugs via flushing (1%). Less than a quarter of students were aware of drug take-back programs (24%), and only 4% had ever used take-back services. These findings indicate that the university student population may be storing a large volume of unused drugs.that will require future disposal. Increasing awareness of, access to, and participation in pro-environment pharmaceutical behaviors, such as purchasing over-the-counter medication in smaller quantities and utilizing drug take-back programs, could minimize future pharmaceutical pollution from this population.

AB Advanced oxidation processes including UV, UV/H2O2, Fenton reaction (Fe(II)/H2O2) and Photo Fenton process (Fe(II)/H2O2/UV) for degradation of paracetamol, Bisphenol A, and dibutyl phthalate as endocrine disrupting chemicals(EDCs) are investigated in this study. A comparison among these techniques is undertaken with respect to the decrease of total organic carbon (TOC). Optimum operating conditions for each understudied process revealed the effect of the initial amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Among the tested processes, the Photo Fenton process was found to be the most efficient with respect to TOC reduction of the wastewater within 50 min reaction time under low amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide of 2.7 and 5 mmol/L respectively and amounted to 100% TOC removal for all the studied EDCs. Photo Fenton was followed by UV/H2O2, Fenton and UV only respectively in TOC removal.
   Paracetamol showed the highest removal followed by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) while, Bisphenol A came in the end. Scavenger experiment proved that the degradation takes place mainly through hydroxyl radical mechanism. As well, studying the toxicity of produced water showed that the treated water is non-toxic.

AB Amide pharmaceuticals cannot be removed easily in conventional wastewater treatment processes, and the dosage of redox mediators may enhance their removals under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic batch experiments were carried out for the removals of amide pharmaceuticals with the dosage of ferroferric oxide or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. Factors of redox mediators, organic carbon and steps of anaerobic treatment on the removals of amide pharmaceuticals were evaluated. For primidone, carbamazepine and crotamiton, their removals were poor during anaerobic treatment, and the addition of redox mediators enhanced their removals. For sulfamethoxazole, it was effectively removed by anaerobic treatment (above 90%) and the dosage of redox mediator accelerated its removal. The cooperation of carbon source and redox mediators accelerated the removals of amide pharmaceuticals, but the types of organic carbon had little influence on the anaerobic degradation of amide pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the hydrolysis/acidification step contributed significantly to the removal of amide pharmaceuticals during anaerobic treatment. For the control of amide pharmaceuticals in wastewater, the incorporation of anaerobic process into the wastewater treatment stream is a valuable strategy, especially with the dosage of redox mediators.

AB Human pharmaceuticals such as Acetaminophen, Atenolol and Carbamazepine are pseudo persistent aquatic pollutants with yet unknown sub-lethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were exposed to Acetaminophen: 31.90 +/- 11.07 mu g L-1 ; Atenolol: 0.95 +/- 0.38.mu g L-1 and Carbamazepine: 6.95 +/- 0.13 mu g L-1 in a 28 day flow through experiment to (1) determine whether exposure to low concentrations in the mu g L-1 range of the pharmaceuticals alters the brain transcriptome and, (2) identify different expression profiles and treatment specific modes of action and pathways. Despite low exposure concentrations, 411, 7 and 612 differently expressed transcripts were identified in the individual treatments with Acetaminophen, Atenolol and Carbamazepine, respectively. Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed a significant over representation of several biological processes, cellular compartment features and molecular functions for both Acetaminophen and Carbamazepine treatments. Overall, the results obtained in seabream brain suggest similar physiological responses to those observed in humans also at environmental concentrations, as well as the existence of treatment specific processes that may be useful for the development of biomarkers of contamination.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics. SMX degradation in sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge systems has not been reported so far. This research investigated the SMX degradation using SRB sludge in a sulfate-reducing up-flow sludge bed reactor. Moreover, the mechanisms and kinetics of SMX removal were also investigated using SRB sludge via a series of batch experiments. The results showed that SMX removal was characterized by a rapid sorption onto SRB sludge, and desorption from SRB sludge to aqueous phase until achieving equilibrium, and then followed by slow biodegradation. Biodegradation was the dominant route for SMX removal. The sorption process conformed well to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, meaning that the sorption occurred primarily via a chemical sorption process. The removal of SMX followed the pseudo-zero-order kinetic model with a specific removal rate of 13.2 +/- 0.1 mu g/L/d at initial SMX concentration 100 mu g/L in batch tests. Based on the analysis of metabolites, most of the SMX biotransformation products' structures altered in the isoxazole ring, which were significantly different from that produced by aerobic and anaerobic sludge systems. Thus, SRB sludge system could play an important role in SMX biodegradation, especially in Sulfate-reduction Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI) process for sewage treatment.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) and regulated compounds (RCs) from three different WWTP effluents were measured in the current study. The efficiency of two tertiary treatments, Photobiotreatment (PhtBio) and Multi-Barrier Treatment (MBT), for removing contaminants was determined. Results indicated different percentages of removal depending on the treatment and the origin of the effluent. Risk Quotients (RQs) were determined for different species of algae, Daphnia, and fish. RQ results revealed diverse risk values depending on the bioindicator species. Tonalide, galaxolide (fragrances), and ofloxacin (antibiotic) were the most persistent and harmful substances in tested effluents. "Negligible risk" category was reached since a wide diversity of ECs were removed by MBT with high removal percentages. Contrarily, PhtBio was effective only in the depuration of certain chemical compounds, and its efficiency depended on the composition of the raw effluent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Norfloxacin is often found in wastewater treatment plants, groundwater, and even drinking water causing environmental concerns because of its potential undesirable effects on human health or aquatic ecosystems. However, conventional treatments cannot deal with norfloxacin efficiently. This work proposes an efficiently enzymatic degradation of norfloxacin by chloroperoxidase (CPO). 82.18% degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was achieved after 25 min reaction time at pH 5.0 with an enzyme concentration of 1.5 x 10(-9) mol L-1. HPLC-MS was used to determine the intermediates or final products. The product analysis and determination of the chemical oxygen demand indicated if the enzymatic degradation by CPO was carried out before the usually existing bioremediation techniques (usually activated sludge) in sewage treatment plant, the effluent containing norfloxacin can be decontaminated more efficiently and thoroughly than that only by activated sludge treatment. The eco-toxicity tests using a green algae, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, indicated that the toxicity of degraded products of norfloxacin was lower than the parent norfloxacin molecule. CPO-catalyzed degradation of norfloxacin is a promising alternative for treating effluent containing norfloxacin.

AB The conditions for the treatment of high phosphorus pharmaceutical wastewater using chemical precipitation were determined to achieve high efficiency on the removal of total phosphorus (TP). The key factors affecting the TP removal efficiencies of four metal salts (FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, and CaCl2), such as molar ratio, initial wastewater pH, and reaction time, were investigated. The optimal metal mole ratios of FeCl3, AlCl3P, MgCl2, and CaCl2 for the TP removal were 1.8:1, 1.8:1, 1.6:1, and 1.6:1 in the initial pH range, respectively. The TP removal efficiencies obtained by FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, and CaCl2 were 99.8%, 98.3%, 96.9%, and 99.2% at the optimal mole ratio and pH conditions with 30min reaction time, respectively. FeCl3 and AlCl3 had better removal performance on COD, wherein the removal rates of COD by FeCl3 and AlCl3 were 38.6% and 27.6%, respectively. FeCl3 and CaCl2 were selected for the combined process of removing TP and overcoming the aforementioned problem. The final effluent quality was better than the one only used on one of the four metal salts, in which the removal rates of TP and COD were as high as 99.8% and 46.9%, respectively. The combined process with FeCl3 and CaCl2 was an effective method for the pretreatment of high phosphorus pharmaceutical wastewater to reduce the processing cost and to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TP.

AB Seasonal variations in the concentrations of eight ultraviolet (UV) filters and 22 illicit drugs including their metabolites in the Korean aquatic environment were investigated. Seawater samples from three beaches, water samples from two rivers, and influents and effluents from three wastewater treatment plants were analyzed. The UV filter concentrations in the seawater, river water, and effluent samples were 39.4-296, 35.4-117, and 6.84-51.1 ng L-1, respectively. The total UV filter concentrations in the seawater samples were 1.9-4.4 times higher at the peak of the holiday season than outside the peak holiday season. An environmental risk assessment showed that ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) could cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the seawater at the three beaches during the holiday period. Seven of the 22 target illicit drugs including their metabolites were detected in the wastewater influent samples, and the total illicit drug concentrations in the influent samples were 0.08-65.4 ng L-1 The estimated daily consumption rates for cis-tramadol (Cis-TRM), methamphetamine (MTP), meperidine (MEP), and codeine (COD) were 25.7-118.4, 13.8-36.1, 136-12.6, and 1.75-8.64 mg d(-1) (1000 people)(-1), respectively. In popular vacation area, the illicit drug consumption rates (Cis-TRM, MTP and MEP) were 1.6-2.6 times higher at the peak of the summer holiday season than at the beginning of the summer.

AB The reuse of treated municipal sewage ('biosolids') on land is an effective method to divert waste away from landfill and to use an alternative, low cost method of fertilisation. While legislation has mainly focused on the control of nutrient and metal application rates to land, other potentially harmful emerging contaminants (ECs) may be present in biosolids. Up to 80% of municipal sewage sludge is reused in agriculture in Ireland, which is currently the highest rate of reuse in Europe. However, unlike other countries, no study has been conducted on the presence of ECs across a range of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in this country. This study evaluated the concentrations of two ECs in sewage sludge, the antimicrobials triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC), and their presence in surface runoff following land application in controlled rainfall simulation studies. In 16 WWTPs, concentrations of TCS and TCC were 0.61 and 0.08 mu g g(-1), which is at the lower end of concentrations measured in other countries. The concentrations in runoff post land application were also mainly below the limits of detection (90 ng L-1 for TCS, 6 ng L-1 for TCC), indicating that runoff is not a significant pathway of entry into the environment.

   RAPID ANALYSIS
AB Ozone oxidation has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment process for the attenuation of trace organic compounds (TOrCs); however, predicting TOrC attenuation by ozone processes is challenging in wastewaters. Since ozone is rapidly consumed, determining the exposure times of ozone and hydroxyl radical proves to be difficult. As direct potable reuse schemes continue to gain traction, there is an increasing need for the development of real-time monitoring strategies for TOrC abatement in ozone oxidation processes. Hence, this study is primarily aimed at developing indicator and surrogate models for the prediction of TOrC attenuation by ozone oxidation. To this end, the second-order kinetic equations with a second-phase Rd value (ratio of hydroxyl radical exposure to molecular ozone exposure) were used to calculate comparative kinetics of TOrC attenuation and the reduction of indicator and spectroscopic surrogate parameters, including UV absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) and total fluorescence (TF). The developed indicator model using meprobamate as an indicator compound and the surrogate models with UVA254 and TF exhibited good predictive power for the attenuation of 13 kinetically distinct TOrCs in five filtered and unfiltered wastewater effluents (R-2 values > 0.8). This study is intended to help provide a guideline for the implementation of indicator/surrogate models for real-time monitoring of TOrC abatement with ozone processes and integrate them into a regulatory framework in water reuse.

AB Biosolids are a potentially valuable source of carbon and nutrients for agricultural soils; however, potential unintended impacts on human health and the environment must be considered. Virtually all biosolids contain trace amounts endocrine-disrupting chemicals derived from human use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). One potential way to reduce the bioavailability of PPCPs is to co-apply biosolids with biochar to soil, because biochar's chemical (e.g., aromaticity) and physical properties (e.g., surface area) give it a high affinity to bind many organic chemicals in the environment. We developed a soil-specific extraction method and utilized a luciferase-based bioassay (CALUX) to detect endocrine active chemicals in a biosolids-biochar co-amendment soil greenhouse study. Both biochar (walnut shell, 900 degrees C) and biosolids had positive impacts on carrot and lettuce biomass accumulation over our study period. However, the walnut shell biochar stimulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suggesting the presence of potential endocrine active chemicals in the biochar. Since the biochar rate tested (100 t ha(-1)) is above the average agronomic rate (10-20 t ha(-1)), endocrine effects would not be expected in most environmental applications. The effect of high temperature biochars on endocrine system pathways must be explored further, using both quantitative analytical tools to identify potential endocrine active chemicals and highly sensitive bioanalytical assays such as CALUX to measure the resulting biological activity of such compounds.

AB This paper describes the development of an integrative embryo-toxicity assay in Japanese medaka allowing analysis of several toxicological endpoints together in a same individual. In this assay, embryos are topically exposed, and survival, hatching success, malformations, biometry, behaviour, and target gene expression are subsequently analysed in each individual. This assay was applied to oxazepam, an anxiolytic pharmaceutical compound currently found in wastewater treatment plant effluent. Even if oxazepam accumulation in embryos was very low, it caused spinal and cardiac malformations, delayed growth, erratic swimming and deregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and mitochondrial metabolism. Relationship between gene deregulation, abnormal behaviour, and developmental anomalies was demonstrated. This assay is sensitive enough to detect adverse effects at low chemical concentrations and at multiple endpoints in a unique fish embryo. This integrative embryo-toxicity assay is a powerful tool to characterize the spectrum of effects of new chemicals and also to link effects induced at different molecular, tissue and physiological levels.

AB This study investigated the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin during the treatment of real wastewater using high rate algal ponds (HRAP). When spiked at 2 mg/L into primary domestic wastewater, ciprofloxacin (CPX) was efficiently removed from laboratory scale photobioreactors continuously operated under various durations of artificial illumination and hydraulic residence times. Subsequent batch tests conducted with reactor microcosms showed CPX removal was mainly caused by photodegradation during daytime, and sorption to biomass during night time. These findings were confirmed during an experiment conducted in a 1000 L pilot HRAP operated outdoors, as well as during outdoor batch assays conducted using pilot HRAP microcosms. While these results highlight a potentially interesting treatment capacity in comparison to conventional biological treatment, further research must confirm these findings at relevant pollutant concentration (ng-mu g/L) and determine the fate and potential toxicity of degradation products.

AB A new enzymatic assay method that uses deconjugation enzymes was developed to evaluate the presence and extent of conjugated pharmaceuticals in the form of glucuronide conjugates or sulphate conjugates in river environments. First, acetaminophen glucuronide (Ace Glu) and acetaminophen sulphate (Ace Sul) were used as model conjugated pharmaceuticals to determine the appropriate combination of deconjugation enzymes and reaction conditions, including temperature, duration and pH. Next, we applied the defined method to 19 pharmaceuticals grouped into nine therapeutic classes that were chosen based on previously detected levels and frequencies in sewage and river water. The enzymatic decomposition profile varied widely depending upon the enzyme preparations available. The effect of the water reaction temperature was small between 5 and 40 degrees C, and the reaction proceeded in for both glucuronide conjugates and sulphate conjugates at an approximately neutral pH (corresponding to usual river water conditions) within 1 h. Application of the method to environmental samples showed that some pharmaceuticals were present in both glucuronide conjugate and sulphate conjugated forms, although glucuronide conjugates were the primary forms in the river water environment. Water treatment systems at sewage treatment plants were found to be effective for the removal of these conjugated compounds. The present results should be valuable in the environmental risk assessment of conjugated pharmaceuticals and in keeping river environments clean. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that enables the evaluation of the pharmaceutical deconjugation potential in a river environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption on carbon materials (AC-F400, AC-PS, AC-RH, CNF and MWNT) has revealed as an effective treatment for the removal of two representative pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, CBZ, and ciprofloxacin, CPX) in ultrapure water, as isolated compounds and as a mixture of both of them. Accordingly, a real pharmaceutical effluent containing these substances was efficiently treated by adsorption with the tested carbon adsorbents. A relatively high adsorption rate (equilibrium time of 4 h) and large carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin adsorption capacities (q(CBZ) = 242 mg g(-1), q(CPX) = 264 mg g(-1)) were found, using adsorbent doses ranging from 2 to 3 g L-1, natural pH, temperature of 30 degrees C and stirring rate of 250 rpm. Thus, the decreasing in the adsorption removal was observed for both contaminants when the mixture CBZ-CPX was treated, reaching up to 80.5% of decreasing in CBZ adsorption (in presence of CPX) onto F-400 activated carbon. The bi-component adsorption systems were reasonably well-fitted by the extended Freundlich model equation. Meanwhile, the reduction of macroscopic parameters (Total Organic Concentration, TOC, Total Nitrogen, TN, carbonates (CO32-) and aromaticity) in the real hospital wastewater was achieved in high percentages (from 64 to 98.8%). Moreover, the carbon adsorbents were proven as efficient materials in the removal of the pharmaceutical compounds from the hospital effluent matrix; after the treatment, only trace-level concentrations of atenolol and trazodone were detected.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical and personal care products increases their concentrations in the wastewater entering treatment plants and their levels into biological reactors. The most extended biological wastewater treatment is the activated sludge process. The toxicity of ibuprofen and triclosan, individually and combined, was studied by tracking the biological activity of the activated sludge measuring oxygen uptake rate and the inhibition of the esterase activity. Short-term exposure produced significant inhibition in oxygen uptake, with lower damage to enzymatic activity. Median effect values for oxygen uptake inhibition were 64 +/- 13 mg L-1 and 0.32 +/- 0.07 mg L-1 for ibuprofen and triclosan respectively using 125 mg L-1 activated sludge. For the inhibition of enzymatic activity values were 633 +/- 63 mg L-1 for ibuprofen and 1.94 0.32 mg L-1 for triclosan. Results indicated that oxygen uptake, related to primary activity of microorganisms, was more strongly affected than the enzymatic activity associated to energy consumption. Toxicity interactions were determined using the Combination Index-isobologram method. Results showed antagonism at lower values of affected population, after which the mixtures tended to additivity and synergism. For the case of enzymatic activity, the antagonism was less marked and the additivity range was higher. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present research investigated the treatment of hospital laundry wastewaters by the combined use of photochemical VUV and UVC reactors. Seven different configurations were tested and the performances of each of them were evaluated based on the removal of the load parameters, detoxification and life cycle assessment (LCA). The characterization of studied wastewaters included analysis of the following parameters: COD, BOD5, TKN, total P, pH, turbidity and conductivity. Acute ecotoxicity was evaluated using Daphnia magna. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was performed to determine the organic fraction and chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the qualitative characterization of priority pollutants. Characterization parameters showed the presence of drugs like lidocaine and dipyrone and a high organic load with a poor biodegradability. Wastewaters presented an extreme acute toxicity against D. magna (EC50, 6.7%). The ozonation process (mainly generated by the VUV reactor) obtained the best results concerning the ratio between the consumed energy and the removed COD and the UVC process presented the lowest environmental impacts for the characterization and normalization parameters of the LCA. Normalization revealed that the highest environmental burdens were associated with human toxicity, ecotoxicity and eutrophication of surface waters as well as to the use of non-renewable resources. VUV/UVC/O-3 process presented the best results considering detoxification (EC50 100%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation and removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) on ultrapure (UPW) and natural water (NW) by ozone (O-3) and ozone/powdered activated carbon (O-3/PAC) have been studied. The OMPs atrazine (ATZ, herbicide), carbamazepine (CBZ, anticonvulsant), diclofenac (DCL, anti-inflammatory) and triclosan (TCS, antimicrobial) are incorporated continuously and uncontrolled on water treatment systems (e.g., drinking water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants).
   Batch experiments on ultrapure and natural water showed that ATZ treated with 03 and O-3/PAC has the slowest transformation rate (>90% at 30 min reaction) while CBZ, DCL and TCS were oxidized very fast (>90% at similar to 5 min). The radical scavenger tert-Butyl alcohol (TBA) was used to evaluate the contribution of HO' on the OMPs oxidation. TBA, a hydrophilic compound with low adsorbability, was used as a strong HO' scavenger to assess the role of the OH radical in the oxidation of the OMPs studied. ATZ oxidation was mainly driven by OH radicals. On the contrary, CBZ, DCL and TCS were removed by direct reaction with ozone. Infrared analysis (FTIR) showed changes in the PAC surface functional groups of the carbon exposed to ozone, decreasing its basic properties.
   The acute toxicity assays of the OMPs mixture dissolved in UPW performed with D. magna was significantly reduced by ozonation. The addition of PAC to the ozonation process, strongly improved the acute toxicity removal.Short chain mono- and di-carboxylic acids were identified as some of the oxidation intermediates formed during ozone treatment.

AB Knowledge regarding the impact of tourism on the emergence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in Alpine river waters is limited and scarce. Therefore, a study on the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal variability of 105 PPCPs in an Alpine river basin located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region (North-Eastern Italy) has been conducted. We observed that the total concentration of analyzed PPCPs was generally higher in all sampling sites during winter than in the summer. The analysis of tourist data revealed that during both sampling campaigns the number of tourists was lower in the downstream sites in comparison with the upstream area of the basin (Val di Sole). Particularly, sampling sites located near important tourist resorts have shown the highest abundance of the PPCPs during winter, being analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antihypertensives and antibiotics the most abundant pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Diclofenac showed the highest concentration amongst PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 675 ng L-' in the sampling site situated downstream of the Tonale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Antihypertensives were found at concentrations >300 ng L-1, while antibiotics were quantified up to 196 ng L-1, respectively. Amongst personal care products (PCPs), the most abundant compound was octyl-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (ODPABA) with concentrations reaching up to 748 ng L-1 in the sampling site situated within the Rotaliana district In general, concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in water than in the sediment samples. The most frequently detected PhACs in sediments from both sampling campaigns were antibiotics, while amongst PCPs in sediments, octocrylene (OC) showed the highest concentration in both sampling campaigns. As a result, this study highlights the potential impact of tourism on the water quality of the Alpine aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the risks to aquatic organisms posed by 12 commonly detected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that are extensively used in Bohai coastal region of China were examined. These were linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), nonylphenol (NP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ERY), bisphenol A (BPA), ofloxacin (OFL), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX), atenolol (ATL) and metoprolol (MET). Their relative risk was ranked based on the proximity between the medians of the reported effect concentrations and measured river or lake water concentrations. The surfactants (LAS) and endocrine disrupting chemicals NP (a breakdown product of the surfactant nonylphenol polyethoxylate) and DEHP (a plasticizer) were identified as posing the greatest risk from this range of chemicals. LAS had a hundred-fold higher risk than any of the pharmaceuticals. The highest risk ranked pharmaceuticals were all antibiotics. Zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg) were added to the comparison as representative heavy metals. Zn posed a risk higher than all the organics. The risk posed by Hg was less than the surfactants but greater than the selected pharmaceuticals. Whereas LAS and DEHP could cause harmful effects to all the wildlife groups, NP and BPA posed the greatest risk to fish. Antibiotics showed the highest risk to algae. Spatial and temporal distributions of PPCPs and EDCs were conducted for risk identification, source analysis and seasonal change exploration. Municipal sewage effluent linked to urban areas was considered to be the major source of pharmaceuticals. With regard to seasonal influence the risk posed by LAS to the aquatic organisms was significantly affected by wet and dry seasonal change. The dilution effects were the common feature of LAS and ERY risks. The difference in LAS and ERY risk patterns along the rivers was mainly affected by the elimination process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Poor removal of many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage treatment leads to their discharge into the receiving waters, where they may cause negative effects. Their elimination from the water column depends of several processes, including photochemical and biological degradation. We have focused this research on comparing the degradation kinetics of a wide number (n = 33) of frequently detected PPCPs considering different types of water, pH and solar irradiation. For those compounds that were susceptible of photodegradation, their rates (k) varied from 0.02 to 30.48 h(-1) at pH 7, with the lowest values for antihypertensive and psychiatric drugs (t(1/2) > 1000 h). Modification of the pH turned into faster disappearance of most of the PPCPs (e.g., k = 0.072 and 0.066 h(-1) for atenolol and carbamazepine at pH 4, respectively). On the other hand, biodegradation was enhanced by marine bacteria in many cases, for example for mefenamic acid, caffeine and triclosan (k = 0.019, 0.01 and 0.04 h(-1), respectively), and was faster for anionic surfactants. Comparing photodegradation and biodegradation processes, hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac, both not biodegradable, were eliminated exclusively by irradiation (t(1/2) = 0.15-0.43 h and t(1/2) = 0.14-0.17 h, respectively). Salicylic acid and phenylbutazone were efficiently photo (t(1/2) <3 h) and biodegraded (t(1/2) = 116-158 h), whereas some compounds such as ibuprofen, carbamazepine and atenolol had low degradation rates by any of the processes tested (t(1/2) = 23-2310 h), making then susceptible to persist in the aquatic media.

AB Despite the large number of pharmaceutically active compounds found in natural environments little is known about their transport behavior in groundwater, which is complicated by their wide range of physical and chemical properties. The transport behavior of five widely used and often detected pharmaceutical compounds and one lifestyle drug has therefore been investigated, using a set of three column experiments. The investigated compounds were the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, the lifestyle drug caffeine, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen. The columns were filled with three different types of sand. The substrates consisted of artificially prepared iron coated sand, artificially prepared organic carbon sand (with 5% leaf compost), and natural aquifer sand from Long Point, Ontario (Canada). The experiments were conducted simultaneously under the same hydraulic conditions and with the same input solution of about 1 mu g.L-1 of each compound. The transport behavior of the organic compounds differed significantly between both the different columns and the different compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the retardation factors for carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen and the organic carbon content of the substrate. While the retardation increased with increasing organic carbon content, no direct relationship was observed between the organic carbon content and the removal of these compounds. In contrast, the retardation factors for sulfamethoxazole and naproxen showed no correlation with the organic carbon content but these compounds were significantly removed in the presence of organic matter. The influence of the Fe3+ surfaces in the iron-coated sand was less significant than expected, with all compounds except for sulfamethoxazole having retardation factors <1.8. Caffeine was so strongly removed during transport through those substrates containing organic carbon that no reliable retardation factor could be determined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel process consisted of an anaerobic bioscrubber was studied at the field scale for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from a printing press facility. The pilot unit worked under high fluctuating waste gas emissions containing ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 1-ethoxy-2-propanol as main pollutants, with airflows ranging between 184 and 1253 m(3) h(-1) and an average concentration of 1126 +/- 470 mg-C Nm(-3). Three scrubber configurations (cross-flow and vertical-flow packings and spray tower) were tested, and cross-flow packing was found to be the best one. For this packing, daily average values of VOC removal efficiency ranged between 83% and 93% for liquid to air volume ratios between 3.5.10(-3) and 9.1.10(-3). Biomass growth was prevented by periodical chemical cleaning; the average pressure drop was 165 Pa m(-1). Rapid initiation of anaerobic degradation was achieved by using granular sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant. Despite the intermittent and fluctuating organic load, the expanded granular sludge bed reactor showed an excellent level of performance, reaching removal efficiencies of 93 +/- 5% at 25.1 +/- 3.2 degrees C, with biogas methane content of 94 +/- 3% in volume. Volatile fatty acid concentration was as low as 200 mg acetic acid L-1 by treating daily average organic loads up to 3.0 kg COD h(-1), equivalent to 24 kg COD m(-3) bed d(-1). The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed the initial shift of the domains Archaea and Bacteria associated with the limitation of the carbon source to a few organic solvents. The Archaea domain was more sensitive, resulting in a drop of the Shannon index from 1.07 to 0.41 in the first 123 days. Among Archaea, the predominance of Methanosaeta persisted throughout the experimental period. The increase in the proportion of Methanospirillum and Methanobacterium sp. was linked to the spontaneous variations of operating temperature and load, respectively. Among Bacteria, high levels of ethanol degraders (Geobacter and Pelobacter sp.) were observed during the trial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study describes the catalytic ozonation of clofibric acid (CFA) under ambient conditions using copper oxide catalysts synthesized by different methods. The objective of this study is to provide novel catalysts and reaction mechanism for the degradation of emerging pharmaceutical compounds in aqueous solution. Among the various Cu catalysts screened in this study, the Cut-Ali oxide catalyst showed an excellent activity and stability in the degradation and mineralization of CFA. In situ attenuated total reflection IR (ATR-IR) spectroscopy was used to examine the interaction of ozone with the active sites of the catalyst in presence of water and to investigate the possible catalytic mechanism. The presence of Lewis acid sites in the Cut-Ali catalyst increased the amount of chemisorbed water enhancing stronger interaction of ozone to form surface activated species, resulting in higher catalytic activity. The results obtained from in-situ ATR-IR study indicate that surface hydroxyl groups and Lewis acid sites are responsible for promoting the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OHS) from aqueous ozone.

AB For the first time the occurrence of 26 nitrogen heterocyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (N-HETs) and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) as a marker for anthropogenic influence was determined in an entire river system and its influents. Besides the investigation of diurnal and annual variations in concentrations, dilution and load calculations, the aims were to facilitate transferability to other rivers by identifying sources of the different substances. To create a sufficient database over 180 aqueous samples from the River Fuhse (Lower Saxony, Germany), its catchment area, effluents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rainwater were analyzed. Typical substances found in background water samples and rain samples were quinoline and isoquinoline, whereas 1-/3-methylisoquinoline were traced back to an industrial WWTP. Due to similar concentration levels in the effluents of municipal WWTPs, their impact on the river correlated with their nominal loads. In municipal WWTP effluents CBZ (c(median) = 1693 ng L-1), 2-methylquinoline (c(median) = 64 ng L-1), and acridine (c(median) = 62 ng L-1) prevailed. Although the occurrence of N-HETs at contaminated sites is a widely discussed scientific topic, this study showed that the investigated site was a source with only small volumetric contribution to N-HET concentrations in the adjacent river. In total the River Fuhse discharges 20 kg a(-1) N-HETs and 21 kg a(-1) CBZ into the receiving river. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage epidemiology is a real-time tool used to monitor tobacco consumption. In this study, we investigated the tobacco consumption in eight cities in Jilin province using sewage epidemiology. We collected influent wastewater samples from ten wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that serve nearly four million people. Mean nicotine (NIC) loads ranged from 1.42 to 14.2 mg/d/capita, whereas mean cotinine (COT) loads showed lower levels with 033 to 2.15 mg/d/capita. Population size was estimated to provide an accurate and real-time population based on ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) concentration in influent. To verify the NH4-N equivalent population, we compared these results with the corresponding population estimated based on the expert knowledge of the local WWTPs operators. Daily consumption of NIC was estimated to be approximately 2.39 +/- 1.47 mg/d/capita. Monte Carlo simulation was used to analyze uncertainty and variability in the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers in the range of 9.8 to 31.4 per day with a median of 16.9. The data of tobacco consumption in this study coordinated strongly with a traditional survey on the consumption of tobacco in China, indicating sewage epidemiology with NH4-N equivalent population estimation may provide a suitable and useful tool for tobacco use monitoring.

AB Omeprazole is one of the world-wide most frequently prescribed and administered pharmaceuticals in humans for the relief of gastro-intestinal disorders. Despite its high worldwide consumption, omeprazole is rarely detected in urban wastewaters and environmental waters. On the other hand, its human urinary metabolites and transformation products formed through abiotic processes in the environment have been recently documented. Despite these available data, however, there is still a lack of information on the extent of environmental fate and occurrence, on elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in waste water treatment plants. In this study, the relevance of photodegradation processes on the environmental persistence of omeprazole under simulated and solar irradiation was investigated. Photodegradation experiments were performed in distilled water, lake, river and seawater, and revealed that the different matrix in natural waters significantly affect the photolytic behavior of the investigated compound. Overall, the results highlight that photodegradation process by solar irradiation significantly contributes to omeprazole degradation and elimination from the aquatic environment. TPs formed through the process were identified and elucidated by using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry. In total seven TPs were identified, among of which four were also detected as hydrolysis TPs. The Microtox bioassay showed that solar photolysis is efficient to detoxify omeprazole and its TPs in aqueous solutions. Finally, a systematic investigation was conducted in order to provide information on removal efficiency and occurrence of omeprazole and its metabolites/TPs in 8 WWTPs in North West Greece by performing target and suspect screening analysis. The findings revealed the presence of both parent compound and metabolites/TPs in wastewaters. Given, however, the scarce detection of omeprazole at fairly low concentration levels, from analytical and environmental point of view, further attention should be given to metabolites/fPs instead of the parent compound.

AB Wastewater indicator is a useful tool for evaluating the wastewater impact on natural water, but there is little information about the suitability of wastewater indicators for different regions. This study aimed to select suitable wastewater indicators in the Pearl River Delta region, south China by screening a range of wastewater related organic compounds. The screening campaign was carried out by investigating the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 93 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 5 artificial sweeteners (ASs) in nine wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the region, and the occurrence of these target compounds in the contaminated and clean surface water of the Pearl River. An ideal wastewater indicator should be hydrophilic, source-specific for domestic wastewater, ubiquitous in contaminated surface water with detection frequency (DF) >80% and absent in background water samples. For liable indicators, high removal rates (>90%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the influent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. For conservative indicators, low removal rates (<50%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the effluent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. Based on the above criteria, sucralose and fluconazole were selected as conservative indicators in the region, while cyclamate, saccharin, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben, paracetamol, salicylic acid and caffeine were selected as liable indicators.

AB The cost-effective and energy-efficient removal of organic micropollutants (MPs) from water and wastewater is challenging. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of porous beta-cyclodextrin polymers (P-CDP) as adsorbents of MPs in aquatic matrixes. Adsorption kinetics and MP removal were measured in batch and flow -through experiments for a mixture of 83 MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g L-1) and across gradients of pH, ionic strength, and natural organic matter (NOM) concentrations. Performance was benclunarked against a coconut-shell activated carbon (CCAC). Data reveal pseudo-second-order rate constants for most MPs, ranging between 1.5 and 40 g mg(-1) min(-1) for CCAC and 30 and 40000 g mg(-1) min(-1) for PCDP. The extent of MP removal demonstrates slower but more uniform uptake on CCAC and faster but more selective uptake on P-CDP. Increasing ionic strength and the presence of NOM had a negative effect on the adsorption of MPs to CCAC but had almost no effect on adsorption of MPs to P-CDP. P-CDP performed particularly well for positively charged MPs and neutral or negatively charged MPs with McGowan volumes greater than 1.7 (cm(3) mol(-1))/I00. These data highlight advantages of P-CDP adsorbents relevant to" MP removal during water and wastewater treatment. (GRAPHICS)

AB Previous studies have demonstrated that aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) remove pharmaceuticals better than activated sludge. Thus we used a MBBR system to polish the effluent of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. To overcome that effluent contains insufficient organic matter to sustain enough biomass, the biofilm was intermittently fed with raw wastewater.
   The capacity of pharmaceutical degradation was investigated by spiking pharmaceuticals. Actual removal during treatment was assessed by sampling the inlets and outlets of reactors. The removal of the majority of pharmaceuticals was enhanced through the intermittent feeding of the MBBR. First-order rate constants for pharmaceutical removal, normalised to biomass, were significantly higher compared to other studies on activated sludge and suspended biofilms, especially for diclofenac, metoprolol and atenolol. Due to the intermittently feeding, degradation of diclofenac occurred with a half-life of only 2.1 h and was thus much faster than any hitherto described wastewater bioreactor treatment.

AB The removal of organic matter and etodolac (an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical) from a real process wastewater by using powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption before and after Fenton oxidation has been studied. The wastewater sample is collected from the final stage of chemical synthesis of a pharmaceutical (etodolac). Fenton oxidation resulted with decrease in chemical oxygen demand (84% removal) and etodolac concentration was reduced to 0.7 mg L-1. Optimum adsorption equilibrium conditions were found as t = 16 hours, and m = 10 g L-1. The Freundlich model showed the best fit for the adsorption of both wastewater with R-2 values of 0.89 and 0.99. Lower pseudo-second-order rate constant (k(2)) (0.067 < 2.62) obtained from the adsorption of raw wastewater with higher organic matter concentration confirms the chemisorption of the adsorbates onto the PAC. Pore surface mass diffusion with R-2 value of 0.92 was found as rate-controlling step for adsorption process with Fenton pre-treated wastewater.

AB Improper disposal of effluents from bulk drug manufacturing units creates a pathway for antibiotics to enter the aquatic environment. This study investigated the presence and distribution of antibiotics belonging to fluoroquinolone group (ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, norflaxacin, enrofloxacin, pefloxacin, and difloxacin) in the aquatic environment of the Musi River in India. Results showed that fluoroquinolones were present in exceptionally high concentrations in the river. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were frequently detected with the highest concentrations, up to 5,015, 542.4, and 251 mu g/L, respectively. Due to the impact of effluents from bulk drug manufacturing units, antibiotic concentration was observed to be several folds higher than the usual range of its occurrence around the world. Positive correlation was observed between the concentration of fluoroquinolones in the water and sediment samples collected along the river due to sorption affinity of fluoroquinolones onto solids. The findings from the present study call for an increased focus on the development of regulatory specification and safe disposal practices of bulk drug manufacturing units into surface water.

AB Pharmaceuticals as severe contaminants of surface and ground water around the manufacturing communities and residential zones received growing attention recently. Since, there is no report on ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal using electrocoagulation (EC) process by aluminum electrodes, the present work deals with efficient removal of CIP from hospital wastewater using mentioned method. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the main effects of parameters, their simultaneous interactions and quadratic effect to achieve the optimum condition for EC process. According to the obtained results from regression analysis, it was found that the experimental data are best fitted to the second-order polynomial model with coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.9086, adjust correlation coefficient (Adj. R-2) value of 0.8796 and predicted correlation coefficient (pred. R2) value of 0.7834. EC process was applied successfully with removal efficiency of 88.57% under optimal operating condition of pH 7.78, inter-electrode distance 1 cm, reaction time 20 min, current density 12.5 mA cm(-2) and electrolyte dose of 0.07 M NaCl with the initial CIP concentration of 32.5 mg L-1. The experimental efficiency was in satisfactory agreement with the predicted efficiency of 90.34%. The obtained results revealed that, sweep flocculation as a determinant mechanism controlled the adsorption of CIP molecules on aluminum hydroxide precipitates. Electrode consumption and electrical energy consumption were found to be 66.80 g m(-3) and 0.613 kWh m(-3), respectively. The obtained results from real sample analysis revealed that the initial CIP concentration of 1544 61,,g L-1 of hospital wastewater were found to reached to zero after applying optimal condition of EC process.

AB Adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC) is a promising step to extend existing treatment trains in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and, thus, to reduce the concentration of micropollutants (MPs) (e.g. pharmaceuticals) in wastewater. It is common practice to use characteristic numbers when choosing GAC for a specific application. In this study, characteristic numbers were correlated for five different GACs, with measured adsorption capacities of these carbons for three pharmaceutical MPs (carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole) and dissolved organic carbon of a WWTP effluent. The adsorption capacities were measured using rapid small scale column tests. Density of GAC showed the highest correlation to adsorption of MP. All other characteristic numbers (iodine number, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface and methylene blue titre) are not suitable markers for choosing an appropriate activated carbon product for the elimination of MPs from municipal wastewater.

AB Safe management of hazardous metals deriving from solid wastes constitutes an important environmental challenge. In the present study, recent progress in the stabilization/solidification of heavy metals from various solid wastes into ceramics and glass-ceramic materials is reviewed. Coal/lignite-fired power plant fly and bottom ashes, steel industry by-products, metallurgical and urban/municipal wastewater sludge, and pharmaceutical wastes are included. The environmental behavior of the ceramics produced is studied via several leaching tests and ecotoxicological analyses. The goal is to assess the potential of these materials for retention of pollutants into their microstructure, for safe use as building materials. These objectives are in line with green chemistry and sustainable development principles. Moreover, the aim of turning waste into useful feedstock for another industrial sector towards symbiosis, ample coordination, and circular economy, is strongly encouraged by current environmental policies. Such secondary resources can be considered as substitute materials in ceramics production, as they contain useful oxides. However, the presence of heavy metals remains a significant environmental issue. Possible leaching of pollutants caused by rain from construction materials incorporating solid wastes would lead to contamination of surface and subsurface water, thus raising critical environmental concerns. Inertization of potentially hazardous metals into environmentally-friendly ceramics and glass-ceramics is shown to be feasible, as concentrations of these elements in the leachates remain within acceptable limits. Certainly, this also depends on the leaching method employed and system parameters. In conclusion, stabilization of these elements into ceramic matrices can be an effective and beneficial alternative for protecting human health and the environment.

AB Ozonation and three (biological) filtration techniques (trickling filtration (TF), slow sand filtration (SSF) and biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration) have been evaluated in different combinations as tertiary treatment for municipal wastewater effluent. The removal of 18 multi-class pharmaceuticals, as model trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), has been studied. (Biological) activated carbon filtration could reduce the amount of TrOCs significantly (>99%) but is cost-intensive for full-scale applications. Filtration techniques mainly depending on biodegradation mechanisms (TF and SSF) are found to be inefficient for TrOCs removal as a stand alone technique. Ozonation resulted in 90% removal of the total amount of quantified TrOCs, but a post-ozonation step is needed to cope with an increased unselective toxicity. SSF following ozonation showed to be the only technique able to reduce the unselective toxicity to the same level as before ozonation. In view of process control, innovative correlation models developed for the monitoring and control of TrOC removal during ozonation, are verified for their applicability during ozonation in combination with TF, SSF or BAC. Particularly for the poorly ozone reactive TrOCs, statistically significant models were obtained that correlate TrOC removal and reduction in UVA254 as an online measured surrogate parameter.

Thiswas thereafter used for the determination of the levels of the hormones in surface water collected around some livestock farms. The sensitivity of the method allowed the LODs and LOQs of the hormones and mimic hormone in the range 1.14-2.510 and 3.42-7.53 mu g/L, respectively. The results revealedwidevariability inthe concentrations ofE2andE3, whileBPAwas not detected at any of the sampling stations. The concentration of E3 ranged between < 1.14 and 45.5 mu g/L (N= 120) in station 2water. The highest concentrationofE2( 15.7 mu g/L, N= 80) wasobservedinwaterfrom station 1. The varied concentrations may be connected with the nature and sources of release, inconsistencies in analyte distribution due to dynamics of water flow pattern and the physical/chemical properties of the receiving water bodies.

AB The quality of anaerobic sludge and struvite from black water treatment system, aerobic sludge from grey water treatment system and effluents of both systems was assessed for organic micropollutant content in order to ensure safety when reusing these products. Use of anaerobic black water sludge and struvite as soil amendments is recommended based on the low micropollutant content. Aerobic grey water sludge is recommended for disposal, because of the relatively high micropollutant concentrations, exceeding those in sewage sludge. Effluents of black and grey water treatment systems require post-treatment prior to reuse, because the measured micropollutant concentrations in the effluents are above ecotoxicological thresholds.

AB The degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous solution was investigated on alpha-(Cu,Fe)(2)O-3 catalyst under visible irradiation. The material was prepared by a hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, BET analysis, electrical conductivity, diffuse reflectance and photo-electrochemistry. alpha-(Cu,Fe)(2)O-3 crystallizes in the corundum structure and exhibit n-type conductivity with activation energy of 0.41 eV. It exhibits a direct optical transition at 2.02 eV; further transitions, indirectly allowed, occur at 1.93 and 1.69 eV. These bands located between those of CuO (similar to 1.46 eV) and Fe2O3 (similar to 2 eV) confirm the presence of the solid solution (Cu,Fe)(2)O-3; the BET surface area of the sample averages 10 m(2) g(-1). The IBP photo-degradation, monitored by high performance liquid chromatography was found to have overall high conversion rates. The optimal performance was observed for a catalyst dose of 0.25 g L-1 and IBP concentration of 200 mg L-1 at pH similar to 11. By applying the optimal operating conditions, IBP conversion of 88% was obtained after 240 min under visible illumination.

AB Although there is a growing interest in emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), most research is focused on wastewater treatment, the occurrence of EOCs, and their fate in the aquatic environment. There is limited information about their behavior in agricultural soils, where they can be introduced via irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW). In this study, the degradation in an agricultural soil of eight EOCs (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, diethyl phthalate, ethyl paraben, 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, primidone, Surfynol 104, and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate) with a broad range of physical-chemical properties was monitored for 40 days. Two types of soil treatments were performed: non-sterilization and sterilization. In the non-sterilized soil, by the end of the incubation period, degradation was greater than 70% for all the target compounds except carbamazepine, Surfynol 104, and primidone (<50%). In contrast, in the sterilized soil, the degradation of most of the compounds was less than 50%, except ethyl paraben, 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, and diethyl phthalate (>70%). These findings indicate that soil sterilization reduces overall degradation rates, which suggests that microbial activity plays an important role in the degradation of most of the EOCs studied in soil.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants in our water resources poses potential threats to the livings. Due to the poor treatment in wastewater management, treatment technologies are needed to effectively remove these products for living organism safety. In this study, Graphene oxide (GO) was tested for the first time for its capacity to remove a kind of emerging wastewater contaminants, metformin. The research was conducted by using a series of systematic adsorption and kinetic experiments. The results indicated that GO could rapidly and efficiently reduce the concentration of metformin, which could provide a solution in handling this problem. The uptake of metformin on the graphene oxide was strongly dependent on temperature, pH, ionic strength, and background electrolyte. The adsorption kinetic experiments revealed that almost 80% removal of metformin was achieved within 20 min for all the doses studied, corresponding to the relatively high k(1) (0.232 min(-1)) and k(2) (0.007 g mg(-1) min(-1)) values in the kinetic models. It indicated that the highest adsorption capacity in the investigated range (q(m)) of GO for metformin was at pH 6.0 and 288 K. Thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous (Delta G(0) < 0) and exothermic (Delta H-0 < 0) process. The adsorption of metformin increased when the pH values changed from 4.0 to 6.0, and decreased adsorption were observed at pH 6.0-11.0. GO still exhibited excellent adsorption capacity after several desorption/adsorption cycles. Besides, both socalled pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds might be mainly responsible for the adsorption of metformin onto GO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the concentrations of 57 target compounds in the different treatment units of various biological treatment processes in South Korea, including modified biological nutrient removal (BNR), anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O), and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems, to elucidate the occurrence and removal fates of PPCPs in WWTPs. Biological treatment processes appeared to be most effective in eliminating most PPCPs, whereas some PPCPs were additionally removed by post-treatment. With the exception of the MBR process, the A2O system was effective for PPCPs removal. As a result, removal mechanisms were evaluated by calculating the mass balances in A2O and a lab-scale MBR process. The comparative study demonstrated that biodegradation was largely responsible for the improved removal performance found in lab-scale MBR (e.g., in removing bezafibrate, ketoprofen, and atenolol). Triclocarban, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and tetracycline were adsorbed in large amounts to MBR sludge. Increased biodegradability was also observed in lab-scale MBR, despite the highly adsorbable characteristics. The enhanced biodegradation potential seen in the MBR process thus likely plays a key role in eliminating highly adsorbable compounds as well as non-degradable or persistent PPCPs in other biological treatment processes.

AB Accurate data is needed to evaluate the capacity of wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) to remove contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The variability of CEC removals reported in the literature has raised questions about the methods used to estimate removals. In this study, we used the recently proposed "fractionated approach" to account for the influence of hydrodynamics in WWTPs and applied this method for estimating the removal of 23 target CECs. Data on the conductivity and temperature of wastewater at two WWTPs were used to determine the hydraulic model that best described the flow regime of treatment units. Composite samples (24-h) were collected at different stages of treatment over successive days. The concentrations of the target compounds in wastewater were determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Different hydraulic models were necessary to define the hydrodynamics at the two WWTPs, resulting in different load fractions to be used in the calculation of removals. For WWTP A, that has a primary clarifier, all target CECs, except triclosan, were poorly removed during this step at efficiencies <30%. On the other hand, the activated sludge treatment unit at both WWTPs removed most target CECs at >70%. This study expanded the application of the fractionated approach to compare the hydraulics of two treatment trains of different configurations, including primary and secondary treatment. It demonstrated the sensitivity of the method to account for variations between the different treatment units. Reliable removals of an extended list of CECs in primary and secondary treatment were also provided in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the adsorption of heavy metals (Cr-TOT, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) in wastewater originated from galvanization process and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone) in aqueous solutions on waste sludge. To get the insight in the adsorption process, the adsorption kinetics and mechanisms are described. The physico-chemical properties of the waste sludge were determined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction technique, energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry, surface area and gas adsorption porosimetry, and laser diffraction. The adsorption on waste sludge was performed as batch tests and the concentration of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals was monitored by atomic absorption spectrometry and UV/Vis spectrophotometry, respectively. The rates of pharmaceuticals adsorption dependent on different initial concentration were explained. The kinetics of heavy metal ions and pharmaceuticals adsorption on the sludge was analyzed using four different models. The pseudo secondorder model assuming chemical adsorption as the rate limiting process showed the best agreement. Furthermore, the results revealed that the adsorption involves complex processes, including film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. The investigated industrial waste sludge is a promising non-hazardous and a low cost sorbent with relatively high surface area which can be used for removal of heavy metal ions (CrTOT, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+), and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone) from wastewater.
