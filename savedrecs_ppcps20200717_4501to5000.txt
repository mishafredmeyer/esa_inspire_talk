AB Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-induced coagulation of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH] was studied for the rapid removal of estrogens and phenolic compounds from water. When electrically equivalent amount (62 mg L-1) of SDS was added into the aqueous solution of 20 mg L-1 PAH with vigorous mixing, PAH was quantitatively (> 99%) recovered from water as condensed aggregates of PAH-SDS complexes. According to the fluorescence spectrum of a molecular probe, the complexes provided hydrophobic regions suitable for incorporating hydrophobic organic pollutants. However, rather polar estrone, beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethynylestradiol were insufficiently removed. Combined use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the collection yields of these estrogens, because of their HRP-induced oxidation of and spontaneous binding to PAH. With the HRP activity of 100 U L-1 and the hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10 mg L-1, nearly complete (> 98%) removal of four estrogens was achieved within 10 mm at 30 degrees C in the pH region from 6 to 7.5. The method was also useful for the rapid removal of different phenolic compounds and selected pharmaceuticals. The applicability to wastewater treatment was successfully demonstrated by using secondary effluents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term irrigation with untreated wastewater may increase soil microbial adaptation to pollution load and lead to enhanced natural attenuation. We hypothesized that long-term wastewater irrigation accelerates the dissipation of pharmaceuticals. To test our hypothesis we performed an incubation experiment with soils from the Mezquital Valley, Mexico that were irrigated for 0, 14, or 100 years. The results showed that the dissipation half-lives (DT50) of diclofenac (<0.1-1.4 days), bezafibrate (<0.1-4.8 days), sulfamethoxazole (2-33 days), naproxen (6-19 days), carbamazepine (355-1,624 days), and ciprofloxacin were not affected by wastewater irrigation. Trimethoprim dissipation was even slower in soils irrigated for 100 years (DT50: 45-72 days) than in nonirrigated soils (DT50: 12-16 days), was negatively correlated with soil organic matter content and soil-water distribution coefficients, and was inhibited in sterilized soils. Applying a kinetic fate model indicated that long-term irrigation enhanced sequestration of cationic or uncharged trimethoprim and uncharged carbamazepine, but did not affect sequestration of fast-dissipating zwitterions or negatively charged pharmaceuticals. We conclude that microbial adaptation processes play a minor role for pharmaceutical dissipation in wastewater-irrigated soils, while organic matter accumulation in these soils can retard trimethoprim and carbamazepine dissipation.

AB In the paper, the problem of water pollution risks with pharmaceuticals was discussed. The results of the investigation from different countries are shown. Polish results are presented as well. Particular emphasis was put on water pollution with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and psychoactive drugs. The need for additional disinfection of drinking water has been highlighted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonic (US) process on the degradation of pharmaceuticals. For testing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs were selected. The tests were performed using Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer with a sonotrode. The samples were exposed to an ultrasonic field with parameters 250W and 20 kHz. During the experiment, sonication time was altered and it was equalled to 30, 60, 120, and 240 s. Based on the results, the relationship between the ultrasonic field, length of its duration, and particles' diameters was determined. Particle sizes were strongly correlated with the intensity and time of the ultrasonic field exposition. The largest particles were obtained for unmodified samples and they amounted to even 479 mu m. The smallest particles were obtained for samples modified for 240 s and amounted to 0.724 mu m for ketoprofen.

AB Naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, commonly used for fever, inflammation and for different health problems, as found for many pharmaceuticals has been recently detected in sewage effluents, surface, and ground water, and sometimes even in drinking water. An advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), utilizing ultra-filtration, activated charcoal (AC), and reverse osmosis (RO) after the primary biological treatment, showed that both nano- and micro-ultrafiltration were not sufficient for removing spiked naproxen to a safe level, whereas RO membrane was quite efficient. No naproxen degradation was detected in pure water whereas it underwent biodegradation within three days in activated sludge giving O-desmethyl-naproxen. Adsorption performed on micelle-clay complex and AC under steady state conditions, showed that the former adsorbent is highly effective in removing naproxen with fast kinetics. Laboratory micelle-clay complex filters under continuous naproxen-spiked water flowing were found to be efficient in removing this drug, suggesting that the efficiency of existing advanced WWTP could be improved by including filtration columns filled with suitable sand/micelle-clay mixtures.

AB As a consequence of population growth and urbanization, arable fields are increasingly irrigated with wastewater, but the related environmental and health risks (e. g., pollution with antibiotics) are poorly understood. We performed batch sorption experiments with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) and soils that had been irrigated with untreated wastewater for 0, 14, 35, and 100 yr. Sorption of CIP was always strong and largely irreversible irrespective of the duration of wastewater irrigation and the content and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) (Freundlich sorption coefficient, K-F: 346-979 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1); 1/n: 0.62-0.76) but decreased with increasing soil pH due to a decreasing fraction of the cationic species. Sorption of SMX and sorption hysteresis were stronger in the nonirrigated soil (K-F: 4.14 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1) +/- 0.02; 1/n: 0.69 =/- 0.02) than in the irrigated soils (K-F: 0.65-1.38 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1); 1/n: 0.68-0.75). Irrigation (e. g., competition with SMX accumulated in soil or with other organic compounds contained in wastewater) and SOM quality (i.e., increase of carboxylic moieties with increasing time of irrigation) had a stronger effect on SMX sorption and its hysteresis than soil organic carbon content. Whereas sorption of SMX can be reduced by long-term irrigation with wastewater, sorption of CIP is intense also after prolonged irrigation.

AB Organisms in the environment are exposed to a number of pollutants from different compound groups. In addition to the classic pollutants like the polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols, biocides, etc. other compound groups of concern are constantly emerging. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) can be expected to co-occur with other organic contaminants like biocides, PAHs and alkylphenols in areas affected by wastewater, industrial effluents And intensive recreational activity. In this study, representatives from these four different compound groups were tested individually and in mixtures in a growth inhibition assay with the marine algae Skeletonema pseudocostatum (formerly Skeletonema costatum) to determine whether the combined effects could be predicted by models for additive effects; the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) prediction model. The eleven tested compounds reduced the growth of S. pseudocostatum in the microplate test in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of toxicity of these chemicals were irgarol > fluoxetine > diuron > benzo(a)pyrene > thioguanine > triclosan>propranolol > benzophenone 3 > cetrimonium bromide > 4-tert-octylphenol > endosulfan. Several binary mixtures and a mixture of eight compounds from the four different compound groups were tested. All tested mixtures were additive as model deviation ratios, the deviation between experimental and predicted effect concentrations, were within a factor of 2 from one or both prediction models (e.g. CA and IA). Interestingly, a concentration dependent shift from IA to CA, potentially due to activation of similar toxicity pathways at higher concentrations, was observed for the mixture of eight compounds. The combined effects of the multi-compound mixture were clearly additive and it should therefore be expected that PPCPs, biocides, PAHs and alkylphenols will collectively contribute to the risk in areas contaminated by such complex mixtures.

AB The synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) has been increasingly detected in sewage effluents in the last two decades. The aim of the present study was determined if EE2 exposure adversely affected reproduction in internally fertilizing fish species Jenynsia multidentata. Sexual behavior, brain and gonadal aromatase expression as well as sperm quality were evaluated. The brain aromatase expression, reproductive behavior, spermatozoa viability and gonadosomatic index were sensitive biomarkers of EE2 effects on this species. The condition factor, hepatosomatic index, gonadal aromatase expression, sperm count and sperm velocities were unaltered after EE2 exposure. The present work highlights the importance of using a combination of several biomarkers to study the effects of estrogenic compounds, especially when trying to link these results to potential population-level effects.

AB Use of animal manure is a main source of veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) in soil and groundwater through a series of migration processes. The sorption-desorption and transport of four commonly used VPs including trimethoprim (TMP), sulfapyridine, sulfameter, and sulfadimethoxine were investigated in three soil layers taken from an agricultural field in Chongming Island China and two types of aqueous solution (0.01 M CaCl2 solution and wastewater treatment plant effluent). Results from sorption-desorption experiments showed that the sorption behavior of selected VPs conformed to the Freundlich isotherm equation. TMP exhibited higher distribution coefficients (K (d) = 6.73-9.21) than other sulfonamides (K (d) = 0.03-0.47), indicating a much stronger adsorption capacity of TMP. The percentage of desorption for TMP in a range of 8-12 % is not so high to be considered significant. Low pH (< pK (a) of tested VPs) and rich soil organic matter (e.g., 0-20 cm soil sample) had a positive impact on sorption of VPs. Slightly lower distribution coefficients were obtained for VPs in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, which suggested that dissolved organic matter might affect their sorption behavior. Column studies indicated that the transport of VPs in the soil column was mainly influenced by sorption capacity. The weakly adsorbed sulfonamides had a high recovery rate (63.6-98.0 %) in the leachate, while the recovery rate of TMP was only 4.2-10.4 %. The sulfonamides and TMP exhibited stronger retaining capacity in 20-80 cm and 0-20 cm soil samples, respectively. The transport of VPs was slightly higher in the columns leached by WWTP effluent than by CaCl2 solution (0.01 M) due to their sorption interactions.

AB Residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in surface waters. Incomplete removal of these compounds by wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) results in their presence in effluents and finally in surface waters. The occurrence and removal of four PPCPs was investigated in three WWTPs in Mississippi, USA, during a period of 1 year. Influent and effluent were sampled from the three WWTPs. Upstream and downstream samples of the WWTPs were also collected. All four PPCPs were detected in all influents where sulfamethoxazole showed the highest concentration levels with a median concentration of 1,640 ng/L, and carbamazepine was detected at the lowest level with a median concentration of 132 ng/L. Different PPCPs were removed to different extents varying from 99 to 100 %. Gemfibrozil showed the highest removal rates (73-100 %), whereas carbamazepine showed the lowest (-99 to -30 %). Secondary activated sludge in oxidation-ditch process showed remarkable PPCP-specific removal rates. Galaxolide was removed more than the other PPCPs, and sulfamethoxazole showed the least removal. Galaxolide was found to be a predominant PPCP in effluent among the PPCPs studied, and it was detected in all downstream (14.1-428.2 ng/L) and upstream (4.1-60.0 ng/L) samples. Sulfamethoxazole was removed more during the summer than the winter season. A clear increase of PPCP concentrations was observed in most downstream samples compared with upstream samples suggesting that discharges from WWTPs are the major source of PPCPs in surface waters.

AB We developed a protocol to quantify 12 emerging contaminants (ECs) (pharmaceuticals and hormones) and pesticides extracted from suspended particulate matter (SPM) of river water and municipal wastewaters samples as well as river sediments. The separation of suspended solids was realized using filtration of water samples. We tested a series of six different filter types. The effect of filtration on the concentrations of dissolved contaminants was evaluated to minimize losses of target compounds. The river sediment samples were lyophilized, and both SPM and sediment samples were subjected to ultrasonic extraction combined with C18 cartridge clean-up. Quantifications were realized using mass spectrometry. The method recoveries of all compounds ranged from 38 to 112 % in all studied matrices; poorer recoveries were achieved for sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac (as low as 38 %), whereas the recoveries for all other compounds in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples were between 68 and 111 %. The detection limits in sediments and SPM from river samples for the 12 analytes varied from 0.7 to 9.4 ng g(-1) and from 21 to 92 ng g(-1) for WWTP SPM samples. All targeted ECs were detected with concentrations ranging from 3 to 5,440 ng g(-1) in the studied matrices with the highest concentrations observed in WWTP SPM samples. A significant portion of the contaminants in a water sample is clearly associated with the suspended particulates. Optimization of water-treatment processes and environmental fate must absolutely consider the fraction of contaminants that is particulate-bound if one hopes to have a reasonable mass balance.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which a suite of organic micropollutants (MPs) can be removed by biological filtration and the role of bioavailability and ammonia oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) in the biodegradation process. During approximately one year, laboratory-scale columns with 8 min empty bed contact time (EBCT) and packed with anthracite as filter media were used for treating a tertiary effluent spiked with a broad range of MPs at a target concentration of 2 mu g L-1. In parallel columns, aerobic biomass growth was inhibited by using either the biocide sodium azide (500 mg L-1 NaN3) or allylthiourea (5 mg L-1 ATU), specifically inhibiting nitrifying bacteria. Once the biomass had colonized the media, around 15% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOG) contained in the untreated tertiary effluent was removed by non-inhibited columns. The removal of several MPs increased over time indicating the relevance of biological activity for the removal of MPs, while the negative control, the NaN3 inhibited column, showed no significant removal. Out of 33 MPs, 19 were recalcitrant (<25%) to biodegradation under aerobic conditions with the others exhibiting a diverse range of removal efficiency up to 95%. Through inhibition by ATU it was shown that nitrifying bacteria were clearly having a role in the degradation of several MPs, whereas the removal of other MPs was not affected by the presence of the nitrification inhibitor. A relationship between the qualitative assessment of sorption of MPs on granular activated carbon (GAC) and their removal efficiency by biodegradation on anthracite was observed. This result suggested that the affinity of the MPs for GAG media could be a useful indicator of the bioavailability of compounds during biofiltration on anthracite. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Naproxen and bezafibrate fall into the category of pharmaceuticals that have been widely detected in the aquatic environment, and one of the major sources is the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants. This study investigated the sorption and degradation kinetics of naproxen and bezafibrate in the presence of activated sludge under aerobic conditions. Experimental results indicated that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by activated sludge was rapid, and the relative adsorbabilities of the two-target compounds were based on their log K-ow and pK(a) values. The adsorption data could be well interpreted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The degradation process could be described by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, whereas the pseudo-second-order kinetics were also well suited to describe the degradation process of the selected compounds at low concentrations. Bezafibrate was more easily degraded by activated sludge compared with naproxen. The spiked concentration of the two-target compounds was negatively correlated with k(1) and k(2s), indicating that the substrate inhibition effect occurred at the range of studied concentrations. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) did not associate with naproxen degradation; thus, COD is not an alternative method that could be applied to investigate natural organic matter's impact on degradation of pharmaceuticals by activated sludge.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence of 29 selected micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters and wastewaters in Seoul (South Korea) during both dry and wet weather conditions. The study area was selected based on the lack of available information regarding the suspected contamination of rivers/creeks by EDCs and PPCPs in the Seoul region and the presence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which serves approximately 4.1 million inhabitants and has a design capacity of 1,297x10(3) m(3)/day. Many target compounds (83 %) were detected in samples collected from wastewater treatment influent/effluent, creek water, and combined sewer overflow (CSO). The total EDC/PPCP concentrations were as follows: WWTP influent (69,903 ng/L)>WWTP effluent (50,175 ng/L) >3 creek samples (16,03544,446 ng/L) during dry weather, and WWTP influent (53,795 ng/L)>WWTP bypass (38,653 ng/L) > 5 creek samples (15,260-29,113 ng/L) >2 CSO samples (11,109-11,498 ng/L) during wet weather. EDCs and PPCPs were found to be present at high daily loads (65.1 and 69.8 kg/day during dry and wet weather, respectively) in the WWTP effluent. Compound removal by the WWTP varied significantly by compound: caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and propylparaben (> 90 %), and acesulfame, DEET, iohexol, iopromide, and iopamidol (<5 %). These findings and literature information support the hypothesis that the efficiency of removal of EDCs and PPCPs is strongly dependent on both removal mechanism (e. g., biodegradation, adsorption to sludge, and oxidation by chlorine) and compound physicochemical properties (e. g., pKa and hydrophobicity).

AB Biosolids generally contain the microbiocidal agents triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) that are persistent during wastewater treatment and sorp to organic material. The present study investigated the concentration of TCS in tissues of radish, carrot, and soybean grown in potted soil amended with biosolids. Highest mean concentrations of TCS in radish, carrot, and soybean root tissue midway through the life cycle were 24.8ng/g, 49.8ng/g, and 48.1ng/g dry weight, respectively; by the conclusion of the test, however, concentrations had declined to 2.1ng/g, 5.5ng/g, and 8.4ng/g dry weight, respectively. Highest mean concentrations of TCS in radish and carrot shoot tissue were 33.7 and 18.3ng/g dry weight at days 19 and 45, respectively, but had declined to 13.7ng/g and 5.5ng/g dry weight at days 34 and 69, respectively. Concentration of TCS in all samples of soybean seeds was below method detection limit (i.e., 2.8ng/g dry wt). The present study also examined the concentration of TCS and TCC in edible portions of green pepper, carrot, cucumber, tomato, radish, and lettuce plants grown in a field amended with biosolids. Triclosan was detected only in cucumber and radish up to 5.2ng/g dry weight. Triclocarban was detected in carrot, green pepper, tomato, and cucumber up to 5.7ng/g dry weight. On the basis of the present study and other studies, we estimate that vegetable consumption represents less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of TCS and TCC. These results demonstrate that, if best management practices for land application of biosolids in Ontario are followed, the concentration of TCS and TCC in edible portions of plants represents a negligible exposure pathway to humans.

AB BACKGROUND The objective of this research was the valorization of an agro-food industry residue, namely codfish salting wastewater, through the recovery of valuable bioactive compounds. Approximately 200 L of salted wastewater are generated for each ton of fresh codfish, carrying protein and free amino acids at a concentration of c. 10 g L-1, and sodium chloride (NaCl) at c. 250 g L-1. RESULTS Protein and free amino acids were selectively recovered by sorption with the Amberlite XAD16 resin. Food-grade acetone was used to elute amino acids while a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) desorbed protein. Recovery of protein and of hydrophobic to neutral amino acids was 100%; NaCl was also partially recovered from the salting wastewater, at a level of 33%. Kinetics and mechanisms of adsorption and desorption were investigated. CONCLUSIONS The process implemented can be considered as a valuable management option for codfish salting wastewater, it can contribute to the fish industry sustainability and can serve as a source of nutrients. Free amino acids and protein extracts can find application in animal and human nutrition through incorporation into functional food and drinks, as well as in cosmetics and in pharmaceutical formulations.

AB The province of Jaen counts with four natural parks, numerous rivers, reservoirs and wetlands; moreover, it is probably the region with higher olive oil production in the world, which makes this zone a proper target to be studied based on the European Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE. The aim of this survey is to monitor a total number of 373 compounds belonging to different families (pesticides, PAHs, nitrosamines, drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals and life-style compounds) in surface waters located at different points of the province of Jaen. Among these compounds some priority organic substances (regulated by the EU Directive 2008/105/EC) and pollutants of emerging concern (not regulated yet) can be found. A liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) method covering 340 compounds was developed and applied, together with a gas chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method which enabled the analysis of 63 organic contaminants (30 of these compounds are analyzed by LC-TOFMS as well). From April 2009 to November 2010 a total of 83 surface water samples were collected (rivers, reservoirs and wetlands). In this period numerous organic contaminants were detected, most of them at the ng L-1 level. The most frequently priority substances found were chlorpyrifos ethyl, diuron and hexachlorobenzene. Within the other groups, the most frequently detected compounds were: terbuthylazine, oxyfluorfen, desethyl terbuthylazine, diphenylamine (pesticide family); fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene (PAHs group), codeine, paracetamol (pharmaceuticals compounds) and caffeine, nicotine (life-style compounds). As is could be expected, the total concentration of emerging contaminants is distinctly larger than that of priority pollutants, highlighting the importance of continuing with the study of their presence, fate and effects in aquatic environments. However, concentration levels (at the ng per liter level) are low in general for both kinds of contaminants which minimizes the possible harmful effect on the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A methodology used to estimate the percentage of wastewater effluent in an otherwise pristine water site is proposed on the basis of the weighted mean of the level of a consortium of indicator pollutants. This method considers the levels of uncertainty in the evaluation of each of the indicators in the site, potential effluent sources, and uncontaminated surroundings. A detailed demonstrative study was conducted on a site that is potentially subject to wastewater leakage. The research concentrated on several perched springs that are influenced to an unknown extent by agricultural communities. A comparison was made to a heavily contaminated site receiving wastewater effluent and surface water runoff. We investigated six springs in two nearby ridges where fecal contamination was detected in the past; the major sources of pollution in the area have since been diverted to a wastewater treatment system. We used chloride, acesulfame, and carbamazepine as domestic pollution tracers. Good correlation (R-2 > 0.86) was observed between the mixing ratio predictions based on the two organic tracers (the slope of the linear regression was 1.05), whereas the chloride predictions differed considerably. This methodology is potentially useful, particularly for cases in which detailed hydrological modeling is unavailable but in which quantification of wastewater penetration is required. We demonstrate that the use of more than one tracer for estimation of the mixing ratio reduces the combined uncertainty level associated with the estimate and can also help to disqualify biased tracers.

AB Diclofenac sodium, a widely detected pharmaceutical drug in wastewater samples, has been selected as a model pollutant for degradation using novel combined approach of hydrodynamic cavitation and heterogeneous photocatalysis. A slit venturi has been used as cavitating device in the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor. The effect of various operating parameters such as inlet fluid pressure (2-4 bar) and initial pH of the solution (4-7.5) on the extent of degradation have been studied. The maximum extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium was obtained at inlet fluid pressure of 3 bar and initial pH as 4 using hydrodynamic cavitation alone. The loadings of TiO2 and H2O2 have been optimised to maximise the extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium. Kinetic study revealed that the degradation of diclofenac sodium fitted first order kinetics over the selected range of operating protocols. It has been observed that combination of hydrodynamic cavitation with UV, UV/TiO2 and UV/TiO2/H2O2 results in enhanced extents of degradation as compared to the individual schemes. The maximum extent of degradation as 95% with 76% reduction in TOC has been observed using hydrodynamic cavitation in conjunction with UV/TiO2/H2O2 under the optimised operating conditions. The diclofenac sodium degradation byproducts have been identified using LC/MS analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB In this study, the removal of clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac residues from wastewater, using a novel shear-induced cavitation generator has been systematically studied. The effects of temperature, cavitation time and H2O2 dose on removal efficiency were investigated. Optimisation (50 degrees C; 15 min; 340 mg L-1 of added H2O2) resulted in removal efficiencies of 4786% in spiked deionised water samples. Treatment of actual wastewater effluents revealed that although matrix composition reduces removal efficiency, this effect can be compensated for by increasing H2O2 dose (3.4 g L-1) and prolonging cavitation time (30 mm). Hydrodynamic cavitation has also been investigated as either a pre- or a post-treatment step to biological treatment. The results revealed a higher overall removal efficiency of recalcitrant diclofenac and carbamazepine, when hydrodynamic cavitation was used prior to as compared to post biological treatment i.e., 54% and 67% as compared to 39% and 56%, respectively. This is an important finding since diclofenac is considered as a priority substance to be included in the EU Water Framework Directive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of micropollutants (MPs) from secondary municipal wastewater by an advanced oxidation process (AOP) based on UV irradiation combined with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) has been assessed through pilot-scale experiments incorporating microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Initial tests employed low concentrations of a range of key emerging contaminants of concern, subsequently focusing on the highly recalcitrant compound metaldehyde (MA), and the water quality varied by blending MF and RO permeate.
   Under optimum H2O2 and lamp power conditions, AOP achieved significant removal (>99%) of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) for all waters. Pesticide removal, in particular metaldehyde, atrazine and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was dependent on water transmittance (UVT), and levels of TOC and other hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) scavengers. Further analysis of MA removal showed UVT, hydraulic retention time and H2O2 dose to be influential parameters in determining degradation as a function of UV dose.
   A cost assessment revealed energy consumption to account for 65% of operating expenditure with lamp replacement contributing 25%. A comparison of three unit process sequences, based on MF, RO, AOP and activated carbon (AC), revealed MF-RO-AOP to be the most cost effective provided management of the RD concentrate stream incurred no significant cost. Results demonstrated AOPs to satisfactorily reduce levels of the more challenging recalcitrant MPs to meet stringent water quality standards for wastewater reuse, but that practical limitations exist and the cost penalty is significant.

AB The catalyst of cerium supported on activated carbon (Ce/AC) for ozonation was prepared and the catalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA). The results showed that Ce/AC catalyst could not only greatly enhance the degradation of p-TSA but also significantly increase the efficiency of COD removal by ozonation. The COD removal could reach 74.1% with the Ce/AC catalyst at 60 min, while the effects of activated carbon (AC) catalyst and without catalyst were only 62.4% and 50.8%, respectively. The superiority of Ce/AC catalyst was attributed to the fact that cerium increased the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which could react with p-TSA and intermediate to form oxidized products rapidly. Based on the intermediates detected by GC/MS. IC and HPLC, a possible degradation pathway of p-TSA was proposed. Our aim is to provide basic data and theoretical support for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by catalytic ozonation. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Human exposure to emerging contaminants by indirect routes is of increasing interest. This study assessed the contamination of food by chemicals used in human pharmaceuticals (HPs), veterinary medicines (VMs), and personal care products (PCPs). A prioritization study was undertaken to identify the chemicals and food-producing scenarios most likely to result in contamination of food. Around 400 samples of mushrooms, vegetables, aquaculture products, and animal tissues were collected from sites in the United Kingdom, along with aquaculture products imported from Southeast Asia. A number of multianalyte methods were developed and validated for the analysis of the prioritized compounds in these samples. The analysis of all sample method combinations required approximately 18000 determinations. Around 325 individual residues, including parabens, musk compounds, and antibiotics, were detected in 118 individual samples, but mostly at low nanograms per gram concentrations. Results suggest that the limited contamination of target chemicals occurred in the realistic food-producing scenarios investigated.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern were measured in mussels collected along the California coast in 2009-2010. The seven classes were alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), other flame retardants, current use pesticides, perfluorinated compounds (PFC), and single walled carbon nanotubes. At least one contaminant was detected at 67 of the 68 stations (98%), and 67 of the 167 analytes had at least one detect (40%). Alkylphenol, PBDE, and PFC concentrations increased with urbanization and proximity to storm water discharge; pesticides had higher concentrations at agricultural stations. These results suggest that certain compounds; for example, alkyiphenols, lomefloxacin and PBDE, are appropriate for inclusion in future coastal bivalve monitoring efforts based on maximum concentrations >50 ng/g dry weight and detection frequencies >50%. Other compounds, for example PFC and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), may also be suggested for inclusion due to their >25% detection frequency and potential for biomagnification.

AB A three-phase hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) method was evaluated for the extraction and preconcentration of naproxen and diclofenac using a polypropylene membrane followed by analysis using HPLC or LC/MS. In this technique, the drugs were extracted into di-n-hexyl ether immobilized in the wall pores of a porous hollow fiber from 50mL of sludge slurry sample as a donor phase with pH 3, and then back-extracted into the acceptor phase located in the lumen of the hollow fiber. Experimental factors were studied in 16 trials using a Taguchi orthogonal array experimental design with an OA(16) (4(5)) matrix. The significance of these factors was investigated using analysis of variance. The extraction time was statistically demonstrated as the main factor for the extraction of naproxen and diclofenac, while ionic strength played the role of the second most important factor for HF-LPME extraction of diclofenac. The method permitted a detection limit of 0.2-0.7ngg(-1) with relative standard deviation values of 3-5%. Enrichment factors of 2,300 for naproxen and 1,400 for diclofenac were achieved. The method was applied to determine naproxen and diclofenac in sewage sludge from sewage treatment plant, Kallby (Lund, Sweden).

AB Background: Over recent years, a global increase in the use of pharmaceutical products has been observed. EU directives state that "Member states shall ensure that appropriate collection systems are in place for medicinal products that are unused or have expired" (Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/27/EC).
   Objectives: There is no published data on how people in Ireland dispose of unused medicines; therefore the purpose of this study is to establish baseline information on storage and disposal of medicines.
   Design: Data was collected over two 2-week periods a year apart. People in the streets of Galway and Cork were approached randomly and invited to participate by filling out a questionnaire.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 398 individuals (207 in Galway and 191 in Cork). Unused medicines were kept in the home by 88% of the respondents. The most cited reason for keeping unused medicines was "in case they are needed later" (68%). Of the respondents who had disposed of medicine in the past, 72% had done so inappropriately. Environmentally inappropriate disposal methods were through general waste disposal and via the sewage system. Interestingly, of the people who had received advice on disposal practices from a healthcare professional, 75% disposed of their medicine appropriately.
   Conclusions: There is little awareness among members of the public regarding appropriate ways to dispose of unused medicines. Our findings suggest that effective communication and established protocols will promote appropriate disposal practices. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) released into the environment via discharge of wastewater effluents have been detected in rivers and lakes worldwide, raising concerns due to their potential persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation. This study provides the first reconnaissance of TOrC occurrence in wastewater effluents within Saudi Arabia. Four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs 1-4) located in Western Saudi Arabia were sampled hourly over twelve-hour periods, for a total of six sampling events. All samples were analyzed for a wide range of TOrC encompassing pharmaceuticals, personal care products and household chemicals. Treatment and capacities of the plants varied from non-nitrifying to full biological nutrient removal providing a representative cross section of different types of plants operational within the country. A comparison of TOrC occurrence in effluents in Saudi Arabia with respective effluent qualities in the United States revealed similar levels for most TOrC. Overall, the occurrence of TOrC was higher at two of the plants. The higher TOrC concentrations at WWTP 1 are likely due to the non-nitrifying biological treatment process. The unique TOrC occurrence observed in the WWTP 3 effluent was unlike any other plant and was attributed to the influence of a large number of international visitors in its sewershed. The occurrence of TOrC in this plant was not expected to be representative of the occurrence elsewhere in the country. Bimodal diurnal variation expected for a range of TOrC was not observed, though some hourly variation in TOrC loading was noted for WWTP 3. Since water reclamation and reuse have received increasing interest in Saudi Arabia within the last few years, results from this study provide a good foundation in deciding whether advanced treatment is necessary to attenuate TOrC deemed to be of concern in effluents, or if natural treatment such as managed aquifer recharge provides sufficient protection to public health.

AB Apart from providing a total activated sludge (AS) inhibition, an efficient AS inhibition technique must preserve the biomass structure in order to maintain the real sorption phenomenon. Many inhibition techniques with different modes of action were used in previous studies for AS inhibition. But, the effectiveness of AS deactivation and the adverse effects on the biomass structure were rarely related. In this paper, five common AS inhibition techniques were evaluated: thermal, three chemical and gas purging techniques. The lowest chemical effective concentrations were determined in order to limit the negative impact on the AS structure. 100 mgHg(2)SO(4) g(TSS)(-1) and 30 mgHgCl(2) g(TSS)(-1) within 2 h of reaction were enough to provide a complete AS inhibition. However, after 20 h of reaction a full AS inhibition has never been achieved with sodium azide at 200 mgNaN(3) g(TSS)(-1), even by increasing NaN3 concentration.
   The analysis of the AS apparent viscosity, the median size D-50 of the flocs and the supernatant turbidity showed that the thermal technique destructured the AS completely. A significant AS deflocculation is induced by the three chemical reagents depending on the mode of action and the concentration used. Thermal and chemical inactivations are therefore not suitable to determine sorption properties. The only technique which kept the initial AS structure unchanged has several drawbacks since (i) a reaction might occur between the gas and the analyte of interest, and (ii) anaerobic activated sludge are not inhibited by this technique. Therefore, the establishment of anaerobic conditions without gas injection is recommended for implementing sorption experiments on aerobic AS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters are applied widely in personal care products (PCPs), but the distribution and risks of these compounds in the marine environment are not well known. In this study, the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 12 organic UV filters in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) equipped with different treatment levels in Hong Kong, South China, were investigated during one year and a preliminary environmental risk assessment was carried out. Using a newly developed simultaneous multiclass quantification liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM), 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-4 (BP-4) and 2-ethyl-hexyl-4-trimethoxycinnamate (EHMC) were frequently (>= 80%) detected in both influent and effluent with mean concentrations ranging from 23 to 1290 ng/L and 18-1018 ng/L, respectively; less than 2% of samples contained levels greater than 1000 ng/L. Higher concentrations of these frequently detected compounds were found during the wet/summer season, except for BP-4, which was the most abundant compound detected in all samples in terms of total mass. The target compounds behaved differently depending on the treatment level in WWTPs; overall, removal efficiencies were greater after secondary treatment when compared to primary treatment with >55% and <20% of compounds showing high removal (defined as >70% removal), respectively. Reverse osmosis was found to effectively eliminate UV filters from effluent (>99% removal). A preliminary risk assessment indicated that BP-3 and EHMC discharged from WWTPs may pose high risk to fishes in the local environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ketamine has been increasingly used both recreationally and medicinally around the world. Although the metabolic pathways to form its metabolite norketamine have been carefully investigated in humans and animals, knowledge of their environmental occurrence and fate is limited. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of ketamine and norketamine in 20 natural bodies of water, effluents from 13 hospitals, two wastewater treatment plants and one water supply plant. Ketamine was found at concentrations as high as 10 mu g/L. Ketamine and norketamine were consistently found in similar concentrations (ketamine/norketamine ratio: 0.3-4.6) in the collected water samples, and this ratio similar to that found in urine samples. Dark incubation experiments have shown that ketamine is not susceptible to microbial degradation or hydrolysis. Phototransformation was demonstrated to significantly reduce the concentration of ketamine and norketamine in river waters (t(1/2) = 12.6 +/- 0.4 and 10.1 +/- 0.4 h, respectively) and resulted in byproducts that are similar to human metabolites. Both direct and indirect photolysis led to the N-demethylation of ketamine to form norketamine and other byproducts, including hydroxynorketamine (HNK), dehydronorketamine (DNK), hydroxy-ketamine (HK) and isomer forms of ketamine and norketamine. Irradiated solutions exhibited higher toxicity (via the Microtox (R) test). Although a final risk assessment could not be made due to a lack of studies on the chronic effects on aquatic organisms, the high and persistent environmental occurrences of ketamine and norketamine as well as the increasingly acute toxicity of the photo byproducts demonstrate the importance of including metabolites in evaluation of the overall risk of ketamine.

AB This study evaluates the applicability of TiO2-based photocatalysts for the treatment of pharmaceutical micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluent (SWE). Photolytic experiments using SWEs with different compositions demonstrated that the rates of photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen and carbamazepine inversely correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), regardless of the type of applied light source and initial pharmaceutical concentration. The critical relevance of organic matter to the scavenging behavior of SWE was further verified by assessing the photocatalytic performance as a function of the concentrations of potential effluent-derived quenchers (i.e., NO3-, Cl-, alkalinity, and humic acid). Kinetic comparison of the degradation of trace levels of pharmaceuticals (i.e., caffeine, cimetidine, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole) using TiO2/UV-A, TiO2/UV-C, and H2O2/UV-C systems revealed that heterogeneous processes showed more significant performance reduction with increasing DOC concentration; this result indicates that organic matter plays dual roles in the scavenging activity of an effluent matrix: (1) OH radical ((OH)-O-center dot) quenching and (2) active-site coverage. TiO2 surface modifications (i.e., Pt and SiOx loading) accelerated the degradation of all the tested pharmaceuticals in SWEs to a certain degree. Particularly, the relevant altered surface affinity preferentially increased the susceptibility of specific pharmaceuticals to photocatalytic treatment. The presence of the effluent matrix substantially impaired the performance of visible-light-active photocatalysts in most cases. However, photocatalytic pharmaceutical degradation on Pt-doped TiO2, which occurs via direct charge transfer, was much less hindered in SWEs than that on Pt-deposited WO3, which occurs via (OH)-O-center dot-mediated oxidation.

AB Toxic compounds in sewage or industrial wastewater may inhibit the biological activity of activated sludge impairing the treatment process. This paper evaluates the Inhibition Capacity Index (ICI) for the assessment of activated sludge in the presence of toxicants. In this study, activated sludge was obtained from industrial treatment plants and was also synthetically produced. Continuous respirometric measurements were carried out in a reactor, and the oxygen uptake rate profile obtained was used to evaluate the impact of inhibiting toxicants, such as dissolved copper, phenol, sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate and amoxicillin, on activated sludge. The results indicate that ICI is an efficient tool to quantify the intoxication capacity. The activated sludge from the pharmaceutical industry showed higher resistance than the sludge from other sources, since toxicants are widely discharged in the biological treatment system. The ICI range was from 58 to 81% when compared to the synthetic effluent with no toxic substances.

AB Recent research has suggested that the fate of biologically active compounds (BACs) originating from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants is fundamentally different from that of similar compounds released from nonpoint sources through runoff from agricultural landscapes. Downstream from wastewater treatment plants, BACs will degrade via a variety of mechanisms; however, their concentration in the water adjacent to the point of discharge may not decrease over time, as the compounds are continually released. In contrast, in agricultural systems, BACs are episodically introduced to surface water during snowmelt and rainstorm events, and under these circumstances, may be found in water for only hours or days after a storm event. Recent research in our laboratories as well as others, has suggested that sediments play an important role in the persistence of herbicides and steroids in watersheds after nonpoint source loading events. Conceptually, the sediment serves as both a sink and a source, equilibrating with BACs during storm events then slowly releasing them back into the water over time, long after the initial pulse of chemicals has moved downstream.

AB One by-product of advances in modern chemistry is the accumulation of synthetic chemicals in the natural environment. These compounds include contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), some of which are endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) that can have detrimental reproductive effects. The role of sediments in accumulating these types of chemicals and acting as a source of exposure for aquatic organisms is not well understood. Here we present a small-scale reconnaissance of CECs in bed sediments of the lower Columbia River and several tributaries and urban streams. Surficial bed sediment samples were collected from the Columbia River, the Willamette River, the Tualatin River, and several small urban creeks in Oregon. Thirty-nine compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from <1 to >1,000ng [g sediment](-1) dry weight basis. Concentrations and frequencies of detection were higher in tributaries and small urban creeks than in the Columbia River mainstem, suggesting a higher risk of exposure to aquatic life in lower order streams. Ten known or suspected EDCs were detected during the study. At least one EDC was detected at 21 of 23 sites sampled; several EDCs were detected in sediment from most sites. This study is the first to document the occurrence of a large suite of CECs in the sediments of the Columbia River basin. A better understanding of the role of sediment in the fate and effects of emerging contaminants is needed.

AB The use of waters of impaired quality has been suggested as a means to expand available water resources supply for water-limited communities. An ongoing concern is the safety of supplies that use wastewater because of the potential for introduction of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals into drinking water supplies. Prior research into contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) have included a variety of methods, but the only consistent removal is with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, ultraviolet light (UV), and advanced oxidation processes (AOP). However, few of these prior studies have measurable quantities of these contaminants in the influent wastewater, so determining actual removal percentages is difficult. This project was designed to evaluate the removal of CECs to verify that a 3-log removal of common constituents was realized. Spike testing was used to compare to prior research and to evaluate whether the project costs were competitive with other forms of reuse or other water supplies. The combination of RO/UV/AOP was effective at obtaining a 3-log removal of CECs, but the RO and UV/AOP processes alone were not capable of removing all substances. However, despite the extensive treatment, the proposed process was both competitive cost-wise and met the water quality goals.

AB In 2007, a 1.5-year field-scale study was initiated by the U.S. Geological Survey to evaluate the dissipation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) following a first agronomic biosolids application to nonirrigated farmland. CECs with the greatest decrease in concentration in the surface biosolids at 180days post-application included indole, d-limonene, p-cresol, phenol, and skatol. CECs that were present in the largest concentration in 180-day-weathered biosolids included stanols, nonylphenols, bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, hexahydrohexamethyl cyclopenta-benzopyran (HHCB), and triclosan. CECs that were detected in pre-application soil were 3-beta coprostanol, skatol, acetophenone, beta-sitosterol, beta-stigmastanol, cholesterol, indole, p-cresol, and phenol, most of which are biogenic sterols or fragrances that have natural plant sources in addition to anthropogenic sources, yet their concentrations increased (in some cases, substantially) following biosolids application. Preliminary data indicate the nonylphenols (including NPEO1, NPEO2), OPEO1, benzo[a]pyrene, diethyl phthalate, d-limonene, HHCB, triclosan, and possibly 3-beta coprostanol, skatol, beta-sitosterol, cholesterol, indole, and p-cresol, migrated downward through the soil by 468days post-application, but indicated little uptake by mature wheat plants. This study indicates that some CECs are sufficiently persistent and mobile to be vertically transported into the soil column following biosolids applications to the land surface, even in semiarid regions.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a combined pre/post-closure assessment at a long-term wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) site at Fort Gordon near Augusta, Georgia. Here, we assess select endocrine-active chemicals and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure prior to closure of the WWTP. Substantial downstream transport and limited instream attenuation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was observed in Spirit Creek over a 2.2-km stream segment downstream of the WWTP outfall. A modest decline (less than 20% in all cases) in surface water detections was observed with increasing distance downstream of the WWTP and attributed to partitioning to the sediment. Estrogens detected in surface water in this study included estrone (E1), 17-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). The 5ng/l and higher mean estrogen concentrations observed in downstream locations indicated that the potential for endocrine disruption was substantial. Concentrations of alkylphenol ethoxylate (APE) metabolite EDCs also remained statistically elevated above levels observed at the upstream control site. Wastewater-derived pharmaceutical and APE metabolites were detected in the outflow of Spirit Lake, indicating the potential for EDC transport to aquatic ecosystems downstream of Fort Gordon. The results indicate substantial EDC occurrence, downstream transport, and persistence under continuous supply conditions and provide a baseline for a rare evaluation of ecosystem response to WWTP closure.

AB Composite nanofiltration membrane was applied to treat chromaticity and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from printing and dyeing wastewater. The results showed that nanofiltration membrane technology could effectively remove the chromaticity and chemical oxygen demand in the printing and dyeing wastewater, and the average removal rates were 100 and 98 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the process of recovery was up to 90 %. The water flux of the membrane was increased with the feed flow rate and the operating pressure and then decreased with the improvement of the process of recovery.

AB Conventional onsite wastewater treatment system design relies on a septic tank and soil treatment unit (STU) for treatment of wastewater and integration of the final effluent into the environment. Organic water contaminants (OWCs), chemicals found in pharmaceutical drugs, detergents, surfactants, and other personal care and cleaning products, have been observed in septic tank effluent and the environment. Sorption of OWC mass to soil is a key mechanism in the removal and retardation of many of these chemicals in effluent as it travels through an STU. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the fraction of organic carbon of soil and the equilibrium sorption partitioning coefficient of a selected group of relevant and diverse OWCs. A secondary goal is to evaluate current methods of modeling the sorption of selected OWCs in soil. Five point Freundlich isotherms were constructed from equilibrium sorption batch tests for target OWCs with four different soils. For soils with organic carbon fraction between 0.021 and 0.054, K-d values were calculated between 60 and 185 for 4-nonylphenol, 75 to 260 for triclosan, 115 to 270 for bisphenol-A, 3 to 255 for 17 beta-estradiol, 40 to 55 for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and 28 to 70 for estrone. An empirically derived, direct relationship between f(oc) and K-d may be a useful approach to estimating sorption for a soil based on organic carbon content.

AB Pharmaceuticals, once ingested, are commonly metabolized in the body into more polar and soluble forms. These compounds might not be completely removed in the wastewater treatment plants and consequently being discharged into the aquatic ecosystem. In this work, a multi-class sensitive method for the analysis of 21 compounds, including 7 widely consumed pharmaceuticals and 14 relevant metabolites, has been developed based on the use of UHPLC-MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The method was validated in six surface waters (SW) and six effluent wastewaters (EWW) at realistic concentration levels that can be found in waters. The optimized method was applied to the analysis of different types of water samples (rivers, lakes and effluent wastewater), detecting nearly all the parent compounds and metabolites investigated in this work. This fact illustrates that not only pharmaceuticals but also their metabolites are commonly present in these types of waters. Analytical research and monitoring programs should be directed not only towards parent pharmaceuticals but also towards relevant metabolites to have a realistic overview of the impact of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

AB Xenobiotics such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals are an increasingly large problem in aquatic environments. A fixed-bed adsorption filter, used as tertiary stage of sewage treatment, could be a solution to decrease xenobiotics concentrations in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent. The adsorption efficiency of two mineral adsorbent materials (expanded clay (EC) and zeolite (ZE)), both seen as a possible alternative to activated carbon (AC), was evaluated in batch tests. Experiments involving secondary treated domestic wastewater spiked with a cocktail of ten xenobiotics (eight pharmaceuticals and two pesticides) known to be poorly eliminated in conventional biological process were carried out. Removal efficiencies and partitions coefficients were calculated for two levels of initial xenobiotic concentration, i.e, concentrations lower to 10 mu g/L and concentrations ranged from 100 to 1,000 mu g/L. While AC was the most efficient adsorbent material, both alternative adsorbent materials showed good adsorption efficiencies for all ten xenobiotics (from 50 to 100 % depending on the xenobiotic/adsorbent material pair). For all the targeted xenobiotics, at lower concentrations, EC presented the best adsorption potential with higher partition coefficients, confirming the results in terms of removal efficiencies. Nevertheless, Zeolite presents virtually the same adsorption potential for both high and low xenobiotics concentrations to be treated. According to this first batch investigation, ZE and EC could be used as alternative absorbent materials to AC in WWTP.

AB Staphylococci causing diseases in humans and animals are well described, whereas not very much is known about the staphylococci in natural ecosystems. Due to increased consumption of antibiotics, multiresistant species are released with excrements. Therefore, 1048 staphylococci from raw and treated sewage and from receiving water bodies were isolated, identified and tested for resistance against erythromycin, clindamycin, oxacillin and ciprofloxacin. More resistant staphylococci were present in raw sewage (33.8%) than in treated sewage (24.9%) or river water (10.9%). Of all isolates, 20.2% were resistant against the macrolide erythromycin which can induce cross-resistance against lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics (iMLS(B)). Erythromycin is metabolized to anhydroerythromycin and excreted with urine into sewage. The question arises whether anhydroerythromycin can also induce resistance against MLSB antibiotics in staphylococci. This was investigated with antibiotic susceptibility tests (D-tests) and macrodilution assays. Staphylococci with iMLS(B) phenotype in river water were more numerous (27.8%) than in treated sewage (18.9%). The most common MLSB resistance gene was ermC. Traces of erythromycin and anhydroerythromycin (1ngL(-1)) induced already resistance against clindamycin after only 10min exposure. This is reported for the first time and is relevant for risk assessment.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been shown to be biotransformed in water treatment systems. However, little research exists on the effect of initial PPCP concentration on PPCP biotransformation or on the microbial communities treating impacted water. In this study, biological PPCP removal at various concentrations was assessed using laboratory columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. Pyrosequencing was used to examine microbial communities in the columns and in soil from a soil aquifer treatment (SAT; a method of water treatment prior to reuse) site. Laboratory columns were supplied with different concentrations (0.25, 10, 100, or 1,000 mu g liter(-1)) of each of 15 PPCPs. Five PPCPs (4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol [biosol], p-chloro-m-xylenol, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, and phenytoin) were not removed at any tested concentrations. Two PPCPs (naproxen and triclosan) exhibited removals independent of PPCP concentration. PPCP removal efficiencies were dependent on initial concentrations for biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, chlorophene, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, and valproic acid, showing that PPCP concentration can affect biotransformation. Biofilms from sand samples collected from the 0.25- and 10-mu g liter(-1) PPCP columns were pyrosequenced along with SAT soil samples collected on three consecutive days of a wetting and drying cycle to enable comparison of these two communities exposed to PPCPs. SAT communities were similar to column communities in taxonomy and phylotype composition, and both were found to contain close relatives of known PPCP degraders. The efficiency of biological removal of PPCPs was found to be dependent on the concentration at which the contamination occurs for some, but not all, PPCPs.

However, comparative studies on the redox-dependent degradation behavior of organic trace pollutants are scarce. The objective of the study presented herein, was to compile and evaluate data from several comparable previous tank experiments, thus, providing an overview on the redox-dependent removal of a total of 27 wastewater-derived trace compounds, including phenazone type compounds, antimicrobials, -blockers, psychoactive drugs and sulfonamides. Removal rate constants were fitted assuming first-order degradation kinetics. Six compounds were identified to be removed solely under oxic, three compounds solely under anoxic conditions. Others persisted under all experimental conditions, while some were removed under both oxic and anoxic conditions.

AB This study addresses the occurrences and natural fates of chemotherapeutics and controlled drugs when found together in hospital effluents and surface waters. The results revealed the presence of 11 out of 16 drugs in hospital effluents, and the maximum detected concentrations were at the mu g L-1 level in the hospital effluents and the ng L-1 level in surface waters. The highest concentrations corresponded to meperidine, morphine, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. The sunlight photolysis of the target compounds was investigated, and the results indicated that morphine and codeine can be significantly attenuated, with half-lives of 0.27 and 2.5 h, respectively, in natural waters. Photolysis can lower the detected environmental concentrations, also lowering the estimated environmental risks of the target drugs to human health. Nevertheless, 5-fluorouracil and codeine were found to have a high risk quotient (RQ), demonstrating the high risks of directly releasing hospital wastewater into the environment.

AB Although trace concentrations of ibuprofen (IBP) have been detected in diverse water bodies, there is currently insufficient information on the potentially deleterious effects of this xenobiotic. The present study aimed to determine whether IBP induces oxidative stress in brain, liver, gill, and blood of the common carp Cyprinus carpio. To this end, the median lethal concentration at 96 h (96-h LC50) was determined and the lowest observed adverse effect level was established. Carp were exposed to the latter concentration (17.6 mg L-1) for 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and the following biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPX) and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Results indicated that LPX and antioxidant enzymes' activity increased significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to the control group in liver, gill, and blood, while no significant differences occurred in brain. In conclusion, IBP induced oxidative stress on C. carpio, the liver being the organ most affected by this damage.

AB Amphibian populations have been decreasing in urban freshwater systems in Korea. To elucidate the biological safety of treated wastewater effluent (TWE) in the Tancheon basin, the capital area of Korea, a 7-d-exposure Bombina orientalis embryo developmental toxicity assay was examined during the breeding season. In March, there were no significant differences in embryonic survival or malformation among the water samples. In July, following monsoon precipitation, embryonic lethality in TWE was significantly higher than in the upstream water sample. Malformation in TWE and TWE-mixed waters was significantly higher than in the control and upstream water samples. Tail muscle height of tadpoles also significantly decreased in TWE and TWE-mixed waters. Heavy metals were not detected in any samples. Total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chemical oxygen demand in TWE markedly increased together with a decrease in dissolved oxygen in July. The increase in organic and inorganic loading following precipitation could have made TWE and TWE-mixed water not suitable for embryonic development. Though being managed based on physicochemical criteria, the water quality of TWE may not be sufficient to assure normal development of amphibian embryos. An amphibian developmental toxicity assay would be helpful for the water-quality management of TWE and urban freshwater systems in Korea. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:954-961. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB The azole fungicide fluconazole has been reported to be persistent in conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study investigated the photodegradation of fluconazole under UV-254 in aqueous solutions. The results revealed that the photodegradation of fluconazole was pH-dependent (2.0-12.0) following the pseudo-first-order kinetics with quantum yield values ranging from 0.023 to 0.090 mol einstein(-1), and it underwent a direct and self-sensitized mechanism involving O-1(2). The main photodegradation by-products were identified and semi-quantitated. The proposed photodegradation pathway included hydroxylative defluorination reaction. The 72 h-NOEC and 72 h-LOEC values for fluconazole using a freshwater unicellular green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were 10 mu M and 15 mu M. Overall, the photodegradation of fluconazole produced a significant decrease in algal toxicity. It also proved that the photodegradation by-products will not present extra toxicity to this alga than fluconazole itself. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper compares the removal performances of two complete wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for all priority substances listed in the Water Framework Directive and additional compounds of interest including flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides, and personal care products (PCPs) (n = 104). First, primary treatments such as physicochemical lamellar settling (PCLS) and primary settling (PS) are compared. Similarly, biofiltration (BF) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) are then examined. Finally, the removal efficiency per unit of nitrogen removed of both WWTPs for micropollutants is discussed, as nitrogenous pollution treatment results in a special design of processes and operational conditions. For primary treatments, hydrophobic pollutants (log K (ow) > 4) are well removed (> 70 %) for both systems despite high variations of removal. PCLS allows an obvious gain of about 20 % regarding pollutant removals, as a result of better suspended solids elimination and possible coagulant impact on soluble compounds. For biological treatments, variations of removal are much weaker, and the majority of pollutants are comparably removed within both systems. Hydrophobic and volatile compounds are well (> 60 %) or very well removed (> 80 %) by sorption and volatilization. Some readily biodegradable molecules are better removed by CAS, indicating a better biodegradation. A better sorption of pollutants on activated sludge could be also expected considering the differences of characteristics between a biofilm and flocs. Finally, comparison of global processes efficiency using removals of micropollutants load normalized to nitrogen shows that PCLS + BF is as efficient as PS + CAS despite a higher compactness and a shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT). Only some groups of pollutants seem better removed by PS + CAS like alkylphenols, flame retardants, or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), thanks to better biodegradation and sorption resulting from HRT and biomass characteristics. For both processes, and out of the 68 molecules found in raw water, only half of them are still detected in the water discharged, most of the time close to their detection limit. However, some of them are detected at higher concentrations (> 1 mu g/L and/or lower than environmental quality standards), which is problematic as they represent a threat for aquatic environment.

AB A bioanalytical approach was used to identify chemical contaminants at river sites located downstream from a pharmaceutical factory, where reproductive alterations in wild fish have been previously observed. By using polar organic compound integrative samplers (POCIS) at upstream and downstream sites, biological activity profiles based on in vitro bioassays revealed the occurrence of xenobiotic and steroid-like activities, including very high glucocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid, progestogenic and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-like activities (mu g standard-EQ/g of sorbent range), and weak estrogenic activity (ng E2-EQ/g of sorbent range). Chemical analyses detected up to 60 out of 118 targeted steroid and pharmaceutical compounds in the extracts. In vitro profiling of occurring individual chemicals revealed the ability of several ones to act as agonist and/or antagonist of different steroids receptors. Mass balance calculation identified dexamethasone, spironolactone, and 6-alpha-methylprednisolone as major contributors to corticosteroid activities and levonorgestrel as the main contributor to progestogenic activities. Finally, RP-HPLC based fractionation of POCIS extracts and testing activity of fractions confirmed identified compounds and further revealed the presence of other unknown active chemicals. This study is one of the first to report environmental contamination by such chemicals; their possible contribution to in situ effects on fish at the same site is suggested.

AB Pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs are contaminants that are generally ubiquitous in wastewater treatment plant effluents with their release into the environment being well understood in North America, Europe, and Asia. There is, however, less information on the release of human pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs from regions undergoing rapid land use, economical, and social changes, such as Brazil. This encompasses many areas in the tropical zone where releases of emerging contaminants may impact pristine, bio-diversity rich ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals and the illicit drug cocaine was determined in the Rio Negro and two of its tributaries that receive large amounts of untreated sewage, the Igarape Mindu and the Igarape do 40, passing through the city of Manaus, Brazil. In addition to cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecognine, propranolol, diclofenac, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, carbamazepine-epoxide, citalopram, metoprolol, carisoprolol, and sertraline were all detected in two urban tributaries at low ng/l concentrations similar to those typically found in urban surface waters. Concentrations in the Rio Negro were typically lower than detection limits due to the large level of dilution, although traces of a range of pharmaceuticals were detected in the Rio Negro in proximity of the confluence of the urban streams. The data represent new information on the emissions of pharmaceuticals from a newly industrialized region of Brazil.

AB This study tested the hypotheses that (1) exposure to treated Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) effluent will induce biological effects in exposed fish that are consistent with environmental estrogen (EE) exposure; and (2) seasonal differences in effluent composition will moderate biological effects. We conducted seven on-site exposures using a mobile laboratory. Total estrogenicity of effluents was 10- to 20-fold higher during spring than in fall. Common EEs including steroid estrogens, alkylphenols, and bisphenol-A were ubiquitous. An unusual spike in total estrogenicity identified a combined sewer overflow event. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) responded to exposure with subtle changes in vitellogenin concentrations and secondary sex characteristics. An opportunity to assess a common carp (Cyprinus carpio) population permanently sustained inside the Stickney WRP revealed pronounced exposure effects, but also the resilience of biological organisms even under long-term exposure. In contrast to other studies, no histopathological changes were found. The mobile exposure laboratory proved capable of maintaining U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-recommended exposure conditions while providing flexibility for rapid deployment at multiple sites with minimal operational disruption. Further studies using this platform hold promise to resolve the convoluted interactions between complex effluents and inherent biological complexity.

AB Recently, there have been growing concerns about pharmaceuticals including antibiotics as environmental contaminants. Antibiotics of concentrations commonly encountered in wastewater have been suggested to affect bacterial population dynamics and to promote dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Conventional wastewater treatment processes do not always adequately remove pharmaceuticals causing environmental dissemination of low levels of these compounds. Using constructed wetlands as an additional treatment step after sewage treatment plants have been proposed as a cheap alternative to increase reduction of wastewater contaminants, however this means that the natural microbial community of the wetlands becomes exposed to elevated levels of antibiotics. In this study, experimental surface-flow wetlands in Sweden were continuously exposed to antibiotics of concentrations commonly encountered in wastewater. The aim was to assess the antibiotic removal efficiency of constructed wetlands and to evaluate the impact of low levels of antibiotics on bacterial diversity, resistance development and expression in the wetland bacterial community. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and the effect on the bacterial diversity was assessed with 16S rRNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Real-time PCR was used to detect and quantify antibiotic resistance genes and integrons in the wetlands, during and after the exposure period. The results indicated that the antibiotic removal efficiency of constructed wetlands was comparable to conventional wastewater treatment schemes. Furthermore, short-term treatment of the constructed wetlands with environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 100-2000 ng x 1(-1)) of antibiotics did not significantly affect resistance gene concentrations, suggesting that surface-flow constructed wetlands are well-suited for wastewater treatment purposes.

AB Reports concerning the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals in marine ecosystems are somewhat limited. It is necessary to determine pharmaceutical fate and assess any potential risk of exposure to aquatic species and ultimately, seafood consumers. In the work presented herein, analytical methods were optimised and validated for the quantification of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater effluent, receiving marine waters and marine mussels (Mytilus spp.). Selected pharmaceuticals included two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac and mefenamic acid), an antibiotic (trimethoprim), an antiepileptic (carbamazepine) and a lipid regulator (gemfibrozil). This paper also presents the results of an in situ study in which caged Mytilus spp. were deployed at three sites on the Irish coastline over a 1-year period. In water samples, pharmaceutical residues were determined using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extraction of pharmaceuticals from mussel tissues used an additional pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) step prior to SPE and LC-MS/MS. Limits of quantification between 15 and 225 ng.L-1 were achieved in wastewater effluent, between 3 and 38 ng.L-1 in marine surface water and between 4 and 29 ng.g(-1) dry weight in marine mussels. Method linearity was achieved for pharmaceuticals in each matrix with correlation coefficients of R-2 >= 0.976. All five selected pharmaceuticals were quantified in wastewater effluent and marine surface waters. This work has demonstrated the susceptibility of the Mytilus spp. to pharmaceutical exposure following the detection of pharmaceutical residues in the tissues of this mussel species at measurable concentrations.

AB In this paper the photocatalytic degradation of the 0.2 mM ibuprofen (2-(4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)propanoic acid) in aqueous solution (pH 3) has been carried out by the homogeneous photocatalysis (photo-Fenton) process. This method consists of coupling Fenton's reagent and UV-C irradiation in order to catalyse the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals, a powerful oxidizing agent which leads to degradation of organic pollutants until total mineralization. The effect of H2O2 and Fe3+ (catalyst) concentration on the TOC removal has been examined and the performances of photo-Fenton process have been also compared with other photochemical processes such as direct photolysis (UV alone) and H2O2 photolysis (H2O2/UV). The results have shown that the photo-Fenton process appeared more effective than the other systems studied and the TOC removal decreased in the sequence: photo Fenton >H2O2/UV>UV alone. The kinetics study showed that the TOC removal follows the second-order kinetics. It was found that the concentrations of H2O2 and ferric iron constitute key factors governing the TOC removal and that the optimal concentrations are equal to 10 mM of H2O2 and 0.25 mM Fe3+. In these conditions, 96% of initial TOC has been removed after 8 h of irradiation time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A continuously operated laboratory scale anaerobic and aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) combined with O-3/H2O2 process was experimented for antibiotic fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 26.6% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed, and 931.75 mg/L of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was produced under the optimum conditions of the anaerobic MBBR at an influent pH of 6.5, hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 hr and organic loading rate (OLR) of 13 kg COD/(m(3).d) for the hydrolysis/acidification process. In addition, 91.0% of COD was removed at 1.5 m(3)/h of aeration rate with the aerobic MBBR. The shape of bacteria inside the bio-carriers was characterized by a scanning electron microscope. The anaerobic MBBR bacteria were observed as long bacilli, and the aerobic MBBR bacteria were observed as mainly cocci and short bacilli. Finally, the residual non-biodegraded pollutants were mineralized by O-3/H2O2 oxidation with 0.5 of H2O2/O-3 molar ratio and 15 min of reaction time. The total removal efficiencies of COD and color reached 99.2 and 98.7%, respectively. Thus, this method might offer an effective way to treat wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of both natural estrogens, estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3), and a synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), were investigated in sewage treatment plant in Centre Eastern Tunisia employing simple activated sludge process. Concentrations of target estrogens were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer. Among the estrogens studied, E3 was found as the dominant compound detected in wastewater samples with average concentration up to 300 +/- 4 ng/L in influent and up to 36 +/- 2 in effluent. High aqueous phase removals (>85%) were achieved for E3, while only low to moderate removals for E1, E2, and EE2 (<75%). Based on the mass balance analysis, sorption onto sludge played a dominant role in the removal of estrogens in warm season, especially for E1 and E2 (69.5 and 66.3%, respectively), while biological degradation played a significant role in hot season (61%).

AB Many scientific studies reveal the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments. Pharmaceutical industry and sewage are the main sources of these compounds in the receiving environments. In this study, we investigate the fate of a simultaneous release of three drugs (antifungal, antibiotic, and antihistamine) in municipal wastewaters. To achieve this objective, a set of physical and chemical analysis is carried out. The obtained results show that releasing individual and concurrent drugs have a direct impact on the quantity and the quality of different constituent materials of waste water.

AB Removal of nine pharmaceutical compoundsacetaminophen (AAF), antipyrine (ANT), caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CRB), diclofenac (DCF), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), ketorolac (KET), metoprolol (MET) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)spiked in a primary sedimentation effluent of a municipal wastewater has been studied with sequential aerobic biological and ozone advanced oxidation systems. Combinations of ozone, UVA black light and Fe(III) or Fe3O4 constituted the chemical systems. During the biological treatment (hydraulic residence time, HRT = 24h), only AAF and CAF were completely eliminated, MET, SMX and HCT reached partial removal rates and the rest of compounds were completely refractory. With any ozone advanced oxidation process applied, the remaining pharmaceuticals disappear in less than 10min. Fe3O4 or Fe(III) photocatalytic ozonation leads to 35% mineralization compared to 13% reached during ozonation alone after about 30-min reaction. Also, biodegradability of the treated wastewater increased 50% in the biological process plus another 150% after the ozonation processes. Both untreated and treated wastewater was non-toxic for Daphnia magna (D. magna) except when Fe(III) was used in photocatalytic ozonation. In this case, toxicity was likely due to the ferryoxalate formed in the process. Kinetic information on ozone processes reveals that pharmaceuticals at concentrations they have in urban wastewater are mainly removed through free radical oxidation.

AB Nonsteroidal human pharmaceuticals are prevalent in domestic wastewater and may find their way into the environment at low concentrations. Since most pharmaceuticals are designed to be biologically active at low concentrations, there is a risk that these compounds may affect aquatic wildlife. Of particular concern is the occurrence of pharmaceutical mixtures, which may lead to increased adverse effects compared to individual compounds. Interactive effects were previously demonstrated for amphibians exposed to pesticide mixtures, but no such studies investigating responses of amphibians to pharmaceutical mixtures are apparently available. Results demonstrated increased toxicity (loss of tactile response) of striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) tadpoles exposed to a mixture of naproxen, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole, compared to exposures to the individual compounds. Significant time x treatment interactions were observed for tadpole development following chronic exposures to 10 or 100 mu g/L of each compound and the mixture; however, responses were weak and main treatment effects were not significant. Despite minor effects at low exposure concentrations, results demonstrated a potential for mixtures of nonsteroidal pharmaceuticals commonly occurring in wastewater to influence amphibian development. With the vast numbers of pharmaceuticals that exist and are found in the environment, this work highlights a need for further research into mixtures of pharmaceutically active wastewater contaminants. Further, since pharmaceuticals exert extremely varied biological actions, it is suggested that future investigations would benefit from inclusion of endpoints that are indicative of physiological or metabolic performance, as well as assessment of sensitive behavioral responses.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are two important groups of emerging pollutants due to their toxicological and chemical characteristics and their persistent detection in the aquatic environment. Wastewater treatment plants are a significant pathway for their transfer to the water courses. It is well evidenced that these chemicals are only partially removed through biological treatment of wastewater and therefore being detected in secondary effluents. This work focuses on the evaluation of the efficiency of two well-established disinfection technologies (chlorination and UV irradiation) along with UV/H O-2 (2) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) to remove these chemicals from biologically treated wastewater. Based on the results it is shown that appreciable removal efficiencies due to chlorination should be expected for most of the target compounds, whereas this was not the case for ibuprofen and ketoprofen. With the exemption of diclofenac and ketoprofen direct UV irradiation did not efficiently removed target compounds for UV doses usually applied for disinfection purposes. The application of advanced UV treatment through the addition of H O-2 (2) although resulted in increased removal of the target compounds is not sufficient at moderate UV and H O-2 (2) doses to achieve satisfactory removal efficiencies. PAC use resulted in sufficient removal of target compounds although high PAC doses were required for some chemicals. Comparison of Freundlich isotherms of this study with those of other studies, derived employing water samples, suggested that the water matrix along with the target compounds concentration range can significantly affect the outcome of the experiments.

AB Separating urine from domestic wastewater promotes a more sustainable municipal wastewater treatment system. This study investigated the feasibility of applying a forward osmosis (FO) dewatering process for nutrient recovery from source-separated urine under different conditions, using seawater or desalination brine as a low-cost draw solution. The filtration process with the active layer facing feed solution exhibited relatively high water fluxes up to 20 L/m(2)-h. The process also revealed relatively low rejection to neutral organic nitrogen (urea-N) in fresh urine but improved rejection of ammonium (50-80%) in hydrolyzed urine and high rejection (>90%) of phosphate, potassium in most cases. Compared to simulation based on the solution diffusion mechanism, higher water flux and solute flux were obtained using fresh or hydrolyzed urine as the feed, which was attributed to the intensive forward nutrient permeation (i.e., of urea, ammonium, and potassium). Membrane fouling could be avoided by prior removal of the spontaneously precipitated crystals in urine. Compared to other urine treatment options, the current process was cost-effective and environmentally friendly for nutrient recovery from urban wastewater at source, yet a comprehensive life-cycle impact assessment might be needed to evaluate and optimize the overall system performance at pilot and full scale operation.

AB Removal of pharmaceuticals (PhCs) by photocatalysis is a promising avenue in water treatment. The efficiency of these treatments on PhC derivatives compared to their parent molecules remains poorly documented. The present study investigates the efficiency of photodegradation catalyzed by TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles on the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and three of its derivatives; carbamazepine epoxide (CBZ-E), acridine (Al), and acridone (AO). The effects of environmental parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and natural organic matter content on photodegradation efficiency (transformation after 6 hand kinetics) were tested. We report that the efficiency of the catalysts (TiO2 and ZnO) can be very different when comparing CBZ and its derivatives (CBZ-E, Al and AO). TiO2 was more efficient than ZnO at degrading CBZ and CBZ-E. For Al and AO, no significant differences were observed between the two catalysts. We also report that environmental parameters have contrasting effects on the efficiency of the photodegradation of CBZ compared to its derivatives. Changing pH and organic matter content had the most contrasted effects; the photodegradation of CBZ and CBZ-E was significantly affected by pH (especially in presence of TiO2 NPs) and by the presence of natural organic matter. In contrast, the photodegradation of Al and AO was not affected by pH and organic matter. Only the photodegradation of CBZ was clearly affected by IS and solely at very high IS (I M). Overall, our results highlight that TiO2 and ZnO catalysts present contrasted efficiency on the removal of CBZ when compared to its derivatives (CBZ-E, Al and AO). Our results also show that the effect of environmental parameters on the efficiency of the photodegradation of CBZ derivatives cannot be predicted based on the behavior of the parent molecule (CBZ).

AB This work did a systematic investigation on removal of trace antibiotics from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent through nanofiltration (NF), and disposal of the NE concentrate by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Four antibiotics, namely, norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), roxithromycin (ROX) and azithromycin (AZI), which had high detection frequencies in effluents from WWTPs in Dalian (China), were selected as the target micropollutants. High rejections of antibiotics (>98%) were obtained in all sets of NF experiments. UV254 photolysis, ozonation and UV/O-3 process were employed to treat NF concentrate. Results demonstrated that UV254 photolysis was not effective in degrading the four antibiotics, while ozone-based processes exhibited high removal efficiencies in 30 min. A synergetic effect between O-3 and UV was observed in degradation of the selected antibiotics during UV/O-3 treatment. Generation of hydroxyl radicals in the process was testified using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping technology. In treatment of NF concentrate from real secondary effluent, UV/O-3 process achieved excellent removal efficiencies of antibiotics (>87%), a partial removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (40%), an increase of BOD5/COD ratio (4.6 times), and a reduction of acute toxicity (58%).

AB Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the oxidative degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in various waters, by Fe(II)-activated persulfate process. Results show that the Fe2+/S2O82- process is very effective for the elimination of CBZ and characterized by a two-stage kinetics (a rapid initial decay followed by a retardation stage). CBZ degradation reaction was observed to be pH dependent and the optimum pH is 3.0 in the range of 2.00-7.87. The concentration of Fe2+ and S2O82- exhibited a noticeable influence on CBZ removal efficiency, where [S2O82-] exerted more significant effects than that of [Fe2+]. The optimal molar ratio of CBZ, Fe2+, and S2O82- is found to be 1:5:40. The effect of various inorganic anions on CBZ removal was also evaluated under the optimal conditions. The anions NO3-, SO42- and H2PO4- caused a negative effect on the performance of this process, while Cl- interestingly accelerated CBZ degradation. The higher the Cl- concentration, the faster the CBZ decay rate. The intermediates were identified during CBZ degradation with and without the presence of Cl-. The evolution of intermediates for these two scenarios was compared. The decay pathways of CBZ were proposed accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study was undertaken to report the modeling of the dosing-time-dependent adverse effects of both untreated and biologically-treated pharmaceutical wastewater in mice. The mice were housed in a room controlled at 24 degrees C under a 12 h/12 h dark-light cycle (light 7:00-19:00 h) for two weeks before initiating the experiments and allowed free access to food and water. A single dose of pharmaceutical or bioremediated effluent was administrated intraperitoneally (10 mL/kg) to mice divided in six circadian stages [1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 hours after light onset (HALO)]. The surviving treated mice exhibited a significant circadian variation in body weight loss (p < 0.001). Pharmaceutical wastewater dosing at 17 HALO resulted in -6.5% weight loss, whereas drug dosing at 9 HALO was + 1.2% (&#1060; = 19.42 HALO +/- 1.25 h, p < 0.01). Only on the dark span, the proportion of dead mice was dosing-time-dependent (chi(2) = 12.7; p < 0.001). Pharmaceutical wastewater dosing at 17 HALO resulted in the poorest (67%) survival rate; whereas, the best survival was noted in the rest span with 100%. Troughs of motor incoordination were located at the administration times of 9 and 21 HALO (16% of animals affected), whereas peaks were located at 5 and 17 HALO (38 and 55% of animals affected, respectively). A statistically significant ultradian component rhythm with a trial period = 12 h, was detected by cosinor (p < 0.009) the &#1060; = 17.00 HALO +/- 1.70 h modulo 12 h. The toxicity was totally removed when the mice were treated by the bioremediated effluent. This indicates that Pseudomonas putida was able to completely detoxify the toxic pharmaceutical effluent. With regards to these data, the optimal tolerance to untreated pharmaceutical wastewater occurred in the light-rest span of mice.

AB In this study, the treatment process of three cosmetic wastewater types has been investigated. Coagulation allowed to achieve chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 74.6%, 37.7% and 74.0% for samples A (Al-2(SO4)(3)), B (Brentafloc F3) and C (PAX 16), respectively. The Fenton process proved to be effective as well - COD removal was equal to 75.1%, 44.7% and 68.1%, respectively. Coagulation with FeCl3 and the subsequent photo-Fenton process resulted in the best values of final COD removal equal to 92.4%, 62.8% and 90.2%. In case of the Fenton process, after coagulation these values were equal to 74.9%, 50.1% and 84.8%, while in case of the H2O2/UV process, the obtained COD removal was 83.8%, 36.2% and 80.9%. High value of COD removal in the Fenton process carried out for A and C wastewater samples was caused by a significant contribution of the final neutralization/coagulation. Very small effect of the oxidation reaction in the Fenton process in case of sample A resulting from the presence of antioxidants, OH radical scavengers' in the wastewater.

AB Cytostatic drugs are pharmaceutically active compounds used in chemotherapy to prevent or disrupt cell division. Only a few environmental studies have been focused on cytostatic drugs, in spite of their toxicity, their increasing consumption, and their discharge into municipal sewage. This fact can be mainly due to the lack of methods for their simultaneous analysis. This research describes the occurrence of 14 cytostatic drugs in influent and effluent wastewater from four wastewater treatment plants located in Seville (Spain) during 1-year period. A preliminary environmental risk assessment was also carried out. Five cytostatic drugs (cytarabine, etoposide, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, and methotrexate) were detected in influent wastewater at concentration levels up to 464 ng L-1 (cytarabine). Six of them (cytarabine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine) were detected in effluent wastewater at concentration levels up to 190 ng L-1 (cytarabine). Most of the detected cytostatic drugs are not significantly removed during wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, neither ecotoxicological nor genotoxical risks are expected to occur at the measured concentrations on the aquatic environment.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are commonly detected in the environment. Concern over these compounds in the environment center around the potential for pharmaceuticals to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. The main focus of endocrine disruption research has centered on how estrogenic and androgenic compounds interact with-the endocrine system to elicit reproductive effects. Other classes of compounds, such as progestins, have been overlooked. Recently, studies have investigated the potential for synthetic progestins to impair reproduction and growth in aquatic organisms. The present study utilizes the OECD 210 Early-life Stage (ELS) study to investigate the impacts levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic progestin, on fathead minnow (FHM) survival and growth. After 28 days post-hatch, survival of larval FHM was impacted at 462 ng/L, while growth was significantly reduced at 86.9 ng/L. Further analysis was conducted by measuring specific endocrine related mRNA transcript profiles in FHM larvae following the 28 day ELS exposure to LNG. Transcripts of 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP17, AR, ER alpha, and FSH were significantly down-regulated following 28 d exposure to 16.3 ng/L LNG, while exposure to 86.9 ng/L significantly down-regulated 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP19A, and FSH. At 2392 ng/L of LNG, a significant down-regulation occurred with CYP19A and ER beta transcripts, while mPR alpha and mPR beta profiles were significantly induced. No significant changes occurred in 11 beta-HSD, CYP11A, StAR, LH beta, and VTG mRNA expression following LNG exposure. An ex vivo steroidogenesis assay was conducted with sexually mature female FHM following a 7 day exposure 100 ng/L LNG with significant reductions observed in pregnenolone, 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20-DHP), testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone. Together these data suggest LNG can negatively impact FHM larval survival and growth, with significant alterations in endocrine related responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater reclamation for municipal irrigation is an increasingly attractive option for extending water supplies. However, public health concerns include the potential for development of antibiotic resistance (AR) in environmental bacteria after exposure to residual pharmaceuticals in reclaimed water. Though scientific studies have reported high levels of AR in soils irrigated with wastewater, these works often fail to address the soil resistome, or the natural occurrence of AR. This study compared AR patterns in sediment Enterococcus isolated from water storage basins containing either reclaimed water or groundwater in central Arizona. Resistance to 16 antibiotics was quantified in isolates to a depth of 30 cm. Results reveal high levels of resistance to certain antibiotics, including lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin, exists in sediments regardless of the water source (groundwater, reclaimed water), and higher AR was not detectable in reclaimed water sediments. Furthermore, multiple-antibiotic-resistance (MAR) was substantially reduced in isolates from reclaimed water sediments, compared to freshwater sediment isolates. Comparing the development of AR in sediment bacteria at these two sites will increase awareness of the environmental and public health impacts of using reclaimed water for irrigation of municipal areas, and illustrates the necessity for control sites in studies examining AR development in environmental microbiota.

TI Monitoring for contaminants of emerging concern in drinking water using
   POCIS passive samplers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER; PHARMACEUTICALS; CALIBRATION; RATES
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) have been detected in drinking water world-wide. The source of most of these compounds is generally attributed to contamination from municipal wastewater. Traditional water sampling methods (grab or composite) often require the concentration of large amounts of water in order to detect trace levels of these contaminants. The Polar Organic Compounds Integrative Sampler (POCIS) is a passive sampling technology that has been developed to concentrate trace levels of CEC to provide time-weighted average concentrations for individual compounds in water. However, few studies to date have evaluated whether POCIS is suitable for monitoring contaminants in drinking water. In this study, the POCIS was evaluated as a monitoring tool for CEC in drinking water over a period of 2 and 4 weeks with comparisons to typical grab samples. Seven "indicator compounds" which included carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, estrone and sucralose, were monitored in five drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in Ontario. All indicator compounds were detected in raw water samples from the POCIS in comparison to six from grab samples. Similarly, four compounds were detected in grab samples of treated drinking water, whereas six were detected in the POCIS. Sucralose was the only compound that was detected consistently at all five plants. The POCIS technique provided integrative exposures of CECs in drinking water at lower detection limits, while episodic events were captured via traditional sampling methods. There was evidence that the accumulation of target compounds by POCIS is a dynamic process, with adsorption and desorption on the sorbent occurring in response to ambient levels of the target compounds in water. CECs in treated drinking water were present at low ng L-1 concentrations, which are not considered to be a threat to human health.

AB The occurrence and removal of six pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including caffeine (CF), N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), carbamazepine, metoprolol, trimethoprim (TMP), and sulpiride in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Shanghai, China were studied in January 2013; besides, grab samples of the influent were also taken every 6 h, to investigate the daily fluctuation of the wastewater influent. The results showed the concentrations of the investigated PPCPs ranged from 17 to 11,400 ng/L in the WWTP. A low variability of the PPCP concentrations in the wastewater influent throughout the day was observed, with the relative standard deviations less than 25 % for most samples. However, for TMP and CF, the slight daily fluctuation still reflected their consumption patterns. All the target compounds except CF and DEET, exhibited poor removal efficiencies (< 40 %) by biological treatment process, probably due to the low temperature in the bioreactor, which was unfavorable for activated sludge. While for the two biodegradable PPCPs, CF, and DEET, the anaerobic and oxic tank made contributions to their removal while the anoxic tank had a negative effect to their elimination. The tertiary UV treatment removed the investigated PPCPs by 5-38 %, representing a crucial polishing step to compensate for the poor removal by the biologic treatment process in winter.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical drugs in the environment is an important field of toxicology, since such residues can cause deleterious effects on exposed biota. This study assessed the ecotoxicological acute and chronic effects of two anticholinesterasic drugs, neostigmine and pyridostigmine in Daphnia magna. Our study calculated 48 h-EC50 values for the immobilization assay of 167.7 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and 91.3 mu g L-1 for pyridostigmine. In terms of feeding behavior, we calculated a 5 h-EC50 for filtration rates of 7.1 and 0.2 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively; for the ingestion rates, the calculated EC50 values were, respectively, 7.5 and 0.2 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine. In the reproduction assay, the most affected parameter was the somatic growth rate (LOECs of 21.0 and 2.9 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively), followed by the fecundity (LOECs of 41.9 and 11.4 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively). We also determined a 48 h-IC50 for cholinesterase activity of 1.7 and 4.5 mu g L-1 for neostigmine and pyridostigmine, respectively. These results demonstrated that both compounds are potentially toxic for D. magna at concentrations in the order of the mu g L-1.

AB Transformations of cocaine and eleven of its metabolites were investigated in untreated municipal sewage at pH a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 7 and 9, 23, and 31 A degrees C. Results indicated that hydrolysis-possibly bacterially mediated-was the principal transformation pathway. Residues possessing alkyl esters were particularly susceptible to hydrolysis, with pseudo-first-order rate constants varying from 0.54 to 1.7 day(-1) at 23 A degrees C. Metabolites lacking esters or possessing only a benzoyl ester appeared stable. Residues lacking alkyl esters did accumulate through hydrolysis of precursors, however. As noted previously, this may positively bias cocaine utilization estimates based on benzoylecgonine alone. Reported variability in metabolic excretion was used in conjunction with transformation data to evaluate different approaches for estimating cocaine loading. Results indicate that estimates derived from measurands that capture all major cocaine metabolites, such as COCtot (the sum of all measurable metabolites) and EChyd (the sum of all metabolites that can be hydrolyzed to ecgonine), may reduce uncertainty arising from variability in metabolite transformation and excretion, possibly to a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 10 % RSD. This is more than a two-fold reduction relative to estimates derived from benzoylecgonine (> 26 % RSD), and roughly equivalent to reported uncertainties from sources that are not metabolite-specific (e.g., sampling frequency, flow variability). They and other composite measurands merit consideration from the sewage epidemiology community, beginning with efforts to evaluate the stability of the total cocaine load under realistic sewer conditions.

AB This study aimed to provide the first and comprehensive data on the occurrence of 17 target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in urban water environment in Singapore. Meanwhile, this study also verified the suitability of these PPCPs as specific markers of raw wastewater contamination in receiving water bodies in highly urbanized areas where both surface water and groundwater are not impacted by the discharge of treated wastewater effluents. Analytical results of wastewater showed that among 17 target PPCPs examined, only 5 PPCPs were detected in 100 % of raw wastewater samples, including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CF), diethyltoluamide (DEET), and salicylic acid (SA). Similarly, these PPCPs were found in most surface water and groundwater. Interestingly, the three PPCPs (ACT, CBZ, and SA) were only detected in surface water and groundwater in the sampling sites close to relatively older sewer systems, while they were absent in background samples that were collected from the catchment with no known wastewater sources. This suggests that ACT, CBZ, and SA can be used as specific molecular markers of raw wastewater in surface water and groundwater. This study also confirmed that CF and DEET were not really associated with wastewater sources, thus cannot serve well as specific molecular markers of wastewater contamination in receiving water bodies. To the best knowledge of the authors, the use of ACT and SA as specific molecular markers of raw wastewater contamination in urban surface waters and groundwater was first reported. Further studies on the use of ACT, CBZ, and SA along with other chemical/microbial markers are recommended to identify and differentiate contamination sources of surface waters/groundwater.

AB The antimicrobial compounds triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) accumulate in sludges produced during municipal wastewater treatment and persist through sludge treatment processes into finished biosolids. The objective of this research was to determine the extent to which conventional sludge processing systems such as aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion, and lime stabilization were able to remove TCC and TCS. The concentrations of TCC and TCS in sludge and biosolid samples were determined via heated solvent extraction and analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The removal of TCC and TCS in municipal biosolid processing systems was determined from the measured concentration change after correcting for reductions in solid mass during sludge treatment. Removal in the digester systems ranged from 15 to 68% for TCC and 20 to 75% for TCS. Increased solid retention times during sludge treatment operations were correlated with higher removals of TCC and TCS.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) belonging to different therapeutic classes (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, antiepileptics, and lipid regulators) in hospital wastewater and surface water samples was investigated for the first time in Vietnam. Analytical results showed that 10 PhACs, including naproxen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, diclofenac, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, and carbamazepine were detected at least once in the hospital wastewater samples. The detection of these PhACs in hospital wastewater demonstrates that hospital effluents are considered a significant source of pollution of the environment by pharmaceuticals. Our initial results showed that only ibuprofen was removed efficiently by the wastewater treatment plant at sampling site S2. The presence of PhACs in surface water samples may reflect the impacts of wastewater contamination in surface water bodies. The ubiquitous occurrence of carbamazepine in both wastewater and surface water may suggest that carbamazepine can potentially serve as a good molecular marker indicating wastewater contamination in surface water. A tentative assessment of environmental risk of PhACs for surface water has been discussed. Risk quotients higher than one were observed only for carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, suggesting that these compounds seem to show high risk for aquatic ecosystems.

   PHOTODEGRADATION; ECOTOXICOLOGICAL RISK
AB Sunlight photodegradation has long been considered a significant process in lowering the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface waters and thus decreasing the ecological risk. For the first time, this study identified the significance of investigating the environmental photodegradation of a pharmaceutical residue mixture (rather than a single compound) and the associated toxicity of transformation byproducts in environmental waters, including rivers, hospital wastewaters, and effluents from wastewater treatment plants and pharmaceutical production facilities. Pharmaceuticals undergo phototransformation rather than mineralization (11-23% in 34 h). Pharmaceutical mixtures could possibly act as dissolved organic matter for each individual compound and subsequently affect the photolysis rates. The increased toxicity of irradiated pharmaceutical mixtures challenges the validity of the current understanding of sunlight photolysis. The implications of this work suggest that current knowledge concerning the occurrence, natural attenuation, ecotoxicity, and human health risks of pharmaceuticals is far from complete; photolysis is not necessarily a purification process.

AB Sorption and leaching potential of ibuprofen, estrone and 17 beta estradiol were tested in two agricultural soils: one irrigated using municipal wastewater and the other used in rainfed agriculture. Batch sorption-desorption experiments and undisturbed soil column assays were carried out using both soils to which were added a mixture of the target compounds. The three compounds were sorbed to a different extent by both soils: estrone > 17 beta estradiol > ibuprofen. Higher sorption was observed in the irrigated soil, which was attributed to the accumulation of organic matter caused by wastewater irrigation. Desorption of hormones was hysteretic in the irrigated soil, while ibuprofen showed low hysteresis in both soils. Retardation of the compounds' displacement was consistent with the sorption pattern observed in the batch tests. Retardation factor (R-F) was similar for the three compounds in the two tested soils, indicating that the target compounds are much more mobile in the soil columns than would be predicted based on their equilibrium sorption parameters. The results obtained in the experiments clarify the role of wastewater irrigated soils as a filter and degradation media for the target micropollutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment In this work, the mechanism and toxicity of DCF degradation by ClO2 under simulated water disinfection conditions were investigated. Experimental results indicate that rapid and significant oxidation of DCF occurred within the first few minutes; however, its mineralization process was longer than its degradation process. UPLC-MS and (1) H NMR spectroscopy were performed to identify major disinfection byproducts that were generated in three tentative degradation routes. The two main routes were based on initial decarboxylation of DCF on the aliphatic chain and hydroxylation of the phenylacetic acid moiety at the C-4 position. Subsequently, the formed aldehyde intermediates were the starting point for further multistep degradation involving decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and oxidation reactions of C-N bond cleavage. The third route was based on transient preservation of chlorinated derivatives resulting from electrophilic attack by chlorine on the aromatic ring, which similarly underwent C-N bond cleavage. Microtox bioassay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of solutions treated by ClO2. The formation of more toxic mid-byproducts during the ClO2 disinfection process poses a potential risk to consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A continuous active sampling method was compared to continuous passive and discrete sampling methods for the sampling of trace organic compounds (TOCs) in water. Results from each method are compared and contrasted in order to provide information for future investigators to use while selecting appropriate sampling methods for their research. The continuous low-level aquatic monitoring (CLAM) sampler (C.I.Agent (R) Storm-Water Solutions) is a submersible, low flow-rate sampler, that continuously draws water through solid-phase extraction media. CLAM samplers were deployed at two wastewater-dominated stream field sites in conjunction with the deployment of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and the collection of discrete (grab) water samples. All samples were analyzed for a suite of 69 TOCs. The CLAM and POCIS samples represent time-integrated samples that accumulate the TOCs present in the water over the deployment period (19-23 h for CLAM and 29 days for POCIS); the discrete samples represent only the TOCs present in the water at the time and place of sampling. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to examine patterns in both TOC detections and relative concentrations between the three sampling methods. A greater number of TOCs were detected in the CLAM samples than in corresponding discrete and POCIS samples, but TOC concentrations in the CLAM samples were significantly lower than in the discrete and (or) POCIS samples. Thirteen TOCs of varying polarity were detected by all of the three methods. TOC detections and concentrations obtained by the three sampling methods, however, are dependent on multiple factors. This study found that stream discharge, constituent loading, and compound type all affected TOC concentrations detected by each method. In addition, TOC detections and concentrations were affected by the reporting limits, bias, recovery, and performance of each method. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 11-Nor-9-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) is commonly selected as biomarker for the investigation of cannabis consumption through wastewater analysis. The removal efficiency of THC-COOH in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been reported to vary between 31% and 98%. Accordingly, possible transformation products (TPs) of this metabolite might be formed during treatment processes or in receiving surface water under environmental conditions. In this work, surface water was spiked with THC-COOH and subjected to hydrolysis, chlorination and photo-degradation (both ultraviolet and simulated sunlight) experiments under laboratory-controlled conditions. One hydrolysis, eight chlorination, three ultraviolet photo-degradation and seven sunlight photo-degradation TPs were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QTOF MS). In a subsequent step, THC-COOH and the identified TPs were searched in wastewater samples using LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with triple quadrupole. THC-COOH was found in all influent and effluent wastewater samples analyzed, although at significant lower concentrations in the effluent samples. The removal efficiency of WWTP under study was approximately 86%. Furthermore, THC-COOH was also investigated in several surface waters, and it was detected in 50% of the samples analyzed. Regarding TPs, none were found in influent wastewater, while one hydrolysis and five photo-degradation (simulated sunlight) TPs were detected in effluent and surface waters. The most detected compound, resulting from sunlight photo-degradation, was found in 60% of surface waters analyzed. This fact illustrates the importance of investigating these TPs in the aquatic environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to range from low parts per trillion to parts per billion levels in surface waters, wastewater effluents, and sediments. These low levels have led to concern for their potential long-term risks to the survival, growth, and reproduction of aquatic organisms. We investigated the acute and chronic effects of sertraline on the life history traits of Ceriodaphnia dubia over the course of three generations under environmentally realistic concentrations. Acute toxicity of sertraline in C dubia offspring resulted in a 48 h median effective concentration of 126 mu g L-1. Under chronic exposure, the lowest concentration to affect fecundity and growth was at 53.4 mu g L-1 in the first two generations. These parameters become more sensitive during the third generation where the LOEC was 4.8 mu g L-1. The median effective concentrations (EC50) for the number of offspring per female, offspring body size, and dry weight were 17.2, 21.2, and 26.2 mu g L-1, respectively. Endpoints measured in this study demonstrate that chronic exposure of C dubia to sertraline leads to effects that occur at concentrations only an order of magnitude higher than predicted environmental concentrations. However, this study also demonstrates that multigenerational effects should be considered in chronic exposure studies because standard toxicity tests do not account for increases in sensitivity in successive generations to toxicants.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of bacteria and detect the presence of quinolone resistance gene (qnrA) and integrons (intI1, intI2) in a habitat polluted by pharmaceutical sewage. The bacteria were isolated by nutrient agar and nutrient broth from waste water and sludge collected from the sewage outfall of a pharmaceutical factory. The bacteria were identified by Gram staining and biochemical tests, and the bacterial community diversity was analyzed by Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Pielou evenness index (J) and Simpson's diversity index (D). The occurrence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) were detected by Real-time PCR assays. The results showed that 90 strains were isolated from water samples and sludge samples including 22 genera and 26 species. Types of bacteria in water samples contained 18 genera and 20 species, while 13 genera and 14 species were detected in sludge samples. Fifty-five Enterobacteriaceae isolates (61.11 %, 55 of 90) were the predominant bacteria in water and sludge samples. Bacterial species richness and evenness in water samples were higher than in sludge samples. The resistance genes of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) with the total DNA and single isolate plasmid DNA were detected. There were a variety of bacterial species and the presence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) genes in pharmaceutical wastewater habitats, in which Enterobacteriaceae strains were the dominant bacteria. These results suggested that pharmaceutical wastewater had potential risks to public health.

AB There is increasing concern over the presence of pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and other chemicals collectively known as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in municipal effluents, yet knowledge of potential environmental impacts related to these compounds is still limited. The present study used laboratory exposures to examine estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid-related endocrine responses in marine hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) exposed to CECs from municipal effluents with 2 degrees of treatment. Fish were exposed for 14 d to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent (0.5%) and to a higher concentration (5%) to investigate dose responses. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), vitellogenin (VTG), 11-keto testosterone, and thyroxine were measured to assess endocrine responses. Contaminants of emerging concern were analyzed to characterize the effluents. Diverse types of effluent CECs were detected. Statistically significant responses were not observed in fish exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent. Elevated plasma E2 concentrations were observed in males exposed to ammonia concentrations similar to those found in effluents. However, exposure to ammonia did not induce VTG production in male fish. The results of the present study highlight the importance of conducting research with sentinel organisms in laboratory studies to understand the environmental significance of the presence of CECs in aquatic systems.

TI Differentiation of nitrate sources: an environmental forensics approach
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID QUALITY; WATERS
AB The field of environmental science is currently undergoing a shift from environmental measurement to environmental forensics. This is largely attributed to the Environmental Liability Directive 2004/35/EC, which lays down the framework for the application of the 'polluter pays principle'. The adoption of environmental forensics approaches for nitrate source determination is one of the areas receiving the greatest interest. Current methods used for nitrate source differentiation do not successfully distinguish between sewage and manure sources. Nevertheless, achieving this specific differentiation is of great importance due to different health risks arising from the two sources. This science career contribution discusses emerging efforts in using chemical markers for differentiating and characterising point and diffuse inputs of sewage and manure into surface waters.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an effective treatment technology for the removal of a variety of organic pollutants in both water and wastewater treatment. However, many background constituents in water are highly reactive towards hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) and decrease the efficiency of the process towards contaminant oxidation. Up to 95% of the HO center dot scavenging can come from dissolved organic matter (OM). In this study, 28 wastewater effluent samples were analyzed to find correlations between the reactivity of HO center dot with wastewater-derived OM (known as effluent organic matter, EfOM), water quality parameters, treatment train characteristics, and fluorescence-derived data. Rate constants for the reaction between HO center dot and EfOM (k(EfOM-HO)) were measured using a bench scale UV-based AOP system with methylene blue as an HO center dot probe and confirmed using an electron pulse radiolysis method for a subset of the samples. The EfOM was characterized using a series of physicochemical parameters, including polarity, average molecular size and fluorescence. The kinetic data were analyzed with principal component analysis and Akaike Information Criterion. Four predictors were identified as dominant: chemical oxygen demand, retention onto NH2 extraction medium, fluorescence index, and total organic carbon. These four variables accounted for approximately 62% of the variability in the value of k(EfOM-HO) The average k(EfOM-HO) value for EfOM in this study was 2.5 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1), which is about 31% lower than the 3.6 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) value determined for natural organic matter isolates and commonly used in AOP modeling.

AB Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fiuoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aqueous solutions of the tinidazole (TNZ) have been treated by applying the combination of ultrasound irradiation and H2O2. Based on the results, the maximum removal efficiency of 75 % was achieved under the optimum operating conditions (pH 3, 120 kHz frequency, 333 mM/L of H2O2 and 150 min of operating time) while, under the same conditions the minimum removal efficiency was found to be 8.5 by ultrasound radiation in the absence of H2O2. The results also revealed that the degradation of TNZ was enhanced with decreasing both TNZ initial concentrations and pH. Furthermore, TNZ removal efficiency in the case of actual wastewater was less than of synthetic wastewater (75 % and 68 % of synthetic and actual, respectively). According to the chromatographic analyses, no harmful intermediate compounds were observed. The chemical oxygen demand analysis (65 % reduction) confirmed our findings.

AB A laboratory pilot photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR), employing a hybrid TiO2/UV-A catalysis-ultrafiltration process, is evaluated for degradation of diclofenac (DCF), a typical micro-pollutant frequently encountered in source waters. The combination of membrane ultrafiltration with photocatalysis allows TiO2 separation and reuse whereas the automatic periodic membrane backwashing, combined with moderate permeate flux, effectively control membrane fouling, thus permitting stable continuous operation with no wastewater stream. The operation under steady state conditions permitted the assessment of the PMR system performance (for DCF degradation), in terms of water pH and catalyst dosage, in relatively long-term tests. The results demonstrate excellent system performance. Experiments with groundwater, at UV-A radiant power per unit volume 6.57 W/L, show an optimum DCF removal at pH similar to 6 and TiO2 loading near 0.5 g/L with maxima of DCF molecular degradation and mineralization similar to 99.5% and similar to 69%, respectively. Significant differences of photo-catalytic oxidation performance are identified with different water matrices (i.e. ultrapure water, tap water, groundwater), confirming the important role of feed-water characteristics (i.e. presence of organic and inorganic scavengers) on process effectiveness. The new results highlight, among other factors, the need for good knowledge of feed water properties, to successfully design a PMR treatment process for effectively removing organic micropollutant.

AB The occurrence and fate of twenty-one pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were investigated in different steps of the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Southwest China. Concentrations of these PhACs were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that 21 target PhACs were present in wastewater and 18 in sludge. The calculated total mass load of PhACs per capita to the influent, the receiving water and sludge were 4.95 mg d(-1) person(-1), 889.94 mu g d(-1) person(-1) and 78.57 mu g d(-1) person(-1), respectively. The overall removal efficiency of the individual PhACs ranged from "negative removal" to almost complete removal. Mass balance analysis revealed that biodegradation is believed to be the predominant removal mechanism, and sorption onto sludge was a relevant removal pathway for quinolone antibiotics, azithromycin and simvastatin, accounting for 9.35-26.96% of the initial loadings. However, the sorption of the other selected PhACs was negligible. The overall pharmaceutical consumption in Chongqing, China, was back-calculated based on influent concentration by considering the pharmacokinetics of PhACs in humans. The back-estimated usage was in good agreement with usage of ofloxacin (agreement ratio: 72.5%). However, the back-estimated usage of PhACs requires further verification. Generally, the average influent mass loads and back-calculated annual per capita consumption of the selected antibiotics were comparable to or higher than those reported in developed countries, while the case of other target PhACs was opposite.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 19 antibiotics including ten sulfonamides, four quinolones, three tetracyclines and two macrolides in water, sediment, and biota samples from the Liao River Basin, China were investigated in the present study. The samples were collected in May 2012, and laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the Liao River Basin. Macrolides made up the majority of antibiotics in the water ranging from not detected (ND) to 3162.22 ng L-1, while tetracyclines and macrolides were the predominant antibiotics in the sediments, ranging from ND to 404.82 mu g kg(-1) (mean 32.11 mu g kg(-1) dw) and ND to 375.13 (mean 32.77 mu g kg(-1) dw), with detection frequencies of 37.3% and 38.1%, respectively. In biological samples, quinolones were the most frequently detected antibiotics (57.1-100%), with concentrations ranging from 286.6-1655.3 mu g kg(-1). The highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of 45407 L kg(-1) was found for enrofloxacin. The phase distribution calculation showed that tetracyclines were the most strongly adsorbed antibiotics in the sediment, with the highest pseudo-partitioning coefficient values, ranging from 1299 to 1499 L kg(-1). The geographical differences of antibiotic concentrations were largely due to anthropogenic activities and the sewage discharges from the local cities along the rivers.

AB Anticancer drugs routinely used in chemotherapy enter wastewater through the excretion of the non-metabolised drug following administration to patients. This study considers the consumption and subsequent behaviour and occurrence of these chemicals in aquatic systems, with the aim of prioritising a selection of these drugs which are likely to persist in the environment and hence be considered for environmental screening programmes. Accurate consumption data were compiled from a hospital survey in NW England and combined with urinary excretion rates derived from clinical studies. Physical-chemical property data were compiled along with likely chemical fate and persistence during and after wastewater treatment. A shortlist of 15 chemicals (from 65) was prioritised based on their consumption, persistency and likelihood of occurrence in surface waters and supported by observational studies where possible. The ecological impact of these 'prioritised' chemicals is uncertain as the measured concentrations in surface waters generally fall below standard toxicity thresholds. Nonetheless, this prioritised sub-list should prove useful for developing environmental screening programmes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment as a result of wastewater effluent discharge is a concern in many countries. In order to expand our understanding on the occurrence and fate of PPCPs during wastewater treatment processes, 62 antibiotic, analgesic/anti-inflammatory, and antifungal compounds were analyzed in 72 liquid and 24 biosolid samples from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during the summer and winter seasons of 2010-2012. This is the first scientific study to compare five different wastewater treatment processes: facultative and aerated lagoons, chemically-enhanced primary treatment, secondary activated sludge, and advanced biological nutrient removal. PPCPs were detected in all WWTP influents at median concentrations of 1.5 to 92,000 ng/L, with no seasonal differences. PPCPs were also found in all final effluents at median levels ranging from 3.6 to 4200 ng/L with higher values during winter (p <0.05). Removal efficiencies ranged between -450% and 120%, depending on the compound, WWTP type, and season. Mass balance showed that the fate of analgesic/anti-inflammatory compounds was predominantly biodegradation during biological treatment, while antibiotics and antifungal compounds were more likely to sorb to sludge. However, some PPCPs remained soluble and were detected in effluent samples. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence and behavior of a large set of PPCPs and determined how their removal is affected by environmental/operational factors in different WWTPs.

AB At a pilot scale wastewater treatment plant ozonation and powdered activated carbon filtration were assessed for their efficacy to remove trace organic contaminants from secondary treated effluents. A chemical analysis of 16 organic compounds was accompanied by a comprehensive suite of in vitro and in vivo bioassays with the focus on genotoxicity to account for the potential formation of reactive oxidation products. In vitro experiments were performed with solid phase extracted water samples, in vivo experiments with native wastewater in a flow through test system on site at the treatment plant. The chemical evaluation revealed an efficient oxidation of about half of the selected compounds by more than 90% at an ozone dose of 0.7 g/g DOC. A lower oxidizing efficiency was observed for the iodinated X-ray contrast media (49-55%). Activated carbon treatment (20 mg/L) was less effective for the removal of most pharmaceuticals monitored. The urnuC assay on genotoxicity delivered results with about 90% decrease of the effects by ozonation and slightly lower efficiency for PAC treatment. However, the Ames test on mutagenicity with the strain YG7108 revealed a consistent and ozone-dose dependent increase of mutagenicity after wastewater ozonation compared to secondary treatment. Sand filtration as post treatment step reduced the ozone induced mutagenicity only partly. Also the fish early life stage toxicity test revealed an increase in mortality after ozonation and a reduced effect after sand filtration. Only activated carbon treatment reduced the fish mortality compared to conventional treatment on control level. Likewise the in vivo genotoxicity detected with the comet assay using fish erythrocytes confirmed an increased (geno-)toxicity after ozonation, an effect decrease after sand-filtration and no toxic effects after activated carbon treatment.
   This study demonstrates the need for a cautious selection of methods for the evaluation of advanced (oxidative) treatment technologies and of the effectiveness of post-treatments for elimination of adverse effects caused by oxidative treatments case by case.

AB A granular sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for 340 days for treating a synthetic wastewater containing fluoroquinolones (FQs), namely ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The SBR was intermittently fed with FQs, at concentrations of 9 and 32 mu M. No evidence of FQ biodegradation was observed but the pharmaceutical compounds adsorbed to the aerobic granular sludge, being gradually released into the medium in successive cycles after stopping the FQ feeding.
   Overall COD removal was not affected during the shock loadings. Activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria did not seem to be inhibited by the presence of FQs (maximum of 0.03 and 0.01 mM for ammonium and nitrite in the effluent, respectively). However, during the FQs feeding, nitrate accumulation up to 1.7 mM was observed at the effluent suggesting that denitrification was inhibited. The activity of phosphate accumulating organisms was affected, as indicated by the decrease of P removal capacity during the aerobic phase. Exposure to the FQs also promoted disintegration of the granules leading to an increase of the effluent solid content, nevertheless the solid content at the bioreactor effluent returned to normal levels within ca. 1 month after removing the FQs in the feed allowing recovery of the bedvolume. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed a dynamic bacterial community with gradual changes due to FQs exposure. Bacterial isolates retrieved from the granules predominantly belonged to alpha- and gamma-branch of the Proteobacteria phylum.

AB In this study, we examined the feasibility of membrane distillation (MD) for removing trace organic compounds (TrOCs) during water and wastewater treatment. A set of 29 compounds was selected to represent major TrOC groups, including pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones, phytoestrogens, UV-filters, industrial chemicals, and pesticides that occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater. Results reported here suggest that rejection and fate and transport of TrOCs during MD are governed by their volatility and, to a lesser extent, hydrophobicity. All TrOCs with pK(H)>9 (which can be classified as non-volatile) were well removed by MD. Among the 29 TrOCs investigated in this study, three compounds (i.e. 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-tert-butylphenol and benzophenone) possess moderate volatility (pK(H)<9) and therefore had the lowest rejection efficiencies of 54%, 73% and 66%, respectively. The results suggest that the rejection of TrOCs with pK(H)<9 may be governed by the interplay between their hydrophobicity and volatility. In addition, the fate and transport of the TrOCs during the MD process was also investigated. Hydrophilic TrOCs having negligible volatility were concentrated in the feed, while hydrophobic compounds with moderate volatility were substantially lost due to evaporation or adsorption. When MD treatment was integrated with a thermophilic membrane bioreactor (MBR), near complete removal (>95%) of all 29 TrOCs investigated in this study was achieved despite their diverse physicochemical properties (i.e. hydrophobicity, persistency and volatility). The results suggest that MD could be a promising post-treatment to be used in conjunction with thermophilic MBR for TrOC removal. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental awareness in both the public and regulatory sectors has necessitated proper treatment of medicinal components-rich pharmaceutical effluents. Even the presence of trace antiseptic may cause adverse health effects including development of "product resistant microbes" in the aquatic environment. The present study involves photomineralization of chlorhexidine, which belongs to the class of antiseptic drug components. This study details investigations on photocatalytic degradation of chlorhexidine in a slurry batch reactor using titanium dioxide photocatalyst. Emphases were given to study the effects of operating parameters on the degradation behavior of the targeted compound and characterization of degraded products. About 68.14% removal of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD) was found after 1 h at 25 degrees C with a substrate-to-catalyst ratio of 2.5:1 under UV intensity of 50 mu W.cm(-2) at pH 10.5. Though the product profile illustrates several degraded products, toxicological analysis on Bacillus subtilis exhibited no inhibition zone, suggesting the eco-friendly nature of the degraded products.

AB The toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewaters has recently been the focus of the public in China. This study aimed to evaluate the conventional pollution parameters and toxicities of different raw and treated pharmaceutical wastewaters to algae Scenedesmus obliquus and bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Wastewater samples were collected from 16 pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants in China. The results of the conventional parameters analysis indicated that the total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) were largely removed after treatment. Pharmaceutical effluents were mainly polluted with organics and phosphorus as indicated by the average COD (388 mg/L) and TP (3.16 mg/L) concentrations. The toxicity test results indicated that the influent samples were toxic to both test species. Although the toxicities could be remarkably reduced after treatment, 10 out of the 16 effluent samples exceeded the acute toxicity discharge limit of the Chinese national standards. Spearman rank correlation coefficients indicated a significantly positive correlation between the toxicity values of S. obliquus and V. fischeri. Compared with S. obliquus, V. fischeri detected more pharmaceutical effluent samples with toxicities. Meanwhile, the toxicity indicators were significantly and positively correlated with the COD and NH3-N concentrations based on a Spearman rank correlation analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB A pilot study for the qualitative detection of methamphetamine at sites within a sewage collection system adjacent to locations suspected to harbor illegal drug activities was investigated and preliminary findings are reported. Sewage samples were collected over a time interval of four weeks using a Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) deployed directly into the sewer line. The POCIS sorbent was extracted and analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Methamphetamine was found in sewage from one of three sampling sites at a concentration greater than the HPLC-MS/MS method detection limit (MDL) of 3 ng/mL. The goal of this research was to establish proof-of-concept of the feasibility for sampling and analysis using POCIS devices in the sewage collection system. The data encourage further testing and research. The ability to pinpoint the presence of methamphetamine in the sewer may in the future be used as a forensic tool in law enforcement.

AB In South America, there is a lack of data concerning the occurrence and levels of pharmaceuticals in main rivers as well as their negative effects on the biota. Here we report the occurrence as well as the spatial and temporal variations of some common prescribed pharmaceuticals in the Suquia River basin (Cordoba, Argentina). We also report the bioconcentration of two of them in Gambusia affinis, a widely distributed fish species inhabiting the river basin. The influence of the wastewater treatment plant of Cordoba City was critical (up to 70 km downstream). Among 15 compounds analyzed, atenolol, carbamazepine and diclofenac were the most frequently detected (reaching sub mu g L-1 levels), showing different distribution patterns. Bioconcentration of atenolol and carbamazepine was studied under laboratory controlled conditions. Estimated bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were: 0.13 and 0.08 L kg(-1) upon exposure to 100 and 1000 mu g L-1 atenolol in water, respectively; while BCFs were 0.7 and 0.9 L kg(-1) when exposed to 10 and 100 mu g L-1 carbamazepine, respectively. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first report on pharmaceuticals in superficial waters of Argentina as well as the first report on the bioaccumulation of atenolol in whole body fish.

AB Aims: To discuss the need to develop ethical guidelines for researchers using sewage epidemiology to monitor drug use in the general population and specific precincts, including prisons, schools and workplaces.
   Method: Describe current applications of sewage epidemiology, identify potential ethical risks associated with this science, and identify key means by which these risks may be mitigated through proportionate ethical guidance that allows this science to be fully developed.
   Results: A rapidly advancing field of research is sewage epidemiology (SE) - the analysis of wastewater samples to monitor illicit drug use and other substances. Typically this research involves low ethical risks because individual participants cannot be identified and, consequently, review has been waived by human research ethics committees. In the absence of such oversight, ethical research guidelines are recommended for SE teams, peer reviewers and journal editors; guidelines will assist them to mitigate any risks in general population studies and studies of prisons, schools and workplaces. Potential harms include the stigmatisation of participants and, in the prison setting, austere policy responses to SE data that impact negatively upon inmate-participants. The risk of harm can be managed through research planning, awareness of the socio-political context in which results will be interpreted (or, in the case of media, sensationalised) and careful relations with industry partners. Ethical guidelines should be developed in consultation with SE scholars and be periodically amended. They should include publication processes that safeguard scientific rigour and be promulgated through existing research governance structures.
   Conclusions: Guidelines will assist to promote an ethical research culture among SE teams and scholars involved in the publication process and this will work to protect the reputation of the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analytical measurements of sewage water have been used many times to estimate the consumption of specific drugs in an area. This study measured a large number of illicit drugs and metabolites (>30) at a large number of sewage treatment plants (STPs) distributed across Sweden. Twenty-four illicit and prescription drugs, classified as narcotic substances in Sweden, and seven selected metabolites were included in the study. A 24 hour composite sample of incoming sewage water was collected from 33 different municipalities at various geographic locations across Sweden. Species were analyzed using an on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method. The method proved to be rapid with minimum need for sample work up and was able to detect 13 compounds above their respective limits of quantification. The results for all compounds were presented as per capita loads. Multivariate data analysis was used to relate drug consumption to geographical location and/or population of cities. The results showed that geographical differences in drug consumption were apparent across the country. For the narcotic pharmaceuticals, the geographical differences suggested by the multivariate model were supported by prescription statistics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Because aquatic insects use histamines as neurotransmitters, adverse impacts on aquatic insects living in aquatic environments that receive antihistamines with wastewater effluent are plausible. In this study, we exposed damselfly larvae to low concentrations of two commonly used antihistamines (Hydroxyzine and Fexofenadine, 360 +/- 42 and 2200 +/- 43 ng 1(-1), respectively), and recorded damselfly larvae behavior before and after exposure. Further, after the second set of behavioral assays was performed, we quantified bioconcentration of the antihistamines in the damselfly bodies. Our results showed significant changes in damselfly behavior following antihistamine exposure. After Hydroxyzine exposure, the damselfly larvae became less active, and they showed reduced fleeing response (i.e. increased boldness) after being exposed to Fexofenadine, the latter also being significantly different from the non-exposed (control) individuals. Further, we found high levels of bioconcentration in the damselflies; Hydroxyzine showed an average bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 2000. As such, our results indicate that low concentrations of antihistamines can have sub-lethal effects on aquatic insects manifested as behavioral changes, and that bioconcentration of these substances can be high. Therefore, the need to investigate the impact of emergent aquatic contaminants also on aquatic insects, and on behaviors that are of ecological importance, is further highlighted.

AB Twenty percent of the water run-off from China's land surface drains into the Yangtze River and carries the sewage of approximately 400 million people out to sea. The lower stretch of the Yangtze therefore offers the opportunity to assess the pollutant discharge of a huge population. To establish a comprehensive assessment of micropollutants, river water samples were collected monthly from May 2009 to June 2010 along a cross-section at the lowermost hydrological station of the Yangtze River not influenced by the tide (Datong Station, Anhui province). Following a prescreening of 268 target compounds, we examined the occurrence, seasonal variation, and annual loads of 117 organic micropollutants, including 51 pesticides, 43 pharmaceuticals, 7 household and industrial chemicals, and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). During the 14-month study, the maximum concentrations of particulate PAHs (1-5 mu g/g), pesticides (11-284 ng/L), pharmaceuticals (5-224 ng/L), and household and industrial chemicals (4-430 ng/L) were generally lower than in other Chinese rivers due to the dilution caused of the Yangtze River's average water discharge of approximately 30,000 m(3)/s. The loads of most pesticides, anti-infectives, and PAHs were higher in the wet season compared to the dry season, which was attributed to the increased agricultural application of chemicals in the summer, an elevated water discharge through the sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as a result of high hydraulic loads and the related lower treatment efficiency, and seasonally increased deposition from the atmosphere and runoff from the catchment. The estimated annual load of PAHs in the river accounted for some 4% of the total emission of PAHs in the whole Yangtze Basin. Furthermore, by using sucralose as a tracer for domestic wastewater, we estimate a daily disposal of approximately 47 million m(3) of sewage into the river, corresponding to 1.8% of its average hydraulic load. In summary, the annual amounts flushed by the Yangtze River into the East China Sea were 2.9 x 10(6) tons of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC), 369 tons of PAHs, 98 tons of pesticides, 152 tons of pharmaceuticals, and 273 tons of household and industrial chemicals. While the concentrations seem comparably moderate, the pollutant loads are considerable and pose an increasing burden to the health of the marine coastal ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wastewater effluents contain a multitude of organic contaminants and transformation products, which cannot be captured by target analysis alone. High accuracy, high resolution mass spectrometric data were explored with novel untargeted data processing approaches (enviMass, nontarget, and RMassBank) to complement an extensive target analysis in initial "all in one" measurements. On average 1.2% of the detected peaks from 10 Swiss wastewater treatment plant samples were assigned to target compounds, with 376 reference standards available. Corrosion inhibitors, artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals exhibited the highest concentrations. After blank and noise subtraction, 70% of the peaks remained and were grouped into components; 20% of these components had adduct and/or isotope information available. An intensity-based prioritization revealed that only 4 targets were among the top 30 most intense peaks (negative mode), while 15 of these peaks contained sulfur. Of the 26 nontarget peaks, 7 were tentatively identified via suspect screening for sulfur-containing surfactants and one peak was identified and confirmed as 1,3-benzothiazole-2-sulfonate, an oxidation product of a vulcanization accelerator. High accuracy, high resolution data combined with tailor-made nontarget processing methods (all available online) provided vital information for the identification of a wider range of heteroatom-containing compounds in the environment.

AB A simple and rapid HPLC method was developed to analyse cefixime, and potentially other cephalosporin antibiotic in wastewater of pharmaceutical production industry. The collected wastewater samples were treated by liquid - liquid extraction using chloroform to eliminate contaminants before instrumental analysis. Separation of the analyte was achieved using a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250x4.6 mm; 5 pm) and a mixture of methanol and phosphate buffer pH 3.2 as mobile phase in a gradient program. The drug was detected by UV detector at wavelength of 285 rim. The analytical method was first validated using cefixime spiked samples. Absorbance response to cefixime concentrations is linear from 23 to 1100 ppb with a correlation coefficient > 0.999 and the limit of detection of 6.68 ppb. Repeatability and intermediate precision were tested with RSD of less than 3.0%. The recovery values were found in the range of 97.4-106.0%. The method was then applied to determine concentrations of cefixime in real wastewater samples. The concentrations of cefixime residue measured in the actual samples were in the range of 19.24 to 43.33 ppb which proved the applicability of this analytical method in monitoring the level of contaminated cefixime from the effluent of the pharmaceutical manufacturing plant into environment. The method also showed a potential to apply for other cephalosporin antibiotics.

AB This paper presents a study of the combined process of adsorption and biodegradation in solid biologically activated carbon (AC) for the removal of salicylic acid aimed at determining the influence of the presence of biofilm on the process. Adsorption on AC and biodegradation of free cell cultures were studied separately so as to compare their performance with that of the combined biosorption system. The formation of bacterial biofilm on the surface of the carbon was investigated. The study was carried out using a range of synthetic solutions containing between 15 and 500 mg/L salicylic acid simulating an industrial effluent from the pharmaceutical industry. An individual bacterium, Pseudomonas putida (DSM 4478), was used to study the differentiated effects. Filtrasorb 400 and GAC 830 ACs were used in the adsorption processes and Filtrasorb 400 in the biofilm formation and combined biosorption processes. As regards, combined adsorption/biodegradation results indicated that the bioactivated carbon system outperformed the combination of conventional AC and biological water treatment processes when working with high pollutant concentrations.

AB The presence of human pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters is an emerging issue in environmental science. While water purification techniques such as granular activated carbon could potentially remove these pollutants from wastewater streams, the high cost involved suggests that more attention should be given to the potential for the optimization of current treatment processes and reduction at source in order to reduce environmental contamination. Unsaturated Polyester Resin (UPR) was used in the adsorptive removal of Balsalazide, anti-inflammatory drug, from an aqueous solution. It was found that UPR with a higher specific surface area adsorbed and removed more Balsalazide from an aqueous solution. Factorial design of experiments is employed to study the effect of four factors pH (7-12), temperature (30, 40 and 50 degrees C), adsorbent dosage (30 mg L-1) and initial concentration of the BSZ (1.0x 10(-4) mol dm(-3)). The kinetic adsorption studies demonstrate adsorption is usually complete within 10-15 min. The estimated values for Delta G(o) were -5.98x10(3) over UPR at 303 K (30 degrees C), which indicate toward a spontaneous nature of the process, and the positive heats of enthalpy suggest the endothermic nature of the process. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were determined from the experimental data, and the results revealed that the adsorption followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with good correlation coefficients. In addition, it was found that the adsorption of Balsalazide occurred in two consecutive steps, including the slow intra-particle diffusion of Balsalazide molecules through the UPR.

AB Iopromide has been frequently detected in different environmental compartments. However, the biodegradation of iopromide was limited, and significantly different removal efficiencies by various methods were reported. In this study, a Pseudomonas sp. I-24 isolated from activated sludge in a sewage treatment plant was used to degrade iopromide. Four different cosubstrates were selected as the cometabolic carbon and energy sources. The results showed that cosubstrate starch was able to increase catabolic enzymatic activity and enhance iopromide degradation. The degradation efficiency of iopromide was as high as 88.24 %, which was much higher as compared with other cosubstrates (38.58-51.44 %) and blank sample (2.81 %). Additionally, the highest enzymatic activity of 0.182 mU for iopromide degradation was also obtained when adding starch as a cosubstrate, somehow supporting that higher enzymatic activity resulted in higher degradation efficiency for iopromide. Although little was illuminated about the molecular mechanism during the degradation process of iopromide with starch addition, the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results indicated that the iopromide-degrading cells growing with cosubstrate starch underwent significant physiological changes.

AB The membrane bioreactor (MBR) has recently been the focus of research for the treatment of emerging contaminants such as antibiotics in wastewater. Although the biofilm on membrane in an MBR has been considered a cause of "membrane biofouling", its positive impact on removing pollutants has not been well-studied. This study was designed to investigate the retention effect on the permeation of ampicillin (AMP) by the biofilm coated on cellulose acetate (CA) membrane (commonly used for MBRs) utilizing a novel method based on microbial sensitivity test. The bioflim layer (thickness of 12-16 mu m) increased the resistance of the membrane for AMP permeation by 3-28%. Diffusion appeared to be the main driving force for the mass transfer of AMP across the membrane. Besides, the biofilm increased the retention of AMP by 23% but exhibited similar adsorption capacity with comparison of the suspended activated sludge, which indicates that the compact structure of the biofilm was the major contributor for the added retention effect on AMP by the biofilm-coated CA membrane. This study suggests that biofilm (biofouling) in MBRs increases the retention of small-molecule constituents such as antibiotics. A delicate trade-off between reduced wastewater throughput and increased retention of contaminants should be obtained when an MBR is designed and operated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands remove trace organic contaminants via synergistic processes involving plant biomass that include hydrolysis, volatilization, sorption, biodegradation, and photolysis. Wetland design conditions, such as hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) and carbon loading rates (CLRs), influence these processes. Contaminant of emerging concern (CEC) removal by wetland plants was investigated at varying HLRs and CLRs. Rate constants and parameters obtained from batch-scale studies were used in a mechanistic model to evaluate the effect of these two loading rates on CEC removal. CLR significantly influenced CEC removal when wetlands were operated at HLR >5 cm/d. High values of CLR increased removal of estradiol and carbamazepine but lowered that of testosterone and atrazine. Without increasing the cumulative HLR, operating two wetlands in series with varying CLRs could be a way to improve CEC removal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is likely due to rapid degradation as confirmed in our microcosm studies where they exhibited half-lives (t(1/2)) between 0.2-9.5 days when soils were spiked at 50 ng/g soil and between 3 and 68 days when soils were spiked at 5000 ng/g soil. The degradation rate and extent of PCs observed in microcosm studies were similar in soils that had been previously irrigated with TWW or fresh water. This suggests that pre-exposure of the soils to PCs via irrigation with TWW does not enhance their biodegradation. This suggests that PCs are probably degraded in soils via co-metabolism.

AB Well-defined, uniform bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) microcolumns were synthesized through a refined hydrothermal route. During the fabrication process, a detailed orthogonal design on the synthetic conditions was performed, aiming to optimize the experimental parameters to produce BiVO4 materials (BiVO4 (Opt.)) with the most prominent visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency, where the catalytic activities of the synthesized materials were evaluated via the decolorization of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. The BiVO4 (Opt.) were then targetedly produced according to the determined optimal conditions and well characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet and visible diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared with the commercial P25-TiO2 photocatalysts, the as-synthesized BiVO4 (Opt.) displayed superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activities for the degradation of metronidazole-contained wastewater with the presence of H2O2. The degradation efficiency of metronidazole reached up to 70 % within 180 min, leading to a brief speculation on the possibly major steps of the visible-light-driven photocatalytic process. The current study provides a distinctive route to design novel shaped BiVO4 architectures with advanced photocatalytic capacities for the treatment of organic pollutants in the aqueous environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals are synthetic or natural chemicals that can be found in prescription medicines, over-the-counter therapeutic drugs and veterinary drugs. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and the water cycle at trace levels (in the range of nanograms to low micrograms per litre) has been widely discussed and published in literature in the past decade. The increase in detection is largely attributable to the advances in analytical techniques and instrumentation. This paper describes development, optimisation and validation of a method for the simultaneous analysis of 7 multi-class pharmaceuticals (caffeine (CAF), Prazosin (PRZ), enalapril maleate (ENL), carbamazepine (CBZ), nifedipine (NFD), levonorgestrel (LNG), simvastatin (SMV)) using solid phase extraction (SPE cartridges Oasis HLB) followed by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF/MS). Its linearity, 0.5-250 mu g L-1, provided determination coefficients (R-2) above 0.99 for all compounds. The Instrumental Quantification Limits (IQLs) for all pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.5-5 mu g L-1 in the solvent as a standard mixture (i.e., direct injection). The extraction efficiency (EE%) was more than 40% and 60% in river and deionised water for most of compounds, respectively. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for all pharmaceuticals ranged from 13-800 ng L-1 in spiked river water. The inter and intra day precision of the method, calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD%), 2.33-22.3% and 0.6-9.9%, respectively, except for caffeine, which has a RSD% of 20.1% at 50 mu g L-1. Matrix effect was investigated and ranged from 10-41%. Out of seven pharmaceuticals, six pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the river water sample.

AB A new method for the determination of three endocrine disrupters (estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, and bisphenol A) and five pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, diclofenac, bezafibrate and miconazole) in raw sewage samples using tandem solid phase extraction (SPE) sorbents and high-performance liquid chromatography-negative and positive electrospray high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) was developed and validated. The SPE procedure used both a strong ion exchange sorbent (SAX) and a modified divinylbenzene-pyrrolidone SPE sorbent to reduce the levels of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) and to concentrate the analytes of interest from the sewage samples. The influence of matrix composition on the ionisation efficiency, the SPE recoveries, and the sensitivity of the method was identified and quantified. The method was successfully applied to the determination of analytes in raw sewage samples collected from the entrance of the Arrudas Sewage Treatment Plant, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

AB Caffeine is ubiquitous in surface and ground waters and it has been proposed as a marker of the anthropogenic pressure on the environment. Sewage treatment plants based on active sludges seem to be not very efficient in its complete removal from effluents while additional disinfection treatments by chlorination are able to do it. In a simulation of the chlorination step herein we report that caffeine is transformed in six by-products: 8-chlorocaffeine, 1,3-dimethyl-5-azabarbituric acid, N,N'-dimethylparabanic acid, N,N'-dimethyloxalamide, N-methylurea and N,N'-dimethylurea. The ecotoxicity of caffeine and identified compounds was evaluated on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to assess acute and chronic toxicity, while SOS Chromotest and Ames Test were used to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds. Moreover, we assessed the possible antigenotoxic effect of the selected compounds using SOS Chromotest after co-incubation with the standard genotoxin, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on the rotifer while the algae seemed to be unaffected. Results indicated that caffeine (1), N,N'-dimethyloxamide (4) and N,N'-dimethylparabanic add (5) reduced beta-galactosidase activity in comparison with positive control, both at 1 and 5 mg/L of 4-NQNO with a good dose-response.

ID PHARMACEUTICALS; RIVER; FATE; DISRUPTION; SEDIMENT
AB Contaminants released from wastewater treatment plants can persist in surface waters for substantial distances. Much research has gone into evaluating the fate and transport of these contaminants, but this work has often assumed constant flow from wastewater treatment plants. However, effluent discharge commonly varies widely over a 24-hour period, and this variation controls contaminant loading and can profoundly influence interpretations of environmental data. We show that methodologies relying on the normalization of downstream data to conservative elements can give spurious results, and should not be used unless it can be verified that the same parcel of water was sampled. Lagrangian sampling, which in theory samples the same water parcel as it moves downstream (the Lagrangian parcel), links hydrologic and chemical transformation processes so that the in-stream fate of wastewater contaminants can be quantitatively evaluated. However, precise Lagrangian sampling is difficult, and small deviations - such as missing the Lagrangian parcel by less than 1 h - can cause large differences in measured concentrations of all dissolved compounds at downstream sites, leading to erroneous conclusions regarding in-stream processes controlling the fate and transport of wastewater contaminants. Therefore, we have developed a method termed "verified Lagrangian" sampling, which can be used to determine if the Lagrangian parcel was actually sampled, and if it was not, a means for correcting the data to reflect the concentrations which would have been obtained had the Lagrangian parcel been sampled. To apply the method, it is necessary to have concentration data for a number of conservative constituents from the upstream, effluent, and downstream sites, along with upstream and effluent concentrations that are constant over the short-term (typically 2-4 h). These corrections can subsequently be applied to all data, including non-conservative constituents. Finally, we show how data from other studies can be corrected. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence, removal and ecotoxicological assessment of 21 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics and antihypersensitives, were studied at four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Chongqing, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Individual treatment unit effluents, as well as primary and secondary sludge, were sampled and analyzed for the selected PhACs to evaluate their biodegradation, persistence and partitioning behaviors. PhACs were identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. All the 21 analyzed PhACs were detected in wastewater and the target PhACs except acetaminophen, ibuprofen and gemfibrozil, were also found in sludge. The concentrations of the antibiotics and SVT were comparable to or even higher than those reported in developed countries, while the case of other target PhACs was opposite. The elimination of PhACs except acetaminophen was incomplete and a wide range of elimination efficiencies during the treatment were observed, i.e. from "negative removal" to 99.5%. The removal of PhACs was insignificant in primary and disinfection processes, and was mainly achieved during the biological treatment. Based on the mass balance analysis, biodegradation is believed to be the primary removal mechanism, whereas only about 1.5% of the total mass load of the target PhACs was removed by sorption. Experimentally estimated distribution coefficients (<500 L/kg, with a few exceptions) also indicate that biodegradation/transformation was responsible for the removal of the target PhACs. Ecotoxicological assessment indicated that the environment concentrations of single compounds (including sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, azithromycin and erythromycin-H2O) in effluent and sludge, as well as the mixture of the 21 detected PhACs in effluent sludge and receiving water had a significant ecotoxicological risk to algae. Therefore, further control of PhACs in effluent and sludge is required before their discharge and application to prevent their introduction into the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The antimicrobial agents triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) and synthetic musks AHTN (Tonalide) and HHCB (Galaxolide) are widely used in many personal care products. These compounds may release into the soil environment through biosolid application to agricultural land and potentially affect soil organisms. This paper aimed to investigate accumulation, dissipation and potential risks of TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB in biosolid-amended soils of the three field trial sites (Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong) with three treatments (CK: control without biosolid application, T1: single biosolid application, T2: repeated biosolid application every year). The one-year monitoring results showed that biosolids application could lead to accumulation of these four chemicals in the biosolid-amended soils, with the residual concentrations in the following order: TCC > TCS > AHTN > HHCB. Dissipation of TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB in the biosolid-amended soils followed the first-order kinetics model. Half-lives for TCC, TCS, AHTN and HHCB under the field conditions of Shandong site were 191, 258, 336 and 900 days for T1, and 51, 106, 159 and 83 days for T2, respectively. Repeated applications of biosolid led to accumulation of these personal care products and result in higher ecological risks. Based on the residual levels in the trial sites and limited toxicity data, high risks to soil organisms are expected for TCC and TCS, while low-medium risks for AHTN and HHCB. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Effective removal of aging biofilm deserves to receive more attention. This study aimed to characterized aging biofilm from a full-scale moving bed biofilm reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater and evaluate the hydrolysis effects of biofilm by different enzymatic treatments. Results from FTIR and biochemical composition analyses showed that it was a predominately organic-based biofilm with the ratio of total protein (PN) to polysaccharide (PS) of 20.17. A reticular structure of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) with filamentous bacteria as the skeleton was observed on the basal layer through SEM-EDS test. Among the four commercial proteases and amylases from Genencor (R), proteases were shown to have better performances than amylases either on the removal of MLSS and PN/MLSS or on DOC (i.e., dissolved organic carbon)/MLSS raising of biofilm pellets. Difference of dynamic fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matters after treated by the two proteases indicated distinguishing mechanisms of the treating process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sonochemical degradation of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in water and wastewater was investigated at ultrasonic frequency of 850 kHz. The effects of pH, initial concentrations, temperature, power and dissolved organic carbon were examined. The results obtained indicated that the rate of ultrasonic degradation of E2 and EE2 in water and wastewater is influenced by the pH, power, air sparging and the dissolved organic content of the aqueous solutions. Mass degradation rates of E2 and EE2 per kW ranged from 1.7 to 4.0 mg kW(-1) at varying process parameters. The degradation process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with rate constant of 1.71 x 10(-2) min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The value for activation energy (E-a = 15.21 kJ mol(-1)) obtained from Arrhenius-type plot, indicated that the ultrasonic degradation of steroid hormones is thermodynamically feasible, and does not progress only on radical reactions but other intermediate reaction processes. In wastewater, the higher dissolved organic carbon significantly reduced the effectiveness of degradation of the E2 and EE2 showing that ultrasound treatment will be more effective as a tertiary treatment option in wastewater applications.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP), tamoxifen (TAM) and cyclophosphamide (CP) which are often used in anticancer treatment are released in hospital effluent and into the environment. Although the concentrations are low (from ng/L to mu g/L), no data exist concerning their ecotoxicological impact. In this study two biomarkers of early effect were performed on hepatic cells (HepG2): cell viability and genotoxicity (DNA breaks) using cell proliferative assay and comet assay, respectively. These data were compared with two standardized ecotoxicological tests: algaltoxkit F (TM) and microtox(R). Cells were exposed to an increasing amount of an individual drug or in a mixture for 24,48 or 72 h. The time-exposure of bacteria and algae ranged between 5 and 30 min and 72 h, respectively. A non-monotonic dose-response on cell viability was observed when HepG2 cells were exposed to TAM alone or in the presence of CIR The same scheme was observed with microtox(R) when the bacteria were exposed to the mixtures. On the other side, an individual drug does not induce any DNA breaks on hepatic cells, whereas a mixture leads to a dose dependent increase of DNA breaks. Similarly a positive response was observed with algaltoxkit F (TM) only with mixtures. Synergistic effects observed when drugs are in a mixture highlight the importance of investigating the ecotoxicological effects of contaminants at low concentrations and in mixtures.

AB Five estrogenic hormones (unconjugated + conjugated fractions) and 10 beta blockers were analyzed in three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and receiving river waters in the area of Lyon, France. In the different samples, only two estrogens were quantified: estrone and estriol. Some beta blockers, such as atenolol, acebutolol, and sotalol, were almost always quantified, but others, e.g., betaxolol, nadolol, and oxprenolol were rarely quantified. Concentrations measured in river waters were in the nanogram per liter range for estrogens and between 0.3 and 210 ng/L for beta blockers depending on the substance and the distance from the WWTP outfall. The impact of the WWTP on the receiving rivers was studied and showed a clear increase in concentrations near the WWTP outfall. For estrogens, the persistence in surface waters was not evaluated given the low concentrations levels (around 1 ng/L). For beta blockers, concentrations measured downstream of the WWTP outfall were up to 16 times higher than those measured upstream. Also, the persistence of metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol was noted even 2 km downstream of the WWTP outfall. The comparison of beta blocker fingerprints in the samples collected in effluent and in the river also showed the impact of WWTP outfall on surface waters. Finally, a tentative environmental risk evaluation was performed on 15 sites by calculating the ratio of receiving water concentrations to predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). For estrogens, a total PNEC of 5 ng/L was considered and these substances were not linked to any potential environmental risk (only one site showed an environmental risk ratio above 1). Unfortunately, few PNECs are available and risk evaluation was only possible for 4 of the 10 beta blockers studied: acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol. Only propranolol presented a ratio near or above 1, showing a possible environmental risk for 4 receiving waters out of 15.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has become a matter of concern in the last decade due to potential risks posed to non-target organisms and the potential for unintended human exposure via food chain. This concern has been driven by a high detection frequency for drugs in environmental samples; these substances are produced in large quantities and are used in both veterinary and human medicine, leading to deposition and potential effects in the environment. However, few studies have focused on the presence of pharmaceuticals in rural areas associated with farming activities in comparison to urban areas. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface waters collected from urban and rural areas in northwestern Spain. A monitoring study was conducted with 312 river water samples analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Positive detection of pharmaceuticals was made for 51 % of the samples. Decoquinate, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine and trimethoprim were the drugs most frequently detected, being present in more than 10 % of the samples. The sampling sites located downstream of the discharge points for wastewater treatment plants yielded the highest number of positive samples, 13 % of the positive samples were detected in these sites and 38 % of the samples collected near the collection point of a drinking water treatment plant were positive.

AB The homogeneous advanced oxidation process UV/H2O2, using UV radiation (lambda = 254 nm) at low H2O2 concentration, was studied at bench scale for the treatment of secondary effluent spiked with atrazine. The transformation of the effluent organic matter in terms of its biodegradability, atrazine and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal was investigated. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) scavenging and radiation scattering are discussed, along with a rough estimation of treatment costs in terms of energy requirements. The results demonstrated that an UV/H2O2 process at low H2O2 initial dose ([H2O2](0) = 5 mg L-1 and photonic flow = 14.9 mu Einstein s(-1)) was effective in removing 100 mu g L-1 of atrazine in secondary effluent, although hydroxyl radical scavenging was quantified at about 60% of the hydroxyl radical production. Effluent organic compounds were responsible for 85% of the total hydroxyl radical scavenging and for the 12-fold reduction of the atrazine removal rate. Moreover, the natural matrix affected directly the energy required by the lamps to produce (OH)-O-center dot, which increased more than tenfold in relation to deionizal water. Low doses of H2O2 were unable to promote biodegradability increment in secondary effluents, although H2O2/DOC ratios over 3 achieved significant mineralization of effluent organic matter (higher than 50%). At a low H2O2 concentration, the system removes micropollutants without any significant modification of secondary effluents (SE) physic-chemical parameters. However, there will be less elimination of more recalcitrant micropollutants, due to the greater (OH)-O-center dot scavenging than when there are higher H2O2 dosages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, pharmaceutical wastewater with high total dissolved solids (TDSs) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) content was treated through a sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment process. For the anaerobic process, an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) was applied, and a COD removal efficiency of 41.3 +/- 2.2% was achieved with an organic loading rate of 8.11 +/- 0.31 g COD/L/d and a hydraulic retention time of 48 h. To evaluate the salinity effect on the anaerobic process, salts in the wastewater were removed by ion exchange resin, and adverse effect of salinity was observed with a TDS concentration above 14.92 g/L. To improve the anaerobic effluent quality, the UASB effluent was further treated by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Both the UASB + MBR and UASB + SBR systems achieved excellent organic removal efficiency, with respective COD removal of 94.7% and 91.8%. The UASB + MBR system showed better performance in both organic removal and nitrification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change scenarios predict an increase of extreme rain events, which will increase the risk of wastewater flooding and of missing legal water quality targets. This study elicits the willingness to pay to reduce ecological and health risks from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in rivers and lakes, and wastewater flooding of residential and commercial zones under the uncertainty of climate change. We implement a discrete choice experiment on a large representative sample of the Swiss population. We find that about 71% of the respondents are willing to pay a higher annual local tax to reduce the risk of CSOs in rivers and lakes. Swiss households strongly value the protection of water bodies, and mostly, the avoidance of high ecological risks and health risks for children related to CSOs in rivers and lakes. Our findings also show that climate change perception has a significant effect on the willingness to pay to reduce these risks. These results are important to support policy makers' decisions on how to deal with emerging risks of climate change in the water sector and where to set priorities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Occurrence and removal of 81 representative Pharmaceutical Active Compounds (PhACs) were assessed in a municipal WWTP located in a highly industrialized area, with partial water reuse after UV tertiary treatment and discharge to a Mediterranean river. Water monitoring was performed in an integrated way at different points in the WWTP and river along three seasons.
   Consistent differences between therapeutic classes were observed in terms of influent concentration, removal efficiencies and seasonal variation. Conventional (primary and secondary) treatment was unable to completely remove numerous compounds and UV-based tertiary treatment played a complementary role for some of them. Industrial activity influence was highlighted in terms of PhACs presence and seasonal distribution.
   Even if global WWTP effluent impact on the studied river appeared to be minor, PhACs resulted widespread pollutants in river waters. Contamination can be particularly critical in summer in water scarcity areas, when water flow decreases considerably. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a broad-spectrum bactericide, highly toxic to algae, which is released into the environment via wastewater effluents. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for aquatic biota have been proposed in the literature, varying from 1.4 to 1,550 ng/L, reflecting contradicting protection goals. In this work, six rivers in the state of So Paulo were monitored for TCS and caffeine, a tracer for untreated sewage disposal, over a period of more than 1 year. From 71 samples analyzed, 32 contained TCS at concentrations above the limit of quantification, ranging from 2.2 to 66 ng/L, corresponding to a frequency of exceedance of the lowest PNEC of 86 % (six out of seven sites). No correlation between TCS and caffeine was observed, and one of the reasons for that could be the different use patterns in the local populations. Given the high values found in the investigated rivers, TCS seems to be a strong candidate in the priority list of compounds that should be regulated in Brazil to preserve the aquatic environment.

AB Biological treatment of antibiotic production effluents is an economical approach; however, there are still difficulties to overcome because of the recalcitrant characteristics of these compounds to biodegradation. This study aims to reveal that anaerobic treatment technology can be an option as pretreatment before the activated sludge system treatment to treat antibiotic production effluents. The ISO 8192 method was chosen to test the inhibitory effect of raw and treated antibiotic production effluents in this work. Inhibition tests, which were applied according to ISO 8192, highlighted that the anaerobic treatment effluent is less inhibitory than antibiotic production effluent for activated sludge system. Early EC50 concentrations (30-min values) of raw and treated wastewaters were lower than 180-min values. Also, triple effects (sulfamethoxazole-erythromycin-tetracycline) of antibiotics are more toxic than dual effects (sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline). In light of the experimental results obtained and their evaluation, it can be concluded that anaerobic digestion can be applied as a biological pretreatment method for pharmaceutical industry wastewater including antibiotic mixtures prior to aerobic treatment.

AB A simple model was set up to predict estrogen concentrations and endocrine disruption risk in the Yodo River, Japan. This catchment spans the conurbations of Kyoto and Osaka and is the main source of drinking water for Osaka City, Japan. From the river survey data (5 separate occasions between 2005 and 2008), a maximum of 32 g per day estrone (E1) load was observed in the most downstream site of the river. Predicted E1 concentrations were in reasonable agreement with the measurements taken at several points within the basin from a series of sampling campaigns. The predicted concentrations exceeded a net estradiol (E2) equivalent of 1 ng L-1 on only a few occasions, suggesting that only limited endocrine disruption phenomena in fish along the Yodo River is likely. The model was then used to examine the impact on estrogen concentrations and endocrine disruption of a number of different scenarios. It was found that in-river biodegradation had little effect on predicted concentrations and the outcome of endocrine disruption along the catchment. However, reduced sewage treatment removal, as can be experienced in winter in Japan, led to levels of 3.1 ng L-1 E2 equivalents being possible. The reduced river flow in winter in Japan exacerbates the situation as it offers less dilution. It was found that the application of the ozonation process as a tertiary sewage treatment in winter could prevent this higher risk endocrine disruption situation.

Estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were found in all influent samples at concentrations of 69.3-280 ng L-1 and 1.3-30 ng L-1, respectively. The concentrations of conjugated estrogens were from ND (not detected) to 7.6 ng L-1. High concentrations (27.6-235 ng g(-1)) of E1 were found in sludge of some STPs indicating that sorption was an important estrogen removal mechanism. According to the mass flux analyses for estrogens in STP-A, E2 was mainly removed in the anaerobic process and E1 removal was the combined efforts of biodegradation and sorption. Abnormally high concentrations of EE2 (42.6-246 ng L-1), detected with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found in all influent samples of the STPs, therefore interlaboratory analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was conducted for confirmation, which detected no EE2 at all. In consideration of the rather lower estimated EE2 concentration than the measured value, it was speculated that the presence of interfering substances like tetracosanic acid in the matrix could lead to overestimation of EE2 concentration. Overall, the effluents still pose potential estrogenic effect to the downstream aquatic organisms.

AB We demonstrate the simultaneous extraction of phosphorus and clean water from digested sludge centrate using a forward osmosis (FO)-membrane distillation (MD) hybrid process. In this FO-MD hybrid process, FO concentrates orthophosphate and ammonium for subsequent phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O), while MD is used to recover the draw solution and extract clean water from the digested sludge centrate. A decline in water flux was observed during the FO process, but fouling was largely reversible after a brief, simple membrane flushing using deionized water. The FO process also provides an effective pretreatment capacity to the subsequent MD process, which exhibited stable water flux. The use of MgCl2 as the draw solute for the FO process is another novel aspect of the system. The reverse salt flux of magnesium to the concentrated digested sludge across the FO membrane and the diffusion of protons away from the digested sludge create favorable conditions for the formation of struvite crystals. The precipitates obtained in the hybrid process were verified to be struvite crystals by examining the crystal morphology, element composition, and crystal structure. Results reported here highlight the potential and robustness of the FO-MD hybrid process for extracting phosphorus from wastewater.

AB To inform future monitoring and assessment of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in coastal urban watersheds, the occurrence and fate of more than 60 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), commercial/household chemicals, current-use pesticides, and hormones were characterized in 2 effluent-dominated rivers in southern California (USA). Water samples were collected during 2 low-flow events at locations above and below the discharge points of water reclamation plants (WRPs) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Approximately 50% of targeted CECs were detectable at stations downstream from WRPs, compared with <31% and <10% at the reference stations above the WRPs. Concentrations of chlorinated phosphate flame retardants were highest among the CECs tested, with mean total aggregate concentrations of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) of 3400ng/L and 2400ng/L for the 2 rivers. Maximum in-stream concentrations of pyrethroids (bifenthrin and permethrin), diclofenac, and galaxolide exceeded risk-based thresholds established for monitoring of CECs in effluent-dominated receiving waters. In contrast, maximum concentrations of PPCPs commonly detected in treated wastewater (e.g., acetaminophen, N,N,diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and gemfibrozil) were less than 10% of established thresholds. Attenuation of target CECs was not observed downstream of WRP discharge until dilution by seawater occurred in the tidal zone, partly because of the short hydraulic residence times in these highly channelized systems (<3 d). In addition to confirming CECs for future in-stream monitoring, these results suggest that conservative mass transport is an important boundary condition for assessment of the input, fate, and effects of CECs in estuaries at the bottom of these watersheds.

AB Dilution factors are a critical component in estimating concentrations of so-called down-the-drain chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals) in rivers. The present study estimated the temporal and spatial variability of dilution factors around the world using geographically referenced data sets at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution. Domestic wastewater effluents were derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population. Monthly and annual river flows were estimated by accumulating runoff estimates using topographically derived flow directions. National statistics, including the median and interquartile range, were generated to quantify dilution factors. Spatial variability of the dilution factor was found to be considerable; for example, there are 4 orders of magnitude in annual median dilution factor between Canada and Morocco. Temporal variability within a country can also be substantial; in India, there are up to 9 orders of magnitude between median monthly dilution factors. These national statistics provide a global picture of the temporal and spatial variability of dilution factors and, hence, of the potential exposure to down-the-drain chemicals. The present methodology has potential for a wide international community (including decision makers and pharmaceutical companies) to assess relative exposure to down-the-drain chemicals released by human pollution in rivers and, thus, target areas of potentially high risk.

AB The application of appropriate advanced treatment process in the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has become an important issue considering the elimination of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In the present study, the removal of 13 PPCPs belonging to different therapeutic classes by the sequential ultraviolet (UV) and ozonation process in a full-scale WWTP in Beijing was investigated over the course of ten months. Most of the target PPCPs were effectively removed, and the median removal efficiencies of individual PPCPs, ranging from - 13% to 89%, were dependent on their reaction rate constants with molecular ozone. Noticeable fluctuation in the removal efficiencies of the same PPCPs was observed in different sampling campaigns. Nevertheless, the sequential UV and ozonation process still made a significant contribution to the total elimination of most PPCPs in the full-scale WWTP, by compensating for the poor or fluctuant removal performance of PPCPs by biologic treatment process.

AB The aim of this study is to compare measured and predicted concentrations of 11 antibiotics and the antiepileptic carbamazepine in wastewater and surface water and to discuss the accuracy and usefulness of applied predictive models in assessing their concentrations. The occurrence (exposure assessment) of the target compounds was monitored in the influent and effluent of a large municipal wastewater treatment plant, and in its receiving water body, situated in the Po Valley, Italy. Information on the consumption and sales of pharmaceuticals in Italy, along with data related to their excretion and removal during wastewater treatment, were used to predict the concentrations of the selected pharmaceuticals for the studied site. The measured and predicted concentrations were compared for all three sampling points, and according to a criterion available in literature and already adopted in similar studies, the prediction was considered "acceptable" when the ratio of predicted and measured concentrations was between 0.5 and 2. The results show that the concentrations were accurately predicted for ciprofloxacin in wastewaters, and for azithromycin, trimethoprim and carbamazepine in surface water. For all the other compounds and sampling points, the difference between the measured and the predicted concentrations was very high. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed and the main potential factors that influence both measured and predicted concentrations are identified by means of an assessment of the uncertainties in the measured values and sensitivity of all the parameters required for predicting concentration ones. The potential factors are sampling mode for measured values and dilution factor, removal and excretion for predicted ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity of a hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system consisting of two vertical flow (VF) CWs working alternatively (3 m(2)), one horizontal flow (HF) CW (2 m(2)) and one surface flow (FWS) CW (2 m(2)) in series to eliminate 13 emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) under three different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) (0.06, 0.13 and 0.18 m d(-1) considering the area of the two VF beds) was studied through a continuous injection experiment General toxicity, dioxin-like activity, antimicrobial activity and estrogenicity were also measured under the highest hydraulic loading rate. The hybrid system was highly efficient on the removal of total injected EOCs (except for antibiotics, 43 +/- 32%) at all three HLRs (87 +/- 10%). The removal efficiency in the hybrid CW system showed to decrease as the HLR increased for most compounds. The VF wetlands removed most of the injected EOCs more efficiently than the other two CWs, which was attributable to the predominant aerobic degradation pathways of the VF beds (70 +/- 21%). General toxicity was reduced up to 90% by the VF beds. Estrogenicity and dioxin-like activity were similarly reduced by the VF and the HF wetlands, whereas antimicrobial activity was mainly removed by the FWS wetland. Bearing this in mind, this injection study has demonstrated that the use of hybrid CW systems is a suitable wastewater technology for removing EOCs and toxicity even at high HLRs.

AB Ozonation is known as an efficient treatment to reduce the concentration of many trace organic compounds from WWTP effluents, but the formation of unknown and possibly persistent and toxic transformation products has to be considered. In this paper tertiary treatment of wastewater by the combination of ozone and soil aquifer treatment was investigated with respect to the removal of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ, 10 mu g/L) and its transformation products. Batch tests and pilot experiments confirmed efficient removal of carbamazepine from secondary effluent by ozone. With typical ozone consumption of 0.7 mg O-3/mg DOC0, approx. 50% of the transformed CBZ was detected as its primary product 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM). Structure proposals and a formation pathway were elaborated for a total of 13 ozonation products of CBZ. In subsequent biological treatment BQM turned out to be more effectively biodegraded than CBZ. Its aldehyde group was quickly oxidized to a carboxylic acid (BaQM which was removed in sand column experiments. Most of the minor ozonation products of CBZ persisted in sand column experiments with residence times of 5-6 days. Non-target screening of column effluent revealed no formation of persistent biotransformation products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acetaminophen is the most widely used human medicine. Trace levels of acetaminophen are frequently detected in treated wastewater and the impacted surface or groundwater resources. However, even though soil is a primary receiving compartment, the fate of acetaminophen in soil is poorly known, including in particular the potential for the formation of incomplete degradation products that may have altered biological activity and mobility. In this study, using both C-14-labeling and LC-MS/MS techniques, we evaluated the dissipation routes and transformation pathways of acetaminophen in soils under a range of conditions. Throughout 120-d aerobic incubation, up to 17.0 +/- 0.8% of C-14-acetaminophen was mineralized, but mineralization was greatly inhibited after sterilization or amendment of biosolids. Immediately after treatment, the majority of C-14-residue became non-extractable or bound, with the level accounting for 73.4-93.3% of the applied amount at the end of incubation. A total of 8 intermediates were identified, including 3-hydroxyacetaminophen, hydroquinone, 1, 4-benzoquinone, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, p-acetanisidide, 4-methoxyphenol, 2-hexenoic acid, and 1, 4-dimethoxybenzene. Mineralization and rapid conversion to bound residues suggest that acetaminophen is quickly detoxified in soil, decreasing the potential for off-site transport such as leaching or runoff. On the other hand, the formation of a large number of degradation intermediates, and their potential biological activity, may pose unknown risks, such as accumulation into edible plants. This risk warrants further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has been of increasing concern around the world due to their ability to alter the structure of microbial communities and to promote the development of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Six major rivers in Central Taiwan were investigated for the occurrence of the eight most frequently prescribed quinolone and imidazole antibiotics using solid-phase extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Nalidixic acid, flumequine, ofloxacin, dimetridazole, and metronidazole were detected at 0.8-192ng/L in the water samples. The three most frequently detected antibiotics at all sampling sites were metronidazole, nalidixic acid, and flumequine (detection frequency (n=24) 19 sites). The highest concentration of flumequine was detected at 192 +/- 6.5ng/L in the Old Zhuoshui River. Compared to the available predicted no-effect concentration data, the risk quotients of flumequine and ofloxacin were estimated to be close to one. The Old Zhuoshui and Beigang Rivers were shown to be the two most contaminated rivers with the nearby animal husbandries being the important source of contamination. The information provided here warrants future attention and is useful for the development of regulation and remediation strategies.

AB Leachate from stabilized landfill can pose unique challenges to conventional biological wastewater treatment. Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes have garnered recent consideration as an option to reduce the organic strength and recalcitrance of aged landfill leachate. With a bench-scale investigation, the reported work examines the potential for leachate conditioning for further biological treatment by treatment with low-mg/L doses of ozone (0-7.5mg/L O-3). While not sufficient for significant organics mineralization, the tested ozone doses could potentially produce both selective and non-selective oxidation of recalcitrant leachate organic compounds leaving bio-available products in the pre-treated leachate. Leachate conditioning by O-3 or O-3/H2O2 was assessed via monitoring of three anthropogenic organic leachate contaminants(tris-(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tris-(butoxyethyl)-phosphate and 17-estradiol (E2)) with ozonation, and ozonation followed by anaerobic incubation. In addition, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and BOD5 analysis of the ozonated leachate, and methane and total gas formation during the anaerobic incubation were used to assess the degree of leachate conditioning. When treated with O-3 alone, 58% removal of E2 was observed with an ozone dose of 4.5-5.4mg/L. Direct oxidation of the three leachate contaminants was limited with O-3/H2O2 pre-treatment. However, this pre-treatment was observed to have significantly improved degradation of E2 during anaerobic incubation of ozonated leachates (removal rate of E2 was 53.7% with 15 days of incubation), indicating the potential for ozone synthesized co-metabolism. However, overall anaerobic microbial activity was not significantly impacted by the applied ozone pre-treatments, as measured by methane formation, total gas formation, and COD removal during incubation.

AB Thousands of chemicals have been identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), but prioritizing them concerning ecological and human health risks is challenging. We explored the use of sewage treatment plants as chemical observatories to conveniently identify persistent and bioaccumulative CECs, including toxic organohalides. Nationally representative samples of sewage sludge (biosolids) were analyzed for 231 CECs, of which 123 were detected. Ten of the top 11 most abundant CECs in biosolids were found to be high-production volume chemicals, eight of which representing priority chemicals, including three flame retardants, three surfactants and two antimicrobials. A comparison of chemicals detected in nationally representative biological specimens from humans and municipal biosolids revealed 70% overlap. This observed co-occurrence of contaminants in both matrices suggests that the analysis of sewage sludge can inform human health risk assessments by providing current information on toxic exposures in human populations and associated body burdens of harmful environmental pollutants.

AB The presence of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria in aquatic environments has become a health threat in the last few years. Their presence has increased due to the presence of antibiotics in wastewater effluents, which are not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatments. As a result there is a need to study the possible ways of removal of the mixtures of antibiotics present in wastewater effluents and the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which may also spread the antibiotic resistance genes to other bacterial populations. In this study the degradation of a mixture of antibiotics i.e. sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin, the disinfection of total enterococci and the removal of those resistant to: a) sulfamethoxazole, b) clarithromycin and c) to both antibiotics have been examined, along with the toxicity of the whole effluent mixture after treatment to the luminescent aquatic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Solar Fenton treatment (natural solar driven oxidation) using Fenton reagent doses of 50 mg L-1 of hydrogen peroxide and 5 mg L-1 of Fe3+ in a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector plant was used to examine the disinfection and antibiotic resistance removal efficiency in different aqueous matrices, namely distilled water, simulated and real wastewater effluents. There was a faster complete removal of enterococci and of antibiotics in all aqueous matrices by applying solar Fenton when compared to photolytic treatment of the matrices. Sulfamethoxazole was more efficiently degraded than clarithromycin in all three aqueous matrices (95% removal of sulfamethoxazole and 70% removal of clarithromycin in real wastewater). The antibiotic resistance of enterococci towards both antibiotics exhibited a 5-log reduction with solar Fenton in real wastewater effluent. Also after solar Fenton treatment, there were 10 times more antibiotic-resistant enterococci in the presence of sulfamethoxazole than in the presence of clarithromycin. Finally, the toxicity of the treated wastewater to V. fischeri remained very low throughout the treatment time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Omeprazole is one of the world-wide most consumed pharmaceuticals for treatment of gastric diseases. As opposed to other frequently used pharmaceuticals, omeprazole is scarcely detected in urban wastewaters and environmental waters. This was corroborated in a previous research, where parent omeprazole was not detected while four transformation products (TPs), mainly resulting from hydrolysis, were found in effluent wastewaters and surface waters. However, the low abundance of omeprazole TPs in the water samples together with the fact that omeprazole suffers an extensive metabolism, with a wide range of excretion rates (between 0.01 and 30%), suggests that human urinary metabolites should be investigated in the water environment. In this work, the results obtained in excretion tests after administration of a 40 mg omeprazole dose in three healthy volunteers are reported. Analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS) reported low concentrations of omeprazole in urine. Up to twenty-four omeprazole metabolites (OMs) were detected and tentatively elucidated. The most relevant OM was an omeprazole isomer, which obviously presented the same exact mass (m/z 346.1225), but also shared a major common fragment at m/z 198.0589. Subsequent analyses of surface water and effluent wastewater samples by both LC-QTOF MS and LC-MS/MS with triple quadrupole revealed that this metabolite (named as OM10) was the compound most frequently detected in water samples, followed by OM14a and OM14b. Up to our knowledge, OM10 had not been used before as urinary biomarker of omeprazole in waters. On the contrary, parent omeprazole was never detected in any of the water samples. After this research, it seems clear that monitoring the presence of omeprazole in the aquatic environment should be focused on the OMs suggested in this article instead of the parent compound.

AB Advanced wastewater treatment is necessary to effectively remove emerging contaminants (ECs) with chronic toxicity, endocrine disrupting effects, and the capability to induce the proliferation of highly resistant microbial strains in the environment from before wastewater disposal or reuse. This paper investigates the efficiency of a novel hybrid process that applies membrane ultrafiltration, activated carbon adsorption, and ultrasound irradiation simultaneously to remove ECs. Diclofenac, carbamazepine, and amoxicillin are chosen for this investigation because of their assessed significant environmental risks. Removal mechanisms and enhancement effects are analysed in single and combined processes. The influence of adsorbent dose and ultrasonic frequency to EC removal are also investigated. Results suggest that adsorption is probably the main removal mechanism and is affected by the nature of ECs and the presence of other components in the mixture. Almost complete removals are achieved in the hybrid process for all ECs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing urbanisation in the future will put mounting stresses on the receiving environments around those urban centres due to increased sedimentation and contaminant runoff. Emerging contaminants (ECs) are an extensive array of chemicals and many are not under regulatory action. Within New Zealand likely future pressures from ECs will be in both urban centres and rural areas due to intensive agriculture, although at present there is a lack of information on the state of the environment in both sectors. This study was initiated to gauge the distribution of ECs in the urban environment by measuring concentrations of flame retardants, plasticisers, alkylphenols, herbicides and pesticides, steroid oestrogens, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in sediment from 13 estuarine sites around Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city. Total polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardant concentrations ((7)Sigma(PBDE)) ranged from 0.55 to 573 ng/g (dw). The phthalate plasticiser di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was measured at up to 11,500 ng/g from one site. Nonylphenol (NP) was found at up to 32,000 ng/g at one site adjacent to the city's major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). However, median concentrations of NP were 153 ng/g, suggesting this site was not representative of the region. Nonylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates (NPEO1,2) had highest concentrations (1600 ng/g) at a marina. Highest glyphosate concentrations (up to 950 ng/g) were observed at residential sites. Steroid oestrogens were detected at extremely low concentrations (maximum 22 ng/g), while all other pesticides or herbicides were not detected at any sites. Multi-residue analysis of 46 pharmaceuticals showed presence of 21 compounds at one or more sites, with average concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 7.66 ng/g. Generally, environmental concentrations of ECs were similar to those reported world-wide. However, comparisons for pharmaceuticals were problematic, due to very few studies on pharmaceutical concentrations in estuarine sediments, with most focussed on sewage and stream water phases.

AB Approximately 40% of U.S. residents rely on groundwater as a source of drinking water. Groundwater, especially unconfined sand and gravel aquifers, is vulnerable to contamination from septic systems and infiltration of wastewater treatment plant effluent. In this study, we characterized concentrations of pharmaceuticals, perfluorosurfactants, and other organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) in the unconfined sand and gravel aquifer of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, where septic systems are prevalent. Raw water samples from 20 public drinking water supply wells on Cape Cod were tested for 92 OWCs, as well as surrogates of wastewater impact. Fifteen of 20 wells contained at least one OWC; the two most frequently-detected chemicals were sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (perfluorosurfactant). Maximum concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (113 ng/L) and the anticonvulsant phenytoin (66 ng/L) matched or exceeded maximum reported concentrations in other U.S. public drinking water sources. The sum of pharmaceutical concentrations and the number of detected chemicals were both significantly correlated with nitrate, boron, and extent of unsewered residential and commercial development within 500 m, indicating that wastewater surrogates can be useful for identifying wells most likely to contain OWCs. Septic systems appear to be the primary source of OWCs in Cape Cod groundwater, although wastewater treatment plants and other sources were potential contributors to several wells. These results show that drinking water supplies in unconfined aquifers where septic systems are prevalent may be among the most vulnerable to OWCs. The presence of mixtures of OWCs in drinking water raises human health concerns, a full evaluation of potential risks is limited by a lack of health-based guidelines and toxicity assessments.

The steroid hormone profile in the adjacent surface water was also determined. Pro was the most abundant (41%, 408 ng/L) in the influent, followed by tes (35%, 343 ng/L) and E2 (12%, 119 ng/L). El was the most abundant (35%, 23 ng/L) in effluent, followed by E2 (30%, 20 ng/L) and tes (17%, 11 ng/L). Chemical removal efficiencies of the steroid hormones by the WWW averaged 92%. High removal efficiency was observed for pro (98% +/- 2) and tes (96% +/- 1), compared to natural (72-100%) and synthetic estrogen (90% +/- 3), with biodegradation being the major removal route for pro and tes. The lowest removal for E2 is in spring (65%), and maximum removal is in winter (95%). Natural (E2, El) and synthetic estrogen (EE2) were major contributors to influent (E2 = 69%) and effluent (E2 = 73%) estrogenic potency. The estrogenic potency removal averaged 85% (range: 73-100). Risk assessment of the steroid hormones present in wastewater effluent, and surface water, indicated that EE2 and E2 pose the highest risk to human health and fish. EE2 was found to be much more resistant to biodegradation, compared to E2, in surface water. Estrone, as the breakdown product of E2 and EE2 in wastewater, appears to be suitable as an indicator of EDCs. The study suggests that a battery of tests: quantitative chemical assay, bioassay for estrogenic activity and risk assessment methods, collectively, are preferred in order to make meaningful, accurate conclusions regarding potential adverse effects of EDCs present in treated wastewater effluent or surface water, to the aquatic environment, human health, and wildlife systems.

AB The biocides irgarol and terbutryn enter the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) via combined sewer systems after leaching from coatings and paints of materials. In this study, the biotransformation of irgarol and terbutryn was examined in aerobic batch experiments with activated sludge taken from the nitrification zone of a conventional VVWTP, since currently there is no information about the fate of irgarol and terbutryn in biological wastewater treatment. Both, irgarol and terbutryn were transformed into one main transformation product (TP) following pseudo first-order kinetics. The TPs were tentatively identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) to be irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide. The final confirmation of the proposed chemical structures of the TPs was achieved by a comparison of mass spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with those of authentic reference standards (e.g., synthesized). An analytical method for the sensitive quantification of irgarol, terbutryn and their TPs in environmental samples was developed based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and LC tandem MS detection. Irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide were detected in the effluents (average concentrations up to 22 ng L-1 and 65 ng L-1) of all four investigated WWTPs as well as in streams and small rivers (up to 14 ng L-1 and 34 ng L-1). Luminescent bacteria inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri exhibited that the TPs irgarol sulfoxide and terbutryn sulfoxide feature a similar bacterial toxicity than the parent compounds.

TI A Model to Estimate the Population Contributing to the Wastewater Using
   Samples Collected on Census Day

LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG-USE; ILLICIT; BIOMARKERS; SEWAGE; TRENDS
AB An important uncertainty when estimating per capita consumption of, for example, illicit drugs by means of wastewater analysis (sometimes referred to as "sewage epidemiology") relates to the size and variability of the de, facto population in the catchment of interest. In the absence of a day-specific direct population count any indirect surrogate model to estimate population size lacks a standard to assess uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study associated uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collect wastewater samples at a unique opportunity, that is, on a census day, as a basis for a model to estimate the number of people contributing to a given wastewater sample. Mass loads for a wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were quantified in influents of ten sewage treatment (STP) serving populations ranging from approximately 3500 to 500 000 people. Separate linear models for population size were estimated with the mass loads of the different chemical as the explanatory variable: 14 chemicals showed good, linear relationships, with highest correlations for acesulfame and gabapentin. De facto population was then estimated through Bayesian inference, by updating the population size provided by STP staff (prior knowledge) with measured chemical mass loads. Cross validation showed that large populations can be estimated fairly accurately with a few chemical mass loads quantified from 24-h composite samples. In contrast, the prior knowledge for small population sizes cannot be improved substantially despite the information of multiple chemical mass loads. In the future, observations other than chemical mass loads may improve this deficit, since Bayesian inference allows including any kind of information relating to population size.

AB A new analytical method has been developed for the screening, evaluation and determination of sub mu g/L concentrations of chlorinated chemicals in environmental waters. Ten different compounds included in the European water policy have been considered and determined by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) followed by liquid desorption and negative chemical ionization gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (SBSE-LD-NCI-GC-QqQ-MS). Analyte extraction was performed using SBSE with 100mL sample volume, 5% MeOH, 10% NaCl and an extraction time of 14h of mechanized stirring, which provided best analytical recoveries. Desorption of analytes was carried out using 5mL acetonitrile (ACN) and 5min of two successive sonication steps which resulted best performance without any carry over. The method detection limits (MDL) ranged 3-22ng/L and 7-29ng/L for river waters and wastewaters respectively. The experimental recoveries for all compounds were>60% with<20% deviation in the reproducibility. Pentachloroanisole alone reported a low maximum recovery of 54% under given conditions. Matrix influenced signal enhancement was observed more in case of triclosan, which was managed by using matrix matched calibration standards apart from using double helix injection liner. This method was applied to the analysis of different river waters and wastewater effluent samples collected from Alcala de Henares, Spain. Four compounds namely chloropyriphos-ethyl, triclosan, -endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate were positively identified in river waters and three compounds viz., chloropyriphos-ethyl, -endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate were detected in wastewater effluents. The concentrations of -endosulfan ranged between 11.3-22.9ng/L and 16.3-33.8ng/L in river waters and wastewaters respectively. Almost 40% of the water samples analysed showed much higher concentrations of -endosulfan than prescribed European environmental quality standard limit for surface waters of 5 ng/L.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of emerging environmental contaminants. They are manufactured to be biologically active and to be persistent against biodegradation. This makes them more risky for the environment, as they can have negative impact on living organisms. However, still there are many problems in reliable analysis of these compounds due to low amounts and complexity of the environmental samples. The technique widely used for this purpose is liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. One of the main drawbacks of this technique is the change in ionization efficiency-phenomenon known as the matrix effect. Matrix effects heavily influence both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Therefore, it also has impact on the quality of the obtained results. Thus the main aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of six different aqueous environmental matrices on the solid-phase extraction efficiency and the final determination of twelve selected sulfonamides by LC-MS/MS technique. The obtained results showed that both were strongly affected by the matrix composition. The more complicated the matrix was, the greater influence was observed (matrix effects in tap water were in the range from 8.77 to -16.49 % and in waste-water influents from -63.67 to -97.43 %). Extraction efficiency of selected drugs decreased from 94.9 to 41.5 % for tap water samples to from 31.6 to 0 % for wastewater influents. Thus, it is of high significance to use an approach to correct effects caused by matrix components. The proper calculation of the real concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the environment is required for determining the consequent risk to living organisms.

AB Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat the symptoms of pain and inflammation. Diclofenac and its metabolites enter to the ecosystem mainly due to the ineffective treatment in wastewater treatment plants and lead to toxic effects on the environmental ecology. Emerging contaminants such as diclofenac can be degraded to a large extent in anaerobic digestion unit of wastewater treatment plants. Thus, it is important to assess the fate of diclofenac under anaerobic conditions. Biodegradation potential of diclofenac under anaerobic conditions was investigated with a fermentative/methanogenic culture enriched from anaerobic digestion sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. An anaerobic lab-scale semi-continuous reactor was operated at 35 degrees C in the dark. The culture was amended with glucose, yeast extract and diclofenac dissolved in methanol (10 mu g/L) providing 343 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (COD). A constant biogas production in the culture at the end of each feeding cycle was observed after 20 days incubation period (320 mL) which is in accordance with the theoretically calculated gas production. Although diclofenac removal was not achieved at the initial days of the acclimation period, after 70 days acclimation period partial diclofenac degradation (21%) was observed in the reactor. A batch experiment was conducted to assess diclofenac removal efficiency as well as the effect of diclofenac on methane and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production for one feeding cycle. Although only 19% diclofenac removal was observed in the batch culture amended with 10 mu g/L of diclofenac, a negative effect was not observed in terms of gas production, VFAs production and consumption during the incubation period. The results indicate the importance of the further investigation to achieve complete degradation of the diclofenac under anaerobic conditions.

AB This paper investigates the biodegradability of wastewaters originating from a paracetamol active ingredients production factory. Experimental biodegradability tests are performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In this pharmaceutical plant, approximately 1 m(3) of wastewater is generated per ton paracetamol produced. According to the results of conventional characterization, a strong wastewater that is almost totally soluble in nature is produced. ED50 value for raw effluent is determined to be 6.7 % at 30 mm showing significant toxicity towards the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Aerobic and anaerobic treatment alternatives are comparatively evaluated in terms of the lowest achievable COD levels after biotreatment. Aerobic treatment yields a residual COD of 355 mg/L. The discharge standards of 600 mg/L can be complied with the usage of an aerobic treatment unit. Application of anaerobic treatment, on the other hand, is not efficient in removing organics from these effluents. Almost up to 87 % of the COD is recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions resulting in around 16000 mg/L of COD at the outlet of anaerobic treatment. Therefore, aerobic treatment must be favoured over anaerobic one before discharging these effluents to the sewerage system.

AB This study evaluates the joint effects of erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) combinations on anaerobic treatment efficiency and the potential for antibiotic degradation during anaerobic sequencing batch reactor operation. The experiments involved two identical anaerobic sequencing batch reactors. One reactor, as control unit, was fed with synthetic wastewater while the other reactor (ES) was fed with a synthetic substrate mixture including ES antibiotic combinations. The influence of ES antibiotic mixtures on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, volatile fatty acid production, antibiotic degradation, biogas production, and composition were investigated. The influent antibiotic concentration was gradually increased over 10 stages, until the metabolic collapse of the reactors, which occurred at 360 days for the ES reactor. The results suggest that substrate/COD utilization and biogas/methane generation affect performance of the anaerobic reactors at higher concentration. In addition, an average of 40% erythromycin and 37% sulfamethoxazole reduction was achieved in the ES reactor. These results indicated that these antibiotics were partly biodegradable in the anaerobic reactor system.

AB A study has been conducted on a retention soil filter (RSF) to test its effectiveness in removing pharmaceutical residues and microorganisms from combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Efficient removal of solids, nutrients and heavy metals has already been proven. The possibility that organic micropollutants and microorganisms are also retained by the use of RSFs has been identified, but data are lacking. Results obtained in this study, in which testing for removal by a RSF of numerous micropollutant substances was performed, are most promising. The pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen are presented in detail as examples of such micropollutants. Both showed a reduction in positive samples of more than 55% as well as a significant reduction in median and maximum concentrations. For microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, coliphages and Giardia lamblia (cysts), an average reduction in concentrations by three logarithmic steps (99.9%) was achieved. These results add to the evidence that using a RSF in the advanced treatment of wastewater from CSOs reduces the exposure of watercourses to pharmaceutical residues and microbial contamination.

DE chemicals of emerging concern; Great Lakes; wastewater
ID TREATMENT PLANTS
AB The Great Lakes and their connecting channels form the largest fresh surface water system on earth. Over the past 10 years, focus on environmental monitoring has shifted to an array of recently discovered compounds known as 'chemicals of emerging concern' (CEC). These chemicals are found in products used daily in households, businesses, agriculture and industry, such as flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides. Wastewater treatment plants are among the important pathways by which CEC enter the Great Lakes, with concentrations highest in the vicinity of wastewater discharges. Treated sewage is often discharged into the nearshore waters, which also provide a source of drinking water to the public. In 2009-2011, the International Joint Commission addressed the need to assess the effectiveness of existing wastewater treatment technologies in the basin to remove CEC, as well as to gain insight on potential advanced technologies to improve their removal. This assessment encompassed three major activities, development of an inventory of municipal wastewater treatment plants that discharge in the basin; a survey of detailed operational data for selected wastewater facilities; and a comprehensive literature review and analysis of the effectiveness of various wastewater treatment technologies to remove chemicals of emerging concern.

The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency and rate for conventional ANAMMOX was 66.6 +/- 5.9% and 2.7 +/- 0.2 kg N/(m(3).d), respectively, which was 58.6 +/- 3.8% and 1.2 +/- 0.1 kg N/(m(3).d) for single-stage ANAMMOX. Single-stage ANAMMOX showed higher tolerance to CTC than conventional ANAMMOX. The nitrogen removal of conventional and single-stage ANAMMOX began to deteriorate when CTC was added, to 40 and 80 mg/L, respectively, with the former totally inhibited at 120 mg/L CTC and the latter at 140 mg/L CTC. TN removal rates were recovered to 1.2 and 0.7 kg N/(m(3).d), respectively, when CTC concentration was reduced to 20 mg/L for 8 days. This study implied that ANAMMOX could be efficiently used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater, with single-stage implementation being more stable under antibiotic pressure.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the fate of the antimicrobial agent triclosan (TCS) in a conventional septic tank. The main mechanism of TCS removal from wastewater was identified to be rapid TCS sorption to suspended particles followed by settling of these particles to the bottom of the septic tank. Sorption to particles was completed within minutes while the settling took several days. Therefore, in a septic tank the removal of TCS from wastewater is mainly determined by the removal of suspended particles by sedimentation. Over 5 days of hydraulic residence time the initial dissolved TCS concentration of 100 mu g L-1 was reduced by 87 +/- 8%. During the first 24 hours, 66-86% of all removed TCS was retained, whereas during the remainder of the experiment a slight but steady decrease in TCS concentration was observed. This was most likely caused by TCS diffusion and its subsequent sorption onto the septic sludge.

AB Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely used in the treatment of major depression. It has been detected in surface and wastewaters, being able to negatively affect aquatic organisms. Most of the ecotoxicity studies focused only in pharmaceuticals, though excipients can also pose a risk to non-target organisms. In this work the ecotoxicity of five medicines (three generic formulations and two brand labels) containing the same active substance (fluoxetine hydrochloride) was tested on the alga Chlorella vulgaris, in order to evaluate if excipients can influence their ecotoxicity. Effective concentrations that cause 50% of inhibition (EC50) ranging from 0.25 to 15 mg L-1 were obtained in the growth inhibition test performed for the different medicines. The corresponding values for fluoxetine concentration are 10 times lower. Higher EC50 values had been published for the same alga considering only the toxicity of fluoxetine. Therefore, this increase in toxicity may be attributed to the presence of excipients. Thus more studies on ecotoxicological effects of excipients are required in order to assess the environmental risk they may pose to aquatic organisms.

AB The additional removal of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) provided by advanced water and wastewater treatment inevitably requires additional financial costs, which must be estimated to support utility planning and compare alternatives. This study presents conceptual-level (Class 4) capital and annual operations and maintenance (O&M) cost curve equations to aid evaluations of advanced treatment trains for water reuse. The cost curve equations are broadly applicable to the water reuse community, particularly those interested in ozone-based treatment trains. Unit processes include microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes (MF/UF), nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes (NF/RO), ozone (with or without hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), ultraviolet (UV) treatment with H2O2 (UV/H2O2), and biological activated carbon (BAC); all cost curves are for a unit process and can be added together to obtain costs for a combined treatment train. The cost curves indicate that at all plant capacities (1 to 500 MGD), membrane treatment (e. g., MF or RO) represents the highest cost unit process, ozone the least, and BAC or UV/H2O2 fall in between. Additionally, the relationship between ozone dose and TOrC removal is discussed with a demonstration of how costs change with increasing ozone dose to achieve desired TOrC destruction.

AB The authors conducted a survey of small streams to evaluate the effects of centralized and onsite wastewater treatment on the occurrence of selected traditional and emerging contaminants in small streams in the upper Neuse River basin, North Carolina. An undeveloped site was included to assess effects of residential land use activities on stream quality. Concentrations of nutrients and ions were higher in samples from streams in residential sites than from the stream in an undeveloped area. Overall, streams draining residential areas showed relatively small differences with respect to type of wastewater treatment. Two sites, however one in an area of centralized wastewater treatment apparently near a suspected sewer line leak, and the second in an area of onsite wastewater treatment showed effects of wastewater. Organic wastewater compounds were detected more frequently in samples from these two sites than from the other sites. Optical brighteners levels were correlated (r(2) = .88) with the number of organic wastewater and pharmaceutical compounds detected at the residential sites and could potentially serve as a screening method to assess wastewater effects on small streams.

AB Natural steroid estrogens (e. g., 17 beta-estradiol, E2), synthetic steroid estrogens (e. g., 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, EE2) and pharmaceutical antibiotics (e. g., ciprofloxacin) are chemicals detected in biosolids and sewage sludges because they partition into the solids fraction during the wastewater treatment process. This research utilized a three-way factorial design (six media two estrogens three antibiotic treatments) to quantify cumulative E2 and EE2 mineralization over 133 d (MAX) in a range of sewage sludge and biosolid samples in the presence (4 and 40 mg kg(-1)) and absence of ciprofloxacin. The same three-way factorial design was utilized to quantify the impact of the six media, E2 or EE2, and ciprofloxacin on cumulative soil respiration over 133 d (RESP). Minimal ciprofloxacin mineralization was observed (< 0.05% over 133 d), but despite its persistence, ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on MAX of E2 or EE2, and, in general, no significant effect on RESP. MAX ranged from 38.38% to 48.44% for E2 but from only 0.72% to 24.27% for EE2 although RESP was relatively similar, ranging from 101.00 to 866.54 mg CO2 in the presence of E2 and from 69.55 to 893.95 mg CO2 in the presence of EE2. The sorption-limited bioavailability of EE2, which is inherently resistant to biodegradation due to chemical structure, as MAX and Freundlich sorption coefficients (K-f) were negatively correlated. As such, the Kf values of EE2 were largest in composted biosolids in which EE2 was particularly resistant to microbial degradation as the MAX of EE2 was < 3%. In contrast, the MAX of E2 showed a positive association with the K-f values of E2 because some steps in the E2 transformation process have been found to occur in the sorbed phase. The MAX of E2 was significantly greater in the biosolid and composted biosolid media than in any other media, whereas the MAX of E2 decreased in the following order: secondary sewage sludge > primary sewage sludge > biosolid D composted biosolid. This suggests that sewage sludges in municipal lagoons and pretreatment holding lagoons are a more favorable media for mineralization of EE2, whereas biosolids in post-treatment storage lagoons are a more favorable media for the mineralization of E2. The presence of ciprofloxacin will have no impact on the potential E2 or EE2 mineralization rates in these cases.

AB This study investigates the oxidation of selected endocrine disrupting compounds (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) during ozonation and advanced oxidation of biologically treated municipal wastewater effluents in a pilot scale. Selected estrogenic substances were spiked in the treated wastewater at levels ranging from 1.65 to 3.59 mu g.L-1. All estrogens were removed by ozonation by more than 99% at ozone doses >= 1.8 mg.L-1. At a dose of 4.4.mg L-1 ozonation reduced concentrations of estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol by 99.8, 99.7, 99.9 and 99.7%, respectively. All tested advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) achieved high removal rates but they were slightly lower compared to ozonation. The lower removal rates for all tested advanced oxidation processes are caused by the presence of naturally occurring hydroxyl radical scavengers carbonates and bicarbonates.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the mobility of naproxen, carbamazepine, and triclosan through a wastewater-irrigated agricultural soil. Transport experiments were carried out using undisturbed soil columns taken at 10 and 40 cm depths. The mobilization of the pollutants was evaluated using two hydrological regimes transient flow for superficial columns and steady-state conditions for the sub-superficial columns. Results demonstrated that preferential flows are present in the superficial soil, and transient flow conditions facilitate the movement of the pollutants through the soil. Conversely, displacement of the contaminants in the sub-superficial soil columns was slower than that observed in the superficial soil. Triclosan was not found in the leachates of the soil columns at the two depths, indicating the strong retention of the compound by the soils. Conversely, naproxen and carbamazepine were determined in leachates of the soil columns at both depths. Retardation in the transport of carbamazepine was higher than that observed for naproxen in the two tested soils. Naproxen and triclosan showed some degree of dissipation, while carbamazepine was recalcitrant. It was concluded that the natural depuration system studied is capable of retaining and removing the studied pollutants and thus the risk of groundwater pollution is minimized.

AB We optimised the simultaneous analysis of four analytes, namely three anti-influenza drugs (oseltamivir (OS), zanamivir (ZAN) and amantadine (AMN)) and one metabolite of OS (oseltamivir carboxylate (OC)), in sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent by verifying the types and conditions of solid phase extraction (SPE) appropriate for LC-MS/MS analysis. In summary, these target analytes were extracted from aqueous samples (30-50 mL) by using strong cation-exchange SPE cartridges (500 mg adsorbent) under acidic conditions (pH 3-4). After washing of the cartridges with acidified water (pH 3.0, 3 mL) and methanol (3 mL), the analytes were eluted with a mixed solvent (2 mL) of 10% (v/v) triethylamine in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetone and water. Application of this technique to the target compounds should yield a comprehensive understanding of the occurrence and fate of anti-influenza drugs in the water environment.

AB In this study an analytical procedure of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was elaborated and validated for simultaneous determination of 11 acidic, neutral and basic emerging contaminants in wastewater. The most frequently used pharmaceuticals were studied, i.e. five anti-inflammatory drugs - ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen and salicylic acid, an antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, clofibric acid, antibacterial triclosan, a plasticiser bisphenol A and two beta-blockers - propranolol and metoprolol. Sample enrichment was performed using Oasis HLB sorbent. Sample pH and sorbent washing step during the solid-phase extraction were optimised on real wastewater samples. Recoveries of the most polar acidic compounds diminished substantially when the alkalinity of the sample loaded into the cartridge increased. Thus finally wastewater was extracted at pH 2.0. Before elution, sorbent was washed subsequently with 5% methanol in water and n-hexane, which resulted in best recoveries of most of the target compounds and reduced a co-elution phenomena with respect to beta-blockers. The optimised method was successfully applied to influent and effluent samples from wastewater treatment plant, Krakow, Poland. All target compounds except propranolol were identified in wastewater at a concentration up to 12.8 mu g L-1.

AB A reliable multiclass method has been developed and validated for the determination of eight antibiotics from distinct classes (sulfonamides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, cephalosporins and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors) in wastewater - influent and effluent and surface water from Porto Alegre, Brazil. The pre-concentration and clean-up was conducted with a simple and fast protocol using solid-phase extraction allowing a 100-fold concentration factor. The proposed method was validated by using spiked blank wastewater samples in terms of linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, recovery, matrix effects and limits of detection and quantification. Recovery was obtained in the range of 66-149%. Method limit of quantification ranged between 1.6 and 61.7 ng L-1. Samples (n = 16) were taken from January to August 2011 in one wastewater treatment plant, which uses conventional biological treatment. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim show higher concentration, ranging from >10 to <6500 ng L-1, whereas erythromycin presented the lower amount. Differences between influent and effluent profiles were discussed. Surface water samples (n = 8) were collected in Arroio Diluvio, in four sampling points, in February 2012. From the eight antibiotics analysed, five were detected: sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azythromicyn, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, in a concentration range of 376-572 ng L-1, 27-94 ng L-1, 24-40 ng L-1, 16-66ng L-1 and 30-54 ng L-1, respectively.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the degradation of nonbiodegradable organic pollutants in biologically cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater using different electrodes such as non-nano-scale electrode (traditional coated), nano-scale (nano-coated) electrode, and perforated electrode after biotreatment. The traditional coated electrode plate, nano-coated electrode plate, and two different perforated titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrode plates with an average pore size of 10 mm and 20 mm were chosen as the anode. The results demonstrated that traditional coated electrode, nano-scale electrode, and perforated electrode could effectively remove nonbiodegradable organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater. The perforated electrode with an average pore size of 10 mm exhibited the best degradation effect with a 90 % decrease in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) (COD content reduced from 320 mg L-1 to 32 mg L-1). During catalytic degradation, the electrical conductivity of pharmaceutical wastewater increased and the pH increased and finally reached equilibrium. It was also found that the perforated TiO2 electrode produced relatively large amounts of dissolved oxygen during the catalytic oxidation process, reaching above 4 mg L-1, whereas the nano-coated electrode produced little dissolved oxygen. The biotoxicities of all wastewater samples increased firstly then decreased slightly during the electrical catalytic oxidation, but the final biotoxicities were all higher than initial ones.

AB The objectives of the study were to test the effects of coagulation sedimentation after oxidation with potassium ferrate (CSOPF) in advanced treatment of wastewater from traditional Chinese medicine (TCMW) and to research kinetics of chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) and color removal by means of potassium ferrate oxidation. It was hoped to develop a feasible technology and provide technical support for TCMW factories. This study confirmed that implementing coagulating sedimentation after oxidation with potassium ferrate was very efficient for the advanced treatment of the secondary treatment effluent of TCMW. In this optimal situation, the performance of the CSOPF was stable, and the CODcr and the color in the effluent were always under 45and 25 mg L-1 respectively, which meet the strictest discharge standards of the discharge standard of water pollutes for pharmaceutical industry Chinese traditional medicine category (GB21906-2008)(DSWPPICTMC). Moreover, the experiment proved that the economic benefits of CSOPF implementation were striking because its operation cost is only 0.08380 US$ per m(3). Compared with the total cost of the existing wastewater treatment system in the sampled factory, the total saving of CSOPF implementation was 0.15845 US$ per m(3). Finally, the experiment confirmed that in potassium ferrate oxidation, the removal rate for COD can be described by C/C-0 = exp(-0.0421t) and the removal rate for color can be described by C/C-0 = exp(-0.0434t).

AB Female sexual hormones have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to the effects that they cause by interfering in the endocrine system. Many contemporary studies have sought to monitor some of the main female sexual hormones in surface waters in Brazil. Current article evaluates the presence of 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, estrone and progesterone in the surface waters of Curitiba and the surrounding metropolitan area in the state of Parana, Brazil, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), performed at 7 different sites. The study revealed that a range of concentrations between 0.07 and 13.45 mu g L-1 of female sexual hormones was extant; higher values than these were found in other regions of Brazil and in other countries. Higher concentrations have been attributed to the region' s sanitation due to large sewage amounts. Sewage discharge has also been confirmed by results of limnological parameters.

The electroanalytical method to quantify the concentration of FA has been standardised in order to establish the best conditions of pH and concentration range. The EO was performed using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and titanium, as anode and cathode, respectively. According to the data obtained, it was possible to follow the degradation of FA by using DPV technique, determining its concentration, as a function of time.

AB A rapid and accurate ion chromatography (IC) method (limit of detection as low as 0.06 mg L-1) for fosfomycin concentration determination in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater was developed. This method was compared with the performance of high performance liquid chromatography determination (with a high detection limit of 96.0 mg L-1) and ultraviolet spectrometry after reacting with alizarin (difficult to perform in colored solutions). The accuracy of the IC method was established in the linear range of 1.0-15.0 mg L-1 and a linear correlation was found with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998. The recoveries of fosfomycin from industrial pharmaceutical wastewater at spiking concentrations of 2.0, 5.0 and 8.0 mg L-1 ranged from 81.91 to 94.74%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) from 1 to 4%. The recoveries of effluent from a sequencing batch reactor treated fosfomycin with activated sludge at spiking concentrations of 5.0, 8.0, 10.0 mg L-1 ranging from 98.25 to 99.91%, with a RSD from 1 to 2%. The developed IC procedure provided a rapid, reliable and sensitive method for the determination of fosfomycin concentration in industrial pharmaceutical wastewater and samples containing complex components.

AB Pharmaceutical residues, which pass naturally through the human body into sewage, are in many cases virtually unaffected by conventional wastewater treatment. Accumulated in the environment, however, they can significantly impact aquatic life. The present study indicates that many pharmaceutical residues found in wastewater can be removed with activated carbon in a cost-efficient system that delivers higher resource utilisation and security than other carbon systems. The experiment revealed a substantial separation of the analysed compounds, notwithstanding their relatively high solubility in water and dissimilar chemical structures. This implies that beds of activated carbon may be a competitive alternative to treatment with ozone. The effluent water used for the tests, performed over 20 months, originated from Stockholm's largest sewage treatment plant. Passing through a number of different filters with activated carbon removed 90-98% of the pharmaceutical residues from the water. This paper describes pilot-scale tests performed by IVL and the implications for an actual treatment plant that has to treat up to several thousand litres of wastewater per second. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages and costs of the method are discussed. This includes, for example, the clogging of carbon filters and the associated hydraulic capacity limits of the activated carbon.

AB Namibia is a semi-arid to arid country and has most of its surface water in dams built on ephemeral rivers. Whilst water quality is often measured in terms of bacterial contamination and general physico-chemical characteristics, this study extends water quality assessment to include steroid hormone presence and potential physiological toxicity. This is the first study to determine these parameters in dams in Namibia at various stages of the seasons. Seven bioassays were used to determine oestradiol (E-2), oestrone (E-1) and testosterone (T) concentrations, as well as neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity, in water sampled during 2010 and 2011. Oestradiol and E-1 concentrations of up to 7.2 pg ml(-1) and 7.6 pg ml(-1), respectively, were recorded. Testosterone concentrations measured up to 19 pg ml(-1). No cytotoxic effects were detected, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assays indicated low neurotoxic effects in Goreangab Dam (18% AChE inhibition) and no neurotoxic effects in other samples. The immune system biomarker interleukin-6 was high in all samples (457 pg ml(-1); SD 54), with interleukin-10 being high only at Avis (46 pg ml(-1)), Goreangab (74 pg ml(-1)) and Swakoppoort (81 pg ml(-1)) dams. The results suggest that water from Goreangab and Swakoppoort dams may have the potential to modulate endocrine systems, and shows physiological toxicity.

AB Due to the very limited number of studies dealing with the chemical composition of industrial wastewaters, many industrial organic contaminants still escape our view and consequently also our control. We present here the chemical characterization of wastewaters from different units of a chemical complex, thereby contributing to the characterization of industrial pollution sources. The chemicals produced in the investigated complex are widely and intensively used and the synthesis processes are common and applied worldwide. The chemical composition of untreated and treated wastewaters from the chemical complex was investigated by applying a non- target screening which allowed for the identification of 39 organic contaminants. According to their application most of them belonged to four groups: ( i) unspecific educts or intermediates of industrial syntheses, ( ii) chemicals for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, ( iii) educts for the synthesis of polymers and resins, and ( iv) compounds known as typical constituents of municipal sewage. A number of halogenated compounds with unknown toxicity and with very high molecular diversity belonged to the second group. Although these compounds were completely removed or degraded during wastewater treatment, they could be useful as " alarm indicators" for industrial accidents in pharmaceutical manufacturing units or for malfunctions of wastewater treatment plants. Three potential branch- specific indicators for polymer manufacturing were found in the outflow of the complex. Among all compounds, bisphenol A, which was present in the leachate water of the on- site waste deposit, occurred in the highest concentrations of up to 20 000 mg L-1. The comparison of contaminant loads in the inflow and outflow of the on- site wastewater treatment facility showed that most contaminants were completely or at least significantly removed or degraded during the treatment, except two alkylthiols, which were enriched during the treatment process. The chemical composition of the inflow samples showed a very heterogenic composition and strongly varied, reflecting that large scale industrial synthesis is carried out in batches. The outflow contained mainly unspecific chlorinated educts or intermediates of industrial syntheses as well as compounds which are known as typical constituents of municipal wastewaters.

AB Due to a widespread usage and a lack of biodegradability, Synthetic Musk Compounds (SMC) can be found as ubiquitous environmental pollutants, which enter the environment especially via domestic wastewater. We investigated the occurrence and fate of six Polycyclic and two Nitro Musk Compounds in water and sediment samples from 13 locations along the river Saale in the municipal area of Halle (Saale), Germany on a monthly basis for one year. Sample analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and Galaxolide (R) (HHCB) was by far the most abundant analyte in all water samples. The remaining substances could be detected at least once, but mostly in concentrations below their respective Limits of Quantification. Highest concentrations for all detected compounds were determined in final effluent of the local sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on statistical analysis of the data obtained, a second, much smaller emission source could be identified in the examined area. In sediment samples five out of eight analytes could be detected. The analyte contents were very variable, depending on the sediment's character.

AB Hematological studies were carried out to investigate the possible deleterious effects of pharmaceutical wastewater according to the circadian dosing-time on albino mice. Pharmaceutical wastewater of 10 ml/kg was injected to different groups of animals by i.p. route at two different circadian stages 9 and 17 h after light onset, i.e. HALO corresponding, respectively, to times of best tolerance and maximum toxicity. The samples were measured for changes in the hematological parameters, such as the red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT), the hemoglobin concentration (Hb), and the erythrocyte indices: the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at 17 HALO induced a maximum decrease in RBC cells (-29.84% vs. -17.6% at 9 HALO) and in Hb concentration (-27% vs. -20% at 9 HALO). However, administration of pharmaceutical wastewater at 17HALO induced a maximum increase in MCV value (+37.26% vs. +16%. at 9 HALO) and PLT twofold higher than the control vs. only +18% at 9 HALO. Wastewater treatment at 9 and 17HALO resulted in a slight decrease (approximate to -5%) in hematocrit percentage, but not statistically significant. WBC cells were reduced significantly (p < 0.01) by -53.8% in mice treated at 9 HALO and were increased significantly (p < 0.01) by +21% in mice treated at 17HALO compared to control. The administration of pharmaceutical wastewater induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in PLT counts at 9 HALO (+18%). While the rate of PLT was increased twofold in mice treated at 17 HALO. The data indicate that the pharmaceutical wastewater-induced hematological toxicity was higher, when it is administered in the middle of the dark span coinciding with time of maximum lethality and ataxia.

AB Veterinary antibiotics such as sulfonamides were detected in the environment from animal excreta in soils, contaminating soil surface and then groundwaters by percolation. The contaminated waters can enter in this way into drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). On the other hand, direct wastewaters from humans or animals or pharmaceutical industries disposals are discharged in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). These water and wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove highly polar micropollutants like antibiotics. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange constitutes a promising technique for its low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This work studies the removal of sulfamethazine (SMZ). The SMZ retention capacity of an anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP500, was determined. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied and equilibrium constants and diffusivity values were obtained using different models. Load and elution breakthrough curves were plotted to evaluate ion exchange operation in a fixed bed column. In the elution step, 100% SMZ was recovered in all cycles and could be concentrated up to twelve times, thus facilitating its final treatment or removal. Load and elution breakthrough curves were simulated using a fixed bed model in which axial dispersion was considered the parameter model fit.

AB The occurrence of diclofenac (DCF) as an emerging pollutant in surface waters and drinking water has been attributed to elevated global consumption and the inability of sewage treatment plants to remove DCF. In this study, DCF spiked drinking water and river water was subjected to photolysis and TiO2 photocatalytic treatments in a circulating laboratory-scale (immersion-well) and a demonstration-scale loop reactor (Laboclean). The operational parameters for the immersion-well reactor were optimised as follows: TiO2 P25 loading, 0.1 g L-1; natural pH, 6.2; initial concentration, 30 mg L-1; water type, distilled water. Complete DCF removal was realised within 15 min under the optimised conditions using the immersion-well reactor. Sunlight-mediated photochemical degradation required a prolonged exposure period of up to 360 min for complete DCF removal. DCF in distilled and drinking water was efficiently degraded in the larger Laboclean reactor. Differences were, however, observed based on their pseudo-first-order rate constants, which implies that the water matrix has an effect on the degradation rate. Six major photoproducts, 2-(8-chloro-9H-carbazol-1-yl) acetic acid, 2-(8-hydroxy-9H-carbazol-1-yl) acetic acid, 2,6-dichloro-N-o-tolylbenzenamine, 2-(phenylamino) benzaldehyde, 1-chloromethyl-9H-carbazole and 1-methyl-9H-carbazole, generated from TiO2 photocatalysis of DCF were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). This work has shown that photocatalytic degradation kinetics of DCF are dependent on both the geometry of the photoreactor and the nature of the water matrices.

AB The growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to public health has raised interest in the proper treatment of discharged pharmaceutical wastewater before entering surface waters. In this study, adsorption was highlighted as a low cost and effective pathway to remove amoxicillin and ampicillin from aqueous solutions. Montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and myristyltrimethylammonium (MTA)-intercalated montmorillonite (O-MMT) were employed as the adsorbing solids. Static adsorption experiments were performed at three temperatures (303.15 K, 313.15 K and 323.15 K) for single antibiotic systems. The adsorption isotherm curves at all temperatures exhibited an L2-type isotherm. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were applied to analyze single adsorption isotherm data. The maximum sorption capacity of 0.124-0.133 mmol g(-1) for amoxicillin and 0.143-0.157 mmol g(-1) for ampicillin was estimated for O-MMT sorbent from Langmuir fitting. A modified extended-Langmuir model with the inclusion of surface coverage (theta) was proposed for analysis of binary adsorption isotherm data. The fitness of the modified extended-Langmuir model was superior to the original model. Batch adsorption tests on real pharmaceutical wastewater demonstrated the feasibility of the O-MMT sorbent for practical applications.

Because lamotrigine is a weak base (pK(a) = 5.7) that appears in two protonation states in natural waters, this study examined the direct photodegradation of lamotrigine (11.4 to 12.0 mg L-1) in simulated sunlight using liquid chromatography-UV diode array detection and buffered aqueous solutions at pH 3.3, 5.3, and 7.7. Lamotrigine's half-life varied little (100 + 3 to 112 + 2 h) with solution pH, but its specific light absorption rate was 12 times higher, and its reaction quantum yield was 13 times lower, at pH 7.7 versus pH 3.3. In the estimated midday, midsummer sunlight in Denver, CO, USA (latitude 39.8617 degrees N), lamotrigine's estimated photodegradation rate was more than twice as fast at pH 7.7 versus pH 3.3. Lamotrigine's photoproducts were detected by liquid chromatography-UV diode array detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Solution pH was shown to affect the identities and relative abundances of lamotrigine's photoproducts. Some photoproducts appeared only in solutions containing protonated lamotrigine, and others appeared only in solutions containing neutral lamotrigine. As a result, different reaction mechanisms were proposed. Finally, lamotrigine's reaction quantum yield (2.51 +/- 0.07 x 10(-5) mol einstein(-1) at pH 7.7) and other results suggested that lamotrigine and three photoproducts are approximately as resistant to direct photodegradation as carbamazepine, a frequently detected pharmaceutical in surface waters.

AB A double membrane system combining a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a nanofiltration (NF) membrane at the pilot scale was tested to treat real antibiotic wastewater at a pharmaceutical company in Wuxi (China). The water yield of the pilot system reached over 92 +/- 5.6% through recycling the NF concentrate to the MBR tank. Results showed that the pilot scale system operated in good conditions throughout the entire experiment period and obtained excellent water quality in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon were stable at 35 and 5.7 mg/L, respectively. The antibiotic removal rates of both spiramycin (SPM) and new spiramycin in wastewater were over 95%. Organics analysis results showed that the main organics in the biological effluent were proteins, soluble microbial by-product-like, fulvic acid-like and humic-like substances. These organics could be perfectly rejected by the NF membrane. Most of the organics could be removed through recycling NF concentrate to the MBR tank and only a small part was discharged with NF concentrate and permeate.

AB 3D mesoporous BiOBr microspheres via a one-step solvothermal process without templates were synthesized. The as-synthesized material was characterized by XRD, XPS, FESEM, TEM, UV-Vis and nitrogen adsorption techniques. The photodegradation behavior of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous BiOBr suspension was investigated under simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared 3D mesoporous BiOBr microspheres was excellent. IBP photodegradation intermediates were detected by GC/MS analyses, and a detailed reaction pathway was proposed. Luminous bacteria (Vibrio qinghaiensis) toxicity evaluation showed the decrease of the toxicity of the photodegradation intermediates. Based on the results, 3D BiOBr could be a promising catalyst on irradiation by visible light, and even under sunlight.

AB The present study was under taken to investigate the occurrence of ofloxacin in hospital wastewater, municipal wastewater and in river; water receiving the sewage.; along with the assessment of antibiotic resistant Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhi) in these-waters. Transfer of antibiotic resistance between two different strains of bacteria was also studied. Untreated sewage from the three hospitals (Mayo, Services and Jinnah) directly entering into municipal wastewater and ultimately flows into the river Ravi without any prior treatment. The concentration of ofloxacin in wastewater of the three hospitals was ranged between 10.69 to 30.55 mu g mL(-1). However, before mixing of the hospital wastewater, concentration of ofloxacin in the three municipal wastewater drains (receiving the wastewater) was ranged between 0.26 to 0.43 mu g mL(-1). Downstream to the hospitals, increase in concentration was observed and concentration was ranged between 0.54 to 1.29 mu g mL(-1). The river water was not contaminated with ofloxacin upstream to the city, while a concentration of the antibiotic down-stream to the city was 0.067 mu g mL(-1). All the water samples collected from hospital and municipal wastewater drains were contaminated with S. typhi. It was noted that hospital isolates were more resistant (50%) to ofloxacin as compare to municipal wastewater isolates (16.7%). No S. typhi was-detected from the river water before entering first municipal wastewater drain from the city. Downstream to first municipal: wastewater drain:S. typhi were detected and:33% of them were resistant to ofloxacin. The bacterial isolates isolated from river water downstream to the city were 100% resistant-to the antibiotic: The results of co-culture of ofloxacin resistant S. typhi and ofloxacin sensitive Escherichia coli revealed that the resistant S. typhi were able to transfer the antibiotic resistance to another species.

AB Within the last decade, reproductive abnormalities have been discovered in wild amphibian populations of multiple species and in a variety of regions in North America. Predominantly, these field studies have focused on agricultural landscapes. In this study, we worked in suburban environments based on preliminary evidence showing that amphibian populations can display surprisingly high frequencies of reproductive deformities, including intersex traits. Here, we report results from 28 suburban ponds located near onsite septic systems as well as those located in sewered neighborhoods. Caffeine, an indicator of domestic wastewater contamination, was detected in more than 70% of all ponds; prevalence of contamination was indistinguishable for ponds in sewered neighborhoods and those served by onsite septic systems. Among green frogs (Rana (=Lithobates) clamitans) collected from the same ponds, intersex was detected in each population; on average, one male in five showed evidence of intersex. This frequency was insensitive to wastewater treatment mode. Given prior findings that intersex is absent or rare in less developed landscapes, our results suggest that domestic wastewater contamination in suburban contexts may be more widespread than is generally appreciated and should be investigated as a contributor to intersex in wild amphibians. This hypothesis is consistent with abundant prior research on wild riverine and estuarine fish populations associating reproductive deformities with wastewater exposure.

AB The degradation of chlortetracycline in synthetic solution and in municipal effluent was investigated using a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process under visible irradiation. The N-doped TiO2 used as photoanode with 3.4 at.% of nitrogen content was prepared by means of a radiofrequency magnetron sputtering (RF-MS) process. Under visible irradiation, higher photoelectrocatalytic removal efficiency of CTC was recorded using N-doped TiO2 compared to the conventional electrochemical oxidation, direct photolysis and photocatalysis processes. The photoelectrocataIytic process operated at 0.6 A of current intensity during 180 min of treatment time promotes the degradation of 99.1 +/- 0.1% of CTC. Under these conditions, removal rates of 85.4 +/- 3.6%, 87.4 +/- 3.1% and 55.7 +/- 2.9% of TOC, TN and NH4+ have been recorded. During the treatment, CTC was mainly transformed into CO2 and H2O. The process was also found to be effective in removing indicator of pathogens such as fecal coliform (log-inactivation was higher than 1.2 units). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence and behavior of six antiviral pharmaceuticals (acyclovir, ganciclovir, oseltamivir, ribavirin, stavudine and zidovudine) and one active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate were investigated in wastewater, landfill leachate, river water, reservoir and well water in the vicinity of municipal landfills in the Pearl River Delta, China. Acyclovir was the only antiviral detected in the wastewater at 177-406 (mean = 238) and 114-205 (mean = 154) ng L-1 in the influent and final effluent, respectively. Aerobic biodegradation appeared to be the main process for the elimination of acyclovir in the wastewater. Acyclovir was also the only antiviral quantitatively detected in the Pearl River and its tributaries, with a maximum concentration up to 113 ng L-1. Treated wastewater was a major source of acyclovir in the rivers. The highest concentration of acyclovir was observed in winter in the river water and the dilution effect by precipitation was suggested to be the dominant factor impacting the seasonal pattern of acydovir in the rivers. No antivirals were quantitatively detected in the well water whereas acyclovir was frequently detected in the reservoirs at a maximal concentration of 33.6 ng L-1 in the vicinity of the municipal landfills. However, source identification and fate of acyclovir in the reservoirs pend on further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative understanding of effluent quality of decentralized on-site wastewater treatment systems, particularly for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), remains less understood than effluent quality from centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants. Using a novel experimental facility with common influent wastewater, effluent water quality from a decentralized advanced aerobic treatment system (ATS) and a typical septic treatment system (STS) coupled to a subsurface flow constructed wetland (WET) were compared to effluent from a centralized municipal treatment plant (MTP). The STS did not include soil treatment, which may represent a system not functioning properly. Occurrence and discharge of a range of CECs were examined using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry during fall and winter seasons. Conventional parameters, including total suspended solids, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand and nutrients were also evaluated from each treatment system. Water quality of these effluents was further examined using a therapeutic hazard modeling approach. Of 19 CECs targeted for study, the benzodiazepine pharmaceutical diazepam was the only CEC not detected in all wastewater influent and effluent samples over two sampling seasons. Diphenhydramine, codeine, diltiazem, atenolol, and diclofenac exhibited significant (p < 0.05) seasonal differences in wastewater influent concentrations. Removal of CECs by these wastewater treatment systems was generally not influenced by season. However, significant differences (p < 0.05) for a range of water quality indicators were observed among the various treatment technologies. For example, removal of most CECs by ATS was generally comparable to MW. Lowest removal of most CECs was observed for STS; however, removal was improved when coupling the STS to a WET. Across the treatment systems examined, the majority of pharmaceuticals observed in on-site and municipal effluent discharges were predicted to potentially present therapeutic hazards to fish.

AB The Mediterranean wetlands are unique in biological diversity and provide multiple benefits, constituting a great water reserve for the planet and producing biomass and nutrients for the trophic chain. However, the increasing human impact and socio-economic development in recent decades have caused important losses in these ecosystems. This work was carried out in the Natural Park of L'Albufera (Valencia, Spain), which includes a coastal lagoon, marshlands, dunes and pinewoods, surrounded by rice fields and orchard in its non-urbanized part. Despite this great ecological value, it suffers impacts derived from the high human and industrial occupation and the hydrological contributions of the connected irrigation systems. The study focused on the development of a combined methodology, based on environmental forensics principles, with the aim of identifying the presence, flow paths and spatial distribution of illicit drugs entering the Natural Park. It is organized around two major procedures: analysis of 16 water samples and application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) integrating different sources and data formats, as analysis of 14 drugs of abuse by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry techniques, and social and environmental data in either GIS layers or tabular digital formats. Results show that, at present, most analyzed drugs have been identified in all sample points. Besides the population distribution pattern, the traditional irrigation system connected to sewage treatment plant (STP) locations is the way by which illicit substances are introduced into the Natural Park waters.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater from a large number of manufacturing units is extremely contaminated by ciprofloxacin (CIP), an antibiotic drug. In this work, aqueous CIP solution was treated by Fenton oxidation (FO). The effects of typical process parameters on drug mineralization have been reported. The optimal Fe2+/H2O2 molar ratio of 0.125 and pH of 3.5 were determined with 15 mg L-1 initial CIP at 25 degrees C temperature. Maximum CIP, COD and TOC removal of 74.4, 47.1 and 37.9% were obtained under the optimal conditions. The mean oxidation number of carbon determined in terms of COD and TOC values was in accordance with that from the oxidation number of individual carbon atom. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals was measured using the N, N-dimethyl phenyl hydrazine method using dimethyl sulphoxide as a probe. Thirteen fragments appeared in the mass spectra and the proposed mechanism explored the routes of daughter ion formation. The cleavage of the piperazine ring was more effective in CIP oxidation due to high nucleophilic character of lone pair of electrons present on the nitrogen atom. A simple 2nd order kinetic model was proposed for the oxidation of CIP and degradation products (DPs) with respect to OH concentration. The rate constants of 3.13 x 10(3), 4.89 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) were estimated for CIP and DPs. The initial concentration of OHc was found to be 11.67 mu M.

AB Effects of copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) on the adsorption of sulfathiazole (STZ) and tylosin (T) to peat and soil were investigated using a batch equilibration method. Results show that Cu suppressed STZ adsorption onto peat and soil at pH < 5.0 because of the electrostatic competition, while increased STZ adsorption at pH > 5.0 due to the formation of STZ Cu complexes and/or Cu bridge. In contrast, Al only decreased STZ adsorption at pH < 6.0, and exerted slight effect on STZ adsorption at >6.0. As for T, both Cu and Al suppressed its adsorption over the entire pH range owing to three reasons: 1) electrostatic competition between Cu/Al and T+; 2) Cu/Al adsorption made the soil and peat surface less negatively charged, which was unfavorable for T+ adsorption; 3) the shrunken pore size of peat and soil retarded the diffusion of large-sized T into these pores.

AB The occurrence of triclosan (TCS), a general purpose antibacterial agent contained in numerous consumer and personal-care products, in the aquatic environment is well known. To a lesser degree, the formation of chlorinated and brominated derivatives of TCS during the chlorination of the antibacterial has also been reported. Presumably due to the lack of authentic standards, very few reports have been published on the levels of these halogenated TCSs in the environment. For this purpose, we have synthesized six selected halogenated derivatives of TCS, namely, 3-Cl-, 5-Cl-, 3,5-Cl-2-, 3-Br-, 5-Br-, and 3,5-Br-2- TCSs, with supporting H-1-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) data for their structural assignments. Using these model compounds together with sensitive analytical methods, we were able to identify and quantify the above compounds together with their precursor compound TCS in Canadian municipal wastewater and biosolid samples for the first time. While detected in all influent (range from 1.4 to 24.1 ng L-1) and biosolid (range from 7.7 to 274 ng g(-1)) samples, the concentrations of these chlorinated TCS were generally from 100- to 1,000-fold lower than TCS in the same sample. Even lower levels (< 20 ng/g in 85 % of the results) of brominated TCS were found in biosolids, and they were mostly undetected in sewage.

AB A method combining ultrasound-assisted emulsification-microextraction (USAEME) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for simultaneous determination of four acidic pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac, as well as four phenols, 4-octylphenol, 4-n-nonylphenol, bisphenol A, and triclosan in municipal wastewaters. Conditions of extraction and simultaneous derivatization were optimized with respect to such aspects as type and volume of extraction solvent, volume of derivatization reagent, kind and amount of buffering salt, location of the test tube in the ultrasonic bath, and extraction time. The average correlation coefficient of the calibration curves was 0.9946. The LOD/(LOQ) values in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 0.002-0.121/(0.005-0.403) mu g L-1 and 0.002-0.828/(0.006-2.758) mu g L-1, respectively. Quantitative recoveries (a parts per thousand yen94 %) and satisfactory precision (average RSD 8.2 %) were obtained. The optimized USAEME/GC-MS method was applied for determination of the considered pharmaceuticals and phenols in influents and treated effluents from nine Polish municipal wastewater treatment plants. The average concentration of acidic pharmaceuticals in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 0.06-551.96 mu g L-1 and 0.01-22.61 mu g L-1, respectively, while for phenols were in the range of 0.03-102.54 mu g L-1 and 0.02-10.84 mu g L-1, respectively. The removal efficiencies of the target compounds during purification process were between 84 and 99 %.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (E0C5) are frequently detected in urban surface water and the adjacent groundwater and are therefore an increasing problem for potable water quality. River bank filtration (RBF) is a beneficial pretreatment step to improve surface water quality for potable use. Removal is mainly caused by microbial degradation of micropollutants, while sorption retards the transport. The quantification of biodegradation and adsorption parameters for E0Cs at field scale is still scarce. In this study, the fate and behavior of a range of organic compounds during RBF were investigated using a two dimensional numerical flowand transport model. The data base used emanated from a project conducted in Berlin, Germany (NASRI: Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration). Oxygen isotope signatures and hydraulic head data were used for model calibration. Afterwards, twelve organic micropollutants were simulated with a reactive transport model. Three compounds (primidone, EDTA, and AMDOPH) showed conservative behavior (no biodegradation or sorption). For the nine remaining compounds (1.5 NDSA, AOX, AO', MTBE, carbamazepine, clindamycin, phenazone, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole), degradation and/or sorption was observed. 1.5 NDSA and AOX were not sorbed, but slightly degraded with model results for X = 2.25e-3 1/d and 2.4e-3 1/d. For AOI a X = 0.0106 1/d and R = 1 were identified. MTBE could be characterized well assuming R = 1 and a low 1st order degradation rate constant (X = 0.0085 1/d). Carbamazepine degraded with a half life time of about 66 days after a threshold value of 0.2-0.3 iig/L was exceeded and retarded slightly (R = 1.7). Breakthrough curves of clindamycin, phenazone, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole could be fitted less well, probably due to the dependency of degradation on temperature and redox conditions, which are highly transient at the RBF site. Conditions range from oxic to anoxic (up to iron-reducing), with the oxic and denitrifying zones moving spatially back and forth over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reduction in the concentration of pharmaceuticals present in wastewater has been attributed to sorption and biodegradation. However, the contribution of these processes has not been fully characterized. Previous studies have reported varying effects of solution pH and concentration on sorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in different absorbents including activated carbon waste and zeolites. Here we report the pH and concentration effect on sorption of two common anti-inflammatory drugs, viz., ibuprofen and naproxen, on suspended solids in simulated domestic wastewater (SDWW). Batch experiments were conducted at various pH levels, viz., 3.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, and concentration, viz., 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mu g L-1. The results showed that both ibuprofen and naproxen have higher sorption at lower pH values and at higher concentration. It was found that the data were comparatively well fitted to the Redlich-Peterson isotherm. The study revealed that both ibuprofen and naproxen can be removed from wastewater by the sorption process achieved by lowering the pH to values lower than pK(a) and maintaining the concentration at an optimal value.

AB The presence of the antimicrobials triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS)in Fountain Creek, a wastewater-dominated stream, and the Arkansas River, Colorado, USA was measured in the surface water, suspended sediments, and bed sediments during spring runoff (high flow) and summer base flow (low flow) conditions. Fountain Creak is a tributary of the Arkansas River. Passive polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used along with active sampling (water grab samples) to measure and TCS concentrations in these surface waters. The concentration of TCC and TCS, based on POCIS measurements, ranged from 4.5 to 47.3 ng/L and 3.9 to 28.3 ng/L, respectively, at the five sample sites monitored in this study under both flow conditions. The range of concentrations of TCC and TCS in suspended sediments was 0.7-57.3 ng/g and 0.7-13.3 ng/g, respectively, and was closely tied to the quantity of organic carbon in the suspended sediment, which ranged from 1.6 to 14.5%. The quantity of organic carbon in suspended sediment during the summer base flow was influenced by runoff from the burn area of a large forest fire that occurred between the two sampling periods. The primary transport mechanism of TCC and TCS in these surface waters was in the dissolved phase, with 64-99% of TCC and 68-99% of TCS transported in the dissolved phase. The total amount of TCS and TCC in bed-sediments was relatively low, with the maximum amount at any one site being 0.38 +/- 0.15 ng/g TCS and 4.09 +/- 5.26 ng/g TCC. Fountain Creek contributed up to 76% and 69% of the TCC and TCS, respectively, that is transported directly below its confluence with Arkansas River. Fountain Creek drained approximately 3.0 g/day TCS (in spring), 2.9 g/day TCS (in summer) and 1.9 g/day TCC (in spring), 2.0 g/day TCC (in summer) into the Arkansas River, which suggests consistent input of TCC and TCS into Fountain Creek, such as in discharge of treated wastewater that is independent of changing creek flow conditions.

AB This study investigates the degradation of the beta-blockers in hospital wastewater by direct ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation with a focus on measurements at different initial pHs and Fe2+ concentrations, and the determination of kinetic constants. The results showed that these 'emerging contaminants' were completely degraded, when the removal rate of organic matter reached 30.6% and 49.1% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. Likewise, the aromaticity removal rates were 63.4% and 77.9% for zonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. The experimental design showed that pH was the variable which had the greatest effect on the Fe2+/ozonation. The kinetic constants of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol degradation by direct ozonation complied with pseudo-first-order conditions, while Fe2+/ozonation was suited to a biphasic degradation model. The k(obs) tended to rise when the pH increases; propranolol showed high k(obs), which can be attributed to the naphthalene group (an electron-rich moiety). The identification of degradation products was carried out in aqueous solution using HPLC-MS2, followed by a suggestion of degradation pathways by means of ozonation. The degradation products proved to be dependent on the initial pH, and followed pathways that are based on direct ozonolysis and free radicals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The stability of five illicit drug markers in wastewater was tested under different sewer conditions using laboratory-scale sewer reactors. Wastewater was spiked with deuterium labelled isotopes of cocaine, benzoyl ecgonine, methamphetamine, MDMA and 6-acetyl morphine to avoid interference from the native isotopes already present in the wastewater matrix. The sewer reactors were operated at 20 degrees C and pH 7.5, and wastewater was sampled at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h to measure the transformation/degradation of these marker compounds. The results showed that while methamphetamine, MDMA and benzoyl ecgonine were stable in the sewer reactors, cocaine and 6-acetyl morphine degraded quickly. Their degradation rates are significantly higher than the values reportedly measured in wastewater alone (without biofilms). All the degradation processes followed first order kinetics. Benzoyl ecgonine and morphine were also formed from the degradation of cocaine and 6-acetyl morphine, respectively, with stable formation rates throughout the test. These findings suggest that, in sewage epidemiology, it is essential to have relevant information of the sewer system (i.e. type of sewer, hydraulic retention time) in order to accurately back-estimate the consumption of illicit drugs. More research is required to look into detailed sewer conditions (e.g. temperature, pH and ratio of biofilm area to wastewater volume among others) to identify their effects on the fate of illicit drug markers in sewer systems.

AB We investigated the adsorption and decomposition of sulfamethazine (SMT), which is used as a synthetic antibacterial agent and discharged into environmental water, using high-silica Y-type zeolite (HSZ-385), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and TiO2-zeolite composites. By using ultrapure water and secondary effluent as solvents, we prepared SMT solutions (10 mu g/L and 10 mg/L) and used them for adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition experiments. When HSZ-385 was used as an adsorbent, rapid adsorption of SMT in the secondary effluent was confirmed, and the adsorption reached equilibrium within 10 min. The photocatalytic decomposition rate using TiO2 in the secondary effluent was lower than that in ultrapure water, and we clarified the inhibitory effect of ions and organic matter contained in the secondary effluent on the reaction. We synthesized TiO2-zeolite composites and applied them to the removal of SMT. During the treatment of 10 mu g/L SMT in the secondary effluent using the composites, 76 % and more than 99 % of the SMT were decomposed within 2 and 4 h by photocatalysis. The SMT was selectively adsorbed onto high-silica Y-type zeolite in the composites. Resultantly, the inhibitory effect of the coexisting materials was reduced, and the composites could remove SMT more effectively compared with TiO2 alone in the secondary effluent.

AB The removal of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a tertiary treatment system was studied. The ecological risks of effluents from both secondary and tertiary treatment systems as well as excess sludge were evaluated. Primary treatment and ultraviolet light disinfection showed limited ability to remove most selected PPCPs. The combination of an anaerobic process and triple-oxidation ditches can eliminate DEET better than the anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process. Adsorption to sludge played a key role in the removal of triclocarban. Multistage constructed wetlands as a tertiary treatment efficiently removed caffeine and ibuprofen from wastewater and could decrease the risk of partial selected PPCPs. Selected PPCPs residues in excess sludge generally produced higher risks to the ecological environment than effluents from WWTPs.

AB We determined whether or not the chloramination or ozonation of amines and hydrazines listed in Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) results in the formation of N-nitrosamines when reacted in secondary wastewater effluent. We selected 12 primary, 2 secondary, 2 tertiary amines and 3 hydrazines from the PRTRs of Japan, the USA, and Korea. In this study, based on the assumption that there is a production of N-nitrosamines by not only the original selected amines and hydrazines but also-the intermediate products in case of chloramination and ozonation, it was examined whether precursors were identified by selected amines and hydrazines based on the gap of the N-nitrosamines formation potential between day 0 and day 10 rather than analyzing the contribution depending on the concentration of selected amines and hydrazines. Many of the primary amines (notably 2,6-xylidine) and all of the secondary and tertiary amines produced N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by chloramination. Furthermore, the primary amines 2,6-xylidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4-aminoazobenzene, p-chloroaniline, and p-cresidine produced more NDMA than did the secondary amines. The secondary amines produced mainly NDMA. Ozonation produced NDMA only from the hydrazine 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, and at a higher concentration than by chloramination. We identified 2,6-xylidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4-aminoazobenzene, p-chloroaniline, p-cresidine, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, diethylamine, 4,4'-methylenebis(N,N-dimethyl)benzenamine, and chinomethionat as warranting further study.

AB The distribution coefficient (K-D) for the human drug carbamazepine was measured using a non-equilibrium technique. Repacked soil columns were prepared using an Airport silt loam (Typic Natrustalf) with an average organic matter content of 2.45%. Carbamazepine solutions were then leached through the columns at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mL min(-1) representing average linear velocities of 1.8, 3.5 and 5.3 cm h(-1) respectively. Each flow rate was replicated three times and three carbamazepine pulses were applied to each column resulting in a total of 9 columns with 27 total carbamazepine pulses. Breakthrough curves were used to determine K-D using the parameter fitting software CXTFIT. Results indicate that as flow rate decreased from 5.3 to 1.8 cm h(-1), K-D increased an average of 21%. Additionally, K-D determined by column leaching (14.7-22.7 L kg(-1)) was greater than K-D determined by a 2 h batch equilibrium adsorption (12.6 L kg(-1)). Based on these K-D's carbamazepine would be generally characterized as non-mobile in the soil investigated. However, repeated carbamazepine applications resulted in an average 22% decrease in K-D between the first and third applications. Decreasing K-D is attributed to differences in sorption site kinetics and carbamazepine residence time in contact with the soil. This would indicate that the repeated use of reclaimed wastewater at high application rates for long-term irrigation or groundwater recharge has the potential to lead to greater transport of carbamazepine than K-D determined by batch equilibrium would predict.

AB To examine effects of municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) on sentinel organisms, the authors deployed caged freshwater mussels (Lasmigona costata) in the Grand River (ON, Canada) upstream and downstream of an MWWE outfall. Passive sampling devices were deployed alongside caged mussels to confirm exposure. Biomarkers of xenobiotic biotransformation, oxidative stress, estrogenicity, and immunomodulation were investigated. Elevated concentrations of selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and a natural estrogen (estrone) were found at the downstream sites. Mussels caged downstream of the effluent for 2 wk showed minimal evidence of exposure, while those deployed for 4 wk exhibited significantly higher levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, demonstrating that MWWE-exposed mussels exhibit increased activity in xenobiotic conjugation and oxidative stress. With respect to immune responses, a significant increase in plasma lysozyme activity and hemocyte viability was observed in MWWE-exposed mussels. Vitellogenin (vtg)-like protein in male mussels showed a trend toward induction after 4 wk of deployment at the first downstream site, but mean levels were not significantly different. Discriminant function analysis indicated that mussels deployed for 4 wk upstream and downstream of the MWWE discharge could be discriminated on the basis of LPO, GST, plasma lysozyme, and vtg responses. The physiological stress observed in caged mussels indicates that wild mussels chronically exposed to MWWE in this ecosystem would also be negatively impacted. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:134-143.

AB The fabrication of novel ZnSnO3 hollow nanospheres/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid nanocomposite is reported for the first time. The nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile route, and were well characterized with the aid of XRD, FUR, SEM, TEM, BET, UV-vis, and PL techniques. Moreover, the synthesized nanocomposites were used as photocatalysts in the application of the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this study, ZnSnO3 hollow nanospheres showed high efficiency in photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. More interestingly, the photocatalytic activities of these nanospheres could be enhanced by coupling with RGO, where a large improvement (approx. 30.4% increase compared with pure ZnSnO3) in photodegradation of metronidazole was observed on the prepared ZnSnO3/RGO hybrid nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. This improvement might be attributed to the advanced adsorption efficiency of molecules and enhanced visible light absorption within the hybrid nanocomposites by the introduction of RGO. Such study might pave the way toward designing novel photocatalyst systems for efficient degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel graphite oxide/poly(acrylic acid) grafted chitosan nanocomposite (GO/CSA) was prepared and used as biosorbent for the removal of pharmaceutical compound (dorzolamide) from biomedical synthetic wastewaters. The performance was evaluated taking into account pH, kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption. GO/CSA presented higher adsorption capacity in comparison with the parent materials (graphite oxide and poly(acrylic acid) grafted chitosan). All adsorbents prepared were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and potentiometric titration. The surface features were also evaluated after the dorzolamide adsorption in order to derive the adsorption mechanism. It was suggested that the reactive groups of GO and CSA can interact with the amino groups of dorzolamide and mainly the abundance of carboxyl groups of GO/CSA composite was the main reason for its enhanced adsorption capacity.

AB A laboratory scale aerobic oxidation ditch combined with an anoxic reactor was conducted to treat wastewater from a chemical industrial park in Tianjin, China. The wastewater exhibited a low biodegradability, and the results of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that some recalcitrant organic components are present in the wastewater. Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal efficiency of over 90% was obtained. However, the removal efficiencies of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were below 16% and 15%, respectively. The addition of glucose to the anoxic reactor in the system increased the removal efficiencies of TN and COD to approximately 72% and 25.57%, respectively. Results of mass balance indicate that about 60% of the external carbon was consumed as electron donor for denitrification, while 40% was consumed as a substrate for co-metabolism. The optimal dose of added glucose was also investigated, which was determined at 0.35 to 1.20 (CODglucose:CODoriginal).

AB The occurrence and fate of six phthalates: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) were investigated as phthalates passed through three full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment processes, and ultimately into the recipient Songhua River water in Harbin (China). The six phthalates were detected in the majority of aqueous and solid samples, with DEHP being the most abundant compound. The overall removal efficiency of Sigma PAEs in the Cyclic Activated Sludge Technology (CAST) process was over 72%, while both the A/O and A/A/O processes achieved approximately 30% removal. The better performance of the CAST process relative to the Anoxic/Oxic (A/O) and Anaerobic/Anoxic/Oxic (A/A/O) processes was attributed to the indoor-conditions of the CAST plants, which effectively maintained the temperature of the treatment system. The fate of PAEs within two different types of WWTPs (CAST and A/A/O) were assessed qualitatively using mass balances. The results suggested that PAEs removal resulted from both biotransformation and adsorption, of which the former was particularly significant in the CAST process, while the latter was more significant in the A/A/O process. Substantial levels of several PAEs were detected in the Songhua River, especially downstream of the WWTPs, which means that the discharge from WWTPs has a strong impact on the water quality of the Songhua River during cold winter conditions.

AB The levels of 14 micropollutants including nine pharmaceuticals, two pesticides, and three endocrine disruptors were measured in a water treatment plant (WTP) in Seoul, Korea. Among the measured micropollutants, 12 (excluding atrazine,and triclocarban) were found in the influent and effluent from the WTP, at levels ranging from 2 to 482 ng L-1. The removal efficiencies of the detected micropollutants in the WTP ranged from 6% to 100%. Among them diclofenac, acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, and 2,4-D were effectively removed (>80%). Metoprolol was unlikely to be removed (6%) in the WTP process. Concentrations of acetaminophen, metoprolol, ibuprofen, and naproxen were higher in winter, while levels of herbicides of 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were higher in summer. Metoprolol was hardly removed in the water treatment process. Laboratory experiments showed that compounds with logK(ow) > 2.5 (especially bisphenol-A, 2,4-D, carbamazepine, triclocarban and 4-nonylphenol) were effectively removed by coagulation process, and adsorption effect increased in proportion with hydrophobicity of micropollutants and the turbidity of water. Sunlight photodegradation also effectively removed sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, which are photosensitizes. Chlorination was relatively not effective for the removal of micropollutants due to the lower chlorine dosage (2 mg L-1), lower contact time (1 h), and already lower levels of micropollutants at the chlorination stage at WTP. Our results imply that micropollutants during coagulation stage at WTP can be removed not only by coagulation itself, but also by adsorption to clay particle especially for high turbidity water, and by sunlight photodegradation in the areas open to the atmosphere.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants in the natural environment. Most studies of the environmental fate of these chemicals focus on their behavior in wastewater treatment processes and in sewage sludge. Little is known about their behavior in soils. In this study adsorption and biodegradation of four antidiabetic pharmaceuticals - glimepiride, glibenclamide, gliclazide and metformin - were examined in three natural soils. The sorption of sulfonylurea derivatives was high (higher than sulfonylurea herbicides for example), whereas metformin showed high mobility. Desorption rates were highest for metformin. Sorption isotherms in two of three soils fitted best to the Freundlich model. Despite their high affinity to for soil surfaces, biodegradation studies revealed that transformation of the drugs occurred. Biodegradation results were described by pseudo-first order kinetics with half-life values from 5 to over 120 d (under aerobic conditions) and indicate that none of the tested drugs can be classified as quickly biodegradable. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions was much slower; often degrading by less than 50% during time of the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial degradation is the most important process to remove organic pollutants in Waste Water Treatment Plants. Regarding chiral compounds this process is normally enantioselective and needs the suitable analytical methodology to follow the removal of both enantiomers in an accurate way. Thus, this paper describes the development and validation of an enantioselective High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (HPLC-FD) method for simultaneous analysis of fluoxetine (FLX) and norfluoxetine (NFLX) in wastewater effluents. Briefly, this method preconcentrated a small volume of wastewater samples (50 mL) on 500 mg Oasis MCX cartridges and used HPLC-FD with a vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase under reversed mode for analyses. The optimized mobile phase was EtOH/aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (92.5/7.5, v/v) at pH 6.8. The effect of EtOH percentage, buffer concentration, pH, column oven temperature and flow rate on chromatographic parameters was systematically investigated. The developed method was validated within the wastewater effluent used in microcosms laboratory assays. Linearity (R-2 > 0.99), selectivity and sensitivity were achieved in the range of 4.0-60 ng mL(-1) for enantiomers of FLX and 2.0-30 ng mL(-1) for enantiomers of NFLX. The limits of detection were between 0.8 and 2.0 ng mL(-1) and the limits of quantification were between 2.0 and 4.0 ng mL(-1) for both enantiomers of FLX and the enantiomers of its demethylated metabolite NFLX. The validated method was successfully applied and proved to be robust to follow the degradation of both enantiomers of FLX in wastewater samples, during 46 days. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To characterize a broad range of organic contaminants and their transformation products (TPs) as well as their loads, input pathways and fate in the water cycle, the Department of Environmental Chemistry (Uchem) at Eawag applies and develops high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) methods combined with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). In this article, the background and state-of-the-art of LC-HRMS/MS for detection of i) known targets, ii) suspected compounds like TPs, and iii) unknown emerging compounds are introduced briefly. Examples for each approach are taken from recent research projects conducted within the department. These include the detection of trace organic contaminants and their TPs in wastewater, pesticides and their TPs in surface water, identification of new TPs in laboratory degradation studies and ozonation experiments and finally the screening for unknown compounds in the catchment of the river Rhine.

AB In this study, the effects of some operational factors, such as pH value, nano-ZnO loading, UV-A irradiation time, and power of radiation on the degradation efficiency of metronidazole (MNZ) in aqueous solution were discussed through photocatalytic experiments using nano-ZnO as the photocatalyst. Results show that removal of metronidazole (MNZ) and COD has a direct correlation with power of UV-A lamp and irradiation time. MNZ solution (80 mg L-1) was rapidly removed by the irradiation of UV lamp OSRAM 125W high pressure within 180 min. In nano-ZnO/UV photocatalysis reactor, irradiation time and power of UV lamp have a great effect on metronidazole degradation. Statistical analysis (One-way ANOVA) has shown that the pH (in acedic and basic condition) and variation of nano-ZnO concentration has no significant effects on MNZ removal, COD, and BOD5/COD ratio. But the maximum degradation of MNZ occurred at pH 10 and 1.5 gL(-1) nano-ZnO. Maximum degradation of MNZ and COD was 96.55 and 95.42%, respectively. In addition, biodegradability improved from similar to 0 to 0.091 within 180 min.

AB Data allowing for a complete environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their photoderatives in the environment are still scarce. In the present study, in vitro toxicity and both bio-and photopersistence of various pharmaceuticals (aciclovir, allopurinol, cetirizine, cimetidine, fluconazole, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, phenytoin, primidone, ranitidine, sotalol, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane) as well as their phototransformation products were evaluated in order to fill data gaps and to help prioritise them for further testing. Twelve out of the fourteen compounds investigated were found to be neither readily nor inherently biodegradable in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development-biodegradability tests. The study further demonstrates that the photo-induced transformation of the pharmaceuticals was faster upon irradiation with a Hg lamp (UV light) than with a Xe lamp emitting a spectrum that mimics sunlight. Comparing the non-irradiated with the respective irradiated solutions, a higher acute and chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for the irradiated solutions of seven compounds (cetirizine, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, ranitidine, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane). No cyto- and genotoxic effects were found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their phototransformation products. This comparative study documents that phototransformation products can arise as a result of UV treatment of wastewater containing these pharmaceuticals. It further demonstrates that some phototransformation products may have a higher environmental risk potential than the respective parent compounds because some phototransformation products exhibited a higher bacterial toxicity.

AB Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are exogenous substances that cause adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, subsequent to the changes in endocrine function. Recent studies have shown that wastewater treatment plant effluents play an important role in the release of EDCs into aquatic environments. Therefore, in this study, influent and effluent samples from three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Istanbul were analysed for the presence of the principal EDCs. These chemicals include steroids and synthetic organic chemicals. Thus, the occurrence and fate of EDCs of great health concern were monitored at three WWTPs in Istanbul. Furthermore, these WWTPs are employing different treatment processes. Therefore, the EDC removal performances of different treatment regimes were also evaluated. Phytosterol was the most abundant EDC in the influent samples. Second group of compounds at high influent levels were alkyl phenols. Pesticide levels of all three WWTP influent samples were low. Pasakoy Advanced WWTP is more effective at eliminating EDCs. Kadikoy Primary WWTP exhibits the lowest EDC elimination efficiencies. To the best of our knowledge, this work comprises the first detailed report on the occurrence and behaviour of both natural and synthetic EDCs in WWTPs of Istanbul and Turkey. The steroid estrogen levels of this study are higher than the previously documented values, except the levels given for Gaobeidian WWTP in Beijing, China. This is attributed to higher population densities of Beijing and Istanbul and as well as to lower individual water consumption rates in the two cities.

AB Antibiotics consumption has increased worldwide, and their residues are frequently reported in aquatic environments. It is believed that antibiotics reach aquatic water bodies through sewage. Medicine consumed for healthcare practices are often released into sewage, and after sewage treatment plant, it reaches the receiving water bodies of lakes or rivers. In the present study, we determined the fate of some commonly used antibiotics in a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Delhi and the environmental concentration of these antibiotics in the Yamuna River, which receives the sewage and industrial effluent of Delhi. There are many reports on antibiotics occurrences in STP and river water worldwide, but monitoring data from the Indian subcontinent is sparse. Samples were taken from a STP and from six sampling sites on the Yamuna River. Several antibiotics were tested for using offline solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array analysis. Recoveries varied from 25.5-108.8 %. Ampicillin had the maximum concentration in wastewater influents (104.2 +/- 98.11 mu g l(-1)) and effluents (12.68 +/- 8.38 mu g l(-1)). The fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins had the lower concentrations. Treatment efficiencies varied between 55 and 99 %. Significant amounts of antibiotics were discharged in effluents and were detected in the receiving water body. The concentration of antibiotics in the Yamuna River varied from not detected to 13.75 mu g l(-1) (ampicillin) for the compounds investigated.

Based on automated substructure searches a list of 2160 suspected site-specific and documented water contaminants was reduced to those amenable to LC-HRMS. After searching chromatograms for exact masses of suspects, presumably false positive detections were stepwise excluded by retention time prediction, the evaluation of isotope patterns, ionization behavior, and HRMS/MS spectra. In nontarget analysis, peaks for identification were selected based on distinctive isotope patterns and intensity. The stepwise identification of nontarget compounds was automated by a plausibility check of molecular formulas using the Seven Golden Rules, an exclusion of compounds with presumably low commercial importance and an automated HRMS/MS evaluation. Six suspected and five nontarget chemicals were identified, of which two have not been previously reported as environmental pollutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial sweeteners are gaining acceptance as tracers of human wastewater in the environment. The 3 artificial sweeteners analyzed in this study were detected in leachate or leachate-impacted groundwater at levels comparable to those of untreated wastewater at 14 of 15 municipal landfill sites tested, including several closed for >50 years. Saccharin was the dominant sweetener in old (pre-1990) landfills, while newer landfills were dominated by saccharin and acesulfame (introduced 2 decades ago; dominant in wastewater). Cyclamate was also detected, but less frequently. A case study at one site illustrates the use of artificial sweeteners to identify a landfill-impacted groundwater plume discharging to a stream. The study results suggest that artificial sweeteners can be useful tracers for current and legacy landfill contamination, with relative abundances of the sweeteners potentially providing diagnostic ability to distinguish different landfills or landfill cells, including crude age-dating, and to distinguish landfill and wastewater sources.

AB We measured concentrations of 56 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in effluent samples from 50 large wastewater treatment plants across the US. Hydrochlorothiazide was found in every sample. Metoprolol, atenolol, and carbamazepine were found in over 90% of the samples. Valsartan had the highest concentration (5300 ng/L), and also had the highest average concentration (1600 ng/L) across all 50 samples. Estimates of potential risks to healthy human adults were greatest for six anti-hypertensive APIs (lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan, atenolol, enalaprilat, and metoprolol), but nevertheless suggest risks of exposure to individual APIs as well as their mixtures are generally very low. Estimates of potential risks to aquatic life were also low for most APIs, but suggest more detailed study of potential ecological impacts from four analytes (sertraline, propranolol, desmethylsertraline, and valsartan).

AB Pharmaceutical concentration data for Indian surface waters are currently scarce. Sewage often enters Indian rivers without prior treatment, and so previously reported environmental concentrations from regions with routinely implemented sewage treatment cannot simply be used to predict concentrations in Indian surface water. Improved knowledge of pharmaceutical concentrations in Indian waters would enable determination of potential risks posed to aquatic wildlife and human health in this region. The concentrations of five common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid) were determined in surface waters from 27 locations of the Kaveri, Vellar, and Tamiraparani Rivers in southern India. The samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by GC-MS. The measured concentrations of four of the five drugs in this reconnaissance were relatively similar to those reported elsewhere (ND-200 ng/l); however, acetylsalicylic acid, the most readily degradable of the investigated drugs, was found at all sites and at considerably higher concentrations (up to 660 ng/l) than reported in European surface waters. This is the first report on the occurrence of NSAIDs in Indian rivers. The finding of elevated concentrations of acetylsalicylic acid is most likely a result of direct discharges of untreated sewage. Therefore, readily degradable pharmaceuticals may present larger concern in regions without consistent sewage treatment. Based on measured environmental concentrations, the risks of direct toxicity to aquatic wildlife and of humans consuming the water are discussed.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are important sources of emerging contaminants at environmentally-relevant concentrations. In this study, water samples were collected from a river downstream of two WWTPs to identify practical tracers for tracking wastewater. The results of the study indicate elevated concentrations of Cl-, nutrients (NH3-N and NO2-), the artificial sweetener acesulfame-K (ACE-K), and the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ibuprofen (IBU), gemfibrozil (GEM), and naproxen (NAP) in the river close to the WWTPs that decreased with distance downstream. A correlation analysis using the Spearman Rank method showed that ACE-K, CBZ, GEM, NAP, and Cl- were strongly correlated with each other over a 31 km stretch of the river in the study area. The strong correlations of these target compounds indicate that the artificial sweetener ACE-K and the pharmaceuticals CBZ, GEM, and NAP can potentially be used as co-tracers to track wastewater.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a recalcitrant xenobiotic pharmaceutical pollutant highly stable in soil and wastewater during treatment. The biodegradation of CBZ using streptomycetes has been few studied up to now. Sixteen newly filamentous bacteria belong to genus Streptomyces spp. isolated from different Romanian soil samples and three strains from a collection of microorganisms (MIUG) were morphologically characterized, tested based on their resistance against CBZ toxicity and then selected as agents for bioremediation. Five Streptomyces spp. strains coded MIUG 4.88, MIUG 4.89, SNA, LP1 and LP2 showed CBZ tolerance at all of the tested concentrations, i.e. 0.05, 0.2, 1, 5 and 8 mg L-1. Two of these (MIUG 4.89 and SNA strains) were selected based on their resistance to target compound and were then assessed for CBZ biodegradation. The strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 showed an interesting efficiency for CBZ removal, with a yield of 35% when it was cultivated in submerged conditions on a minimal medium supplemented with 5 g L-1 glucose. This ability was linked to extracellular laccase production. These results are promising for the use of these filamentous bacteria as bioremediation agents.

AB The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is an invasive bivalve that has recently spread in Europe and currently represents a large portion of the aquatic biomass in specific areas. Because of the impacts that the species may have in invaded ecosystems, increased knowledge on the physiologic features of the species life-cycle under different environmental scenarios (e.g., contamination events) is critical to understand the dynamics of the invasion and resulting ecosystem imbalance. The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment has recently received great attention since high levels of contamination have been found, not only in sewage treatment plant effluents, but also in open waters. The present article reports toxicological biochemical effects of paracetamol to Corbicula fluminea following short- and long-term exposures. Oxidative stress parameters were specially focused namely catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and glutathione reductase (GRed). The effect of tested substances on lipid peroxidation was also investigated. Paracetamol did not induce alterations on CAT activity, caused a significant decrease of GSTs activity following short- and long-term exposure (LOEC values of 532.78 mg L-1 and 30.98 g L-1, respectively), and was responsible for a significant and dose-dependent decrease of GRed activity in short- and long-term exposures. These results indicate that exposure to paracetamol can provoke significant alterations on the cellular redox status of C. fluminea. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 29: 74-83, 2014.

AB A scientific advisory panel was convened by the State of California to recommend monitoring for chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic systems that receive discharge of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and stormwater runoff. The panel developed a risk-based screening framework that considered environmental sources and fate of CECs observed in receiving waters across the State. Using existing occurrence and risk threshold data in water, sediment, and biological tissue, the panel applied the framework to identify a priority list of CECs for initial monitoring in three representative receiving water scenarios. The initial screening list of 16 CECs identified by the panel included consumer and commercial chemicals, flame retardants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and natural hormones. The panel designed an iterative, phased strategy with interpretive guidelines that direct and update management actions commensurate with potential risk identified using the risk-based framework and monitoring data. Because of the ever-changing nature of chemical use, technology, and management practices, the panel offered recommendations to improve CEC monitoring, including development of bioanalytical screening methods whose responses integrate exposure to complex mixtures and that can be linked to higher-order effects; development or refinement of models that predict the input, fate, and effects of future chemicals; and filling of key data gaps on CEC occurrence and toxicity. Finally, the panel stressed the need for adaptive management, allowing for future review of, and if warranted, modifications to the strategy to incorporate the latest science available to the water resources community.

AB Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), such as the Fenton, photo-Fenton and H2O2/UV processes, have been investigated for the treatment of cosmetic wastewaters that were previously coagulated by FeCl3. The Photo-Fenton process at pH 3.0 with 1000/100 mg L-1 H2O2/Fe2+ was the most effective (74.0% Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal). The Fenton process with 1200/500 mg L-1 H2O2/Fe2+ achieved a COD removal of 72.0%, and the H2O2/UV process achieved a COD removal of 47.0%. Spreading the H2O2 doses over time to obtain optimal conditions did not improve COD removal. The kinetics of the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes may be described by the following equation: d[COD]/dt D = -a[COD] t(m) (t represents time and a and m are constants). The rate of COD removal by the H2O2/UV process may be described by a second-order reaction equation. Head Space, Solid-Phase MicroExtraction, Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) were used to identify 48 substances in precoagulated wastewater. Among these substances, 26 were fragrances. Under optimal AOP conditions, over 99% of the identified substances were removed in 120 min.

AB Antidepressants are a new kind of pollutants being increasingly found in wastewater. In this study, a fast and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the analysis of 24 antidepressant drugs and six of their metabolites in wastewater. This is the first time that the antidepressant residues in wastewater of Beijing (China) were systematically reported. A solid-phase extraction process was performed with 3 M cation disk, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements. The chromatographic separation and mass parameters were optimized in order to achieve suitable retention time and good resolution for analytes. All compounds were satisfactorily determined in one single injection within 20 min. The limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, and extraction recovery were validated. The LOQ for analytes were ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 ng/mL. The determination coefficients were more than 0.99 within the tested concentration range (0.1-25 ng/mL), and the recovery rate for each target compound was ranged from 81.2% to 118% at 1 ng/mL. This new developed method was successfully applied to analysis the samples collected from Beijing municipal wastewater treatment plants. At least ten target antidepressants were found in all samples and the highest mean concentration of desmethylvenlafaxin was up to 415.6 ng/L.

AB In the present work, an extensive study on the presence of eighteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Greece has been conducted. The study covered four sampling periods over 1-year, where samples (influents; effluents) from eight WWTPs of various cities in Greece were taken. All WWTPs investigated are equipped with conventional activated sludge treatment. A common pre-concentration step based on SPE was applied, followed by LC-UV/Vis-ESI-MS. Further confirmation of positive findings was accomplished by using LC coupled to a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The results showed the occurrence of all target compounds in the wastewater samples with concentrations up to 96.65 mu g/L. Paracetamol, caffeine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and salicylic acid were the dominant compounds, while tolfenamic acid, fenofibrate and simvastatin were the less frequently detected compounds with concentrations in effluents below the LOQ. The removal efficiencies showed that many WWTPs were unable to effectively remove most of the PPCPs investigated. Finally, the study provides an assessment of the environmental risk posed by their presence in wastewaters by means of the risk quotient (RQ). RQs were more than unity for various compounds in the effluents expressing possible threat for the aquatic environment. Tridosan was found to be the most critical compound in terms of contribution and environmental risk, concluding that it should be seriously considered as a candidate for regulatory monitoring and prioritization on a European scale on the basis of realistic PNECs. The results of the extensive monitoring study contributed to a better insight on PPCPs in Greece and their presence in influent and effluent wastewaters. Furthermore, the unequivocal identification of two transformation products of trimethoprim in real wastewaters by using the advantages of the LTQ Orbitrap capabilities provides information that should be taken into consideration in future PPCP monitoring studies in wastewaters.

AB This paper describes a simple, sensitive and rapid method for the determination of triclosan and ketoprofen in wastewater influent, effluent and river water. The method involves solid phase extraction (SPE) of target compounds using Oasis HLB sorbent. Several extraction parameters such as sample pH, sample volume, SPE cartridge and SPE elution solvent were optimized. The pH of the collected samples was adjusted to 5.5, and then 100 mL of the sample was loaded into an Oasis HLB cartridge. Methanol was used to elute the retained compounds. The eluted compounds were analyzed using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detection (HPLC-PDA). The method was validated by spiking ultra-pure water and wastewater with different concentrations of both compounds ranging from 5 mu g L-1 to 1000 mu g L-1. Recoveries were in the range of 73% to 104 %, and% RSD ranged from8% to 15%. The method gave good detection limits of 0.01 and 0.08 mu g L-1 for triclosan and ketoprofen, respectively. Traces of both compounds were detected in all wastewater (influent and effluent) samples at a range of 1.2 to 9.0 mu g L-1 and in some river water samples.

AB To assess the environmental fate and risks of pharmaceuticals, the determination of their distributions between sediment and water is crucial as a controlling process. In this paper, the concentrations of 9 selected pharmaceuticals were determined in water and sediment samples from the River Medway, Kent, UK between December 2009 and December 2010. In the water phase, there was a spatial variation of concentration with the highest concentrations being detected in the sewage outfall, indicating it being an important point source in the river. In terms of seasonal variations, the highest concentrations (13-878 ng L-1) were detected in June 2010. In the surface sediment phase, the highest concentrations (5.3-33.6 ng g(-1) dry weight) were observed at the sewage outfall, although in February 2010 the highest concentrations were detected downstream of the sewage outfall indicating a delayed response in sediment accumulation of pharmaceuticals in relation to the water phase. The partition coefficient of pharmaceuticals between surface sediment and water was variable, reflecting a dynamic process of sediment-water interaction and the varying nature of sediments. Overall the partition coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in suspended sediment concentration. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient of the pharmaceuticals was shown to be positively related to their molecular weight (MW), suggesting that sediment-water interactions were partly a partition process favoring large molecules.

AB This work aimed at decontaminating biologically treated domestic wastewater effluent from pharmaceutical residues by using sulphate radical based homogeneous photo-Fenton involving persulphate (PS) as an oxidant, ferrous iron (Fe(II)) as a catalyst and simulated solar irradiation as a light source. This is the first time that the beneficiary use of solar energy in PS/Fe(II)/UV-Vis system was evaluated by using carbamazepine (CBZ) as a probe compound. In wastewater, CBZ was fully degraded in 30 min for an initial CBZ concentration of 50 mu M and an optimal PS:Fe(II) molar ratio of 2:1 thanks to the high selectivity in reactivity of the sulphate radical limiting scavenging effects of organic matter and inorganic ions. Seventeen by-products were identified using liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry allowing for the establishment of degradation pathways. CBZ first underwent degradation through one electron transfer oxidation processes due to sulphate radical reactivity followed by hydroxylation processes through hydroxyl radical formed by Fe(III) photoreduction. The sequential generation of sulphate radical and hydroxyl radical has made PS/Fe(II)/UV Vis a kinetically effective process in removing CBZ from wastewater without the accumulation of toxic intermediates and opens new remediation strategies for tertiary treatment in domestic wastewater treatment plants.

AB There is no quantitative data on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in the aquatic environment in Southeast Asian countries, particularly no information on their suitability as indicators of raw wastewater contamination on surface water and groundwater. This study provided the first quantitative information on the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in raw wastewater, surface water and groundwater in the urban catchment area in Singapore. Acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose were ubiquitous in raw wastewater samples at concentrations in the range of ng/L-mu g/L, while other sweeteners were not found or found only in a few of the raw wastewater samples. Residential and commercial effluents were demonstrated to be the two main sources of artificial sweeteners entering the municipal sewer systems. Relatively higher concentrations of the detected sweeteners were frequently found in surface waters at the sampling sites located in the residential/commercial areas. No significant difference in the concentrations of the detected sweeteners in surface water or groundwater was noted between wet and dry weather conditions (unpaired T-test, p>0.05). Relatively higher concentrations and detection frequencies of acesulfame, cyclamate and saccharin in surface water samples were observed at the potentially impacted sampling sites, while these sweeteners were absent in most of the background surface water samples. Similarly, acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin were found in most groundwater samples at the monitoring well (GW6), which is located close to known leaking sewer segment; whereas these were absent in the background monitoring well, which is located in the catchment with no known wastewater sources. Taken together, the results suggest that acesulfame, cyclamate, and saccharin can be used as potential indicators of raw wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater.

AB Ozonation to achieve removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents, with pH values in the upper and lower regions of the typical range for Swedish wastewater, was investigated. The main aim was to study the effects of varying pH values (6.0 and 8.0), and if small additions of H2O2 prior to ozone treatment could improve the removal and lower the reaction time. The effluents studied differed in their chemical characteristics, particularly in terms of alkalinity (65.3-427 mg center dot l(-1) HCO3-), COD (18.2-41.8 mg center dot l(-1)), DOC (6.9-12.5 mg center dot l(-1)), ammonium content (0.02-3.6 mg center dot l(-1)) and specific UV absorbance (1.78-2.76 l center dot mg(-1)center dot m(-1)). As expected, lower ozone decomposition rates were observed in the effluents at pH 6.0 compared to pH 8.0. When pH 8.0 effluents were ozonated, a higher degree of pharmaceutical removal occurred in the effluent with low specific UV absorbance. For pH 6.0 effluents, the removal of pharmaceuticals was most efficient in the effluent with the lowest organic content. The addition of H2O2 had no significant effect on the quantitative removal of pharmaceuticals but enhanced the ozone decomposition rate. Thus, H2O2 addition increased the reaction rate. In practice, this will mean that the reactor volume needed for the ozonation of wastewater effluents can be reduced.

AB The purpose of studying the biodegradability of pharmaceutical compounds is to evaluate their behaviors in relation to the treatment processes generally used in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants. The antibiotic norfloxacin was found to be a recalcitrant compound. The studies conducted showed norfloxacin removal rates of 12% and 18% when biomasses from treatments with activated sludge and anaerobic biodigesters, respectively, were used without acclimatization. This suggests that anaerobic digestion shows better performance for norfloxacin removal. Ecotoxicological tests, using the luminescent marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri as the test organism, show that anaerobic digestion could eliminate the toxicity of the antibiotic norfloxacin, even though total degradation of the drug was not observed. The release of norfloxacin during cell lysis suggests the importance of controlling this phenomenon in biological treatment systems that handle wastewater contaminated with norfloxacin, thus preventing the return of this drug to the environment.

AB Recent studies have identified the occurrence of a vast number of pharmaceuticals into the municipal wastewater through excreted urine and feces. Some of these pharmaceutical compounds are degraded in the environment. However, there have been reports on the presence of pharmaceutical active compounds in drinking water. Concerns have been raised over the potential adverse effects of these pharmaceuticals on public health and the aquatic environment. In order to investigate the removal process of pharmaceutical enrofloxacin, a unit consisting of a structured packing rotating biological contactor (spRBC) was designed and constructed as a biological treatment unit. The removal rate reached a maximum of 70% in this biological unit. In the meantime, the effect of photolysis process on the effluent of the biological unit was also studied. In the direct photolysis, the removal performance reached 51% and by adding H2O2 the removal efficiency was increased to 87%. The removal efficiency for the entire system including spRBC and an ultraviolet radiation unit was 94%.

ID PRETREATMENT; REMOVAL
AB Pharmaceutical wastewater generated by an antibiotics (penicillin) company was treated by aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). At a low organic loading rate of 0.22 kg-COD m(-3) d(-1), both types of reactors were capable of treating the wastewater such that the treated effluent met the discharge regulation except for the total dissolved solids. However, when the loading rate was increased to 2.92 kg-COD m(-3) d(-1), foaming issues resulted in unstable performance. Overall, the MBRs achieved better solid removal but the SBRs performed better in regards to the degradation of aromatic compounds, as determined by UV absorbance (UVA). Finally, ozonation was applied on two different streams and showed promise on the strong stream - that corresponds to the formulation effluent and contains most of the biorefractory compounds. Ozonation successfully reduced the UVA, lowered the pH and increased the biochemical oxygen demand : chemical oxygen demand (BOD5 : COD) ratio of the strong stream. However, it was less efficient on the effluent having undergone pre-treatment by a biofilter due to a lack of selectivity towards refractory compounds.

ID SEWAGE-SLUDGE; REMOVAL
AB The application of treated sewage sludge on farmland is a suggested method for recycling nutrients and reducing demand for commercial fertilizer. However, sludge needs to be safe from possible contaminants which can cause acute and long-term health and environmental problems. Residual pharmaceuticals and organic contaminants are mentioned as emerging threats since wastewater treatment plants are not designed to degrade these substances. The aim of this study was to screen and evaluate the presence, and reduction, of pharmaceuticals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during anaerobic digestion of mixed primary and waste-activated sludge at 35, 55 and 60 degrees C and during pasteurization at 70 degrees C. The study showed the difficulty of analysing pharmaceutical compounds in low concentrations in the sludge matrix. No general reduction of these compounds was seen during treatment, but for individual substances some reduction occured. The PAHs were generally not reduced during digestion or pasteurization, but for three substances (indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyreneand dibenzo[a,h] anthracene (analysed together) and benzo [g,h,i] perylene) reduction (up to 60%) during digestion was seen. Digestion at 35 and 55 degrees C resulted in about the same order of reduction of the three individual PAHs, which was higher than for digestion at 60 degrees C.

AB Ninety-nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were analyzed in influent, final effluent, and biosolids samples from a wastewater treatment plant employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR). High concentrations in influent were found for acetaminophen, caffeine, metformin, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, paraxanthine, ibuprofen, and naproxen (10(4)-10(5) ng/L). Final effluents contained clarithromycin, metformin, atenolol, carbamazepine, and trimethoprim (>500 ng/L) at the highest concentrations, while triclosan, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, triclocarban, metformin, caffeine, ofloxacin, and paraxanthine were found at high concentrations in biosolids (>10(3) ng/g dry weight). PPCP removals varied from -34% to >99% and 23 PPCPs had >= 90% removal. Of the studied PPCPs, 26 compounds have been rarely or never studied in previous membrane bioreactor (MBR) investigations. The removal pathway showed that acetaminophen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, codeine, metformin, enalapril, atorvastatin, caffeine, paraxanthine, and cotinine exhibited high degradation/transformation. PPCPs showing strong sorption to solids included triclocarban, triclosan, miconazole, tetracycline, 4-epitetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, paroxetine, and ofloxacin. Trimethoprim, oxycodone, clarithromycin, thiabendazole, hydrochlorothiazide, erythromycin-H2O, carbamazepine, meprobamate, and propranolol were not removed during treatment, and clarithromycin was even formed during treatment. This investigation extended our understanding of the occurrence and fate of PPCPs in an MBR process through the analysis of the largest number of compounds in an MBR study to date.

TI Pharmaceuticals in surface waters: sources, behavior, ecological risk,
   and possible solutions. Case study of Lake Geneva, Switzerland
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Nowadays, pharmaceuticals are present in surface waters as well as in groundwaters of developed countries. In the middle of Lake Geneva, for example, one of the largest European lakes, 14 pharmaceuticals are regularly detected in concentrations up to 0.37 mu g/L. This pollution is due to the human consumption of drugs and also veterinary use and industrial releases during production. In the case of Lake Geneva, this latter pollution is significant for some specific compounds. But, as shown in this overview, environmental toxicity data are lacking for most of the pharmaceuticals detected in the aquatic environment. For example, the ecotoxicity of metformin, one of the main compounds detected in Lake Geneva, is mostly unknown for the moment. Furthermore, specific effects like endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, or antibioresistance induction, which may be expected because of the mode of action of some drugs, have not yet been investigated for aquatic species. Ecological risk assessment of pharmaceuticals is therefore tricky and most of the time is not feasible. Owing to this lack of knowledge, also due to high biological potency of the pharmaceuticals, it is critical to reduce the release of these compounds to the aquatic system. This may be achieved by 'at source' (e.g., urine collection) methods or 'end of pipe' (e.g., wastewater treatment) solutions. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This chapter reviews current and new technologies for the removal of emerging TrOC from wastewater for reuse purposes. In particular, it compares the relative performance of Membrane bioreactors (MBR) with other conventional biological processes. It is shown that MBR has many intrinsic advantages over other methods leading to superior performance. Fundamental to this is the presence of a membrane barrier which provides a range of other adsorption mechanisms for TrOC. However, in practice there are many factors affecting TrOC removal by MBR, leading to sometimes conflicting reports in the literature from both lab scale studies as well as full scale plants. These factors include both structural and physicochemical characteristics of the TrOC as well as operational parameters of the MBR process. It is concluded that further work is required, particularly in areas such as improved understanding of the overall fate and degradation pathways of TrOC undergoing MBR processes, investigation of specific microbial-TrOC interactions and development of hybrid systems having MBR at the core to treat the wide varieties of TrOC from wastewater.

AB This chapter evaluates the economic and environmental implications of MBR using Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A brief introduction to these methodologies and the main developments and achievements when applied to MBR is given before the presentation of two case studies. In the first case study, CBA and LCA were applied for the assessment of seven wastewater treatment plants using MBR and other membrane technologies. The results highlighted the benefits of removal of substances responsible for eutrophication and the relevance of the scale factor regarding electricity use, one of the main environmental and economic costs. In the second case study, LCA alone was applied for the environmental assessment of four novel MBR configurations at pilot-plant scale focusing on the removal of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), of which only hormones were found to be relevant in terms of toxicity due to their higher concentrations in the influent.

AB As part of a proactive approach to environmental protection, emerging issues with potential impact on the environment is the subject of ongoing investigation. One emerging area of environmental research concerns pharmaceuticals like salicylic acid, which is the main metabolite of various analgesics including aspirin. It is a common component of sewage effluent and also an intermediate in the degradation pathway of various aromatic compounds which are introduced in the marine environment as pollutants. In this study, biotransformation products of salicylic acid by seaweed, Bryopsis plumosa, associated marine bacterium, Moraxella spp. MB1, have been investigated. Phenol, conjugates of phenol and hydroxy cinnamic acid derivatives (coumaroyl, caffeoyl, feruloyl and trihydroxy cinnamyl) with salicylic acid (3-8) were identified as the bioconversion products by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These results show that the microorganism do not degrade phenolic acid but catalyses oxygen dependent transformations without ring cleavage. The degradation of salicylic acid is known to proceed either via gentisic acid pathway or catechol pathway but this is the first report of biotransformation of salicylic acid into cinnamates, without ring cleavage. Besides cinnamic acid derivatives (9-12), metabolites produced by the bacterium include antimicrobial indole (13) and beta-carbolines, norharman (14), harman (15) and methyl derivative (16), which are beneficial to the host and the environment.

AB This study aims to assess the removal of emerging contaminants from municipal wastewaters using a pilot system that integrated ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), and electrooxidation, which mineralized the RO concentrate. Initially, the study monitored 77 emerging contaminants in the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Most of the compounds were detected in significant amounts in the WWTP effluent.
   A group of 12 compounds that represent the most prevalent therapeutic pharmaceutical categories was selected to monitor their removal by UF/RO. For the majority of the micropollutants, the UF removal efficiency was less than 20%. Excellent removal efficiencies were achieved with the RO treatment. As a result, the concentrations of the emerging contaminants in the RO permeate varied between 44 ng/L for naproxen and 4 ng/L for ofloxacin, and furosemide, bezafibrate and fenofibric acid were not detected. After the RO treatment, electrooxidation of the RO concentrate with boron-doped diamond electrodes reduced the total micropollutant content in the RO concentrate from 149 mu g/L to less than 101 mu g/L. Increasing the intensity of the electrooxidation treatment is expected to further reduce the micropollutant concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of contaminants in the sewage treatment plants (STPs) can be incomplete causing their release to the environment. In this paper, the results of an extensive survey on more than 40 pesticides carried out in 2010 and 2011 in 16 STPs of Ebro, Guadalquivir, Jucar and Llobregat Rivers (Spain) are presented. In 2010, of 43 analytes screened, 29 were detected in influent and 28 in effluent samples, meanwhile in 2011, of 50 analytes, 33 and 34 were detected, respectively. Pesticides were in the range of 0.33 ng L-1 (terbumeton, 2011)-2526.05 ng L-1 (diuron, 2010) for influent and 0.25 ng L-1 (terbumeton, 2011)-2821.12 ng L-1 (carbendazim, 2011) for effluent. Regarding the sludge samples, 11 pesticides were detected in 2010 and 24 in 2011 at concentrations up to 25667.34 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw). Removal efficiencies showed that, in 2010, the elimination ranged from -810% (chlorfenvinphos) to 93% (dimethoate), and in 2011, from -4575% (diazinon) to 97% (chlorfenvinphos). All these data confirm that most of the pesticides are only partially eliminated during the secondary and even tertiary treatments, commonly used in STPs, suggesting that they can be a focal point of contamination to the rivers.

AB The present research aims at giving an insight into the increasingly important issue of water pollution due to emerging contaminants. In particular, the source and fate of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac have been analyzed at catchment scale for the Llobregat River in Catalonia (Spain). In fact, water from the Llobregat River is used to supply a significant part of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. At the same time, 59 wastewater treatment plants discharge into this basin. GREAT-ER model has been implemented in this basin in order to reproduce a static balance for this pollutant for two field campaigns data set. The results highlighted the ability of GREAT-ER to simulate the diclofenac concentrations in the Llobregat Catchment; however, this study also pointed out the urgent need for longer time series of observed data and a better knowledge of wastewater plants outputs and their parameterization in order to obtain more reliable results.

AB Detection and spatial distribution of 14 drugs of abuse and 17 pharmaceuticals in surface waters was investigated to determine transport hydrological connectivity between urban, agriculture and natural environments. Solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied to all samples. To determine spatial incidence of contaminants, analytical results of target compounds were georeferenced and integrated into a geographical information systems structure together with layers of municipal population, location of sewage water treatment plants and irrigation channels and sectors. The methodology was applied to L'Albufera Natural Park in Valencia (Spain). A total of 9 drugs of abuse were detected at 16 points (76% of the sample sites). Cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, were the most detected substances, being found in 12 and 16 samples, respectively. Maximum concentrations were found in benzoylecgonine (78.71 ng/L) and codeine (51.60 ng/L). Thirteen pharmaceuticals were found at 16 points. The most detected compounds were carbamazepine (15 samples) and ibuprofen (11 samples). Maximum concentrations were detected in acetaminophen (17,699.4 ng/L), ibuprofen (3913.7 ng/L) and codeine (434.0 ng/L). Spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals showed a clear relationship between irrigation areas, high population densities municipalities (above 1000 h/km(2)) and sewage water treatment plants.

AB One significant disadvantage of using reverse osmosis (RO) for reclamation purposes is the need to dispose of the RO retentates. These retentates contain a high concentration of micropollutants, effluent organic matter (EfOM) and other inorganic constituents, which are recalcitrant to biological treatment and may impact the environment. The occurrence of 11 pharmaceuticals (concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 mu g L-1) and their mitigation in RO retentates by a UV/H2O2 process and ozonation was studied using a wide range of oxidant dosages. Eleven pharmaceuticals were identified at. Initial observed kinetic constants (kits) were calculated for the different pharmaceuticals. Other typical wastewater parameters were also monitored during the UV/H2O2 and ozonation reactions.
   The range for k(obs) was found to be 0.8-12.8 L mmol O-3(-1) and 9.7-29.9 L mmol H2O2-1 for the ozonation and UV/H2O2 process, respectively. For ozonation, Atenolol, Carbamazepine, Codeine, Trimethoprim and Diclofenac showed the lowest initial k(obs) (in the order mentioned). Atenolol and Carbamazepine appeared as the most ozone resistant pharmaceuticals, exhibiting the lowest percentage of elimination at low ozone doses. On the other hand, despite the non-selectivity of HO center dot, differences in the initial kobs were also observed during the UV/H2O2 process. Trimethoprim, Paroxetine and Sulfamethoxazole exhibited the lowest initial k(obs) values (in the order mentioned). Trimethoprim and Paroxetine also exhibited the lowest percentage removal when low H2O2 doses were assayed. The compounds that were identified as problematic during ozonation were more efficiently removed by the UV/H2O2 process. UV/H2O2 generally appeared to be a more efficient technology for removing pharmaceuticals from RO brines compared to ozonation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the degradation of the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) by sonolysis, TiO2-based heterogeneous photocatalysis under UV-A and simulated solar irradiation, and by the combined use of UV-A and ultrasound irradiation (i.e. sonophotocatalysis) in demineralized water, ground water and effluent wastewater. The processes were compared with respect to substrate conversion rate and the extent of DOC reduction as a measure of mineralization. CBZ was degraded following a pseudo-first order kinetics. Sonophotocatalysis provided the highest rate of CBZ transformation over the time-course of the experiment while the degree of DOC removal in pure water was similar for all the studied treatments (around 40%), and always lower than CBZ conversion. This indicated that a considerable organic load remained in the treated solutions that could also be attributed to the presence of persistent oxidation products. UPLC-(+ESI)-QToE-MS was employed to determine major CBZ-related transformation products. Several recalcitrant hydroxy- and keto-derivatives of CBZ were tentatively identified. A Daphnia magna bioassay was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the samples collected at different time points showing that the mixtures were highly toxic to D. magna.

AB Classification and regression-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) as well as three-dimensional (3D) toxicophore models were developed for toxicity prediction of 104 organic chemicals causing bioluminescent repression of the bacterium genus Pseudomonas isolated from industrial wastewater. Statistically significant and interpretable in silico models were obtained using linear discriminant analysis (classification), genetic partial least-squares (regression), and 3D toxicophore models. The QSAR and toxicophore models were scrupulously validated internally as well as externally along with the randomization test to avoid the possibilities of chance correlation. Features such as octanol water partition coefficient, third-order branching, =CH2 fragment or unsaturation, and the presence of a higher number of electronegative atoms (specifically halogen atoms) and their contribution toward hydrophobicity have been identified as major responsible structural attributes for higher toxicity from the developed in silico models. The present approaches can provide rich information in the context of virtual screening of relevant chemical libraries for aquatic toxicity prediction.

AB Concern over the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment is mounting due to the potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms. This study draws upon a nationwide survey of psychoactive pharmaceuticals (i.e., antischizophrenics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants) in sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that receive domestic, industrial, or mixed (domestic plus industrial) wastewaters in Korea. A total of 16 psychoactive pharmaceuticals (0.12-460 ng/g dry weight) and nine of their metabolites (0.97-276 ng/g dry weight) were determined in sludge. The median concentrations of psychoactive drugs in sludge from domestic WWTPs were 1.2-3.2 times higher than the concentrations found in WWTPs that receive combined domestic and industrial wastewaters. Among the psychoactive drugs analyzed, the median environmental emission rates of alprazolam (APZ) and carbamazepine (CBZ) through domestic WWTPs (both sludge and effluent discharges combined) were calculated to be >= 15.5 mu g/capita/day, followed by quetiapine (QTP; 8.51 mu g/capita/day), citalopram (CLP; 5.45 mu g/capita/day), and venlafaxine (VLF; 3.59 mu g/capita/day). The per-capita emission rates of some of the metabolites of psychoactive drugs through WWTP discharges were higher than those calculated for parent compounds. Significant correlations (rho = 0.432-0.780, p < 0.05) were found between the concentrations of typically coprescribed antischizophrenics and antidepressants in sludge. Multiple linear regression analysis of measured concentrations of drugs in sludge revealed that several WWTP parameters such as treatment capacity, population-served, sludge production rate, composition of wastewater (domestic versus industrial), and hydraulic retention time can affect the concentrations of psychoactive drugs in sludge.

AB Existing stochastic models for predicting concentrations of down-the-drain chemicals in aquatic environments do not account for the diurnal variation of direct photolysis by sunlight, despite its being an important factor in natural attenuation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a stochastic model incorporating temporal variations in direct photolysis. To verify the model, we measured 57 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a 7.6-km stretch of an urban river, and determined their physical and biological properties in laboratory experiments. During transport along the river, 8 PPCPs, including ketoprofen and azithromycin, were attenuated by >20%, mainly owing to direct photolysis and adsorption to sediments. The photolabile PPCPs attenuated significantly in the daytime but persisted in the nighttime. The observations were similar to the values predicted by the photolysis model for the photolabile PPCPs (i.e., ketoprofen, diclofenac and furosemide) but not by the existing model. The stochastic model developed in this study was suggested to be a novel and useful stochastic model for evaluating direct photolysis of down-the-drain chemicals, which occurs during the river transport.

AB Improved endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) removal is desirable in municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) although increased removal does not always translate into reduced biological activity. Suitable methods for determining reduction in biological activity of effluents are needed. In order to determine which MWWTPs are the most effective at removing EDC activities, we operated three configurations of pilot sized biological reactors (conventional activated sludge, CAS; nitrifying activated sludge, NAS; and biological nutrient removal, BNR) receiving the same influent under simulated winter and summer conditions. As frogs are model organisms for the study of thyroid hormone (TH) action, we used the North American species Rana catesbeiana in a cultured tadpole tailfin (C-fin) assay to compare the effluents. TH-responsive (thyroid hormone receptors alpha (thra) and beta (thrb)) and stress-responsive (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and heat shock protein 30) mRNA transcript levels were examined. Effluents infrequently perturbed stress-responsive transcript abundance but thra/thrb levels were significantly altered. In winter conditions, CAS caused frequent TH perturbations while BNR caused none. In summer conditions, however, BNR caused substantial TH perturbations while CAS caused few. Our findings contrast other studies of seasonal variations of EDC removal and accentuate the importance of utilizing appropriate biological readouts for assessing EDC activities.

AB This study demonstrates the robustness and treatment capacity of a forward osmosis (FO)-membrane distillation (MD) hybrid system for small-scale decentralized sewer mining. A stable water flux was realized using a laboratory-scale FO-MD hybrid system operating continuously with raw sewage as the feed at water recovery up to 80%. The hybrid system also showed an excellent capacity for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), with removal rates ranging from 91 to 98%. The results suggest that TrOC transport through the FO membrane is governed by "solute-membrane" interaction, whereas that through the MD membrane is strongly correlated to TrOC volatility. Concentrations of organic matter and TrOCs in the draw solution increased substantially as the water recovery increased. This accumulation of some contaminants in the draw solution is attributed to the difference in their rejection by the FO and MD systems. We demonstrate that granular activated carbon adsorption or ultraviolet oxidation could be used to prevent contaminant accumulation in the draw solution, resulting in near complete rejection (>99.5%) of TrOCs.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs), two metabolites and caffeine was investigated in River Acheloos, located in Western Greece, during a twelve-month monitoring period (March 2007-February 2008). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for the extraction and pre-concentration of the target pollutants and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the detection and quantification. Recoveries were determined between 74.0-100.4% for distilled water and 72.6-95.1% for the river water, whereas the relative standard deviation was less than 9.4% for distilled water and 8% for the river water, respectively. The limits of detection ranged between 1-40ngL(-1). Two pharmaceuticals (paracetamol and carbamazepine), caffeine and the metabolite (salicylic acid), have been detected in all the analysed samples. Maximum concentration levels determined in river samples reached 305ngL(-1) recorded for paracetamol. The concentrations of target compounds were significantly higher in the samples collected at the sampling station situated after the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Agrinio City compared to the samples collected in upper and lower parts of the river. Seasonal variations were attributed mainly to river flow variations and removal percentages by WWTP. Risk quotient method for median environmental concentrations revealed minimal to median risk with the exception of triclosan, ibuprofen and diclofenac, which presented high risk when maximum environmental concentrations were used.

AB Here, the degradation of 100 mL of sulfanilamide solutions of pH 3.0 has been comparatively studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) using a stirred tank reactor equipped with a 3 cm(2) boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a 3 cm(2) air-diffusion cathode. In both treatments, organics are destroyed by hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface and in the solution bulk from Fenton's reaction between cathodically generated H2O2 and initially added Fe2+, whereas in PEF, additional photolysis of intermediates under UVA radiation is also feasible. The influence of applied current density and substrate concentration on antibiotic decay, degradation rate and mineralization degree was examined. The sulfanilamide decay always followed a pseudo-first-order reaction, as found by reversed-phase liquid chromatographic monitoring, being faster for PEF. The EF process led to large mineralization of sulfanilamide concentrations up to 2390 mg L-1. Nevertheless, the PEF process was much more potent and allowed achieving total mineralization (>99% of dissolved organic carbon removal) of all the solutions tested. Results showed that the application of this treatment is preferable at low current densities and high substrate concentrations to obtain the best mineralization current efficiencies. Ion-exclusion liquid chromatography revealed that oxalic and oxamic acids were the most persistent generated carboxylic acids. Their Fe(III) complexes were slowly removed by hydroxyl radical in EF and much more quickly photolyzed by UVA light in PEF. Ion chromatography confirmed the main release of NH4 and SO42-, ions, and NO ion in relatively smaller extent, during all the mineralization processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the implementation and competitiveness of a continuous coupled wet oxidation/biological process for the treatment of four different phenolic compounds of a pharmaceutical wastewater are evaluated according to removal efficiency of each compound, sensitivity to feed perturbations and robustness.
   Efficiencies of wet oxidation pretreatment for each compound rose to 95%, whereas an important part of the initial COD remained in the medium. In the case of the biotreatment, phenolic compounds were practically eliminated and COD reductions up to 95% were achieved. These values are higher than those obtained by means of the majority of the coupled processes.
   The wet oxidation also showed relatively low sensitivities in front of perturbations on the feed composition for compounds with kinetic constants during the wet oxidation process higher than 8.4 h(-1). Sensitivity studies indicated that the system is stable to changes in the flow rate for residence times in the bioreactor lower than 25 days. Perturbations of the oxygen flow rate had no effect on the removal of the phenolic compounds, in accordance with the fact of calculated Hatta numbers lower than 0.015, indicating a kinetically controlled regime in the range assayed (4-10 kgO(2)/m(wastewater)(3)).
   Additionally, during the evaluation of the robustness of the process, "dampening factors" near of 1 were obtained for the removal of phenolic compounds, corroborating the excellent behavior of the coupled wet oxidation/biological system when fast and continuous changes in the pollutant load were assayed.

AB This study investigated for the first time the occurrence of selected synthetic hormones including 17-ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, norethindrone and cyproterone acetate in Malaysian tropical waters. Samples were collected from the effluents of five sewage treatment plants (STPs) and at seven stations along the Langat River in Selangor, Malaysia, and its main tributaries. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In Langat river samples, only levonorgestrel and cyproterone acetate were found at 50% and 3.3% frequency. The concentrations detected for levonorgestrel ranged from less than the method detection limit (<MDL) to 213ngL(-1) and from<MDL to 76ngL(-1) for cyproterone acetate. For the STP effluent samples, levonorgestrel was <MDL in all samples and the concentrations detected were in the range<MDL - 262ngL(-1) for cyproterone acetate,<MDL -11336ngL(-1) for norethindrone and<MDL - 1898ngL(-1) for 17-ethinylestradiol.

AB The external environment, particularly wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where environmental bacteria meet human commensals and pathogens in large numbers, has been highlighted as a potential breeding ground for antibiotic resistance. We have isolated the extensively drug-resistant Ochrobactrum intermedium CCUG 57381 from an Indian WWTP receiving industrial wastewater from pharmaceutical production contaminated with high levels of quinolones. Antibiotic susceptibility testing against 47 antibiotics showed that the strain was 4 to> 500 times more resistant to sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and the aminoglycoside streptomycin than the type strain O. intermedium LMG 3301(T). Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations in the Indian strain causing amino acid substitutions in the target enzymes of quinolones. We also characterized three acquired regions containing resistance genes to sulfonamides (sul1), tetracyclines [tet(G) and tetR], and chloramphenicol/ florfenicol (floR). Furthermore, the Indian strain harbored acquired mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer, including a type I mating pair-forming system (MPFI), a MOBP relaxase, and insertion sequence transposons. Our results highlight that WWTPs serving antibiotic manufacturing may provide nearly ideal conditions for the recruitment of resistance genes into human commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

AB The degradation of sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) in the aqueous environment by the combination of UV illumination and Oxone has been studied. Experimental results indicated that the UV illumination can effectively activate Oxone to produce sulfate-free radicals (SO4 (-aEuro cent)). When 10 mmol L-1 Oxone was added, 96.78 % removal of SMM (5 mg L-1) was achieved within 90 min. Mineralization of SMM was investigated by measuring the total organic carbon, which decreased by 89.01 % after 90 min reaction. Six intermediate compounds generated during the SMM degradation were identified with the aid of liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, combined with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A general reaction pathway for the degradation of SMM was proposed, where the presence of SO4 (-aEuro cent) remained crucial during the degradation process.

AB The knowledge on the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from animal food production industry for the removal of both hormones and antibiotics of veterinary application is still very limited. These compounds have already been reported in different environmental compartments at levels that could have potential impacts on the ecosystems. This work aimed to evaluate the role of activated sludge in the removal of commonly used veterinary drugs, enrofloxacin (ENR), tetracycline (TET), and ceftiofur, from wastewater during a conventional treatment process. For that, a series of laboratory-controlled experiments using activated sludge were carried out in batch reactors. Sludge reactors with 100 mu g/L initial drug charge presented removal rates of 68 % for ENR and 77 % for TET from the aqueous phase. Results indicated that sorption to sludge and to the wastewater organic matter was responsible for a significant percentage of drugs removal. Nevertheless, these removal rates still result in considerable concentrations in the aqueous phase that will pass through the WWTP to the receiving environment. Measuring only the dissolved fraction of pharmaceuticals in the WWTP effluents may underestimate the loading and risks to the aquatic environment.

AB Enantiomeric compositions and fractions (EFs) of three chiral imidazole (econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole) and one chiral triazole (tebuconazole) antifungals were investigated in wastewater, river water, and bed sediment of the Pearl River Delta, South China. The imidazole pharmaceuticals in the untreated wastewater were racemic to weakly nonracemic (EFs of 0.450-0.530) and showed weak enantioselectivity during treatment in the sewage treatment plant. The EFs of the dissolved azole antifungals were usually different from those of the sorbed azoles in the suspended particulate matter, suggesting different behaviors for the enantiomers of the chiral azole antifungals in the dissolved and particulate phases of the wastewater. The azole antifungals were widely present in the rivers. The bed sediment was a sink for the imidazole antifungals. The imidazoles were prevalently racemic, whereas tebuconazole was widely nonracemic in the rivers. Seasonal effects were observed on distribution and chirality of the azole antifungals. Concentrations of the azole antifungals in the river water were relatively higher in winter than in spring and summer while the EF of miconazole in the river water was higher in summer. The mechanism of enantiomeric behavior of the chiral azole antifungals in the environment warrants further research.

AB Two representative pharmaceutical activated compounds, Carbamazepine and Naproxen, were removed (removal efficiency of 52.7 and 58.1%, respectively) in six days in a reaction system with the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium immobilized on sawdust. Naproxen's removal was considered mainly due to the biological/fungal removal whereas Carbamazepine's removal relied largely on the sawdust adsorption. The removal of two target compounds was not found directly related to the activities of two extracellular enzymes lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase, but the synthesis of two enzymes was inhibited by the addition of two pharmaceutical compounds at the initial period. The application of sawdust carriers was found conducive to the synthesis of extracellular enzymes even though without a significant improvement in the biomass production.

AB Emerging pollutants such as personal care products can reach the environment via effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and digested sludge. Only recently, the antidandruff agent and antimycotic climbazole was detected for the first time in a WWTP effluent with concentrations up to 0.5 mu g/L. Climbazole acts as a C14-demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and thus has a high efficacy against fungi, but knowledge of its potential environmental impact is lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize climbazole's ecotoxicity by conducting standard biotests with organisms representing different trophic levels from the aquatic as well as the terrestrial ecosystems. It was found that the toxicity of climbazole is mostly similar to that of other DMI fungicides, whereas it proved to be particularly toxic to primary producers. The lowest median effective concentrations (EC50s) were determined for Lemna minor, at 0.013mg/L (biomass yield), and Avena sativa, at 18.5mg/kg soil dry weight (shoot biomass). Reduction of frond size in water lentils and shoot length in higher plants suggested an additional plant growth-retarding mode of action of climbazole. In addition, it was demonstrated here that for an ionizable compound such as climbazole, the soil pH can have a considerable influence on phytotoxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:2816-2825.

AB The inhibitory effects and biotransformation potential of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) under anoxic (i.e., nitrate reducing) and anaerobic (i.e., sulfate reducing and methanogenic) conditions were investigated. Fermentation and sulfate reduction was inhibited in 10-80 mg/L CIP-amended sulfate-reducing.cultures but recovered with prolonged incubation. Methanogenesis in the mixed culture was significantly inhibited at 80-100 mg CIP/L. No significant decrease of CIP concentration was observed under both sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. However, a low degree of CIP biotransformation was observed in a fed-batch denitrifying culture after a lag time even though the microbial, denitrifying activity was gradually inhibited at 24-40 mg CIP/L. Furthermore, the degradation of CIP was accelerated with a UP reamendment of the denitrifying culture. Two CIP biotransformation products in the denitrifying culture were detected and their proposed chemical structures suggest that the antibiotic quinolone moiety of CIP was intact.

AB Background: Sulfamethoxazole (SMX, sulfonamide antibiotic) biodegradation by activated sludge communities (ASC) is still only partly understood. The present work is focusing on nine different bacteria species capable of SMX biodegradation that were isolated from SMX-acclimated ASC.
   Results: Initially 110 pure cultures, isolated from activated sludge, were screened by UV-absorbance measurements (UV-AM) for their SMX biodegradation potential. Identification via almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed five Pseudomonas spp., one Brevundimonas sp., one Variovorax sp. and two Microbacterium spp.. Thus seven species belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria and two to Actinobacteria. These cultures were subsequently incubated in media containing 10 mg L-1 SMX and different concentrations of carbon (sodium-acetate) and nitrogen (ammonium-nitrate). Different biodegradation patterns were revealed with respect to media composition and bacterial species. Biodegradation, validated by LC-UV measurements to verify UV-AM, occurred very fast with 2.5 mg L-1 d(-1) SMX being biodegraded in all pure cultures in, for UV-AM modified, R2A-UV medium under aerobic conditions and room temperature. However, reduced and different biodegradation rates were observed for setups with SMX provided as co-substrate together with a carbon/nitrogen source at a ratio of DOC:N - 33:1 with rates ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 mg L-1 d(-1).
   Conclusions: Media containing only SMX as carbon and nitrogen source proved the organisms' ability to use SMX as sole nutrient source where biodegradation rates decreased to 1.0 - 1.7 mg L-1 d(-1). The different taxonomically identified species showed specific biodegradation rates and behaviours at various nutrient conditions. Readily degradable energy sources seem to be crucial for efficient SMX biodegradation.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds were increasingly detected in environmental matrices but little is known whether these compounds would transport to coastal zones via watersheds. Three typical tidal rivers in southeastern China were selected and 15 surface sediment samples (0-10 cm) were collected along a 50-km tidal section of each river. Surface sediment samples were frozen-drying and then extracted for pharmaceutical compounds by an accelerated solvent extraction system. The pharmaceutical compounds in extracts were scanned using a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandern mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Three hundred and thirty compounds from nine pharmaceutical groups were detected with signal-to-noise above three (detectable level) in the surface sediments, of which 186 compounds were with a signal-to-noise above ten (measurable level). Of all, 291 and 80 compounds were detectable and measurable in all the three rivers, respectively. The Jiulong River showed a high load of pharmaceutical compounds in surface sediment than other two rivers. Of the nine pharmaceutical groups, the antihistamines and detoxification group and anti-infective drug group contributed five dominant compounds in the surface sediments in all the three rivers. Natures of pharmaceutical compounds rather than the sediment properties (pH, EC, and total carbon content) might influence their residues. The incredible number and intensity of pharmaceutical residues were detected in tidal surface sediments of the three rivers indicating that the pharmaceutical contamination should be strongly considered in China. Source identification and eco-toxicity assessment should be taken into account in the future study. Therapeutic medicine managements need to be strictly improved at a watershed scale to reduce loads of pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems.

AB In this study, the occurrence and sources of five cataloged antibiotics and metabolites were studied in Jiulongjiang River basin, south China. Nineteen antibiotics and 13 metabolites were detected in water samples from 16 river sampling sites, wastewater from 5 swine-raising facilities, and effluent from 5 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results showed that 12 antibiotics and 6 metabolites were detected in river water samples. Sulfonamides (SAs) and their metabolites were detected at high concentrations (8.59-158.94 ng/L). Tetracyclines (TCs) and their metabolites were frequently detected in swine wastewater, and the maximum concentration was up to the level in milligram per liter. Macrolides (MLs) and beta-lactams (beta-Ls) were found in all WWTP effluent samples and some river samples, while they were never found in any of the swine wastewater samples. SAs and quinolones (QNs) were detected in all samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 16 surface water samples was applied to achieve the spatial distribution characteristics of antibiotics in the Jiulongjiang River. As a result, two categories were obviously obtained. Principal component analysis and redundancy analysis showed that TCs and SAs as well as their metabolites were the major antibiotics in Jiulongjiang River, and they mainly originated from swine wastewater, while the QNs, MLs, and beta-Ls in the Jiulongjiang River came from WWTP effluent.

AB The fate of organic micropollutans (MPs) in a membrane system based on microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis/nanofiltration (RO/NF) has been investigated for the case of wastewater reuse. Both an operating full-scale water reuse plant and a pilot plant were employed, with 22 individual organic compounds at their ambient concentrations studied for the former and the latter employing two target compounds over a range of feed concentrations. Results revealed removal efficiencies higher than 75% for most compounds in the full-scale plant, though mass flow studies on all streams revealed a significant imbalance of material for some compounds. Rejection efficiencies measured for candidate commercial NF and RO membranes tested at pilot scale challenged with a pharmaceutically active compound (ibuprofen, IBU) and an endocrine-disrupting chemical (nonylphenol, NP) exceeded 99%. Permeate concentrations were 0.005-0.14g/L for IBU and below the limit of detection for NP. A mass balance of the MPs for the full-scale plant across the MF and RO stages revealed a significant imbalance associated with the challenge of accurate determination of low concentrations. Differences in pilot plant and full-scale data were otherwise attributed to the impact of membrane ageing (and specifically hydrolysis) on RO rejection of the MPs examined.

AB Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an antimicrobial found in consumer soaps and toothpaste. It is in treated wastewater effluents at low parts-per-billion concentrations, representing a potentially chronic exposure condition for biota inhabiting receiving streams. For the present study, a naturally colonized benthos was created using flow-through indoor mesocosms; then, the benthic communities were dosed to achieve different in-stream triclosan concentrations (control, 0.1 mu g/L, 0.5 mu g/L, 1.0 mu g/L, 5.0 mu g/L, and 10 mu g/L) for 56 d. Water quality parameters and endpoints from bacteria to macroinvertebrates, as well as interacting abiotic components, were measured. Effects of triclosan on specific microbial endpoints were observed at all doses, including an effect on litter decomposition dynamics at doses of 1.0 mu g/L and higher. Resistance of periphytic bacteria to triclosan significantly increased at doses of 0.5 mu g/L and above. By the end of dosing, the antimicrobial appeared to stimulate the stream periphyton at the 3 lowest doses, while the 2 highest doses exhibited decreased stocks of periphyton, including significantly lower bacteria cell densities and cyanobacteria abundance compared with the control. Other than an effect on benthic ostracods, the changes that occurred in the periphyton did not translate to significant change in the colonizing nematodes, the macroinvertebrate community as a whole, or other measurements of stream function. The results shed light on the role a low, chronic exposure to triclosan may play in effluent-dominated streams. (c) 2013 SETAC

AB Due to their widespread use, clofibric acid (CA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) have been frequently detected simultaneously at relatively high concentrations in aquatic environments. In this study, agricultural waste rice straw was employed as a potentially low-cost, effective and easy-to-operate biosorbent (RSB) to remove CA and CBZ. The adsorption of both pharmaceuticals followed pseudo second-order kinetics, and intraparticle diffusion was an important rate-limiting step. The adsorption isotherms of both drugs were fit well with Freundlich model. The adsorption of CA onto RSB was exothermic and was more likely to be dominated by physical processes, while the adsorption of CBZ was endothermic. Solution pH was determined to be the most important factor for CA adsorption, such that the adsorption capacity of CA onto RSB increased with the decline of solution pH. In the lower range of solution pH below 3.1, the CA removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of biosorbent dosage. The CBZ removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of RSB dosage without pH control. The maximum adsorption capacities were 126.3 mg/g for CA and 40.0 mg/g for CBZ.

AB Tetracycline (TC), one of the most common antibiotics, is often poorly bio-degraded in conventional wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the sonocatalytic degradation of TC was investigated using TiO2 nano-particles as catalyst. The effect of pH, initial TC concentrations, reaction times, and H2O2 concentrations were evaluated. The efficacy of ultrasonic irradiation alone in the removal of this pollutant was negligible but removal efficiency increased upon addition of TiO2 up to 250mg L-1; increase of pH and initial TC concentration attenuated TC degradation. Addition of H2O2 raised the removal efficiency so that complete removal of TC was achieved within 75min.

AB The adsorption of carbamazepine was evaluated on activated carbon in fixed bed columns. The effect of various parameters on breakthrough curves like carbamazepine initial concentrations (1.2, 1.6, and 2.5mg/L), bed depths (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8cm) and volumetric flow rates (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0mL/min) was investigated. The breakthrough time increased with increase of bed depth, and decreased with increase of initial concentration and volumetric flow rate. In order to predict the theoretical breakthrough curves and to determine model parameters, BDST, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Clark models were applied to the experimental adsorption processes under the operational conditions described above. The Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB Hydrophilic phenolic compounds in olive-mill wastewater (OMWW) evince high potential for use in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products due to their bioactivities. However, up-to-date, effective and low-cost extraction techniques suitable for large quantities of OMWW are still wanting. This lack turns the by-product OMWW into problematic waste, instead of a value-added product. Foam fractionation has not yet been studied with regard to its potential for extracting polar phenolics from OMWW. In this study, this was investigated in a simple model system with oxidative-insensitive vanillic acid. The influence of four process parameters (concentration of vanillic acid, concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, pH value and gas flow rate) on enrichment factor and percentage recovery was analyzed with design of experiments. Analysis of the central composite design revealed that the concentration of the cationic surfactant and the gas flow rate are diametrically opposed for high enrichment factor in the foamate and simultaneous low percentage recovery in the residue. Low vanillic acid concentration and pH of 6-7 were found to be advantageous in terms of good extraction performance. Foam fractionation of vanillic acid under the optimized process parameters led to an enrichment factor of 22.24 in the foamate and 55.88% recovery in the residue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate prediction of pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater effluents requires that the specific biochemical processes responsible for pharmaceutical biodegradation be elucidated and integrated within any modeling framework. The fate of three selected beta blockers-atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol-was examined during nitrification using batch experiments to develop and evaluate a new cometabolic process-based (CPB) model. CPB model parameters describe biotransformation during and after ammonia oxidation for specific biomass populations and are designed to be integrated within the Activated Sludge Models framework. Metoprolol and sotalol were not biodegraded by the nitrification enrichment culture employed herein. Biodegradation of atenolol was observed and linked to the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and heterotrophs but not nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Results suggest that the role of AOB in atenolol degradation may be disproportionately more significant than is otherwise suggested by their lower relative abundance in typical biological treatment processes. Atenolol was observed to competitively inhibit AOB growth in our experiments, though model simulations suggest inhibition is most relevant at atenolol concentrations greater than approximately 200 ng.L-1 CPB model parameters were found to be relatively insensitive to biokinetic parameter selection suggesting the model approach may hold utility for describing pharmaceutical biodegradation during biological wastewater treatment.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is receiving great attention since significant levels of contamination have been found, not only in sewage treatment plant effluents, but also in open waters. In our study, the toxicity of three anticonvulsant drugs commonly found in the environment (diazepam, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) was evaluated in Lepomis gibbosus (pumpkinseed sunfish). This study focused on oxidative stress parameters, namely: glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), catalase (CAT), and lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) in the hepatic, digestive, and gill tissues of exposed animals. Simultaneously, we assessed the effects of these drugs in terms of behavioural parameters, such as scototaxis and activity. Exposure to diazepam caused an increase in GST activities in the gills and an inhibition of GRed in the digestive tract, relative to control, suggesting an antioxidant response. It also caused fish to spend more time swimming and less time in a refuge area (black compartment of an aquarium). Exposure to carbamazepine caused an increase in GSTs and GRed activity in the digestive tract, which is not always consistent with the literature. A significant positive correlation was found between carbamazepine concentration and time spent in motion and a negative correlation with time spent in black compartment. Exposure to phenytoin was responsible for adaptive responses in the activities of CAT and GSTs (in the liver), but it did not elicit any behavioural alterations. Although all three drugs seemed to induce oxidative stress in some organs, peroxidative damage (measured as TBARS concentrations) was not found at the selected range of concentrations. Our results enlighten the need for more research on the ecological consequences of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, especially drugs that interfere with the CNS and behaviour, because the net outcome of these effects may be difficult to predict.

AB Naproxen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Recently, this medicine was detected both in natural waters (up to 1.5 mu g L-1) and in sewage treatment plant effluents (up to 5.2 mu g L-1). Moreover, naproxen is only partly eliminated by classical processes used in sewage treatment plants. Therefore, its degradation is of utmost interest. Advanced oxidation processes proved to be the most suitable methods for the elimination of persistent organic contaminants. In this work ultraviolet (UV, 254 nm), vacuum ultraviolet photolysis (VUV, 172 nm) and their combination (UV/VUV, 254/185 nm) were investigated. The efficiency of the methods increased in the following order: UV < VUV < UV/VUV photolysis. However, VUV irradiation was found to mineralize the contaminant molecule most effectively. The chemical structures of three out of four aromatic by-products and of some aliphatic carboxylic acids were presumed. The effects of dissolved O-2 and the initial concentration of naproxen on the degradation were also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in the aquatic ecosystem, despite the high removal rate that occurs in wastewater treatment plants. Phytoremediation represents a technology to improve the performance of existing wastewater treatment. This study was conducted under hydroponics to evaluate the ability of Salicaceae plants to tolerate and reduce IBU concentration in contaminated water. To this end, we combined growth, physiological and biochemical data to study the effects of different IBU concentrations on two clones of Salix alba L Data demonstrated that clone SS5 was more tolerant and showed a higher ability to reduce IBU concentration in the solution than clone SP3. The high tolerance to IBU shown by SS5 was likely due to several mechanisms including the capacity to maintain an elevated photosynthetic activity and an efficient antioxidative defence. These results illustrate the remarkable potential of willow to phytoremediate IBU-contaminated waters in natural and constructed wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of sequential advanced membrane technology wastewater treatment plant towards removal of a widely used non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) mefenamic acid was investigated. The sequential system included activated sludge, ultrafiltration by hollow fibre membranes with 100kDa cutoff, and spiral wound membranes with 20kDa cutoff, activated carbon and a reverse osmosis (RO) unit. The performance of the integrated plant showed complete removal of mefenamic acid from spiked wastewater samples. The activated carbon column was the most effective component in removing mefenamic acid with a removal efficiency of 97.2%. Stability study of mefenamic acid in pure water and Al-Quds activated sludge revealed that the anti-inflammatory drug was resistant to degradation in both environments. Batch adsorption of mefenamic acid by activated charcoal and a composite micelle (otadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA)-clay (montmorillonite) was determined at 25.0 degrees C. Langmuir isotherm was found to fit the data with Q(max) of 90.9mg g(-1) and 100.0mg g(-1) for activated carbon and micelle-clay complex, respectively. Filtration experiment by micelle-clay columns mixed with sand in the mg L-1 range revealed complete removal of the drug with much larger capacity than activated carbon column. The combined results demonstrated that an integration of a micelle-clay column in the plant system has a good potential to improve the removal efficiency of the plant towards NSAID drugs such as mefenamic acid.

AB The photocatalytic oxidation of carbamazepine (CBZ, an antiepileptic drug frequently detected in surface water and WWTP effluent) in WO3 suspension under the irradiation of 420 nm lamps has been investigated. The addition of S2O82- to this process can significantly accelerate the CBZ degradation. It was interesting to observe that conventional radical quenchers like methanol and ethanol promoted the photocatalytic oxidation of CBZ at low concentration (<100 mM), while the tert-butanol inhibits or accelerates the CBZ degradation depending on its concentration. To explore this, the decomposition of CBZ with and without the presence of methanol was investigated in details through the comparison of evolution of intermediates/products, and the comparison of generated radicals by ESR spectroscopy in the process. Sulfate radicals are believed to play a major role during CBZ decay with the presence of methanol in this process. It was found the rate enhancement of methanol is likely due to the competition between quenching effect and cleaning effect on the catalyst surface. In addition, the reaction mechanism reveals that CBZ degradation is mainly dominant by the electrophilic attack of radicals at olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring, leading to ring-opening and formation of various intermediates.

AB This study used a geographic based water model to predict the environmental concentrations of three pharmaceuticals, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and diclofenac throughout European rivers. The work was prompted by the proposal of the European Community (COM(2011)876) to consider these chemicals as candidates for future control via environmental quality standards (EQS). National drug consumption information, excretion, national water use, and sewage removal rates, were used to derive per capita sewage effluent values for the European countries. For E2, excretion rates of the natural hormone and national demographics were also included. Incorporating this information into the GWAVA model allowed water concentrations throughout Europe's rivers to be predicted. The mean concentration from the expected sewage discharge scenario indicated that 12% by length of Europe's rivers would reach concentrations greater than the proposed 0.035 ng/L EQS for EE2. For several countries, between a quarter and a third of their total river length would fail such an EE2 EQS. For E2, just over 1% by length of rivers would reach concentrations greater than the 0.4 ng/L proposed EQS, while just over 2% by length of rivers would reach concentrations greater than the proposed EQS of 100 ng/L for diclofenac.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) can simultaneously act as the initiator, promoter and inhibitor in water ozonation. This study presents an explicit method that can be used to determine these rate constants via the integration of the transient steady-state hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) model, the R-ct concept and the pseudo first-order ozone decomposition model. The theoretical background of this method was provided, and the method was validated with model compounds. The rate constants of three NOM isolates were determined using the developed method. With these rate constants, the influences of NOM on the degradation of ibuprofen, an center dot OH-reactive pharmaceutical compound, can be quantitatively described.

AB In February 2011, at the peak of an influenza outbreak, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mass balances of four anti-influenza drugs-oseltamivir (OS), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), amantadine (AMN), and zanamivir (ZAN)-in the urban area of the Yodo River system. This area includes three main river catchments (the Katsura, Uji, and Kidzu Rivers) and is home to 12 million people, about 10% of Japan's population. Water was sampled at six main rivers and 13 tributary sites and eight sewage treatment plants (STPs). We concluded that the STP effluents were the major sources of the anti-influenza drug load in the Yodo River system (68-94% of total mass fluxes). Extended measurement throughout the Yodo River system further showed only small fluctuations of the ratio of OS to OC from 0.2 to 0.3, suggesting that OS and its metabolite are environmentally stable. The results also clearly showed the importance of reducing the levels of anti-influenza drugs in the water environment by reducing their emission at STPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biotransformation of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBF) was studied by exposing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to IBF via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, and via water at four (0.17, 1.9, 13 and 145 mu g L-1) exposure levels for 4 d. Following exposure, the bile was collected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS methods. The identification of the formed metabolites in i.p. injected fish bile was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer (Q-TOF-MS) and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by ion trap mass analyzer (IT-MS). In addition to unmetabolized IBF, several phase I and phase II metabolites were found in the bile. The main metabolites were acyl glucuronides and taurine conjugates of IBF and of hydroxylated IBFs. The bioconcentration factors (BCFbile), defined as the ratio of the sum of IBF and its metabolites in fish bile to the concentration of IBF in water, was determined following enzymatic deconjugation and was found to range from 14000 to 49000. The highest BCFbile was found at the lowest exposure concentration (0.17 mu g L-1). The results show that rainbow trout has a high capacity for biotransformation of IBF, and the exposure of fish to sub mu g L-1 concentrations of IBF can be determined by the analyses of the biliary metabolites of the compound.

AB Dimer formation was observed during ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, and confirmed with mass spectrometry, NMR and fluorescence analysis. The dimers were combinations of the two parent molecules or of the parent and the product of photolysis, and had visible color. Radical formation during UV exposure and dissolved oxygen photosensitized reactions played a role in dimer formation. Singlet oxygen formed via photosensitization by photolysis products of diclofenac. It reacted with diclofenac to form an epoxide which is an intermediate in some dimer formation pathways. Quantum yield of photolysis for diclofenac was 0.21 +/- 0.02 and 0.19 +/- 0.02 for UV irradiation from medium pressure and low pressure mercury vapor lamps, respectively. Band pass filter experiments revealed that the quantum yield is constant at wavelengths >200 nm. The same dimers formed in laboratory grade water when either of the two UV sources was used. Dimers did not form in wastewater effluent matrix, and diclofenac epoxide molecules may have formed bonds with organic matter rather than each other Implications for the importance of dimer formation in NOM are discussed.

AB The potential presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones and personal care products in drinking water supplies has raised concerned over the efficiency with which these substances are removed by water treatment processes. In this work, we analyzed samples of raw, unprocessed water collected in different periods and found them to contain higher levels of these contaminants in the colder periods (viz. 12314 ng L-1 in autumn and winter as compared to 8-127 ng L-1 in spring and summer) as a result of their biodegradation being favoured by high temperatures and solar irradiance. We also assessed the efficiency with which these contaminants are removed from drinking water by a water treatment plant operating in south-eastern Spain. Preoxidation with potassium permanganate and chloramination with sodium hypochlorite in the presence of highly concentrated ammonia were found to be the treatment steps most markedly contributing to the removal of pharmaceuticals, hormones and personal care products from drinking water (especially in the warmer periods, where these contaminants were completely removed from the water). By contrast, water treated in the colder periods (autumn and winter) still contained small amounts of ibuprofen and carbamazepine (0.09-0.5 ng L-1) which, however, accounted for less than 0.2% of their original concentrations in the water prior to treatment.

AB The attenuation of bulk organic matter and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) was evaluated for various aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR)-ozone (O-3) hybrid treatment process combinations using soil-batch reactor and bench-scale ozonation experiments as a proof of concept prior to pilot and/or field studies. In water reclamation and especially potable reuse, refractory bulk organic matter and TOrCs are of potential health concern in recycled waters. In this study, the role of biotransformation of bulk organic matter and TOrCs was investigated considering different simulated treatment combinations, including soil passage (ARR) alone, ARR after ozonation (O-3-ARR), and ARR prior to ozonation (ARR-O-3). During oxic (aerobic) ARR simulations, soluble microbial-like substances (e.g., higher molecular weight polysaccharides and proteins) were easily removed while (lower molecular weight) humic substances and aromatic organic matter were not efficiently removed. During ARR-ozone treatment simulations, removals of bulk organic matter and TOrCs were rapid and effective compared to ARR alone. A higher reduction of effluent-derived organic matter, including aromatic organic matter and humic substances, was observed in the ARR-O-3 hybrid followed by the O-3-ARR hybrid. An enhanced attenuation of recalcitrant TOrCs was observed while increasing the ozone dose slightly (O-3: DOC = 1). TOrC removal efficiency also increased during the postozone treatment combination (i.e., ARR-O-3). In addition, the carcinogenic wastewater disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was eliminated below the method reporting limit (<5 ngl(-1)) both during ARR treatment alone and the ARR-ozone hybrid.

AB The release of hospital wastewater into the urban sewer networks contributes to the general contamination of aquatic media by pharmaceutical residues. These residues include bio-accumulative pharmaceuticals that lead to increased risk for ecosystems because they can concentrate in organisms and food chains, and therefore reach toxic levels. In order to assess the ecotoxicological risks linked to this particular category of residues, we have developed a specific method, by combining a theoretical calculation of pollutant concentrations in organisms to estimate Body Residue (BR), and ecotoxicity biomarkers in fish cell lines, enabling the calculation of a Critical Body Residue (CBR). This method finally results in the calculation of a specific risk quotient (Qb = BR/CBR), characterizing the risk linked to this type of pollutant. This method was applied to mitotane, a bio-accumulative pharmaceutical typically found in hospital wastewater, in the framework of an exposure scenario corresponding to the discharge of all the hospital wastewaters into the Rhone River which flows through the city of Lyon, France. This approach leads to risk quotients (Qb and Qbg) much higher than those found with the classical approach, i.e. Q = PEC/PNEC (Predictive Environmental Concentration/Predictive Non Effect Concentration) = 0.0006. This difference in the appreciation of risk is important when using cytotoxicity as the criterion for measuring the toxicity of mitotane (Qb = 0.056) and it is even greater when the criterion used is genotoxicity (Qbg = 6.8). This study must be now consolidated by taking the biomagnification of the pharmaceuticals into consideration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The adsorption capacities of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) onto two Y type zeolites (CBV-100 and CBV-901), a ZSM zeolite (CBV-28014), and a silicalite zeolite (HISIV-3000) in water were investigated. The CBV-901 extrudate, which has a lower ratio of silicon dioxide/aluminum oxide (SiO2/Al2O3) than CBV-28014 and less surface area than CBV-100, had the highest adsorption affinity for 17b-estradiol. At an equilibrium concentration of 0.09 mg/L, the adsorption capacity of E2 by CBV-901 extrudate was 8.24 mg/g, whereas the E2 adsorption capacities of CBV-28014, HISIV-3000, CBV-100 were all <0.05 mg/g. CBV-901 had adsorption affinities for other estrogens such as estrone (E1) and estriol (E3). In a mixture of E1, E2, and E3, CBV-901 extrudate showed a greater affinity for E1 and E2 than for E3. The CBV-901 extrudate was also studied for the adsorption of E1, E2, EE2 (17 beta-ethynylestradiol), progesterone, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol in a spiked effluent. Results showed a promising prospect of CBV-901 for the removal of estrogenic compounds in aqueous solutions.

AB Methylamine (MA) is an organic compound that can be found in many commercial applications (agricultural chemicals, including herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, biocides, and miticides; catalysts; pharmaceuticals; resin manufacturing). It has a strong odor similar to fish and can cause chemical burns to the eyes and skin. The vapor from this chemical is extremely irritating to the nose, throat, lungs, skin, and eyes. The indiscriminate discharge of improperly treated chemical contaminated wastewater or wastes into a natural water body will cause serious environmental pollution problems and severe adverse impacts to the aquatic ecology. The goal of this investigation is to remove MA using a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and to understand the ability of mixed bacteria strains to treat different initial MA concentrations in synthetic and actual industrial wastewaters in the CSTR. The following results were obtained: When the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 1.136 day, the MA removed efficiency in the CSTR was the best. When the HRT was 1.136 day, the mixed strains could utilize 1000 mg l(-1) MA both from synthetic wastewater and actual industrial wastewater for growth in the CSTR. The MA removal efficiency reached 100% in the CSTR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An ultra-performance liquid chromatography method using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was developed and validated for the determination of steroid oestrogens in wastewater matrices. To date, analytical methods established in the literature for 17-ethinylestradiol have been unable to achieve the proposed predicted no effect concentration of 0.1ngl(-1). The extensive sample pretreatment and analytical methodology proposed herein enable 17-ethinylestradiol to be determined at very low background concentrations with a theoretical method detection limit of 0.06ngl(-1) which has been applied in real environmental matrices. During the validation process, a trickling filter wastewater treatment works was monitored to demonstrate the method's application. Oestrogen removal across the filters demonstrated good removals of natural free oestrogens (62.0%) with lower removals of the synthetic oestrogen 17-ethinylestradiol (29.2%) from wastewaters at 10 degrees C. The method's application illustrates its capability of detecting oestrogen concentrations in real wastewater samples comprising complex organics of comparatively high concentration. Furthermore, a complete process mass balance for 17-ethinylestradiol is now attainable which has previously posed a challenge owing to the low environmental concentrations typically exhibited, but more significantly as a result of the lower sensitivity inherent in previously reported analytical methods.

AB The degradation of 30 trace organic contaminants (TrOC) by a white-rot fungus-augmented membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated. The results show that white-rot fungal enzyme (laccase), coupled with a redox mediator (1-hydroxy benzotriazole, HBT), could degrade TrOC that are resistant to bacterial degradation (e.g. diclofenac, triclosan, naproxen and atrazine) but achieved low removal of compounds (e.g. ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and amitriptyline) that are well removed by conventional activated sludge treatment. Overall, the fungus-augmented MBR showed better TrOC removal compared to a system containing conventional activated sludge. The major role of biodegradation in removal by the MBR was noted. Continuous mediator dosing to MBR may potentially enhance its performance, although not as effectively as for mediator-enhanced batch laccase systems. A ToxScreen3 assay revealed no significant increase in the toxicity of the effluent during MBR treatment of the synthetic wastewater comprising TrOC, confirming that no toxic by-products were produced.

AB Numerous efforts have been made to remove emerging trace organic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). This study examined the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) by Trametes versicolor laccase and its laccase-mediator systems. Experimental results showed that DEET was poorly removed by laccase alone. The poor removal efficiency of DEET by laccase may be attributed to the presence of strong withdrawing electron group (-CO-N [CH2-CH3](2)) in the chemical structure of DEET. Experimental results also indicated that DEET might be indirectly oxidized by laccase-mediator systems. More than 50% initial DEET amount was removed by laccase in the presence of a redox mediator, such as 2,2'-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid] (ABTS) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). However, laccase activity was considerably decreased in the presence of a redox mediator (ABTS or HBT). Further studies on identification of degradation byproducts and degradation pathways are recommended. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds, widely produced and used all around the world, are partly responsible for the widespread water pollution in the environment. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug that persists in the environment for many years. In the present study, we used the TiO2/UV, nanoparticulate zero-valent iron (NZVI), and NZVI/H2O2 treatment processes to compare efficiency of CBZ removal from water. Influence of NZVI loading, H2O2 concentration, TiO2 loading, UV lamp power, and the matrix (distilled water and groundwater) on CBZ removal efficiency was evaluated using full factorial design. Results indicated that the NZVI/H2O2 process oxidized CBZ within 5min. On the other hand, the NZVI process alone did not reduce CBZ concentration after 120min of process time. The NZVI/H2O2 process was equally effective in CBZ removal from both distilled water and groundwater whereas the TiO2/UV process was less effective due to the presence of ions in groundwater. CBZ removal efficiency of the TiO2/UV process declined 30% when the matrix was changed from distilled water to groundwater. Negative divalent ions, i.e., SO42- ans CO32-, were the main cause of reduction of CBZ removal efficiency from groundwater. It is likely that these two ions adsorb onto, and consequently prevent the superoxide anion O-2(center dot-) and hydroxyl radical OH center dot from being generated on, the surface of the TiO2.

AB The fate and exposure risks of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in marine environments are not well-understood. In this study we developed a multi-residue analytical method for quantifying concentrations of forty target compounds in seawater from Singapore. Analyses of samples (n = 24) from eight sites showed the occurrence of several compounds, including gemfibrozil (<0.09-19.8 ng/L), triclosan (<0.55-10.5 ng/L), carbamazepine (<0.28-10.9 ng/L) and ibuprofen (<2.2-9.1 ng/L). A 3D hydrodynamic model for Singapore was used to predict residence time (t(R)). Principal Components Analysis revealed a strong relationship between t(R) and contaminant concentrations. While source emissions are undoubtedly important, proximate distance to a wastewater treatment plant had little influence on concentrations. The site with the greatest t(R), which exhibited the highest concentrations, is adjacent to Singapore's largest protected wetland reserve. The results highlight an important linkage between hydrodynamic behavior and contaminant exposure risks in complex coastal marine ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since sorption is an essential process with regard to attenuation of organic pollutants during subsurface flow, information on the sorption properties of each pollutant are essential for assessing their environmental fate and transport behavior. In the present study, the sorption behavior of 20 wastewater originated organic micropollutants was assessed by means of sediment column experiments, since experimentally determined data for these compounds are not or sparsely represented in the literature. Compounds investigated include various psychoactive drugs, phenazone-type pharmaceuticals and beta-blockers, as well as phenacetine, N-methylphenacetine, tolyltriazole and para-toluenesulfonamide. While for most of the compounds no or only a low sorption affinity was observed, an elevated tendency to sorb onto aquifer sand was obtained for the beta-blockers atenolol, propranolol and metoprolol. A comparison between experimental data and data estimated based on the octanol/water partition coefficient following the QSAR approach demonstrated the limitations of the latter to predict the adsorption behavior in natural systems for the studied compounds.

AB Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the largest littoral lagoon on the Iberian Peninsula, has been affected by eutrophication processes since the 1970s due to the direct dumping of sewage waters of industrial, agricultural and urban origin. Consequently, the submerged vegetation that covered the bottom of the lagoon has been lost (charophytes and Potamogeton spp., Myriophyllum spp. and Ceratophyllum spp.). Despite efforts to improve water quality, this vegetation has not recovered. No information about the potential of the recent sediments to host charophyte development is available. In this study, we analysed several sediment cores taken from different areas of the lagoon to determine the spatial distribution of past charophyte communities (based on the fructifications, i.e., oospores and gyrogonites, found in the sediments), to ascertain whether propagules remain in the upper sediments and to determine the potential of the surface sediments (containing pollutants, e.g., organochlorinated pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) to host the growth and germination of charophytes if clear water is restored to the lagoon. The study was based on laboratory experiments. Generally, the same species of charophytes were found in all studied areas of the lagoon. The oospores and gyrogonites were located immediately surficially (in the first 5 cm) in certain areas, and these might be capable of germinating in this sediment stratum. The more recent sediment strata (the upper 14 cm), corresponding to the eutrophication period, can support the vegetative growth of Chara hispida and Chara vulgaris and promote the germination of Chara aspera and Chara baltica. We conclude that if the underwater light conditions are improved and nutrient concentrations are reduced in Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the reestablishment of charophytes might be possible both naturally and through specific management measures (namely, programmes involving seeds as planting stock or large-scale planting activity). This approach necessarily requires an improvement in the water quality of the inputs to the lagoon and an increase in the amount of water discharge to reduce the water residence time. These measures would restore the highly desirable positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous antibiotics like sulfonamides have been found in effluents from drug manufacturers due to the fact that these pollutants cannot be removed completely in STPs. Removal of pharmaceuticals by adsorption and ion exchange comprise some of the most promising techniques due to their low cost, easy regeneration, and selective removal of pollutants. This article studies the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a common antibiotic that prevents the formation of dihydrofolic acid and which is the most frequently detected as sulfonamide in municipal sewage. The SMX retention capacity of an anionic ion exchange resin, Lewatit MP-500 (Lanxess Chemical), was initially determined. Equilibrium and kinetics were studied and equilibrium constants and diffusivity values were obtained using different models. Load and elution breakthrough curves were plotted to evaluate ion exchange operation in a fixed bed column. In the elution step, 100% SMX was recovered in all cycles and could be concentrated up to nine times, thus facilitating the treatment of this compound. Load and elution breakthrough curves were simulated using a fixed bed model in which axial dispersion was considered the parameter model fit. A good correlation between experimental results and the numerical solution of the fixed bed model demonstrates the validity of the model.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (PPCPs) in aquatic environments is of concern. Although measured concentrations of individual substances are low, little consideration has been given to the likely chronic nature of the exposures or to the potential for mixture effects. The purpose of the present study was to use the RTG-2 rainbow trout cell line to analyse sub-lethal and cytotoxic effects of PPCPs present in a wastewater-treatment-plant (WWTP) effluents and their mixtures. Interactions with cytochrome P450 1A enzyme, oxidative stress, cellular senescence and cell viability were assessed using 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), ss-galactosidase (ss-gal) and neutral red (NR) uptake assays, respectively. Not all of the compounds that were tested exhibited significant effects. The lowest-observed-effect concentrations and half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were within the range 0.15 to 784.47 mu g l(-1). Clear dose-response curves were found for cells exposed to different mixtures of PPCPs. The lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing EC50 were within the range 0.05 to 54.61 mu g l(-1). Four out the seven tested mixtures induced EROD activity. ROS production was detected in two mixtures. The ss-gal inhibition response was observed in six out the seven tested mixtures and occurred at a higher concentration than was observed for EROD induction activity or ROS generation. The present study clearly shows that the stress response through which cells mount a homeostatic response to toxicants can be potentially used for an initial, rapid and cost-effective assessment of the complex mixtures of PPCP that present in WWTP effluents are difficult and expensive to analyse chemically.

AB Acute and chronic (or sub-chronic) toxicity of five selected antimicrobial agents, including triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), resorcinol, phenoxyethanol and p-thymol, was investigated using the conventional three-aquatic-organism battery. These compounds are widely used in cosmetics and other personal care products and their ecological risk has recently become a significant concern. As results of toxicity tests, TCS was found to be most strongly toxic for green algae [e.g. 72h no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.50 mu gl(-1)] among the selected compounds, followed by TCC, while TCC was more toxic or similar to TCS for Daphnia and fish (e.g. Daphnia 8day NOEC of 1.9 mu gl(-1)). Having compared the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) determined from the toxicity data with measured environmental concentrations (MEC), the preliminary ecological risk assessment of these five antimicrobials was conducted. The MEC/PNEC ratios of TCS and TCC were over 1 for some monitoring data, especially in urban streams with watershed areas without sewage service coverage, and their potential risk for green algae and Daphnia might be at a level of concern, although the contribution of TCS/TCC on the total toxicity of the those sites needs to be further investigated. For the three other antimicrobials, the maximum MEC/PNEC ratio for resorcinol was 0.1-1, but those for phenoxyethanol and p-thymol were <0.1 and their risk to aquatic organisms is limited, although the additive effects with TCS, TCC and other antimicrobial agents, such as parabens, need to be further examined in future studies.

AB In spite of the increasing concerns about the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the nanomaterial pollution in aquatic ecosystem, the effects of carbon nanotubes on the photochemical transformation of PPCPs are less considered. In this study, the photochemical production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in colloidal dispersions of hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT-OH) under simulated solar irradiation using a Xenon lamp. Two kinds of ROS, O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot, were confirmed by their molecular probes, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) and p-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA). The steady-state concentrations of O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot were calculated as 1.30 x 10(-14) M and 5.02 x 10(-16) M, respectively. The effects of MWNT-OH on photodegradation of atenolol (ATL) were investigated in the presence of natural water components, i.e., dissolved organic matters (DOMs), nitrate (NO3-) and ferric ions (Fe3+). Photoproducts of atenolol were identified by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) analysis techniques. Three potential photochemical pathways of atenolol, including the hydroxylation on aromatic ring, the loss of amide group and the cleavage of ether oxygen bond as well as di-polymerization of reaction intermediates were tentatively proposed. Using the radical quenching method, reaction with (OH)-O-center dot was determined as the major photolysis pathway of atenolol in irradiated MWNT-OH suspensions. These findings of the production of ROS and their effects on the photodegradation of organic contaminants provided useful information for assessing environmental risk of MWNT-OH.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment has become a topic of concern because of their potential adverse effects on human health and wildlife species. A total of 45 dewatered sewage sludge samples were collected throughout China and analyzed for 30 commonly consumed pharmaceutical residues. Ofloxacin was found to be the dominant contaminant with concentrations up to 24760 mu g kg(-1), followed by oxytetracycline (52801 mu g kg(-1)), norfloxacin (5280 mu g kg(-1)) and ketoprofen (4458 mu g kg(-1)). The concentration of pharmaceutical residues varied greatly depending on the operation conditions of wastewater treatment plants and sampling locations. Poor agreement was found between the predicted (calculation based on the annual consumption and coefficient of sludge water partition) and detected concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indicating that the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues was affected by various factors such as loading rates, sewage properties and the chemical properties such as the contribution from polar groups. National wide fate and ecotoxicity study is required for the development of control strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The monitoring of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has focused on the distribution in rivers and small lakes, but data regarding their occurrence and effects in large lake systems, such as the Great Lakes, are sparse. Wastewater treatment processes have not been optimized to remove influent PPCPs and are a major source of PPCPs in the environment. Furthermore, PPCPs are not currently regulated in wastewater effluent. In this experiment we evaluated the concentration, and corresponding risk, of PPCPs from a wastewater effluent source at varying distances in Lake Michigan. Fifty-four PPCPs and hormones were assessed on six different dates over a two-year period from surface water and sediment samples up to 3.2 km from a wastewater treatment plant and at two sites within a harbor. Thirty-two PPCPs were detected in Lake Michigan and 30 were detected in the sediment, with numerous PPCPs being detected up to 3.2 km away from the shoreline. The most frequently detected PPCPs in Lake Michigan were metformin, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan. To determine the ecological risk, the maximum measured environmental concentrations were compared to the predicted no-effect concentration and 14 PPCPs were found to be of medium or high ecological risk. The environmental risk of PPCPs in large lake systems, such as the Great Lakes, has been questioned due to high dilution; however, the concentrations found in this study, and their corresponding risk quotient, indicate a significant threat by PPCPs to the health of the Great Lakes, particularly near shore organisms.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. However, they are emerging as a significant contaminant in aquatic environments through wastewater. Due to the persistent and accumulated properties of pharmaceuticals via the food web, their potential harmful effects on aquatic animals are a great concern. In this study, we investigated the effects of six pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, ATP; atenolol, ATN; carbamazepine, CBZ; oxytetracycline, OTC; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; and trimethoprim, TMP on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) activity and its transcript expression with chlorpyrifos (as a positive control) in the monogonont rotifer, Brachionus koreanus. ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure also remarkably inhibited Bk-AChE activity at 100 mu g/L (24 h) and 1000 mu g/L (12 hand 24 h). ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure showed a significant decrease in the Bk-AChE mRNA level in a concentration-dependent manner. However, in the case of OTC and SMX, a slight decrease in Bk-AChE mRNA expression was found but only at the highest concentration. The time-course experiments showed that ATP positively induced Bk-AChE mRNA 12 h after exposure at both 100 and 1000 mu g/L, while the Bk-AChE mRNA expression was significantly downregulated over 6 to 24 h after exposure to 1000 mu g/L of CBZ, OTC, SMX, and TMP. Our findings suggest that Bk-AChE would be a useful biomarker for risk assessment of pharmaceutical compounds as an early signal of their toxicity in aquatic environments. Particularly, ATP, CBZ, and TMP may have a toxic cholinergic effect on rotifer B. koreanus by inhibiting AChE activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment of potential impacts of wastewater effluent discharges in freshwater systems requires an understanding of the likely degrees of dilution and potential zones of influence. In this study, four tracers commonly present in wastewater effluents were monitored to compare their relative effectiveness in determining areas in freshwater systems that are likely to be impacted by effluent discharges. The four tracers selected were the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine, anthropogenic gadolinium, fluorescent-dissolved organic matter (fDOM), and electrical conductivity (EC). The four tracers were monitored longitudinally in two distinct freshwater systems receiving wastewater effluents, where one site had a high level of effluent dilution (effluent < 1 % of total flow) and the other site had a low level of effluent dilution (effluent similar to 50 % of total flow). At both sites, the selected tracers exhibited a similar pattern of response intensity downstream of discharge points relative to undiluted wastewater effluent, although a number of anomalies were noted between the tracers. Both EC and fDOM are non-specific to human influences, and both had a high background response, relative to the highly sensitive carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium responses, although the ease of measuring EC and fDOM would make them more adaptable in highly variable systems. However, the greater sensitivity and selectivity of carbamazepine and gadolinium would make their combination with EC and fDOM as tracers of wastewater effluent discharges highly desirable to overcome potential limitations of individual tracers.

AB Ten antibiotics belonging to three groups (macrolides, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides) were investigated in riverine runoff of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China for assessing the importance of riverine runoff in the transportation of contaminants from terrestrial sources to the open ocean. All antibiotics were detected in the eight outlets with concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 127 ng L-1. The annual mass loadings of antibiotics from the PRD to the PRE and coast were 193 tons with 102 tons from the fluoroquinolone group. It showed that antibiotics decreased from the riverine outlets to the PRE and open ocean. Risk assessment showed that most of these antibiotics showed various ecological risks to the relevant aquatic organisms, in which ofloxacin (OFL), erythromycin (ETM) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) posed high ecological risks to the studied aquatic environments.

AB The river Meuse serves as a drinking-water source for more than 6 million people in France, Belgium, and The Netherlands. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides, both designed to be biologically active, are important classes of contaminants present in this river. The variation in the presence of pharmaceuticals in time and space in the Dutch part of the Meuse was studied using a multicomponent analytical method for pharmaceuticals combined with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of the results. Trends and variation in time in the presence of pharmaceuticals were investigated in a dead-end side stream of the Meuse that serves as an intake point for the production of drinking water, and 93% of the selected compounds were detected. Highest concentrations were found for the antidiabetic metformin. Furthermore, a spatial snapshot of the presence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides was made along the river Meuse. Principal component analysis was successfully applied to reveal that wastewater-treatment plant effluent and water composition at the Belgian border were the main factors determining which compounds are found at different locations. The Dutch part of the river basin appeared responsible for approximately one-half of the loads of pharmaceuticals and pesticides discharged by the Meuse into the North Sea. The present study showed that multicomponent monitoring in combination with principal component analysis is a powerful tool to provide insight into contamination patterns in surface waters.

AB Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides, but minimal information has been published on their presence in municipal wastewater in the United States. Pyrethroids in wastewater from the Sacramento, California, USA, area consisted of permethrin, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and cyhalothrin, with a combined concentration of 200ng/L to 500ng/L. Sampling within the wastewater collection system leading to the treatment plant suggested pyrethroids did not originate primarily from urban runoff, but could be from any of several drain disposal practices. Wastewater from residential areas was similar in pyrethroid composition and concentration to that from the larger metropolitan area as a whole. Secondary treatment removed approximately 90% of pyrethroids, but those remaining exceeded concentrations acutely toxic to sensitive species. Toxicity to the amphipod, Hyalella azteca, was consistently evident in the final effluent. The large river into which this particular plant discharged provided sufficient dilution such that pyrethroids were undetected in the river, and there was only slight toxicity of unknown cause in 1 river sample, but effects in receiving waters elsewhere will be site-specific.

AB The bacterial strain Paracoccus denitrificans W12, which could utilize pyridine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was added into a membrane bioreactor (MBR) to enhance the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater. The treatment efficiencies investigated showed that the removal of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were similar between bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented MBRs, however, significant removal of pyridine was obtained in the bioaugmented reactor. When the hydraulic retention time was 60 hr and the influent concentration of pyridine was 250-500 mg/L, the mean effluent concentration of pyridine without adding W12 was 57.2 mg/L, while the pyridine was degraded to an average of 10.2 mg/L with addition of W12. The bacterial community structure of activated sludge during the bioaugmented treatment was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The results showed that the W12 inoculum reversed the decline of microbial community diversity, however, the similarity between bacterial community structure of the original sludge and that of the sludge after bioaugmentation decreased steadily during the wastewater treatment. Sequencing of the DNA recovered from DGGE gel indicated that Flavobacteriaceae sp., Sphingobium sp., Comamonas sp., and Hyphomicrobium sp. were the dominant organisms in time sequence in the bacterial community in the bioaugmented MBR. This implied that the bioaugmentation was affected by the adjustment of whole bacterial community structure in the inhospitable environment, rather than being due solely to the degradation performance of the bacterium added.

AB Carbamazepine is frequently detected in waters and hardly eliminated during conventional wastewater treatment processes due to its complicated chemical structure and resistance to biodegradation. A carbamazepine-degrading bacterium named CBZ-4 was isolated at a low temperature (10 degrees C) from activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Strain CBZ-4, which can use carbamazepine as its sole source of carbon and energy, was identified as Pseudomonas sp. by the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The composition and percentage of fatty acids, which can reveal the cold-adaptation mechanism of strain CBZ-4, were determined. Strain CBZ-4 can effectively degrade carbamazepine at optimal conditions: pH 7.0, 10 degrees C, 150 r/min rotation speed, and 13% inoculation volume. The average removal rate of carbamazepine was 46.6% after 144 hr of incubation. The biodegradation kinetics of carbamazepine by CBZ-4 was fitted via the Monod model. V-max and K-s were found to be 0.0094 hr(-1) and 32.5 mg/L, respectively.

AB One of the major sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment is wastewater effluent of which human urine contributes the majority of pharmaceuticals. Urine source separation has the potential to isolate pharmaceuticals at a higher concentration for efficient removal as well as produce a nutrient byproduct. This research investigated the efficacy of using strong-base anion exchange polymer resins to remove the widely detected and abundant pharmaceutical, diclofenac, from synthetic human urine under fresh and ureolyzed conditions. The majority of experiments were conducted using a strong-base, macroporous, polystyrene resin (Purolite A520E). Ion-exchange followed a two-step removal rate with rapid removal in 1 h and equilibrium removal in 24 h. Diclofenac removal was >90% at a resin dose of 8 mL/L in both fresh and ureolyzed urine. Sorption of diclofenac onto A520E resin was concurrent with desorption of an equivalent amount of chloride, which indicates the ion-exchange mechanism is occurring. The presence of competing ions such as phosphate and citrate did not significantly impact diclofenac removal. Comparisons of three polystyrene resins (A520E, Dowex 22, Dowex Marathon 11) as well as one polyacrylic resin (IRA958) were conducted to determine the major interactions between anion exchange resin and diclofenac. The results showed that polystyrene resins provide the highest level of diclofenac removal due to electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium functional groups of resin and carboxylic acid of diclofenac and non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix and benzene rings of diclofenac. Diclofenac was effectively desorbed from A520E resin using a regeneration solution that contained 4.5% (m/m) NaCl in an equal-volume mixture of methanol and water. The greater regeneration efficiency of the NaCl/methanol-water mixture over the aqueous NaCl solution supports the importance of non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix and benzene rings of diclofenac. Experiments with ketoprofen, in addition to diclofenac, suggest that polystyrene anion exchange resins can be used to selectively remove other acidic pharmaceuticals from urine.

AB In the year 2010, effluents from 90 European wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were analyzed for 156 polar organic chemical contaminants. The analyses were complemented by effect-based monitoring approaches aiming at estrogenicity and dioxin-like toxicity analyzed by in vitro reporter gene bioassays, and yeast and diatom culture acute toxicity optical bioassays. Analyses of organic substances were performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) or gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). Target microcontaminants were pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), veterinary (antibiotic) drugs, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organophosphate ester flame retardants, pesticides (and some metabolites), industrial chemicals such as benzotriazoles (corrosion inhibitors), iodinated x-ray contrast agents, and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging agents; in addition biological endpoints were measured. The obtained results show the presence of 125 substances (80% of the target compounds) in European wastewater effluents, in concentrations ranging from low nanograms to milligrams per liter. These results allow for an estimation to be made of a European median level for the chemicals investigated in WWTP effluents. The most relevant compounds in the effluent waters with the highest median concentration levels were the artificial sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose, benzotriazoles (corrosion inhibitors), several organophosphate ester flame retardants and plasticizers (e.g. tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate; TCPP), pharmaceutical compounds such as carbamazepine, tramadol, telmisartan, venlafaxine, irbesartan, fluconazole, oxazepam, fexofenadine, diclofenac, citalopram, codeine, bisoprolol, eprosartan, the antibiotics trimethoprim, ciprofloxacine, sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycine, the insect repellent N,N'-diethyltoluamide (DEET), the pesticides MCPA and mecoprop, perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOS and PFOA), caffeine, and gadolinium.

AB The substantial transformation of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist valsartan to the transformation product 2'-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (referred to as valsartan acid) during the activated sludge process was demonstrated in the literature and confirmed in the here presented study. However, there was a severe lack of knowledge regarding the occurrence and fate of this compound in surface water and its behavior during drinking water treatment. In this work a comparative study on the occurrence and persistency of valsartan acid, three frequently used beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, and sotalol), atenolol acid (one significant transformation product of atenolol and metoprolol), and the two widely distributed persistent anthropogenic wastewater indicators carbamazepine and acesulfame in raw sewage, treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and tap water is presented. Median concentrations of valsartan acid in the analyzed matrices were 101, 1,310, 69, <1.0, and 65 ng L-1, respectively. Treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants were confirmed as significant source. Regarding concentration levels of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters valsartan acid was found just as relevant as the analyzed beta-blockers and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine. Regarding its persistency in surface waters it was comparable to carbamazepine and acesulfame. Furthermore, removal of valsartan acid during bank filtration was poor, which demonstrated the relevance of this compound for drinking water suppliers. Regarding drinking water treatment (Muelheim Process) the compound was resistant to ozonation but effectively eliminated (>= 90%) by subsequent activated carbon filtration. However, without applying activated carbon filtration the compound may enter the drinking water distribution system as it was demonstrated for Berlin tap water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) adsorbent for clofibric acid (CA) was prepared by a non-covalent protocol. Characterization of the obtained MIP was achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen sorption. Sorption experimental results showed that the MIP had excellent binding affinity for CA and the adsorption of CA by MIP was well described by pseudo-second-order model. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that two classes of binding sites were formed in the MIP with dissociation constants of 7.52 +/- 0.46 mg L-1 and 114 +/- 4.2 mg L-1, respectively. The selectivity of MIP demonstrated higher affinity for CA over competitive compound than that of non-imprinted polymers (NIP). The MIP synthesized was used to remove CA from spiked surface water and exhibited significant binding affinity towards CA in the presence of total dissolved solids (TDS). In addition, MIP reusability was demonstrated for at least 12 repeated cycles without significant loss in performance.

AB Nowadays, due to lack of freshwater resources a sufficient wastewater management is an environmental concern. This global issue is resulting in the rapid growth of technologies for wastewater treatment. In this study a novel rotation generator of hydrodynamic cavitation is presented, which is used as a tool for pharmaceuticals removal in water. On presented machine analysis of hydrodynamics is made, where the extent and aggressiveness of cavitation is evaluated. The study has shown, that for a sufficient treatment, hydrodynamic cavitation with combination of hydrogen peroxide is needed. The removal of four pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac) was considered, where the over 80% effect was achieved. Various operating parameters such as the rotors geometry of the cavitation generator, pressure in the treatment chamber, temperature of the liquid, amount of hydrogen peroxide and time of exposure to the cavitation was investigated. The experimental results show that hydrodynamic cavitation has a good potential for efficient removal of pharmaceuticals what suggests to continue with research in this field and to consider an appropriate design for a commercial use.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorous loading into waterways from designated beneficial uses of reclaimed water is a growing concern in many parts of the United States. Numerous studies have documented that organic microconstituents present in the reclaimed water can be utilized as indicators of its influence on surface water bodies. However, little to no information is available on the environmental attenuation of these microconstituents relative to the nutrients, which is a critical component in determining the effectiveness or limitations of those markers as a tool for elucidating their origins. In this study, the stability of selected markers (sucralose, carbamazepine, gadolinium anomaly, iohexol, and atenolol) was evaluated through bench-scale studies designed to simulate environmental conditions associated with biodegradation, adsorption, and photolysis. The primary pathway for nitrogen reduction was biodegradation (greater than 99%) while the highest phosphorous removal was due to adsorption (30-80%). Soils with low organic content were selected for this study. Sucralose was the most recalcitrant microconstituent in the environment with less than 15% removal by adsorption, biodegradation, or photolysis. Iohexol was too susceptible to photolysis (90% removal), and atenolol was susceptible to biodegradation (60-80% removal). Gd anomaly was fairly stable (less than 30% removal) in the environment. Carbamazepine was another efficacious marker for wastewater, but was susceptible (50% removal) to photolysis. Of the selected microconstituents, only atenolol showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for nitrate and none of the microconstituents showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for phosphorus.

AB The degradation of a pharmaceutical wastewater using a ferrioxalate-assisted solar/photo-Fenton system has been studied. The photochemical reaction was carried out in a pilot plant consisting of a compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar reactor. An optimization study was performed combining a multivariate experimental design and Neuronal Networks that included the following variables: initial concentrations of H2O2, catalyst Fe (II) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4), temperature and solar power. Under optimal conditions, 84% TOC (Total Organic Carbon) removal was achieved in 115 min. Oxalic acid had a positive effect on mineralization when solar power was above 30 W m(-2). The minimum amount of H2O2 to degrade 1 mol of TOC was found to be 3.57 mol. Both the H2O2 conversion efficiency and the degree of mineralization were highest when the oxalic/Fe(II) initial molar relation was close to 3. HO center dot radicals were the main oxidative intermediate species in the process, although hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2 center dot) also played a role. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work assessed the behaviour of nine pharmaceuticals and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) coupled to distinct simplified post-treatment units (submerged bed, polishing ponds, and trickling filters) fed on raw sewage taken from a municipality in Brazil. The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated that they were not appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the submerged bed and polishing ponds, probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as trickling filters, tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using trickling filters.

AB It is widely demonstrated that antibiotics in the environment affect microbial community structure. However, direct evidence regarding the impacts of antibiotics on microbial functional structures in wastewater treatment systems is limited. Herein, a high-throughput functional gene array (GeoChip 3.0) in combination with quantitative PCR and clone libraries were used to evaluate the microbial functional structures in two biological wastewater treatment systems, which treat antibiotic production wastewater mainly containing oxytetracycline. Despite the bacteriostatic effects of antibiotics, the GeoChip detected almost all key functional gene categories, including carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, etc., suggesting that these microbial communities were functionally diverse. Totally 749 carbon-degrading genes belonging to 40 groups (24 from bacteria and 16 from fungi) were detected. The abundance of several fungal carbon-degrading genes (e.g., glyoxal oxidase ( glx), lignin peroxidase or ligninase (lip), manganese peroxidase (mnp), endochitinase, exoglucanase_genes) was significantly correlated with antibiotic concentrations (Mantel teSt; P < 0.05), showing that the fungal functional genes have been enhanced by the presence of antibiotics. However, from the fact that the majority of carbon-degrading genes were derived from bacteria and diverse antibiotic resistance genes were detected in bacteria, it was assumed that many bacteria could survive in the environment by acquiring antibiotic resistance and may have maintained the position as a main player in nutrient removal. Variance partitioning analysis showed that antibiotics could explain 24.4% of variations in microbial functional structure of the treatment systems. This study provides insights into the impacts of antibiotics on microbial functional structure of a unique system receiving antibiotic production wastewater, and reveals the potential importance of the cooperation between fungi and bacteria with antibiotic resistance in maintaining the stability and performance of the systems.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in treated municipal effluents have the potential to adversely impact exposed organisms prompting elevated public concern. Using transcriptomic tools, we investigated changes in gene expression and cellular pathways in the liver of male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to 5% concentrations of full secondary-treated (HTP) or advanced primary-treated (PL) municipal wastewater effluents containing CECs. Gene expression changes were associated with apical end points (plasma vitellogenin and changes in secondary sexual characteristics). Of 32 effluent CECs analyzed, 28 were detected including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and industrial compounds. Exposure to both effluents produced significantly higher levels of plasma VTG and changes in secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., ovipositor development). Transcript patterns differed between effluents, with <10% agreement in the detected response (e.g., altered production of transcripts involved in xenobiotic detoxification, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were observed following exposure to both effluents). Exposure to PL effluent caused changes in transcription of genes involved in metabolic pathways (e.g., lipid transport and steroid metabolism). Exposure to HTP effluent affected transcripts involved in signaling pathways (e.g., focal adhesion assembly and extracellular matrix). The results suggest a potential association between some transcriptomic changes and physiological responses following effluent exposure. This study identified responses in pathways not previously implicated in exposure to complex chemical mixtures containing CECs, which are consistent with effluent exposure (e.g., oxidative stress) in addition to other pathway responses specific to the effluent type.

AB The relation between pharmaceutical residues along the river Rhine and the demographic characteristics of the upstream population was studied. A sampling campaign was performed in which water samples from the Rhine were taken at 42 locations. Measurements were compared to a two parameter model with regional demographic data as main input. For 12 out of the 21 studied pharmaceuticals, a significant dominant demographic group could be identified. For 3 out of these 12 pharmaceuticals the male elderly were the most contributing demographic group. A Monte Carlo analysis showed a high level of significance for the results of this study (p < 0 : 01). By combining environmental water quality data and demographic data, better insight was gained in the interplay between humans and their environment, showing the medicinal footprint of the population of the Rhine basin.

AB Methyl-triclosan (MTCS), a transformation product and metabolite of triclosan, has been widely spread in environment through the daily use of triclosan which is a commonly used anti-bacterial and anti-fungal substance in consumer products. Once entering human body, MTCS could affect the conformation of human serum albumin (HSA) by forming MTCS-HSA complex and alter function of protein and endocrine in human body. To evaluate the potential toxicity of MTCS, the binding mechanism of HSA with MTCS was investigated by UV-vis absorption, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Binding constants, thermodynamic parameters, the binding forces and the specific binding site were studied in detail. Binding constant at room tempreture (T = 298 K) is 6.32 x 10(3) L mol(-1); Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0) were 22.48 kJ mol(-1), 148.16J mol(-1) K-1 and -21.68 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The results showed that the interactions between MTCS and HSA are mainly hydrophobic forces. The effects of MTCS on HSA conformation were also discussed. The binding distance (r = 1.2 nm) for MTCS-HSA system was calculated by the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The visualized binding details were also exhibited by molecular modeling method and the results could agree well with that from the experimental study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment, and in aquatic media in particular, have received considerable attention by the scientific community during the last two decades. Pharmaceuticals, which are designed to be biologically active substances, are usually lipophilic and resistant to biodegradation, thus having the potential for accumulation and persistence in the environment. Although they are usually present at relatively low concentrations, ranging between ng/L and g/L levels, they may cause serious effects on the environment. In this study, the removal efficiency of sonolysis has been tested on a mixture of 23 pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac and carbamazepine degradations were tested at different power densities (100-400W/L) using low frequency. These compounds were spiked separately in wastewater at high concentrations (mg/L). Subsequently, low-frequency ultrasound-induced degradation of a mixture of 23 emerging contaminants with low concentration (g/L) in urban wastewater was investigated, working at 100W/L. It was found that the pharmaceuticals conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities. The reaction rate for different pharmaceuticals is almost the same in the mixtures and the kinetic regimes are mainly pseudo-first order.

AB This study aims to assess the removal of a set of non-polar pollutants in biologically treated wastewater using ozonation, ultraviolet (UV 254 nm low pressure mercury lamp) and visible light (Xe-arc lamp) irradiation as well as visible light photocatalysis using Ce-doped TiO2. The compounds tracked include UV filters, synthetic musks, herbicides, insecticides, antiseptics and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Raw wastewater and treated samples were analyzed using stir-bar sorptive extraction coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (SBSE-CG x GC-TOF-MS). Ozone treatment could remove most pollutants with a global efficiency of over 95% for 209 mu M ozone dosage. UV irradiation reduced the total concentration of the sixteen pollutants tested by an average of 63% with high removal of the sunscreen 2-ethylhexyl trans-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), the synthetic musk 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene (tonalide, AHTN) and several herbicides. Visible light Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis reached similar to 70% overall removal with particularly high efficiency for synthetic musks. In terms of power usage efficiency expressed as nmol kJ(-1), the results showed that ozonation was by far the most efficient process, ten-fold over Xe/Ce-TiO2 visible light photocatalysis, the latter being in turn considerably more efficient than UV irradiation. In all cases the efficiency decreased along the treatments due to the lower reaction rate at lower pollutant concentration. The use of photocatalysis greatly improved the efficiency of visible light irradiation. The collector area per order decreased from 9.14 +/- 5.11 m(2)m(-3) order(-1) for visible light irradiation to 0.16 +/- 0.03 m(2) m(-3) order(-1) for Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis. The toxicity of treated wastewater was assessed using the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Ozonation reduced the toxicity of treated wastewater, while UV irradiation and visible light photocatalysis limited by 20-25% the algal growth due to the accumulation of reaction byproducts. Three transformation products were identified and tracked along the treatments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 12 active substances among licit and illicit drugs was investigated over a 2 week period inflowing and outflowing in an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in the city of Verona, Northern Italy. Chemical analyses were performed by means of on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in order to minimize sample pre-treatment. Quantifiable concentrations, up to hundreds of ng/L, were detected in influent and in effluent only for carbamazepine, codeine and benzoylecgonine. Such values are in accordance with literature data, so as removal efficiencies: it was observed that there was pretty much no abatement for carbamazepine, while average removal percentages of about 60% and 90% were calculated for codeine and benzoylecgonine, respectively. These results provide useful information (also concerning some active principles never or rarely detected, up to now, such as lormetazepam) for integrated water cycle managing, also taking into account the specific characteristics of the receiving water basin.

AB This study deals with the evaluation of water quality of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in order to assess its suitability as a raw water source for drinking water production. Therefore, water samples from (1) surface water, (2) tap water, and (3) wastewater treatment plant effluents were taken randomly by 2011-2012 in the area of the TGR and were analyzed for seven different organic contaminant groups (207 substances in total), applying nine different analytical methods. In the three sampled water sources, typical contaminant patterns were found, i.e., pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in surface water with concentrations of 0.020-3.5 mu g/L and 0.004-0.12 mu g/L, disinfection by-products in tap water with concentrations of 0.050-79 mu g/L, and pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant effluents with concentrations of 0.020-0.76 mu g/L, respectively. The most frequently detected organic compounds in surface water (45 positives out of 57 samples) were the pyridine pesticides clopyralid and picloram. The concentrations might indicate that they are used on a regular basis and in conjunction in the area of the TGR. Three- and four-ring PAH were ubiquitously distributed, while the poorly soluble five- and six-ring members, perfluorinated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, were below the detection limit. In general, the detected concentrations in TGR are in the same range or even lower compared to surface waters in western industrialized countries, although contaminant loads can still be high due to a high discharge. With the exception of the two pesticides, clopyralid and picloram, concentrations of the investigated organic pollutants in TGR meet the limits of the Chinese Standards for Drinking Water Quality GB 5749 (Ministry of Health of China and Standardization Administration of China 2006) and the European Union (EU) Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption (The Council of the European Union 1998), or rather, the EU Directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union 2008). Therefore, the suggested use of surface water from TGR for drinking water purposes is a valid option. Current treatment methods, however, do not seem to be efficient since organic pollutants were detected in significant concentrations in purified tap water.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are, along with microbial cells, the main components of the biological sludges used in wastewater treatment and natural biofilms. EPS play a major role in removing pollutants from water by means of sorption. The ability of soluble EPS (S-EPS) and bound EPS (B-EPS) derived from various bacterial aggregates (flocs, granules, biofilms) to bind at pH 7.0 +/- 0.1 to two pharmaceutical substances, acetaminophen (ACE) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (ERY), has been investigated using the fluorescence quenching method. Two intense fluorescence peaks, A (Ex/Em range, 200-250/275-380 nm) and B (Ex/Em range, 260-320/275-360 nm), corresponding respectively to the aromatic protein region and soluble microbial by-product-like region, were identified in a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix of EPS samples. The fluorescence peak, which corresponds to humic-like substances, was also identified though at low intensity. The ability of EPS to bind ACE was found to exceed that for ERY. The aromatic protein fraction of EPS displays a slightly higher affinity for drugs than that shown by the soluble microbial by-product-like fraction. The S-EPS and B-EPS present the same affinity for ACE and ERY. The effective quenching constants (log K) derived from the Stern-Volmer Equation equaled at peak A (with S-EPS): 3.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.1 for ACE and 2.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 for ERY. With B-EPS, these values were 3.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.0 +/- 0.1 for ACE and 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.1 for ERY. Our results suggest that the weaker EPS affinity for ERY than for ACE serves to partially explain why only about 50-80 % of ERY is removed from wastewater at the treatment plant. Moreover, this work demonstrates that EPS from natural river biofilms are able to bind drugs, which in turn may limit the mobility of drugs in natural waters.

AB The performance of two laboratory scale biofilters, packed with pressmud (BF1) and sugarcane bagasse (BF2), was evaluated for gas phase ethylacetate removal under various operating conditions. Biofilters were inoculated with mixed culture obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater sludge. Experiments were carried out at different flow rates (0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 m(3) h(-1)) and inlet ethylacetate concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.2 gm(-3)). Maximum removal efficiency (RE) of 100% and 98% was achieved at an inlet concentration of 0.2 gm(-3) and gas flow rate of 0.03 m(3) h(-1) in BF1 and BF2, respectively. A maximum elimination capacity (EC) of 66.6 gm(-3) h(-1) and 64.1 gm(3) h(-1) was obtained in BF1 and BF2, respectively, at an inlet concentration of 0.8 gm(-3) and a gas flow rate of 0.12 m(3) h(-1). The kinetics of biofiltration of ethylacetate was studied by using Ottengraf and van den Oever model. The kinetic modelling gives an insight into the mechanism of biofiltration. The modified Ottengraf model, which was also tested, demonstrated good agreement between calculated and experimental data.

AB Twelve pilot-scale constructed wetlands with different configurations were set up in the field to evaluate the removal and factors that influence removal of sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfacetamide, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole) and trimethoprim from domestic sewage. The treatments included four flow types, three substrates, two plants and three hydraulic loading rates across two seasons (summer and winter). Most target antibiotics were efficiently removed by specific constructed wetlands; in particular, all types of constructed wetlands performed well for the degradation of sulfapyridine. Flow types were the most important influencing factor in this study, and the best removal of sulfonamides was achieved in vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetlands; however, the opposite phenomenon was found with trimethoprim. Significant relationships were observed between antibiotic degradation and higher temperature and redox potential, which indicated that microbiological pathways were the most probable degradation route for sulfonamides and trimethoprim in constructed wetlands.

AB Release of domestic sewage leads to accumulation of xenoestrogens in holding waters, especially in closed or semi-enclosed waters such as lakes. In the study, the occurrence, distribution, estrogenic activity and risk of eight xenoestreogens were evaluated in Lake Donghu, China. Nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and bisphenol A (BPA) were identified as the main xenoestrogens ranging from tens of ng L-1 (in the surface water) or ng g(-1) dw (in the suspended particles and sediment) to tens of mu g L-1 or mu g g(-)1 dw. The sum of 178-estradiol equivalents (Sigma EEQs) ranged from 0.32 to 45.02 ng L-1 in the surface water, 0.53 to 71.86 ng g(-1) dw in the suspended particles, and 0.09 to 24.73 ng g(-1) dw in the sediment. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was determined as the main contributor to Sigma EEQs followed by NP. The risk assessment showed a higher risk in the surface water than in the suspended particles and sediment in such domestic sewage-holding lake. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reuse of treated wastewater to irrigate agricultural crops is increasing in many arid and semi-arid areas around the world. The presence of numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater and their potential transfer into food produce such as vegetables poses an unknown human health risk. The goal of this study was to identify PPCPs that have a comparatively high potential for plant uptake and translocation. A total of 20 frequently-occurring PPCPs were compared for their accumulation into four staple vegetables (lettuce, spinach, cucumber, and pepper) grown in nutrient solutions containing PPCPs at 0.5 or 5 mu g L-1. Triclocarban, fluoxetine, triclosan, and diazepam were found at high levels in roots, while meprobamate, primidone, carbamazepine, dilantin, and diuron exhibited more active translocation from roots to leaves. Root uptake of neutral PPCPs was positively correlated with the pH adjusted log K-ow(i.e., log D-ow), and was likely driven by chemical adsorption onto the root surfaces. In contrast, translocation from roots to leaves was negatively related to log D., suggesting hydrophilicity-regulated transport via xylems. Compounds preferentially sorbed to roots should be further evaluated for their uptake in tuber vegetables (e.g., carrot, radish) under field conditions, while those easily translocated into leaves (e.g., carbamazepine, dilantin) merit focused consideration for leafy and other vegetables (e.g., lettuce, cucumber). However, estimation of dietary intake by humans suggested the implied risks from exposure to PPCPs via wastewater irrigation to be negligible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Open-water cells in unit process treatment wetlands can be used to exploit sunlight photolysis to remove trace organic contaminants from municipal wastewater effluent. To assess the performance of these novel systems, a photochemical model was calibrated using measured photolysis rates for atenolol, carbamazepine, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole in wetland water under representative conditions. Contaminant transformation by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and carbonate radical ((CO3-)-C-center dot) were predicted from steady-state radical concentrations measured at pH values between 8 and 10. Direct photolysis rates and the effects of light screening by dissolved organic matter on photolysis rates were estimated using solar irradiance data, contaminant quantum yields, and light screening factors. The model was applied to predict the land area required for 90% removal of a suite of wastewater-derived organic contaminants by sunlight-induced reactions under a variety of conditions. Results suggest that during summer, open-water cells that receive a million gallons of water per day (i.e., about 4.4 x 10(-2) m(3) s(-1)) of nitrified wastewater effluent can achieve 90% removal of most compounds in an area of about 15 ha. Transformation rates were strongly affected by pH, with some compounds exhibiting faster transformation rates under the high pH conditions associated with photosynthetic algae at the sediment water interface and other contaminants exhibiting faster transformation rates at the circumneutral pH values characteristic of algae-free cells. Lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations typically resulted in increased transformation rates.

AB Parabens (alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid) are widely used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foodstuffs as broad-spectrum antimicrobial preservatives. Laboratory animal studies have shown that parabens possess weak estrogenic activity. Widespread exposure of humans to parabens has raised significant public health concerns. Despite such concern, little is known about the occurrence of parabens in the environment. In this study, six paraben analogues, methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl- (PrP), butyl- (BuP), benzyl- (BP), and heptyl parabens (HepP), were determined in surface sediment and sediment core samples collected from several locations in the United States (U.S.), Japan, and Korea by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Concentrations of parabens also were determined in sewage sludge collected from several wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. MeP was found in all samples, including surface sediment, sediment core, and sludge samples, at concentrations ranging from 0.312 to 540 ng/g dry weight (dw). PrP was detected in the majority of samples (79%), and the concentrations were, in general, 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than MeP concentrations. Significant positive correlations were found among the concentrations of paraben analogues in sediment and sludge, which suggested the existence of similar sources of origin for these compounds. The sum concentrations of six parabens (Sigma PBs) in sludge (geometric mean: 66.3, median: 89.5 ng/g dw) were remarkably higher than those in sediment (5.48, 5.24 ng/g dw). Vertical profiles of parabens in sediment cores from the U.S. showed a gradual increase in concentrations in the past decade, although such a trend was not clear in sediment core from Tokyo Bay, Japan.

AB De facto wastewater reuse is the incidental presence of treated wastewater in a water supply source. In 1980 the EPA identified drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) impacted by upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges and found the top 25 most impacted DWTPs contained between 2% and 16% wastewater discharges from upstream locations (i.e., de facto reuse) under average streamflow conditions. This study is the first to provide an update to the 1980 EPA analysis. An ArcGIS model of DWTPs and WWTPs across the U.S. was created to quantify de facto reuse for the top 25 cities in the 1980 EPA study. From 1980 to 2008, de facto reuse increased for 17 of the 25 DWTPs, as municipal flows upstream of the sites increased by 68%. Under low streamflow conditions, de facto reuse in DWTP supplies ranged from 7% to 100%, illustrating the importance of wastewater in sustainable water supplies. Case studies were performed on four cities to analyze the reasons for changes in de facto reuse over time. Three of the four sites have greater than 20% treated wastewater effluent within their drinking water source for streamflow less than the 25th percentile historic flow.

AB Given the large number of chemicals under regulatory scrutiny, models play a crucial role in the screening phase of the environmental risk assessment. The sewage treatment plant (STP) model SimpleTreat 3.1 is routinely applied as part of the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances to estimate the fate and elimination of organic chemicals discharged via sewage. SimpleTreat estimates tend to be conservative and therefore only useful for lower-tier assessments. A probabilistic version of SimpleTreat was built on the updated version of the model (SimpleTreat 3.2, presented in a parallel article in this issue), embracing likeliest as well as worst-case conditions in a statistically robust way. Probabilistic parameters representing the variability of sewage characteristics, STP design, and operational parameters were based on actual STP conditions for activated sludge plants in Europe. An evaluation study was carried out for 4 chemicals with distinct sorption and biodegradability profiles: tonalide, triclosan, trimethoprim, and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Simulations incorporated information on biodegradability simulation studies with activated sludge (OECD 314B and OECD 303A tests). Good agreement for both median values and variability ranges was observed between model estimates and monitoring data. The uncertainty analysis highlighted the importance of refined data on partitioning and biodegradability in activated sludge to achieve realistic estimates. The study indicates that the best strategy to refine the exposure assessment of down-the-drain chemicals is by integrating higher-tier laboratory data with probabilistic STP simulations and, if possible, by comparing them with monitoring data for validation.

AB The occurrence and fate of 36 emerging contaminants, belonging to five different classes, (benzotriazoles, BTRs; benzothiazoles, BTHs; perfluorinated compounds, PFCs; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs and endocrine disruptors, EDCs) were investigated in raw, treated wastewater (both particulate and dissolved phases), and in sludge from a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Athens, Greece. The average concentrations of BTRs, BTHs, NSAIDs and EDCs in raw wastewater ranged between 11 ng L-1 and 727 mu g L-1, while PFCs did not exceed 100 ng L-1. In dewatered sludge, the average concentrations ranged between 0.8 ng g(-1), dw (perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA) and 3895 ng g(-1) dw (nonylphenol, NP). The distribution of emerging contaminants between particulate and dissolved phase was different among the compounds. BTRs and BTHs showed lower solid-liquid distribution coefficients (K-d) than all other compounds. For 9 over the 27 compounds detected in influents, the removal efficiency was higher than 70%, while the others either were removed to a lesser extent or detected at higher concentrations in effluents. Based on this, advanced treatment processes should be applied in the future for achieving adequate emerging contaminants removal in STPs. Regarding removal mechanisms, almost 60% of BTRs and 30 to 75% of BTHs were removed in bioreactors, while the contribution of primary and secondary clarifiers was of minor importance. Sorption to primary sludge was a significant mechanism affecting EDCs fate in STP.

AB The coupling of membrane separation and photocatalytic oxidation has been studied for the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants. The retention properties of two different membranes (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) were assessed. Comparable selectivity on the separation of pharmaceuticals were observed for both membranes, obtaining a permeate stream with concentrations of each pharmaceutical below 0.5 mg L-1 and a rejected flux highly concentrated (in the range of 16-25 mg L-1 and 18-32 mg L-1 of each pharmaceutical for NF-90 and BW-30 membranes, respectively), when an initial stream of six pharmaceuticals was feeding to the membrane system (10 mg L-1 of each pharmaceutical). The abatement of concentrated pharmaceuticals of the rejected stream was evaluated by means of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation using TiO2 and Fe2O3/SBA-15 in presence of hydrogen peroxide as photo-Fenton system. Both photocatalytic treatments showed remarkable removals of pharmaceutical compounds, achieving values between 80 and 100%. The nicotine was the most refractory pollutant of all the studied pharmaceuticals. Photo-Fenton treatment seems to be more effective than TiO2 photocatalysis, as high mineralization degree and increased nicotine removal were attested. This work can be considered an interesting approach of coupling membrane separation and heterogeneous photocatalytic technologies for the successful abatement of pharmaceutical compounds in effluents of wastewater treatment plants.

AB This study focuses on the removal of 22 selected micropollutants in an effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) at pilot scale. A reactor of 37 L with five low pressure mercury lamps emitting at 254 nm (UV254) was used. The 22 micropollutants include 15 pharmaceuticals, 2 X-Ray contrast medias, 1 corrosion inhibitor and 4 biocides/pesticides. Five of these 22 compounds were used as indicative substances as proposed by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) (carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, benzotriazole and mecoprop).
   Treatments included UV254 light alone, UV254 + H2O2 and UV254 H2O2+Fe3+. Wastewater coming from the MWTP already contained iron with an average total iron of 1.6 mg L-1. Original pH was not modified and remained between 6 and 7. The parameters changed during the experiments to find the optimal conditions were: wastewater flow rate (2-14 m(3) h(-)1) H2O2 concentration (20-50 mg L-1) and Fe (III) concentration (0-4 mg L-1). Chemicals removal rates were greater than 80% for the majority of the flow rates tested.
   Operating costs for the different conditions evaluated were also estimated and compared. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the use of co-occurring discriminators of sewage and manure was assessed as a potential way to disentangle sewage and manure sources. A suite of human and veterinary derived chemical markers, which includes pharmaceuticals and compound such as food additives, has been identified for this purpose. The suite was selected in such a manner as to provide additional source characterisation, e.g. differentiating raw versus treated sewage inputs. An SPE-LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determined suite of chemical markers with a detection limit of up to 50 pg L-1. This represents one of the lowest limits of detection for pharmaceuticals reported in literature. To illustrate the suitability of the proposed method to differentiate sewage and manure inputs to surface water bodies, results from surface water samples collected at monitoring sites corresponding to specific land use types within Ireland are discussed.

AB Stereoisomeric compositions can provide insights into sources, fate, and ecological risks of contaminants in the environment. In this study, stereoisomeric profiles of ibuprofen and iopromide were investigated in wastewater and receiving surface water of the Pearl River Delta, south China. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of ibuprofen was 0.108-0.188 and 0.480, whereas the isomer ratio (IR) of iopromide was 1.426-1.673 and 1.737-1.898 in the influent and final effluent, respectively, suggesting stereoselective degradation occurred for both pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment. Ibuprofen showed enantioselective degradation in the anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic conditions, whereas iopromide displayed isomer-selective degradation only under the aerobic condition. In the river waters, the EF of ibuprofen was 0.130-0.327 and the IR of iopromide was 1.500-2.531. The results suggested that pharmaceuticals in the mainstream Pearl River were mainly from discharge of treated wastewater, whereas in the tributary rivers and urban canals, direct discharge of untreated wastewater represented a significant contribution. The IR of iopromide can be an applicable and efficient tracer for wastewater discharge in the environment.

AB Direct immersion solid-phase microextraction has been optimized and applied to the simultaneous determination of the neutral and basic pharmaceuticals: caffeine, carbamazepine, clomipramine, chlorprothixene and clotrimazole at low concentrations in municipal wastewater. Two absorption type stationary phases: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyacrylate (PA) have been found to be most effective for extraction of target analytes. The separation and detection were carried out by gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer working in the selected ion monitoring mode. The method was validated for linearity, detection and quantitation limits, selectivity and precision. The average correlation coefficient of the calibration curves was 0.9933. The LOD values in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 10-145 ng L-1 and 4-111 ng L-1, respectively, which were a bit higher than those in the deionized water due to matrix effect. The high values of distribution coefficient (K (fs) ) in PDMS/water and PA/water systems (log K (fs) between 3.05 and 4.23) indicates the very high applicability of these stationary phases for determination of carbamazepine, clomipramine, chlorprothixene and clotrimazole in water samples.

AB Optimization of photocatalytic degradation of phenazopyridine (PhP) under UV light irradiation using immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles was studied. The effect of operational parameters was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum removal efficiency was achieved at the optimum conditions: initial drug concentration of 10 mg/L, UV light intensity of 47 W/m(2), flow rate of 200 mL/min, and reaction time of 150 min. The residence time distribution (RTD) analysis was studied to find the effect of flow rate on the drug removal efficiency. The tracer (PhP) pulse injection response was studied with UV-vis measurements and was used to prepare RTD curves. (c) 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB Pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents are a current and emerging global problem and the development of cost-effective methods to facilitate their removal is needed to mitigate this issue. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), in particular UV/TiO2, have potential for wastewater treatment. In this study, TiO2 anatase phase nanobelts (30-100 nm in width and 10 mu m in length) have been synthesized using a high temperature hydrothermal method as a means to photocatalyze the oxidation of pharmaceutical contaminants. We have investigated a model dye (malachite green), three pharmaceuticals and personal care products-naproxen, carbamazepine, and theophylline-that are difficult to oxidize without AOP processes. TiO2 nanobelts were exposed to 365 nm UV illumination and the measured photocatalytic degradation rates and adsorption parameters of pharmaceuticals were explored using kinetic models. Furthermore we have determined the degree of pharmaceutical degradation as a function of solution pH, illumination time, temperature, and concentration of contaminant. In addition, the roles of active oxygen species-hydroxyl radial (OH center dot), positive holes (h(+)), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-involved were also investigated in the degradation process. These studies offer additional applications of hierarchical TiO2 nanobelt membranes, including those harnessing sunlight for water treatment.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) based on ozone treatments, assisted by ultrasounds, have been investigated at a pilot-plant scale in order to evaluate the removal of emerging contaminants in sewage water. Around 60 emerging contaminants, mainly pharmaceuticals from different therapeutically classes and drugs of abuse, have been determined in urban wastewater samples (treated and untreated) by LC-MS/MS. In a first step, the removal efficiency of these contaminants in conventional sewage water treatment plants was evaluated. Our results indicate that most of the compounds were totally or partially removed during the treatment process of influent wastewater. Up to 30 contaminants were quantified in the influent and effluent samples analysed, being antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and angiotensin II receptor antagonists the most frequently detected. Regarding drugs of abuse, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were the most frequent. In a second step, the effectiveness of AOP in the removal of emerging contaminants remaining in the effluent was evaluated. Ozone treatments have been proven to be highly efficient in the removal, notably decreasing the concentrations for most of the emerging contaminants present in the water samples. The use of ultrasounds, alone or assisting ozone treatments, has been shown less effective, being practically unnecessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports the presence of fossil organic carbon in wastewater and its fate in wastewater treatment plants. The findings pinpoint the inaccuracy of current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines which defines all organic carbon in wastewater to be of biogenic origin. Stable and radiocarbon isotopes (C-13 and C-14) were measured throughout the process train in four municipal wastewater treatment plants equipped with secondary activated sludge treatment. Isotopic mass balance analyses indicate that 4-14% of influent total organic carbon (TOC) is of fossil origin with concentrations between 6 and 35 mg/L; 88 -98% of this is removed from the wastewater. The TOC mass balance analysis suggests that 39-65% of the fossil organic carbon from the influent is incorporated into the activated sludge through adsorption or from cell assimilation while 29-50% is likely transformed to carbon dioxide (CO2) during secondary treatment. The fossil organic carbon fraction in the sludge undergoes further biodegradation during anaerobic digestion with a 12% decrease in mass. 1.4-6.3% of the influent TOC consists of both biogenic and fossil carbon is estimated to be emitted as fossil CO2 from activated sludge treatment alone. The results suggest that current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines, which assume that all CO2 emission from wastewater is biogenic may lead to underestimation of emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater may contain high-value pharmaceutically active compounds such as amlodipine. A hollow-fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) process was developed and applied in the pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater for (S)-amlodipine recovery. The HFSLM system contained O,O'-dibenzoyl-(2S,3S)-tartaric acid ((+)-DBTA) in the liquid membrane phase and beta-cyclodextrin in the stripping phase. The effects of various chemical parameters, including the concentration of the chiral selector in the stripping phase, as well as the type of organic diluent and the carrier concentration in the membrane, were also investigated. Several diluents - hexane, 1-decanol, chlorobenzene, benzene, dichloromethane, ethylene dichloride, and chloroform - with different polarity indexes, from 0.1 to 4.1, were used. The results found that the polarity of the diluents was the main factor influencing the extraction performance and stability of the liquid membrane. Decreasing the polarity of the diluent could prolong membrane stability, but the percentages of extraction and stripping decreased as well. The longest lifetime (150 min) was obtained by using 1-decanol, with a polarity index of 1.8, as a diluent. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fate and removal of 48 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge were investigated in four full-scale sewage treatment plants (STPs). We measured concentrations in both the liquid and solid phases of the sludge to compare the distribution ratios (K-d) between phases before and after digestion. The results showed changes in K-d values of PPCPs with carboxyl or amino functional groups, probably due to a shift of dissociation equilibrium with the increase in pH. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were almost completely degraded (>90%); triclosan, triclocarban, and ofloxacin were moderately degraded (around 30-50%); but carbamazepine was not eliminated. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows (i) the occurrence and removal of several tens of PPCPs by anaerobic sludge digestion in full-scale municipal STPs and (ii) the change of distribution between the liquid and solid phases during digestion.

AB The anti-microbial agent triclosan (TCS), and its derivative methyl-triclosan (Me-TCS), are discharged with treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants to receiving environments. We investigated the bioconcentration of TCS and Me-TCS in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to TCS (100 ng L-1) for 30 days in seawater aquaria (19 +/- 2 degrees C) with fresh phytoplankton as a food source. Bioconcentration increased with time reaching a steady-state around 24-30 days. The bioconcentration factor (log BCF) for TCS were 2.81 L kg-1 (dry weight) and 4.13 L kg(-1), when lipid normalised concentrations were used. Mussels were also deployed in cages at four marine locations receiving effluents from WWTPs. The mean ( SD) TCS and Me-TCS concentrations for mussels from these sites were 9.87 ( +/- 1.34) and 6.99 ( +/- 2.44) mu g kg(-1). The study showed that mussels can be a useful tool for monitoring pollution of TCS and Me-TCS in marine and estuarine environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent studies have shown the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in surface water and sewage samples. A study on rapid removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)-bisphenol AF (BPAF) on multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is significant for understanding how wastewater containing trace recalcitrant or hazardous BPAF was treated. Besides, the sorption behavior and mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, it was found the adsorption kinetics equilibrium followed the pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption isotherms fitted better with Langmuir equation, and the adsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process. The adsorption process was controlled simultaneously by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion, but the external mass transfer processes played an important role in sorption of BPAF. Hydrogen bonds was the main driving force for the adsorption, and pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions were probably extra important mechanisms to the adsorption of BPAF. The MWCNT have higher stability within eight removal-regeneration recycles and up to 95% of recovery could be obtained using ethanol elution. The results of the experiment verified effectiveness for the recovery and removal of BPAF from wastewater samples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The constant detection of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) in the environment demonstrates the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants to completely remove them from wastewaters. So far, many studies have shown the feasibility of using white rot fungi to remove these contaminants. However, none of them have studied the degradation of several PhACs in real urban wastewater under non-sterile conditions, where mixtures of contaminants presents at low concentrations (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) as well as other active microorganisms are present. In this work, a batch fluidized bed bioreactor was used to study, for the first time, the degradation of PhACs present in urban wastewaters at their pre-existent concentrations under non-sterile conditions. Glucose and ammonium tartrate were continuously supplied as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively, and pH was maintained at 4.5. Complete removal of 7 out of the 10 initially detected PhACs was achieved in non-sterile treatment, while only 2 were partially removed and 1 of the PhACs analyzed increased its concentration. In addition, Microtox test showed an important reduction of toxicity in the wastewater after the treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In-stream attenuation was determined for 14 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites. Lagrangian sampling, which follows a parcel of water as it moves downstream, was used to link hydrological and chemical transformation processes. Wastewater loading of neuro-active compounds varied considerably over a span of several hours, and thus a sampling regime was used to verify that the Lagrangian parcel was being sampled and a mechanism was developed to correct measured concentrations if it was not. In-stream attenuation over the 5.4-km evaluated reach could be modeled as pseudo-first-order decay for 11 of the 14 evaluated neuro-active pharmaceutical compounds, illustrating the capacity of streams to reduce conveyance of neuro-active compounds downstream. Fluoxetine and N-desmethyl citalopram were the most rapidly attenuated compounds (t(1/2) = 3.6 +/- 0.3 h, 4.0 +/- 0.2 h, respectively). Lamotrigine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, and carbamazepine were the most persistent (t(1/2) = 12 +/- 2.0 h, 12 +/- 2.6 h, 21 +/- 4.5 h, respectively). Parent compounds (e.g., buproprion, carbamazepine, lamotrigine) generally were more persistent relative to their metabolites. Several compounds (citalopram, venlafaxine, O-desmethyl-venlafaxine) were not attenuated. It was postulated that the primary mechanism of removal for these compounds was interaction with bed sediments and stream biofilms, based on measured concentrations in stream biofilms and a column experiment using stream sediments.

AB A fourteen-month monitoring period (April 2007May 2008) was realized to investigate the removal and occurrence of eight pharmaceutical and personal care compounds, two metabolites and caffeine across the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Agrinio city, located in Western Greece as well as in the discharging sampling point in Acheloos River, which receives the effluents of the plant. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target pollutants and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) for their detection and quantification. All the selected compounds were detected in the wastewater samples. The concentrations determined in the influent of the municipal WWTP ranged between 65.3 and 6679ng L-1 recorded for triclosan and caffeine respectively, while in the effluent ranged between 24.9 and 552ng L-1 observed for triclosan and carbamazepine, respectively. The detected concentration levels in Acheloos River ranged from 37.6ng L-1 for caffeine to 305ng L-1 for paracetamol. Mean total removal efficiencies ranged between 46.3% for carbamazepine and 96.8% for naproxen. The results of this study demonstrate that most of the compounds are being reduced in low levels by municipal wastewater treatment processes but quite significant levels of pharmaceuticals enter river waterways.

AB The efficiency of Al-Quds Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which includes sequential elements as activated sludge, ultrafiltration, activated carbon column and reverse osmosis, to remove spiked ibuprofen, a non steroid anti inflammatory drug (NSAID), was investigated. Kinetic studies in pure water and in the activated sludge indicated that the drug was stable during one month of observation. Besides, the overall performance of the integrated plant showed complete removal of ibuprofen from wastewater. Activated carbon column, which was the last element in the sequence before the reverse osmosis system, yielded 95.7% removal of ibuprofen. Batch adsorptions of the drug by using either activated charcoal or composite micelle-clay system were determined at 25 degrees C and well described by Langmuir isotherms. Octadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA) bromide and montmorillonite were used to prepare the micelle-clay adsorbent, for which the adsorption kinetics are much faster than activated charcoal. Results suggest that integrating clay-micelle complex filters within the existing WWTP may be promising in improving removal efficiency of the NSAID.

AB In this paper, we assessed aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde (GA), a chemical used for the disinfection of hospital materials, using advanced oxidative processes, O-3, and UV, and the combination of the latter two. Assays with different ozone concentrations at distinct pH levels were conducted to determine the best treatment process. GA concentrations before and after each treatment were measured by spectrophotometry. The best treatment was that which combined O-3 and UV, yielding a degradation of 72.0-75.0% in relation to the initial concentration with pH between 4 and 9. Kinetics demonstrated that GA degradation is not dependent on pH, as there was a first-order reaction with a rate constant of k=0.0180 min(-1) for initial pH 9 and of k=0.0179 min(-1) for initial pH 7, that is, the values are virtually the same. Secondary wastewater samples were also analysed using the septic tank/filter system of a regional hospital in Vale do Rio Pardo, state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. In this case, the characteristics of the wastewater were described and, after treatment, a GA degradation rate of 23.3% was noted, with reductions of 75% for chemical oxygen demand, 81% for biochemical oxygen demand, 68% for turbidity, 70% for surfactants and total disinfection in terms of thermotolerant coliforms.

AB In recent years, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in various environmental matrices, including ground water, surface water, and municipal wastewater. In order to evaluate the impact of PPCPs on environment, their distribution must be accurately established in these matrices first, as very limited studies have been carried out especially in the Indian subcontinent. In this study, the occurrence and removal of an antibiotic, Amoxicillin, at a sewage treatment plant (STP) located in Delhi has been studied. Amoxicillin was selected for its widespread use as a prescribed over the counter drug. Sampling exercises were carried out over a period of six months so as to cover seasonal variations. Sewage samples were collected from the influents and effluents of STP to determine the occurrences and removal of the amoxicillin. Concentration of amoxicillin in the untreated raw sewage at the STP varied from not detected (ND) to 172.6ngL(-1). After treatment, it varied from ND to 62.5ngL(-1). Average removal efficiency was 49.7%. Presently, there is great focus on the reuse of the treated sewage. So, findings of the study can help to build a better understanding of reuse options for treated effluents and preparation of appropriate water resources management plans.

AB Pharmaceuticals are released to the environment after human and animal consumption, which partly comes from accumulation in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment. This paper developed a method for the determination of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and 14 pharmaceuticals belonging to multiple therapeutic classes such as antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, anti-hypertensive, and anticonvulsant in dewatered sludge. Pressurized liquid extraction using methanol/McIlvaine buffer (volume ratio, 1:1), associated with HPLC-MS/MS was proven to be effective for extraction and quantification of pharmaceuticals and DEET in dewatered sludge. Optimization procedures, including extraction method, extraction solvents and clean-up treatment, were carried out by simulating naturally aged samples to provide a more realistic extraction than previous methods, which were often done by spiking the standard solution before extraction without any aging procedures. The internal standard quantification method using six isotopically labelled compounds was applied to improve the poor absolute recoveries induced by severe matrix effects to obtain better relative recoveries (70-120%). Good relative standard deviations (lower than 19.0% for 7 repeats) and the limit of quantification (0.6-19.4 mu g/kg) indicated that the developed method was reliable and sensitive to extract and quantify the studied pharmaceuticals in dewatered sludge. For samples collected from eight sewage treatment plants in Beijing, China, it was found that trimethoprim, caffeine, ketoprofen and ibuprofen were the most prominent contaminants, with the median concentrations reaching 97.6, 179.4, 268.0 and 153.0 mu g/kg, respectively. The level of ketoprofen, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, cabamazepine and diclofenac were similar to results reported from Spain, whilst the levels of other compounds were similar to those found in Germany, Canada and the US.

AB This study examined the relationship between molecular properties and the fate of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in the aqueous and solid phases during wastewater treatment by MBR. A set of 29 TrOCs was selected to represent pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones, phytoestrogens, UV-filters and pesticides that occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater. Both adsorption and biodegradation/transformation were found responsible for the removal of TrOCs by MBR treatment. A connection between biodegradation and molecular structure could be observed while adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism for the hydrophobic (log D > 3.2) compounds. Highly hydrophobic (log D > 3.2) but readily biodegradable compounds did not accumulate in sludge. In contrast, recalcitrant compounds with a moderate hydrophobicity, such as carbamazepine, accumulated significantly in the solid phase. The results provide a framework to predict the removal and fate of TrOCs by MBR treatment. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fixed bed reactors with naturally attached biofilms are increasingly used for anaerobic treatment of industry wastewaters due their effective treatment performance. The complex nature of biological reactions in biofilm processes often poses difficulty in analyzing them experimentally, and mathematical models could be very useful for their design and analysis. However, effective application of biofilm reactor models to practical problems suffers due to the lack of knowledge of accurate kinetic models and uncertainty in model parameters. In this work, an inverse modeling approach based on ant colony optimization is proposed and applied to estimate the kinetic and film thickness model parameters of wastewater treatment process in an anaerobic fixed bed biofilm reactor. Experimental data of pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment process are used to determine the model parameters as a consequence of the solution of the rigorous mathematical models of the process. Results were evaluated for different modeling configurations derived from the combination of mathematical models, kinetic expressions, and optimization algorithms. Analysis of results showed that the two-dimensional mathematical model with Haldane kinetics better represents the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in the biofilm reactor. The mathematical and kinetic modeling of this work forms a useful basis for the design and optimization of industry wastewater treating biofilm reactors.

AB This work investigated the application of a solar driven advanced oxidation process (solar Fenton), for the degradation of the antibiotic ofloxacin (OFX) in various environmental matrices at a pilot-scale. All experiments were carried out in a compound parabolic collector pilot plant in the presence of doses of H2O2 (2.5 mg L-1) and at an initial Fe2+ concentration of 2 mg L-1. The water matrices used for the solar Fenton experiments were: demineralized water (DW), simulated natural freshwater (SW), simulated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant (SWW) and pre-treated real effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant (RE) to which OFX had been spiked at 10 mg L-1. Dissolved organic carbon removal was found to be dependent on the chemical composition of the water matrix. OFX mineralization was higher in DW (78.1%) than in SW (58.3%) at 12 mg L-1 of H2O2 consumption, implying the complexation of iron or the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals by the inorganic ions present in SW. On the other hand, the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SWW and RE, led to lower mineralization per dose of H2O2 compared to DW and SW. The major transformation products (TPs) formed during the solar Fenton treatment of OFX, were elucidated using liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ToF-MS). The transformation of OFX proceeded through a defluorination reaction, accompanied by some degree of piperazine and quinolone substituent transformation while a hydroxylation mechanism occurred by attack of the hydroxyl radicals generated during the process leading to the formation of TPs in all the water matrices, seven of which were tentatively identified. The results obtained from the toxicity bioassays indicated that the toxicity originates from the DOM present in RE and its oxidation products formed during the photocatalytic treatment and not from the TPs resulted from the oxidation of OFX.

AB To better understand the environmental mobility of sulfonamide antibiotics and develop improved processes for their removal during wastewater treatment, stirred cell ultrafiltration (UF) experiments were conducted using both synthetic and real wastewater effluent. The interactions between selected sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfathiazole and sulfamerazine), solids and dissolved organic matter were systematically explored. The further impact of micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF), a process in which surfactants are added at micellar concentrations to enhance removal of various trace contaminants from aqueous streams, was then explored by using a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Ultrafiltration of sulfonamides in the absence of other materials generally removed only 15-20% of the antibiotics. The presence of micellar solutions of CTAB generally improved removal of sulfonamides over UF alone, with rejections ranging from 20 to 74%. Environmental solids (sediment) further increased retention of sulfonamides using both UF and MEUF, but the presence of DOM did not influence rejection. Similar trends were observed on UF and MEUF of real effluent samples that had been spiked with the sulfonamides, confirming the environmental relevance of the observed interactions between sulfonamides, surfactant, and wastewater constituents. The results demonstrate that MEUF processes can be designed for the selective removal of such trace contaminants as sulfonamide antibiotics. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Consumption of illicit drugs is a new concern for water management that must be considered not only because of the social and public health aspects but also in an environmental context in relation with the contamination of surface waters. Indeed, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents contain drug residues that have not been eliminated since STP treatments are not completely efficient in their removal.
   We developed and validated an HPLC-MS/MS analytical method to assess the concentrations of 17 illicit drugs and metabolites in raw urban wastewaters: cocaine and its metabolites, amphetamine and amphetamine-likes (methamphetamine, MDMA, MDEA, MDA), opiates and opiate substitutes (methadone and buprenorphine), and THC-COOH cannabis metabolite.
   This method has been applied to the analysis of influent and effluent samples from 25 STPs located in France all over the country. The results allowed evaluating the drug consumption in the areas connected to the STPs and the efficiency of the treatment technology implied.
   We selected STPs according to their volume capacity, their treatment technologies (biofilters, activated sludges, MBR) and their geographical location.
   In influents, the concentrations varied between 6 ng/L for EDDP (main metabolite of methadone) and 3050 ng/L for benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite). Consumption maps were drawn for cocaine, MDMA, opiates, cannabis and amphetamine-like compounds. Geographical significant differences were observed and highlighted the fact that drug consumption inside a country is not homogeneous. In parallel, comparisons between STP technology processes showed differences of efficiency. More, some compounds appear very resistant to SW processes leading to the contamination of receiving water.

AB The development of human society entails increased industrial activity and consequently the release of a large number of chemical substances including solvents, detergents and pharmaceutical products which reach water bodies through the discharge of industrial effluents, damaging the organisms living in these ecosystems. This study aimed to determine oxidative stress induced on the common carp Cyprinus carpio by effluent from a pharmaceutical plant that manufactures nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The median lethal concentration and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed to the latter value (0.1173 %) for different exposure periods (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h), and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P<0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC particularly in gill of effluent-exposed specimens. SOD, CAT and GPx activity in gill also increased with respect to the control group. This particular industrial effluent is therefore concluded to induce oxidative stress on C. carpio, this damage being most evident in gill.

AB Wastewater from a pharmaceutical formulation facility (TevaKS, Israel) was treated with a biological activated-sludge system followed by ozonation. The goal was to reduce the concentrations of the drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and venlafaxine (VLX) before discharging the wastewater to the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Both drugs were detected at extremely high concentrations in TevaKS raw wastewater ([VLX] = 11.72 +/- 2.2 mg/L, [CBZ] = 0.84 +/- 0.19 mg/L), and resisted the biological treatment. Ozone efficiently degraded CBZ: at an 03 dose-to-dissolved organic carbon ratio of 0.55 (O-3/DOC), the concentration of CBZ was reduced by >99%. A lower removal rate was observed for VLX, which was decreased by similar to 98% at the higher O-3/DOC ratio of 0.87. Decreasing the pH of the biologically treated effluent from 7 to 5 significantly increased the ozone degradation rate of CBZ, while decreasing the degradation rate of VLX. Ozone treatment did not alter the concentration of the effluent's DOC and filtered chemical oxygen demand (CODf). However, a significant increase was recorded (following ozonation) in the effluent's biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and the BOD5/CODf ratio. This implies an increase in the effluent's biodegradability, which is highly desirable if ozonation is followed by a domestic biological treatment. Different organic byproducts were formed following ozone reaction with the target pharmaceuticals and with the effluent organic matter; however, these byproducts are expected to be removed during biological treatment in the municipal WWTP.

AB Electrochemical (EC) residual disinfection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence and absence of primary sludge particulates (PSPs) was studied. The kinetics followed a first-order rate law. When PSPs were absent, the EC residual disinfection rate coefficient (k) increased linearly with EC pretreatment energy (E-C, 0-0.63 kWh/m(3)). However, with 143 mg PSPs/L, Is first increased linearly with E-C (0-0.28 kWh/m(3)) and then decreased linearly with E-C (0.28-0.42 kWh/m(3)). H2O2 was detected during EC pretreatment in PSPs-free samples and the H2O2. concentration (C-H) increased with E-C (0-0.83 kWh/m(3)) linearly. Chloride was detected in PSPs aqueous samples (143 mg PSPs/L) and its concentration (C-C) changed during EC pretreatment: initially, a decrease of C-C was observed when E-C increased from 0 to 0.28 kWh/m(3), followed by an increase of C-C when E-C increased 0.28-0.42 kWh/m(3). In both cases, k correlated to the initial post-EC chloride concentration (C-CI) in an inverse linear relationship. This two-stage change of C-C and k was caused by a combination of two reactions: anodic oxidation of chloride and the reaction of chloramines with excess chlorine. This paper explains the mechanisms underlying EC residual disinfection in the presence and absence of PSPs, and proposes a feasible strategy for EC disinfection when PSPs are present, an approach that could be useful in the treatment of combined sewage overflow (CSO).

AB The influence of industrial (pharmaceutical and chemical) wastewater composition on membrane bioreactor (MBR) performance was investigated in a pilot-scale installation. The study focussed on nitrification performance, which was evaluated based on influent and effluent parameters as well as batch nitrification rate tests. The industrial wastewater was pumped into the MBR in a mixture with municipal wastewater at constant flow rate. The loading of the MBR with industrial wastewater was increased stepwise from 0 to 75% share in the mixed influent to study the adaptation of nitrifying bacteria.
   Stable nitrification performance was observed until the content of industrial wastewater in the influent reached 40%, with effluent values of around 0.56 mg L-1 NH4-N and 98.3% ammonia removal. Breakdown of nitratation was observed at a 40% industrial wastewater dose and breakdown of nitritation at a 50% dose, respectively. However, after several months of adaptation, both processes recovered. No nitrification was observed when the industrial wastewater share exceeded 50%. Adaptation of nitrifying bacteria in the MBR was also confirmed by results of kinetic tests. The inhibition effect of the concentrated industrial wastewater to the MBR sludge decreased substantially after several months of exposure, while the inhibition of referential activated sludge remained constant.

AB Water and wastewater treatment and conveyance account for approximately 4% of US electric consumption, with 80% used for conveyance. Net zero water (NZW) buildings would alleviate demands for a portion of this energy, for water, and for the treatment of drinking water for pesticides and toxic chemical releases in source water. However, domestic wastewater contains nitrogen loads much greater than urban/suburban ecosystems can typically absorb. The purpose of this work was to identify a first design of a denitrifying urban NZW treatment process, operating at ambient temperature and pressure and circum-neutral pH, and providing mineralization of pharmaceuticals (not easily regulated in terms of environmental half-life), based on laboratory tests and mass balance and kinetic modeling. The proposed treatment process is comprised of membrane bioreactor, iron-mediated aeration (IMA, reported previously), vacuum ultrafiltration, and peroxone advanced oxidation, with minor rainwater make-up and H2O2 disinfection residual. Similar to biological systems, minerals accumulate subject to precipitative removal by IMA, salt-free treatment, and minor dilution. Based on laboratory and modeling results, the system can produce potable water with moderate mineral content from commingled domestic wastewater and 10-20% rainwater make-up, under ambient conditions at individual buildings, while denitrifying and reducing chemical oxygen demand to below detection (<3 mg/L). While economics appear competitive, further development and study of steady-state concentrations and sludge management options are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bacterial community shift on a lab scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater and exposed to 50 mu g L-1 of sulfamethoxazole (SFX) for 2 months was investigated in this study. The impact on biological nutrient removal performance and SEX removal efficiencies were also studied. Satisfactory biological nutrient removal was observed as regards to COD and Nitrogen. SFX removal efficiencies ranged between 20% and 50% throughout the experimental period, enhanced within the aerobic phases of the SBR cycle, with no evident signs of biomass acclimation. Nevertheless, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed significant variance leading to not only the fading, but also the emergence of new species in the bioreactor bacterial community after SFX dosage. According to the phylogenetic analysis, bacteria belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes were the dominant species, among them, the Thiotrix spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) cell number increased due to its tolerance to the antibiotic. On the other hand, the classes Sphingobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Chlorobi were found to be more vulnerable to the antibiotic load and disappeared. The sulphonamide resistance gene sull was also quantified and discussed, as there are very few studies on bacterial resistance in lab-scale treatment reactors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence, partitioning and risk of eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), nine new brominated (NBFRs) and ten organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) were evaluated in three Spanish rivers suffering different anthropogenic pressures (Nalon, Arga and Besos). OPERs were ubiquitous contaminants in water (Sigma PFRs ranging from 0.0076 to 7.2 mu g L-1) and sediments (Sigma OPERs ranging 3.8 to 824 mu g kg(-1)). Brominated flame retardants were not detected in waters, whereas Sigma PBDEs ranged from 88 to 812 mu g kg(-1) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) reached 435 mu g kg(-1) in sediments from the River Besos, the most impacted river. The occurrence of flame retardants in river water and sediment was clearly associated with human activities, since the highest levels occurred near urban and industrial zones and after wastewater treatment plants discharge. Daphnia magna toxicity was carried out for OPERs, the most ubiquitous flame retardants, considering individual compounds and mixtures. Toxicity of nine tested OPERs differed largely among compounds, with EC50 values ranging over three magnitude orders (031-381 mg L-1). Results evidenced that these compounds act by non-polar narcosis, since their toxicity was proportional to their lipophilicity (K-ow). Furthermore, their joint toxicity was additive, which means that single and joint toxicity can be predicted knowing their concentration levels in water using quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) and predictive mixture models. Based on these results, a risk assessment considering joint effect was performed calculating and summing risk quotients (RQs) for the water and sediment samples. No significant risk to D. magna (Sigma RQs <1) was observed for any of the monitored rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Passive and composite sampling in combination with in vitro bioassays and identification and quantification of individual chemicals were applied to characterize pollution by compounds with several specific modes of action in urban area in the basin of two rivers, with 400,000 inhabitants and a variety of industrial activities. Two types of passive samplers, semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD) for hydrophobic contaminants and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) for polar compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, were used to sample wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent as well as rivers upstream and downstream of the urban complex and the WWTP. Compounds with endocrine disruptive potency were detected in river water and WWTP influent and effluent. Year-round, monthly assessment of waste waters by bioassays documented estrogenic, androgenic and dioxin-like potency as well as cytotoxicity in influent waters of the WWTP and allowed characterization of seasonal variability of these biological potentials in waste waters. The WWTP effectively removed cytotoxic compounds, xenoestrogens and xenoandrogens. There was significant variability in treatment efficiency of dioxin-like potency. The study indicates that the WWTP, despite its up-to-date technology, can contribute endocrine disrupting compounds to the river. Riverine samples exhibited dioxin-like, antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic potencies. The study design enabled characterization of effects of the urban complex and the WWTP on the river. Concentrations of PAHs and contaminants and specific biological potencies sampled by POCIS decreased as a function of distance from the city. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most used pharmaceutical drugs, due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties that turn it into a primary choice in varied pathologies and conditions. However, and despite its massive use, acetaminophen is not exempt of adverse effects, especially when administered in over dosage, which are related to the formation of toxic metabolites by oxidative pathways. It is thus possible to observe that toxicity caused by acetaminophen is usually mediated by reactive oxygen species and can result in multiple effects, ranging from protein denaturation to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. The occurrence of acetaminophen has been reported in the aquatic environment, being important to address the potential exertion of toxic effects on nontarget environmentally exposed organisms. The present study intended to characterize the effects of acute acetaminophen exposure on physiological traits (antioxidant defense, oxidative damage) of two species of bivalves, namely, the edible clams Venerupis decussata and Venerupis philippinarum. Results showed a significant increase in all oxidative stress biomarkers, evidencing the bioactivation of acetaminophen into a deleterious prooxidant, triggering the onset of deleterious effects. Furthermore, strong interspecific differences were observed among responses of the two tested species, which was a major issue due to intrinsic ecological implications when one considers that both species share the same habitat.

AB The present study evaluated the potential environmental concentrations of 4 cytostatic (also known as cytotoxic) drugs in rivers. The antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and its pro-drug capecitabine were examined based on their very high use rates, cyclophosphamide (CP) for its persistence, and carboplatin for its association with the metal element platinum. The study combined drug consumption information across European countries, excretion, national water use, and sewage removal rates to derive sewage effluent values across the continent. Results showed considerable variation in the popularity of individual cytostatic drugs across Europe, including a 28-fold difference in 5FU use and 15-fold difference in CP use. Such variations could have a major effect on the detection of these compounds in effluent or river water. Overall, capecitabine and CP had higher predicted levels in effluent than 5FU or carboplatin. Predicted effluent values were compared with measurements in the literature, and many non-detects could be explained by insufficient limits of detection. Linking the geographic based water resources model GWAVA with this information allowed water concentrations throughout 1.2 million km of European rivers to be predicted. The 90th percentile (worst case) prediction indicated that, with the exception of capecitabine, more than 99% of Europe's rivers (by length) would have concentrations below 1 ng/L for these cytostatic drugs. For capecitabine, 2.2% of river length could exceed 1 ng/L. (C) 2013 SETAC

AB The objective of this study was to examine the oestrogen and androgen hormone removal efficiency of reactive (Connelly zero-valent iron (ZVI), Gotthart Maier ZVI) and sorptive (AquaSorb 101 granular activated carbon (GAC) and OrganoLoc PM-100 organoclay (OC)) materials from HPLC grade water and constructed wetland system (CWS) treated dairy farm wastewater. Batch test studies were performed and hormone concentration analysis carried out using highly sensitive reporter gene assays (RGAs). The results showed that hormonal interaction with these materials is selective for individual classes of hormones. Connelly ZVI and AquaSorb 101 GAC were more efficient in removing testosterone (Te) than 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and showed faster removal rates of oestrogen and androgen than the other materials. Gotthart Maier ZVI was more efficient in removing E2 than Te. OrganoLoc PM-100 OC achieved the lowest final concentration of E2 equivalent (EEQ) and provided maximum removal of both oestrogens and androgens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of effluent wastewaters from four different hospitals: a university (1456 beds), a general (350 beds), a pediatric (110 beds) and a maternity hospital (96 beds), which are conveyed to the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), was evaluated in the receiving urban wastewaters. The occurrence of 78 pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutic classes was assessed in hospital effluents and WWTP wastewaters (influent and effluent) as well as the contribution of each hospital in WWTP influent in terms of pharmaceutical load. Results indicate that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in both hospital and urban wastewaters. The contribution of hospitals to the input of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewaters widely varies, according to their dimension. The estimated total mass loadings were 306 g d(-1) for the university hospital, 155 g d(-1) for the general one, 14 g d(-1) for the pediatric hospital and 1.5 g d(-1) for the maternity hospital, showing that the biggest hospitals have a greater contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, analysis of individual contributions of each therapeutic group showed that NSAIDs, analgesics and antibiotics are among the groups with the highest inputs.
   Removal efficiency can go from over 90% for pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to not removal for beta-blockers and salbutamol. Total mass load of pharmaceuticals into receiving surface waters was estimated between 5 and 14 g/d/1000 inhabitants.
   Finally, the environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals detected in hospital and WWTP effluents was assessed by means of hazard quotients toward different trophic levels (algae, daphnids and fish). Several pharmaceuticals present in the different matrices were identified as potentially hazardous to aquatic organisms, showing that especial attention should be paid to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin and clarithromycin, since their hazard quotients in WWTP effluent revealed that they could pose an ecotoxicological risk to algae.

AB Groundwater in urban areas can be affected by numerous wastewater sources. Distinguishing these sources can facilitate better management of urban water resources and wastewater, and protection of urban aquatic environments. A single wastewater tracer, even if ideal (i.e. low background levels, non-reactive, low detection limits, etc.), would be unable to accomplish this task. Here, we investigated the potential advantages of using a suite of anthropogenic chemicals as co-tracers to distinguish wastewater sources that contribute to groundwater contamination at two urban sites. We considered both relatively ubiquitous and non-ubiquitous tracers in wastewater. At the Jasper (Alberta, Canada) site, concentrations of an artificial sweetener, two pharmaceutical compounds, and a degradate of nicotine in groundwater were strongly correlated as co-tracers. This evidence, along with the similar spatial distributions of these co-tracers could be used to delineate and distinguish a single municipal wastewater plume. At the Barrie (Ontario, Canada) site, there was moderate to strong correlation of the wastewater co-tracers, but local differences in their distributions and in the ratios of their concentrations could be used to infer that mixtures of two or more domestic septic plumes were present in the groundwater at this site. This study demonstrates the benefit of applying a suite of tracers to urban groundwater affected by wastewater contamination. This approach should be applicable at other urban sites.

AB Continuous release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) present in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is nowadays leading to the adoption of specific measures within the framework of the Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive). The ozonation process, normally employed for drinking water production, has also proven its potential to eliminate PPCPs from secondary effluents in spite of their low concentrations. However, there is a significant drawback related with the costs associated with its implementation. This lack of studies is especially pronounced regarding the economic valuation of the environmental benefits associated to avoid the discharge of these pollutants into water bodies. For the first time the shadow prices of 5 PPCPs which are ethynilestradiol, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, tonalide and galaxolide from treated effluent using a pilot-scale ozonation reactor have been estimated. From non-sensitive areas their values are -73.73; -34.95; -42.20; -10.98; and -8.67 respectively and expressed in (sic)/kg. They represent a proxy to the economic value of the environmental benefits arisen from undischarged pollutants. This paper contributes to value the environmental benefits of implementing post-treatment processes aimed to achieve the quality standards required by the Priority Substances Directive.

   EQUILIBRIUM ADSORPTION
AB Many organic micropollutants present in wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides, are poorly removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To reduce the release of these substances into the aquatic environment, advanced wastewater treatments are necessary. In this context, two large-scale pilot advanced treatments were tested in parallel over more than one year at the municipal WWTP of Lausanne, Switzerland. The treatments were: i) oxidation by ozone followed by sand filtration (SF) and ii) powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption followed by either ultrafiltration (UF) or sand filtration. More than 70 potentially problematic substances (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, endocrine disruptors, drug metabolites and other common chemicals) were regularly measured at different stages of treatment. Additionally, several ecotoxicological tests such as the Yeast Estrogen Screen, a combined algae bioassay and a fish early life stage test were performed to evaluate effluent toxicity. Both treatments significantly improved the effluent quality. Micropollutants were removed on average over 80% compared with raw wastewater, with an average ozone dose of 5.7 mg O-3 I-1 or a PAC dose between 10 and 20 mg I-1. Depending on the chemical properties of the substances (presence of electron-rich moieties, charge and hydrophobicity), either ozone or PAC performed better. Both advanced treatments led to a clear reduction in toxicity of the effluents, with PAC-UF performing slightly better overall. As both treatments had, on average, relatively similar efficiency, further criteria relevant to their implementation were considered, including local constraints (e.g., safety, sludge disposal, disinfection), operational feasibility and cost. For sensitive receiving waters (drinking water resources or recreational waters), the PAC-UF treatment, despite its current higher cost, was considered to be the most suitable option, enabling good removal of most micropollutants and macropollutants without forming problematic by-products, the strongest decrease in toxicity and a total disinfection of the effluent.

AB Concentrations of 17 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and their major metabolites (bupropion, hydroxy-bupropion, erythro-hydrobupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, carbamazepine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine, citalopram, N-desmethyl-citalopram, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, 2-N-glucuronide-lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine), were measured in treated wastewater and receiving surface waters from 24 locations across Minnesota, USA. The analysis of upstream and downstream sampling sites indicated that the wastewater treatment plants were the major source of the neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites in surface waters of Minnesota. Concentrations of parent compound and the associated metabolite varied substantially between treatment plants (concentrations +/- standard deviation of the parent compound relative to its major metabolite) as illustrated by the following examples; bupropion and hydrobupropion 700 +/- 1000 ng L-1, 2100 +/- 1700 ng L-1, carbamazepine and 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine 480 +/- 380 ng L-1, 360 +/- 400 ng L-1, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine 1400 +/- 1300 ng L-1, 1800 +/- 2300 ng L-1. Metabolites of the neuro-active compounds were commonly found at higher or comparable concentrations to the parent compounds in wastewater effluent and the receiving surface water. Neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites were detected only sporadically in samples upstream from the effluent outfall. Metabolite to parent ratios were used to evaluate transformation, and we determined that ratios in wastewater were much lower than those reported in urine, indicating that the metabolites are relatively more labile than the parent compounds in the treatment plants and in receiving waters. The widespread occurrence of neuro-active pharmaceuticals and metabolites in Minnesota effluents and surface waters indicate that this is likely a global environmental issue, and further understanding of the environmental fate and impacts of these compounds is warranted.

AB A monitoring program was initiated for two sewage outfalls (OA and OB) with different land uses (mainly residential versus institutional) over the course of a year. Eleven CSO events resulting from fall and summer precipitations and a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation in late winter and early spring were monitored. Median concentrations measured in CSOs were 1.5 x 10(6) Escherichia coli/100 mL, 136.0 mg/L of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 4599.0 ng/L of caffeine (CAF), 158.9 ng/L of carbamazepine (CBZ), in outfall OA and 5.1 x 10(4) E. coli/100 mL, 167.0 mg TSS/L, 300.8 ng CAF/L, 4.1 ng CBZ/L, in outfall OB. Concentration dynamics in CSOs were mostly related to the dilution by stormwater and the time of day of the onset of overflows. Snowmelt was identified as a critical period with regards to the protection of drinking water sources given the high contaminant concentrations and long duration of events in addition to a lack of restrictions on overflows during this period. Correlations among measured parameters reflected the origins and transport pathways of the contaminants, with E. coli being correlated with CBZ. TSS were not correlated with E. coli because E. coli was found to be mostly associated with raw sewage whereas TSS were additionally from the resuspension of in-sewer deposits and surface runoff. In receiving waters, E. coli remained the best indicator of fecal contamination in strongly diluted water samples as compared to WWMPs because WWMPs can be diluted to below their detection limits.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants in a hybrid biofilm-activated sludge process was investigated through batch experiments, modeling, and full-scale measurements. Batch experiments with carriers and activated sludge from the same full-scale reactor were performed to assess the micropollutant removal rates of the carrier biofilm under oxic conditions and the sludge under oxic and anoxic conditions. Clear differences in the micropollutant removal kinetics of the attached and suspended growth were demonstrated, often with considerably higher removal rates for the biofilm compared to the sludge. For several micropollutants, the removal rates were also affected by the redox conditions, i.e. oxic and anoxic. Removal rates obtained from the batch experiments were used to model the micropollutant removal in the full-scale process. The results from the model and plant measurements showed that the removal efficiency of the process can be predicted with acceptable accuracy (+/- 25%) for most of the modeled micropollutants. Furthermore, the model estimations indicate that the attached growth in hybrid biofilm-activated sludge processes can contribute significantly to the removal of individual compounds, such as diclofenac.

AB The performance of a lab-scale submerged membrane bioreactor system (SMBR) for treating a process wastewater containing the pharmaceutical active compound (PhAc) etodolac with four different microfiltration (MF) membranes (MP005, MV02, CA, and MCE) was investigated at three different sludge retention times (SRTs) under constant pressure. In the first phase of the study, the continuous bioreactor system was operated at SRTs of 15 and 30 days and without sludge wasting (WSW). After steady state conditions were reached, the SMBR process was started as the second phase. Short-term filtration (24 h) tests were conducted for each SRT. When the SRTs were increased, both permeate volumes and steady-state flux values increased. The best etodolac removals were obtained in case of WSW for both bioreactor system and SMBR. The etodolac removals achieved by the different membranes for the period WSW were observed in the following order: MV02 = MP005 > CA = MCE. In addition, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies for bioreactor system and SMBR were approximately 80 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 2%, respectively, at all SRTs. The COD removals at each of the three SRTs were similar for all of the membranes. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and soluble microbial products (SMPs) were analyzed as fouling control factors. Increasing the SRT caused increases in sludge concentrations in the SMBR as well as in increased etodolac removal, while EPS and SMP protein and carbohydrate concentrations decreased. Fouling on the pores and surfaces of the membranes were characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and contact angle measurements. The resistance in series model was used to evaluate the flux decline caused by the gel layer, cake resistance, and internal pore blocking in the MF membranes at the three different SRTs.

AB The use of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals is increasing. Over the past decade, there has been a proliferation of research into potential environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment. A Royal Society-supported seminar brought together experts from diverse scientific fields to discuss the risks posed by pharmaceuticals to wildlife. Recent analytical advances have revealed that pharmaceuticals are entering habitats via water, sewage, manure and animal carcases, and dispersing through food chains. Pharmaceuticals are designed to alter physiology at low doses and so can be particularly potent contaminants. The near extinction of Asian vultures following exposure to diclofenac is the key example where exposure to a pharmaceutical caused a population-level impact on non-target wildlife. However, more subtle changes to behaviour and physiology are rarely studied and poorly understood. Grand challenges for the future include developing more realistic exposure assessments for wildlife, assessing the impacts of mixtures of pharmaceuticals in combination with other environmental stressors and estimating the risks from pharmaceutical manufacturing and usage in developing countries. We concluded that an integration of diverse approaches is required to predict 'unexpected' risks; specifically, ecologically relevant, often long-term and non-lethal, consequences of pharmaceuticals in the environment for wildlife and ecosystems.

AB The direct discharge of effluent wastewater into Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva) results in the formation of an effluent plume with locally high concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants. The micropollutant hotspots above the wastewater outfall present a potential ecotoxicological risk, yet the spatial extent of the plume and the associated ecotoxicological risk zone remain unclear. This work combines the two main processes affecting the spreading of the plume, namely dilution of micropollutants due to mixing and degradation by photolysis, into a coupled hydrodynamic-photolysis model, with which we estimated the spatial extent of the risk zone in Vidy Bay. The concentration of micropollutants around the wastewater outfall was simulated for typical wind scenarios and seasons relevant to Vidy Bay, and the resulting ecotoxicological risk was evaluated. Specifically, we determined the direct and indirect photolysis rate constants for 24 wastewater-derived micropollutants and implemented these in a hydrodynamic particle tracking model, which tracked the movement of water parcels from the wastewater outfall. Simulations showed that owing to thermal stratification, the zone of ecotoxicological risk is largest in summer and extends horizontally over 300 m from the outfall. Photolysis processes contribute to reducing the plume extent mainly under unstratified conditions when the plume surfaces. Moreover, it was shown that only a few compounds, mainly antibiotics, dominate the total ecotoxicological risk.

AB Antibiotics including three beta-lactams, two fluoroquinolones and two macrolides, which were the top seven most prescribed antibiotics in Dalian, China, were selected to investigate their occurrence in six municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their distribution in the effluent-receiving waters of the Yellow Sea. Four WWTPs employing different treatment technologies were selected to explore the mechanism of antibiotics elimination during wastewater treatment. Results showed that fluoroquinolones and macrolides were dominant species in both WWTPs effluents and the surveyed coastal waters. Biodegradation was the main pathway for beta-lactams removal, however, primary treatment performed better than biological treatment for fluoroquinolones removal. Concentrations of macrolides increased dramatically after the biological treatment, which was probably due to the release of macrolides enclosed in feces particles. In the surveyed coastal waters, reduction of antibiotic concentration with distance was observed. Potential environmental risk caused by the occurrence of these antibiotics should be evaluated in future work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of some veterinary medicines in the livestock wastewater plants (WWTPs) was investigated. This investigation represented the occurrence of veterinary medicines to treat in the livestock WWTPs or be discharged into the water system in Korea since the sampling sites were widely distributed across the nation and samples were collected from the 11 livestock WWTPs. Nine antibiotics, two analgesics, and two disinfectants occurred in the livestock wastewater plants (WWTPs). From 11 livestock WWTP influents, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, acetylsalicylic acid, and disinfectants frequently occurred with the high concentrations. Meanwhile, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-H2O, and trimethoprim did not occur during sampling periods. The values for log Kow of each chemical showed a high correlation with the number of hydrogen bonding acceptors and were important parameters to estimate and understand the biodegradability and toxicity of a compound in the environment. The biodegradability of each compound was proportional to the hydrophilicity of each compound and the toxicity was proportional to the number of hydrogen bonding acceptors of each compound. The expected introductory concentration (EIC), predicted exposure concentration (PEC), and hazard quotient showed that the livestock WWTP effluents were hazardous to ecosystems.

AB In 2008, Lake Havasu City, Arizona, began a treated wastewater subsurface recharge program at its North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRP) to store treated wastewater, which is planned to be seasonally recovered for irrigation during the summer months. As a proactive measure, the city decided to monitor a suite of pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants (PECs) along with required regulatory constituents, e. g., nitrate. Potential contributing sources of PECs throughout the water system were identified, resulting in only six constituents detected in the untreated drinking water and treated drinking water, all at concentrations less than 50 ng/L. Thirty-three of 40 PECs analyzed were identified in the city's treated wastewater streams, with concentrations ranging from just above the detection level to 9000 ng/L (pseudoephedrine), clearly showing the dominating local urban use of these compounds. NRP treated wastewater is recharged via vadose zone injection wells. It migrates through alluvial fans sediments, some containing interstitial clays, forming a water mound and blending with groundwater of the Colorado River Aquifer. Sixteen of 33 PECs present in the NRP treated wastewater have concentrations above detection limits (>10 ng/L) within 150 m (492 ft) of the injection wells. Six PECs (sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, primidone, phenytoin, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and meprobamate) remained above their respective detection limit in monitoring wells that penetrate sediments largely free of clay more than 560 m (1,840 ft) away from the injection wells.

ID REMOVAL
AB Tannin rigid foams are presented as novel adsorbents for wastewater remediation. Although these materials are known since long time ago, this is one of the newest applications in environmental technology. The efficiency of the different combinations of reagents in the foam synthesis were studied by using Response Surface Methodology, and the optimum category was subsequently tested on dye, surfactant and pharmaceutical removal. The results are promising for the three types of pollutant. Structural differences based on FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and other superficial characterization techniques confirmed the intrinsic adsorption benefits of this optimum category if compared with other tannin rigid foams. Optimum tannin rigid foam was obtained with 0.03 g of furfuryl alcohol, 0.11 g of formaldehyde, 0.25 g of diethyl ether and 0.20 g of p-toluensulfonic acid per g of Weibull Black tannin extract. With this combination of reagents, up to 250 mg g(-1) of Methylene Blue removal was reached and a significant elimination of several dyes and surfactants was feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The marine-estuarine polychaete Capitella is an indicator of organic pollution and plays important roles in sewage waste cycling. The antidepressant fluoxetine can be accumulated in streams and sewage effluents and it could pose a hazard to infauna. Effects of fluoxetine on feeding and growth of Capitella teleta were investigated through the exposure to 0, 0.001, 0.03, 0.3 and 33 mu g/g dry weight sediment-spiked fluoxetine during 18 days. No effects of fluoxetine concentrations were observed on egestion rates, body weight and size-specific egestion rates. Fluoxetine favoured the occurrence of males with abnormal genital spines. This suggests that fluoxetine can have important reproductive implications. Further studies are recommended to assess potential detrimental effects on benthic infauna inhabiting close to sewage treatment plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are largely unregulated, water resource recovery facilities are increasingly using advanced chemical/physical treatment technologies (e.g., advanced oxidation and reverse osmosis) to remove or destroy these trace organic contaminants (TOrCs). This can both reduce potential adverse human health effects in reuse applications and mitigate environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. Unfortunately, advanced treatment technologies are typically energy intensive and costly to implement, operate, and maintain. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimization of solids retention time (SRT) provided sufficient benefits to warrant such operational strategies for TOrC mitigation. Specifically, SRTs of 5.5, 6, and 15 days were evaluated to determine the effects on several standard wastewater parameters (e.g., nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia concentrations) and the degradation of TOrCs. The experimental SRTs were operated simultaneously in parallel, full-scale activated sludge basins. The results indicate that it can be beneficial to implement biological process optimization strategies using existing infrastructure while reducing reliance on advanced treatment technologies. This study also identified potential operational issues that might arise in activated sludge systems operating at extended SRTs.

AB The removal of six endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (NP), was investigated in 20 rural wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) located in a county of Zhejiang Province, China. These WWTFs adopted one of the four treatment processes: activated sludge (AS), constructed wetland (CW), stabilization pond (SP), and micro-power biofilm reactor (MP). Results indicate that all the six EDCs were detected in wastewater samples with NP showing a maximum detection frequency (97%) and a maximum influent concentration (5002 ng L-1). After biological treatment, the concentrations of E2, E3 and NP decreased remarkably, while El, EE2 and BPA exhibited varying removal efficiencies that depended on the specific treatment process and sampling season. In general, the centralized AS process outperformed those decentralized processes (i.e., CW, SP and MP) and a higher removal of El, EE2, NP and BPA in the AS process was observed in summer (>70%) than in winter. Among the three decentralized processes, the removal of EDCs in the SP process was limited, especially for El, EE2 and BPA (18-46%) in winter. Due to an incomplete removal, the total concentration of target EDCs increased obviously in the mixing and downstream sections of a local river receiving the effluent from a typical WWTF (practicing AS). This study reveals that the design and operation of rural WWTFs should be optimized if an effective removal of EDCs is to be achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Health care waste includes all the waste generated by health care establishments, research facilities, and laboratories. This constitutes a variety of chemical substances, such as pharmaceuticals, radionuclides, solvents, and disinfectants. Recently, scientists and environmentalists have discovered that wastewater produced by hospitals possesses toxic properties due to various toxic chemicals and pharmaceuticals capable of causing environmental impacts and even lethal effects to organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Many of these compounds resist normal wastewater treatment and end up in surface waters. Besides aquatic organisms, humans can be exposed through drinking water produced from contaminated surface water. Indeed, some of the substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be potential contributors to certain cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of wastewaters from two hospitals and three clinical diagnostic centers located in Jaipur (Rajasthan State), India using the prokaryotic Salmonella mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and the eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae respiration inhibition assay. In the Ames assay, untreated wastewaters from both of the health care sectors resulted in significantly increased numbers of revertant colonies up to 1,000-4,050 as measured by the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains (with and without metabolic activation) after exposure to undiluted samples, which indicated the highly genotoxic nature of these wastewaters. Furthermore, both hospital and diagnostic samples were found to be highly cytotoxic. Effective concentrations at which 20 % (EC20) and 50 % (EC50) inhibition of the respiration rate of the cells occurred ranged between similar to 0.00 and 0.52 % and between 0.005 and 41.30 % (calculated with the help of the MS excel software XLSTAT 2012.1.01; Addinsoft), respectively, as determined by the S. cerevisiae assay. The results indicated that hospital wastewaters contain genotoxic and cytotoxic components. In addition, diagnostic centers also represent small but significant sources of genotoxic and cytotoxic wastes.

ID RISK
AB A rapid, sensitive and highly specific HPLC-MS/MS method with direct on-line preparation was applied for the determination of 20 common pharmaceuticals in hospital and urban wastewater. Median drug concentrations were quite similar in the majority of samples, cerca 1 mu g L-1 ranging from 0.06 to 2.67 mu g L-1 in both water. Pharmaceutical hospital contribution, below 1 %, was negligible, as compared to the huge amount in the municipal plant flow. Due to only partial elimination in the plant, hundreds of kilograms of harmful waste per year are discharged in the River Seine. Therefore, to reduce potential human and environmental exposure, a topic of major concern, an efficient drug treatment procedure should be used at the municipal plant stage in order to reduce urban wastewater pollution. The HPLC-MS/MS method could be a very useful tool to optimize the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment process.

AB A pilot-scale municipal wastewater reclamation system using combined coagulation and disk filtration (CC-DF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane has been built to investigate removal of water contaminants and fouling mitigation. The reclaimed water using the pilot system could meet draft regulations on wastewater reuse of the California Department of Public Health (DOC: 0.5 mgC/L; TN: 5 mgN/L). The removal of micropolluants by the CC-DF process and UF could not be evaluated by their MW, Log D, and charge characteristics. However, they were identified as governing factors affecting the removal of micropollutants by the RD. The CC-DF process might effectively remove particulate materials capable of contributing to cake layer formation on the UF membrane surfaces but the residual coagulants provided a strong effect on fouling formation of the UF membrane. Thus, hydrophobic fractions of the desorbed UF membrane foulants were higher than those of the desorbed RD membrane foulants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations of 119 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 13 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in marine sediments measured throughout Puget Sound (n=10) and Bellingham Bay (n=30), Washington, USA, are reported. These data are among the first measurements of PPCPs and PFASs in marine sediments from the Pacific Northwest and provide a comparison to previous measurements of these chemicals in influent, effluent, and biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants throughout the region. The concentrations of both PPCPs and PFASs in sediments from Puget Sound and Bellingham Bay ranged from very low to non-detectable for most compounds. Only 14 of the 119 PPCPs and 3 of 13 PFASs were quantifiable in sediments. Diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) was most frequently detected (87.5% of samples), with a maximum concentration of 4.81ng/g dry weight and an estimated mean detected concentration of 1.68ng/g. Triclocarban (an antibacterial) was detected in 35.0% of the samples, with a maximum concentration of 16.6ng/g dry weight. Perfluoroalkyl substances were detected in 2.5% of analyses. Perfluorobutanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorooctane sulfonamide were detected in 7, 5, and 1 sample(s) each, respectively, with the highest concentrations observed for perfluorooctane sulfonate (1.5ng/g). Detected concentrations were often highest within the industrial harbor in Bellingham Bay and near the cities of Seattle and Bremerton. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:1701-1710. (c) 2013 SETAC

A total of 180 samples was collected at the entrance of a WTP in Lausanne, Switzerland. Sample concentrations were multiplied by flow rate to obtain monthly, daily and hourly mass fluxes of six antibiotics (trimethoprim, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clindamycin and metronidazole). Seasonality in mass fluxes was observed for all substances, with maximum values in winter being up to an order of magnitude higher than in summer. The hourly measurements of the mass flux of antibiotics were found to have a period of 12 h. This was due to peaks in toilet use in the morning and early evening. In particular, the morning peak in flushing coincided with high concentrations (and hence high mass fluxes) due to overnight accumulation of substances in urine. However, little variation was observed in the average daily flux. Consequently, fluctuations in mass fluxes of antibiotics were mainly evident at the monthly and hourly time scales, with little variation on the day-week time scale. These results can aid in optimizing removal strategies and future sampling campaigns focused on antibiotics in wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been documented throughout the United States fresh-waters but research has focused largely on lotic systems. Because PPCPs are designed to have a physiological effect, it is likely that they may also influence aquatic organisms. Thus, PPCPs may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. The objectives of this research were to quantify PPCP abundance in near-shore habitats of southern Lake Michigan and identify factors related to PPCP abundance. Stratified sampling was conducted seasonally at four southern Lake Michigan sites. All sites and depths had measurable PPCP concentrations, with mean individual compound concentrations of acetaminophen (536 ng/L), caffeine (31.0 ng/L), carbamazepine (2.23 ng/L), cotinine (4.03 ng/L), gemfibrozil (7.03 ng/L), ibuprofen (7.88 ng/L), lincomycin (4.28 ng/L), naproxen (6.32 ng/L), paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine; 462 ng/L), sulfadimethoxine (0.94 ng/L), sulfamerazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethazine (0.92 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (26.0 ng/L), sulfathiazole (0.92 ng/L), tridocarban (5.72 ng/L), trimethoprim (5.15 ng/L), and tylosin (3.75 ng/L). Concentrations of PPCPs varied significantly among sampling times and locations (river mouth vs offshore), with statistical interactions between the main effects of site and time as well as time and location. Concentrations of PPCPs did not differ with site or depth. Temperature, total carbon, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and ammonium concentrations were related to total pharmaceutical concentrations. These data indicate that PPCPs are ubiquitous and persistent in southern Lake Michigan, potentially posing harmful effects to aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two carbon materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, MWCNT, and activated carbon, AC) were investigated as ozonation catalysts for the mineralization of bezafibrate (BZF) in water. For comparative purposes, kinetic results obtained in the absence of catalyst (single zonation) and adsorption experiments were also presented. Removal of BZF in the presence of MWCNT is mainly due to a catalytic process, contrarily to what occurs in the presence of activated carbon, which acts mainly as adsorbent. 3-[(4-chlorophenyl)formamido]propanoic acid (BBR), 4-chorobenzoic acid (pCBA) and 4-chloro-N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]benzamide (BBV) were detected as primary products of single and catalytic ozonation of BZF, whereas oxalic, pyruvic and oxamic acids were identified as refractory final oxidation products. The original chlorine of BZF is completely converted to chloride ion and part of nitrogen is converted to NH4+, NO3- and NO2-. The presence of the radical scavenger tert-butanol during catalytic and single ozonation evidenced the participation of HO center dot radicals in the oxidation process, especially in the mineralization of several intermediates. Microtox tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and AC originated lower acute toxicity, which may be due to the contribution of adsorption for the removal from the solution of BZF and its oxidation compounds. The time course of all detected compounds is studied and, as a result, the transformation pathway for the complete mineralization of BZF by single and catalytic ozonation in the presence of the selected carbon materials is also elucidated. Successive experimental runs of BZF degradation carried out with MWCNT show that the catalyst suffers some deactivation as a result of the introduction of oxygenated surface groups on the surface.

AB A three-level Box-Behnken factorial design combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied as a tool to study the laccase-catalyzed removal of three estrogenic compounds: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and ethinylestradiol (EE2), in a continuous enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR). Three main factors affecting the treatment efficiency were considered: enzyme activity, hydraulic residence time (HRT) and oxygenation rate. As expected, laccase activity and HRT showed large effects and, interestingly, the relevance of oxygen in improving the oxidation kinetics through raising the dissolved oxygen above saturation levels was demonstrated. When considering elimination rates as the response, optimal conditions were: 1,000 U/L of laccase, 1 h HRT and 60 mgO(2)/(L.h) of oxygenation rate, predicting 2.82-3.24 mg eliminated/(L.h), (71-81% of oxidation). These optimum conditions were successfully validated, and 75% of estrogenicity reduction was achieved. On the other hand, only 100 U/L were found as optimal to maximize the efficacy of the enzyme: E1 was oxidized by 0.06 mg/(L.h.U), although the removal of estrogenicity decreased to 60%. The methodology was also applied to maximize the reduction of estrogenic activity: the highest values assayed [1,000 U/L, HRT 4 h and 60 mgO(2)/(L.h)] provided 99% detoxification.

AB Potential aerobic biodegradation mechanisms of the widely used polar, low-adsorptive sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were investigated in activated sludge at bench scale. The study focused on (i) SMX co-metabolism with acetate and ammonium nitrate and (ii) SMX utilization when present as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. With SMX adsorption being negligible, elimination was primarily based on biodegradation. Activated sludge was able to utilize SMX both as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. SMX biodegradation was enhanced when a readily degradable energy supply (acetate) was provided which fostered metabolic activity. Moreover, it was raised under nitrogen deficiency conditions. The mass balance for dissolved organic carbon showed an incomplete SMX mineralization with two scenarios: (i) with SMX as a co-substrate, 3-amino-5-methyl-isoxazole represented the main stable metabolite and (ii) SMX as sole carbon and nitrogen source possibly yielded hydroxyl-N-(5-methyl-1,2-oxazole-3-yl)benzene-1-sulfonamide as a further metabolite.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior of eight fluoroquinolones (FQs) on aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic sludge, under different adsorpiton time, pH, and temperature conditions. Results indicated that adsorption of FQs onto all sludge was a physical sorption process. The relationship of the partitioning coefficient (K-d) and the octanol/water partition coefficient ( K-ow) for each FQ was established. The adsorbed fraction of FQs on sludge could then be predicted with the K-d. It was calculated that about 50-72% of the FQs were adsorbed on the sludge. Therefore, the adsorption effect must be considered when studying the fate and occurrence of FQs in wastewater treatment systems.

AB Urine source separation has been proposed as a more sustainable approach to wastewater management than treating combined wastewater streams. One such benefit of urine source separation is nutrient recovery, which has primarily focused on struvite precipitation for recovery of phosphorus. There is no previous research investigating phosphorus recovery from human urine by ion-exchange. Accordingly, the goal of this research was to provide an improved understanding of phosphate removal by ion-exchange using a hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin. The specific objectives of this research were to evaluate phosphate removal using HAIX resin in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine in terms of (1) kinetic tests, (2) equilibrium tests, (3) sorption models, (4) competition among sulfate, chloride, and phosphate, and (5) pharmaceutical co-removal. Batch experiments were conducted using different compositions of synthetic urine. HAD: resin consisted of a strong-base anion exchange resin impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide nanoparticles. The major results of phosphate removal from urine using HAIX resin were rapid removal in 5 min or less, high removal up to 97%, similar ion-exchange behavior in fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine, no affect by sulfate on phosphate removal, and co-removal of pharmaceutical and phosphate.

AB A novel double templates-molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared by precipitation polymerization using carbamazepine (CBZ) and clofibric acid (CA) as the double templates molecular and 2-vinylpyridine as functional monomer. The equilibrium data of MIP was well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. Two kinetic models were adopted to describe the experimental data, and the pseudo second-order model well-described adsorption of CBZ and CA on the MIP. Adsorption experimental results showed that the MIP had good selectivity and adsorption capacity for CBZ and CA in the presence of competitive compounds compared with non-imprinted polymer, commercial powdered activated carbon, and C18 adsorbents. The feasibility of removing CBZ and CA from water by the MIP was demonstrated using tap water, lake water, and river water.

AB The occurrence and fate of eight PPCPs was studied in river waters from upstream to downstream of the three rivers in the Pearl River Delta, China. The correlations of PPCP levels and water quality parameters were also investigated. The analytes of the highest concentrations were caffeine, acetaminophen, and ciprofloxacin. Carbamazepine and erythromycin-H2O were detected at the lowest concentrations. The highest concentrations of PPCPs were found in the Shijing River, with 865 ng/L caffeine, 339 ng/L acetaminophen, and 304 ng/L ciprofloxacin. In general, the levels of PPCPs in the Zhujiang River were higher at sites where the metropolitan city Guangzhou is located and decreased from the epicenter along the river. Low levels of PPCPs were generally found in the Beijiang River. Positive correlations were found between PPCP levels, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and cumulative fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) volume. Among the four PPCPs evaluated (caffeine, acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole), caffeine had the best correlations with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. The prediction of PPCP concentrations at specified locations can be substantially simplified.

AB Previous studies showed that caffeine, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine were bioconcentrated by mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) from freshwater bodies directly affected by reclaimed water. To understand the uptake, depuration, and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) under the worst-case conditions, the authors exposed 84 mosquito fish to reclaimed water under static renewal for 7 d, followed by a 14-d depuration phase in clean water. Characterization of the exposure media revealed the presence of 26 pharmaceuticals, whereas only 5 pharmaceuticalscaffeine, diphenhydramine, diltiazem, carbamazepine, and ibuprofenwere present in the organisms after only 5 h of exposure. Caffeine, diltiazem, and carbamazepine were quickly taken up by mosquito fish following a similar uptake curve. Diphenhydramine and ibuprofen, on the other hand, were more gradually taken up by mosquito fish but were also eliminated fairly quickly, resulting in the 2 shortest depuration half-lives at 34 h and 32 h, respectively. For comparison, BCFs based on rate constants (BCFb), steady-state concentrations (BCFa), and saturation-state concentrations (BCFc) were calculated. Values of BCFb ranged from 0.23 to 29 and increased in the order of caffeine<carbamazepine<diltiazem<diphenhydramine<ibuprofen. Values of BCFa and BCFc ranged from 2.0 to 28 and increased in the order of carbamazepine<caffeine<diltiazem<diphenhydramine<ibuprofen. This is the first study using a nonartificial exposure-treated wastewater matrix to generate pharmacokinetic data for pharmaceutical mixtures in aquatic organisms.

AB An urban watershed in northern New Jersey was studied to determine the presence of four classes of antibiotic compounds (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines) and six degradates in the water column and bottom sediments upstream and downstream from the discharges of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a drinking-water intake (DWI). Many antibiotic compounds in the four classes not removed by conventional WWTPs enter receiving waters and partition to stream sediments.
   Samples were collected at nine sampling locations on 2 days in September 2008. Two of the nine sampling locations were background sites upstream from two WWTP discharges on Hohokus Brook. Another background site was located upstream from a DWI on the Saddle River above the confluence with Hohokus Brook Because there is a weir downstream of the confluence of Hohokus Brook and Saddle River, the DWI receives water from Hohokus Brook at low stream flows.
   Eight antibiotic compounds (azithromycin (maximum concentration 024 mu g/L), ciprofloxacin (0.08 mu g/L), enrofloxacin (0.015 mu g/L), erythromycin (0.024 mu g/L), ofloxacin (0.92 mu g/L), sulfamethazine (0.018 mu g/L), sulfamethoxazole (0.25 mu g/L), and trimethoprim (0.14 mu g/L)) and a degradate (erythromycin-H2O (0.84 mu g/L)) were detected in the water samples from the sites downstream from the VVWTP discharges. The concentrations of six of the eight detected compounds and the detected degradate compound decreased with increasing distance downstream from the WVVTP discharges.
   Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim were detected in stream-bottom sediments. The concentrations of three of the four compounds detected in sediments were highest at a sampling site located downstream from the WWTP discharges. Trimethoprim was detected in the sediments from a background site. Pseudo-partition coefficients normalized for streambed sediment organic carbon concentration were calculated for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Generally, there was good agreement between the decreasing order of the pseudo-partition coefficients in this study and the order reported in the literature. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel granular carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/alumina (Al2O3) hybrid adsorbent with good sorption and regeneration properties was successfully prepared by mixing CNTs with surfactant Brij 35 and pseudo boehmite, followed by calcining to remove surfactant and form porous granules. Alumina binder increased the mechanical strength, hydrophilicity and porosity of the granular adsorbent, while the dispersed CNTs in the granular adsorbent were responsible for the sorption of diclofenac sodium (DS) and carbamazepine (CBZ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the CNTs and Al2O3 were mixed well and the porous structure was formed in the granular adsorbent. The high surface area and appropriate pore size of granular CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent were favorable for sorption. The sorption of DS decreased with increasing solution pH, while pH had little effect on CBZ sorption. The maximum sorption capacities of CBZ and DS on the CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent were 157.4 and 106.5 mu mol/g according to the Langmuir fitting. Moreover, the spent CNTs/Al2O3 adsorbent can be thermally regenerated at 400 degrees C in air due to the thermal stability of CNTs. The removal of CBZ and DS changed a little in the initial reuse cycles and then kept relatively constant until tenth cycles. The adsorbed CBZ and DS were decomposed in the regeneration process. This regenerable adsorbent may find potential application in water or wastewater treatment for the removal of some micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot-scale hospital wastewater treatment plant consisting of a primary clarifier, membrane bioreactor, and five post-treatment technologies including ozone (O-3), O-3/H2O2, powdered activated carbon (PAC), and low pressure UV light with and without TiO2 was operated to test the elimination efficiencies for 56 micropollutants. The extent of the elimination of the selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, metabolites and industrial chemicals) was successfully correlated to physical-chemical properties or molecular structure. By mass loading, 95% of all measured micropollutants in the biologically treated hospital wastewater feeding the post-treatments consisted of iodinated contrast media (ICM). The elimination of ICM by the tested post-treatment technologies was 50-65% when using 1.08 g O-3/gDOC, 23 mg/L PAC, or a UV dose of 2400 J/m(2) (254 nm). For the total load of analyzed pharmaceuticals and metabolites excluding ICM the elimination by zonation, PAC, and UV at the same conditions was 90%, 86%, and 33%, respectively. Thus, the majority of analyzed substances can be efficiently eliminated by zonation (which also provides disinfection) or PAC (which provides micropollutants removal, not only transformation). Some micropollutants recalcitrant to those two post-treatments, such as the ICM diatrizoate, can be substantially removed only by high doses of UV (96% at 7200 J/m(2)). The tested combined treatments (O-3/H2O2 and UV/TiO2) did not improve the elimination compared to the single treatments (O-3 and UV).

AB Tannin rigid foams were synthesized at lab scale in order to confirm their feasibility in wastewater treatment. Different water samples containing three emerging contaminants (Methylene blue, Polyoxyethylene (3.5) sodium lauryl ether sulfate and Trimethoprim) were subjected to adsorption process with these novel products. The experimental results confirmed the ability of these foams for removing anionic and cationic contaminants through adsorption process. Kinetic data were adjusted to Lagergren, Ho and Elovich model. Both the second and the third one presented an average r(2) above 0.96. Equilibrium studies on the three studied systems revealed Langmuir and Freundlich models were also adequate for predicting the behavior of the adsorption process. High adsorption capacities were reached (ca. 215, 65 and 25 mg g(-1) for dye, surfactant and pharmaceutical respectively), which were comparable to other commercial adsorbents already available and functional in wastewater treatments. Therefore, this new ability must be added to the list of advantages these new materials seem to present. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The UV-filter substance Sulisobenzone (BP-4) is widely employed in sunscreens and other personal care products. In the current study, its behavior during biological wastewater treatment was investigated. In contact with activated sludge BP-4 was degraded in aerobic batch experiments forming at least nine transformation products (TPs). The mass balance in the batch experiments was closed, as measurements with LC-UV underlined that the quantity of the TPs was comparable to the BP-4 quantity transformed. The chemical structures of the nine TPs could be proposed based on accurate mass measurements by high resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap-MS), several fragmentation experiments up to MS6 and synthesis of one TP. NMR analyses of the main TP confirmed its proposed chemical structure. At the beginning of the biotransformation of BP-4, a benzhydrol analogue was formed due to the reduction of the keto moiety. Further reactions (e.g, oxidation, demethylation, decarboxylation) led to the formation of extremely polar TPs. A biodegradation pathway was proposed based on the TP structures identified and the sequence of the TP formation. The isolated TPs exhibited higher toxic effects on Vibrio fischeri than BP-4. The results contribute to a better general understanding and prediction of the biotransformation of aromatic sulfonic acids in WWTPs.

AB Polar organic micropollutants (MPs) can have ecotmdcological effects on aquatic ecosystems and their occurrence in drinking water is a threat to public health. An extensive exposure assessment of MPs in large river and lake catchments is a necessary but challenging proposition for researchers and regulators. To get a complete picture of MP exposure in a large catchment, we employed a novel integrated strategy including MP measurement in the international catchment of Lake Constance and mass-flux modeling. A comprehensive screening of 252 MPs in the lake water by high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify the most commonly present MPs for the study site It was found that the wastewater borne MPs diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfarnethoxazole, acesulfame, sucralose, benzotriazole, and methylbenzotriazole accounted for the most frequent and prominent findings The concentration pattern of these compounds in the catchment was calculated based on regionalized inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WVVTPs) and substance specific elimination rates. In 52, 8, and 3 of the 112 investigated river locations the concentration exceeded the predicted no effect levels for diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, respectively. By coupling the catchment and lake model the effect of future trends in usage as well as possible mitigation options were evaluated for the tributaries and the lake. The upgrade of the major WWITs in the catchment with a postozonation step would lead to a load reduction between 32% and 52% for all substances except for sucralose (10%).

AB The prediction of risks posed by pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic environment now and in the future is one of the top 20 research questions regarding these contaminants following growing concern for their biological effects. on fish and other animals. To this end it is important that areas experiencing the greatest risk are identified, particularly in countries experiencing water stress, where dilution of pollutants entering river networks is more limited. This study is the first to use hydrological models to estimate concentrations of pharmaceutical and natural steroid estrogens in a water stressed catchment in South Australia alongside a UK catchment and to forecast their concentrations in 2050 based on demographic and climate change predictions The results show that despite their differing climates and demographics, modeled concentrations of steroid estrogens in effluents from Australian sewage treatment works and a receiving river were predicted (simulated) to be similar to those observed in the UK and Europe, exceeding the combined estradiol equivalent's predicted no effect concentration for feminization in wild fish. Furthermore, by 2050 a moderate increase in estrogenic contamination and the potential risk to wildlife was predicted with up to a 2-fold rise in concentrations.

AB A Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, non-endospore-forming rod-shaped bacterium with ibuprofen-degrading capacity, designated strain I11(T), was isolated from activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. The major respiratory quinone was demethylmenaquinone DMK-7, C-18:1 cis9 was the predominant fatty acid, phosphatidylglycerol was the predominant polar lipid, the cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and the G+C content of the genonnic DNA was 74.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain I11(T) were Patulibacter ginsengiterrae CECT 7603(T) (96.8% similarity), Patulibacter minatonensis DSM 18081(T) (96.6 %) and Patulibacter americanus DSM 16676(T) (96.6%). Phenotypic characterization supports the inclusion of strain I11(T) within the genus Patulibacter (phylum Actinobacteria). However, distinctive features and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis suggest that is represents a novel species, for which the name Patulibacter medicamentivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is I11(T) (=DSM 25962(T)=CECT 8141(T)).

AB Namibia is the driest sub-Saharan country in Africa. Namibia's capital, Windhoek, reclaims sewage water for domestic use at the Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (GWRP). Risks associated with sewage effluent and reclaimed sewage should be closely monitored; therefore water at the Gammams Sewage Treatment Plant (GSTP) inlet and outlet, as well as reclaimed water from the GWRP, were assayed using selected bioassays. Samples collected were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assays and chromogenic tests for steroid hormones, neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and inflammatory activity. Estradiol level at the sewage treatment inlet was 78 pg/ml and the treated sewage level showed an 83% to 95% reduction in this, while after reclamation the level was below detection limit. Estrone concentrations at the sewage treatment inlet ranged from 10 to 161 pg/ml. Sewage treatment reduced estrone by between 85% and 92%. After reclamation the level of estrone was below detection limit. Testosterone ranged between 162 and 405 pg/ml at the sewage plant inlet. Sewage treatment removed 96% of the initial testosterone. The residual testosterone was effectively removed by processes in GWRP and after reclamation no testosterone was detected in water. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition at the sewage treatment inlet was 50% while it was only 27% after sewage treatment. After reclamation AChE inhibition was not detected. Only water at the sewage inlet in March and February showed cytotoxicity. High inflammatory activity was detected at the sewage plant inlet. Sewage treatment reduced inflammatory activity by 64%. After reclamation low inflammatory activity was induced. Treated sewage used for reclamation tested positive for most of the biomarkers and can pose a risk to human health. However, reclamation successfully removed these contaminants. Due to the presence of contaminants in the intake water at the reclamation plant, it is essential to routinely monitor the water produced by the reclamation plant for potential residues that can adversely affect human health.

AB The recognition that pharmaceuticals, personal care product chemicals, and endocrine disruptors can cause deleterious effects has led to search new approaches for removing them from contaminated waters. The emergence of tailored nanomaterials, with magnetic properties and high adsorption capacity for a wide range of compounds, provides a new tool to deal with these complex emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). Magnetic permanently confined micelle arrays (Mag-PCMAs) synthesized with cationic surfactants can provide several sorption mechanisms for the multifunctional EOCs. The sorption onto Mag-PCMAs of seven EOCs and two more conventional contaminants was studied. The results indicate high sorption capacity for many of the EOCs. However, because of the complex nature of these EOCs, it is not possible to predict their adsorption based on a single physicochemical characteristic such as K-ow or pK(a). Sorption kinetics are relatively fast, within the typical range for water treatment processes. The low energy required for the synthesis of Mag-PCMAs, relatively low cost (similar to$4/kg), ease of recovery with a magnetic field, and regenerability make them a much more sustainable option than more traditional approaches for removing EOCs, such as high energy granular activated carbon adsorption or advanced oxidation processes.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a group of medications widely used by man to heal certain ailments. However, after consumption, they may be excreted in wastewaters with consequent environmental effects. NSAIDs are endocrine disruptors that can cause changes in animal physiology. The purpose of this study was to implement an analytical method that permits the determination of the presence of NSAIDs in water. Compound extraction was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using an Oasis HLB cartridge. Analytes were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The method was applied in water from the Maipo River and from a neighboring wastewater treatment plant in the Metropolitan Region of Pajaritos, Vina, Tuberia, Union and Gansos sampling points in Chile. This method turned out to be adequate for the determination of NSAIDs in water samples with recovery percentages above 80%. Naproxen and ibuprofen were mostly detected in the Maipo River water samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 0.83 mu g L-1.

AB This research attempts to evaluate a previously developed model for predicting influent concentrations of prescription pharmaceuticals and understand why some drugs are more accurately predicted than others. It also investigates the impact of demographics on influent drug concentrations in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Samples from two WWTPs in the southeastern United States indicate that the model generates concentration estimates that are accurate to within at least one order of magnitude for a diverse set of drug compounds. Additionally, strategically timed sampling at college-town WWTPs, wherein 19-25% of the population comprises students ages 18-22, reveals that the influent concentrations of several drugs (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and metformin) generally prescribed to older-than-average persons increase while students are absent on holiday, whereas the influent concentration of one drug (-ethynyl estradiol) prescribed to younger-than-average persons decreases. These observations reveal the impacts of demographics on prescription drug concentrations in WWTP influents, offering some explanation for the wide variability among previously measured influent drug concentrations. It was also observed that hospital size is generally correlated with increased influent drug concentrations. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB This work determines the principal environmental pollution pathways of pharmaceuticals on the island of Mallorca (Spain). The evaluation was made on the basis of the quantification of pharmaceutical residues by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in several environmental water samples, including wastewater-treatment plant effluents, municipal solid waste landfill leachates, groundwater (GW), and marine water. An overall set of 19 pharmaceuticals has been identified in the environment of the 27 human pharmaceuticals investigated in this study. WWTP effluents are the main source of discharge of the pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment. The data indicate that reuse of treated domestic wastewater for irrigation (which supplies some 30 % of the total water demand in Mallorca) contributes to the contamination of GW. In addition, leaching from landfills is identified as another, but minor, possible source of introduction of pharmaceuticals to GW aquifers. Finally, WWTP effluents ending in the Mediterranean Sea, primarily highly urbanized coastal areas, cause pharmaceutical residues to occur in marine water bodies.

AB The aim of the present research is to develop economic, fast, and versatile method for the removal of toxic organic pollutant phenol from wastewater using eggshell. The batch experiments are conducted to evaluate the effect of pH, phenol concentration, dosage of adsorbent, and contact time on the removal of phenol. The paper includes in-depth kinetic studies of the ongoing adsorption process. Attempts have also been made to verify Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The morphology and characteristics of eggshell have also been studied using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence analysis. At ambient temperature, the maximum adsorption of phenol onto eggshells has been achieved at pH 9 and the contact time, 90 min. The experimental data give best-fitted straight lines for pseudo-first-order as well as pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Furthermore, the adsorption process verifies Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms, and on the basis of mathematical expressions of these models, various necessary adsorption constants have been calculated. Using adsorption data, various thermodynamic parameters like change in enthalpy (a dagger H (0)), change in entropy (a dagger S (0)), and change in free energy a dagger G (0) have also been evaluated. Results clearly reveal that the solid waste material eggshell acts as an effective adsorbent for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are now considered as emerging contaminants of environmental concern. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the uptake and translocation of clofibric acid (CA) by the macrophyte Scirpus validus growing hydroponically. A set of the three replicates was established for each exposure time and for each CA concentration. Plants were grown in 4 L vessels (four plants per vessel corresponding to the three exposure period studies, i.e., 7, 14, 18, and 21 days) which contained an aerated modified Hoagland nutrient solution that was spiked with CA at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1. At each exposure period, CA concentration was measured in the nutrient solutions. A sea sand disruption method was employed for the extraction of CA from plant tissues. The determination of the pharmaceutical concentration was carried out using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by chromatographic analysis. The quantification of CA concentrations in both nutrient solutions (after SPE) and plant tissues (after extraction) was conducted by chromatographic analysis. CA concentrations of 5.4-26.8 mu g g(-1) (fresh weight) were detected in the roots and 7.2-34.6 mu g g(-1) (fresh weight) in the shoots after 21 days. Mass balance calculations showed that S. validus uptake alone accounted for a significant contribution (6-13 % for the roots and 22-49 % for the shoots) of the total loss of CA. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) based on fresh weight for the roots ranged from 6.6 to 23.2, while values for the shoots ranged from 9.5 to 32.1. All the BAFs for the shoots were greater than those in the roots, implying that CA has greater tendency to be translocated to the shoots, rather than the roots of S. validus. All the shoot-to-root concentration ratios were more than 1, denoting that the shoots of S. validus do preferentially accumulate CA. We demonstrated that CA can be actively taken up, subsequently translocated and accumulated by aboveground tissues of S. validus. Since S. validus could account for the removal of 28-62 % of the total mass loss of CA from the system, such phytoremediation technology has great potential for the removal of pharmaceuticals such as CA from inflowing waters.

AB The present study is an overview of the literature on the occurrence and potential risks of pharmaceutical substances in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), natural waters and drinking water treatment plants served by the Great Lakes Basin (Canada and the USA) between the years of 2007-2012. Large number of pharmaceutical substances, including anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, antidepressants, antibiotics, beta blockers, anti-epileptics, anti-hypertensions and stimulants, in high ng/L concentrations, has been reported in the WWTP influents. Most of these compounds have also been detected in the WWTP effluents at comparable concentrations with the exception of caffeine, cotinine and salicylic acid suggesting the inefficiency of conventional treatment processes in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. Decreasing surface water concentrations have been observed with the distance downstream of the discharge point due to the dilution effect. Surface waters located around septic systems and agricultural areas have also been found to be contaminated with pharmaceutical substances. Carbamazepine, caffeine, its metabolite paraxanthine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole have been frequently detected in the surface waters. The number of occurrences of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, sulfamethoxazole and macrolide antibiotics in drinking water sources, at ng/L concentration ranges, has been quite high. Although the detection frequencies in treated drinking waters were relatively low, the concentrations of the above mentioned pharmaceutical substances were at the same range as the source water concentrations. Six of the detected pharmaceutical substances, namely, fluoxetine, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, carbamazepine and esterone exhibit a high environmental risk in Great Lakes WWTP effluents and surface waters, while none of the pharmaceutical substances seem to pose a risk for human health at their highest reported concentrations in the drinking water sources from the Great Lakes.

AB In this study, we critically examined the available data related to pharmaceutical (PhAC) sorption in biological treatment processes. Using these data, we developed and assessed single and polyparameter quantitative structural activity models to better understand the role of sorption in PhAC attenuation. In contrast to other studies, our analysis suggests that values of the sorption coefficient (K-D) are poorly correlated to single parameter models employing log K-OW or the apparent partition coefficient (i.e., K-OW corrected to the experimental pH). Results from the development of polyparameter models suggest that the range of functional moieties typically incorporated in PhAC molecules offers a diverse set of interactions between PhAC and sludge surface (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions). Of particular importance is the role of dissociation and resulting charge(s) of a PhAC in solution. Results demonstrate that when developing predictive models it is advantageous to separate PhACs based upon the charge of the dominant species at the experimental pH. Yet, use a single model for PhACs which are negatively charged and uncharged may have practical utility. Performance of the polyparameter models, however, was found to plateau with a pred-R-2 between 0.50 and 0.60, even when six statistically relevant predictors are included. This outcome suggests that effective predictive models for PhAC sorption cannot include solely PhAC descriptors, rather they must incorporate critical properties related to the sorbent (i.e., mixed liquor) surface.

AB For a few years, the concern of water treatment companies is not only focused on the removal of target micropollutants but has been extended to the investigation of potential biologically active by-products generated during the treatment processes. Therefore, some methods dedicated to the detection and structural characterization of such by-products have emerged. However, most of these studies are usually carried out under simplified conditions (e.g. high concentration levels of micropollutants, drastic treatment conditions, use of deionized or ultrapure water) and somewhat unrealistic conditions compared to that implemented in water treatment plants. In the present study, a real field water sample was fortified at the part-per-billion level (50 mu g L-1) with estrone-3-sulfate (E1-3S) before being ozonated (at 1 mg L-1) for 10 min. In a first step, targeted measurements evidenced a degradation of the parent compound (>80%) in 10 min. Secondly, a non-targeted chemical profiling approach derived from metabolomic profiling studies allowed to reveal 11 zonation by-products, among which 4 were found predominant. The estrogenic activity of these water samples spiked with E1-3S before and after treatment was assessed by the ER-CALUX assay and was found to decrease significantly after 10 min of ozonation. Therefore, this innovative methodological strategy demonstrated its suitability and relevancy for revealing unknown compounds generated from water treatment, and permitted to generate new results regarding specifically the impact of ozonation on estrone-3-sulfate. These results confirm that ozonation is effective at removing E1-3S in drinking water and indicate that the by-products generated have significantly lower estrogenic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Serious shortage of water resources is one of the major factors restricting the sustainable development of cropland and pasture land in northern and northwestern China. Although the reuse of wastewater for agricultural irrigation becomes a well established practice in these regions, many contaminants have been also introduced into the soil-groundwater systems such as persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). To study the influence of long-term sewage irrigation on the distribution of OCPs in soil-groundwater systems, the groundwater flow field was investigated and 31 topsoil samples, 9 boreholes, 11 sewage effluents and 34 groundwater samples were collected in Xiaodian, Taiyuan city, one of the largest sewage irrigation districts, China. During sampling, three representative types of regions were considered including effluent-irrigated area, groundwater-irrigated area served as the control field and no-irrigated area as reference "background". The results showed over-exploitation of groundwater had changed the flow field of groundwater and wherever in soil or in groundwater, the concentration of OCPs in effluent-irrigation area presented the highest value, which indicated that the sewage irrigation had a strong influence on the distribution of OCPs in soil-groundwater systems. Principal component analysis for OCPs content in groundwater showed that the major influence factors on the occurrence and distribution of OCPs in groundwater systems attribute to the flow field of groundwater and to the current pesticide use.

AB In this study, we investigated the occurrences and fates of eight quinolones (QNs), nine sulfonamides (SAs), and five macrolides (MCs) in a wastewater reclamation plant (WRP) in Beijing, China. Among all the 22 antibiotics considered, quinolones were the dominant antibiotics in all samples (4916 ng L-1 in influents, 1869 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 123 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 9200 mu g kg(-1) in sludge samples), followed by sulfonamides (2961 ng L-1 in influents, 1053 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 25.9 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 63.7 mu g kg(-1) sludge samples) and macrolides (365 ng L-1 in influents, 353 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 24.7 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 32.7 mu g kg(-1) in sludge samples). The removal efficiencies of the target antibiotics were limited (-32 to 78%) in the conventional treatment. This study indicated that quinolones were mainly removed from the secondary clarifier, and sulfonamides were degraded in the oxic tank; while macrolides were considered as persistent during the conventional treatment. After the advance treatment, the target antibiotics could be effectively removed at high rates (85-100%), and the risks of antibiotic contamination significantly decreased. However, risk assessment showed that the risk of ofloxacin and erythromycin on organisms in recycled water needed further investigations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background This study analyzes the effectiveness of gamma irradiation in removing diatrizoate contrast from different water matrices: ultrapure water, surface water, groundwater and wastewater. The use of gamma irradiation for degradation is influenced by coexisting substances in natural waters and wastewaters. The influence of the presence of anions Cl-,NO2-,NO3-,SO42-andCO32-/HCO3- on the degradation of diatrizoate by gamma irradiation was investigated. Results Study results indicate that: (1) diatrizoate radiolysis fits pseudo-first-order kinetics; removal of91.9% of the diatrizoate was achieved at a dose of 1000Gy; (2) diatrizoate degradation depends on the type of water matrix, with the radiolysis being affected by the presence of anions, as follows: (i) high concentrations of Cl- increase the efficacy of the process; and (ii) low concentrations of NO2- markedly decrease the degradation rate, because nitrite ions act as scavengers of eaq-, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen radical; (3) TOC values showed that diatrizoate does not mineralize at a dose of 1000Gy. Conclusions Radiolysis degrades diatrizoate by more than 90%; results obtained indicate that it is not mineralized, with TOC values remaining constant in all waters studied.

AB The aim of the this study was to investigate the ozone dosage required to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from biologically treated wastewater of varying quality, originated from different raw wastewater and wastewater treatment processes.
   Secondary effluents from six Swedish wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) were spiked with 42 APIs (nominal concentration 1 mu g/L) and treated with different O-3 doses (0.5-12.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments.
   In order to compare the sensitivity of APIs in each matrix, the specific dose of ozone required to achieve reduction by one decade of each investigated API (DDO3) was determined for each effluent by fitting a first order equation to the remaining concentration of API at each applied ozone dose. Ozone dose requirements were found to vary significantly between effluents depending on their matrix characteristics.
   The specific ozone dose was then normalized to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of each effluent. The DDO3/DOC ratios were comparable for each API between the effluents.
   15 of the 42 investigated APIs could be classified as easily degradable (DDO3/DOC <= 0.7), while 19 were moderately degradable (0.7 < DDO3/DOC <= 1.4), and 8 were recalcitrant towards O-3-treatment (DDO3/DOC > 1.4). Furthermore, we predict that a reasonable estimate of the ozone dose required to remove any of the investigated APIs may be attained by multiplying the experimental average DDO3/DOC obtained with the actual DOC of any effluent.

AB The presence of human pharmaceuticals in sewage-impacted ecosystems is a growing concern that poses health risks to aquatic wildlife. Despite this, few studies have investigated the uptake of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in aquatic organisms. In this study, the uptake of 9 APIs from human drugs was examined and compared in neonate bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) residing in pristine (Myakka River) and wastewater-impacted (Caloosahatchee River) tributaries of Florida's Charlotte Harbor estuary. The synthetic estrogen used in human contraceptives (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and 6 of the selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine) used in human antidepressants were observed at detectable and, in some cases, quantifiable levels in plasma of Caloosahatchee River sharks. Comparatively, only venlafaxine was detected in the plasma of a single Myakka River shark at a level below the limit of quantitation. These results suggest that sharks residing in wastewater-impacted habitats accumulate APIs, a factor that may pose special risks to C leucas since it is one of few shark species to regularly occupy freshwater systems. Further research is needed to determine if the low levels of API uptake observed in Caloosahatchee River bull sharks pose health risks to these animals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the performance of 16 wastewater treatment works to provide an overview of trace substance removal in relation to meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WED). Collection and analysis of over 2400 samples including sewage influent, process samples at different stages in the treatment process and final effluent has provided data on the performance of current wastewater treatment processes and made it possible to evaluate the need for improved effluent quality. Results for 55 substances, including metals, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals are reported. Data for sanitary parameters are also provided. A wide range of removal efficiencies was observed. Removal was not clearly related to the generic process type, indicating that other operational factors tend to be important. Nonetheless, removals for many substances of current concern were high. Despite this, current proposals for stringent water quality standards mean that further improvements in effluent quality are likely to be required. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, concern has grown regarding the presence of triclosan (TCS) in waters because of its potential for causing ecological and human health effects. The authors present a statistical analysis of TCS concentrations reported between 1999 and 2012 in freshwater environments in the United States and provide a comparison with available health-based and aquatic guidance values. Data from 46 peer-reviewed and unpublished investigations from 45 states and 1 US territory were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing the following coded water types: untreated (raw wastewater), effluent (wastewater treatment plant effluent), effluent-impacted environmental, environmental, and finished drinking water (total n=2305). Triclosan was most frequently detected in untreated waters (92% detection frequency; mean +/- standard error, 11270 +/- 2925ng/L; n=237), but concentrations were significantly reduced in effluent waters (83% detection frequency 775 +/- 311ng/L; n=192, =0.05). Triclosan concentration in effluent-impacted environmental waters (62% detection frequency; 130 +/- 17ng/L; n=228) was not significantly reduced from effluent waters but was significantly greater than TCS in environmental waters not classified as effluent impacted (11% detection frequency; 13 +/- 3ng/L; n=1195). In finished drinking water, TCS was largely undetected (1% detection frequency; 4 +/- 2ng/L n=453), suggesting that for the United States, drinking water is not an appreciable source of TCS exposure. In posttreatment waters, average TCS concentrations were below part-per-billion levels. Although no US regulatory standard exists for TCS in aquatic systems, comparison of averages reported in the present study with a predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 500ng/L showed that 5.3% of effluent-impacted environmental waters were above the PNEC for changes in algal biomass, while only 0.25% of environmental waters surpassed this value.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent that is discharged to soils with land-applied wastewater biosolids, is persistent under anaerobic conditions, and yet its impact on anaerobic microbial communities in soils is largely unknown. We hypothesized that triclosan enriches for Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi because these bacteria respire organochlorides and are likely less sensitive, relative to other bacteria, to the antimicrobial effects of triclosan. Triplicate anaerobic soil microcosms were seeded with agricultural soil, which was not previously exposed to triclosan, and were amended with 1mgkg-1 of triclosan. Triplicate control microcosms did not receive triclosan, and the experiment was run for 618days. The overall bacterial community (assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) was not impacted by triclosan; however, the abundance of Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi 16S rRNA genes (determined by qPCR) increased 20-fold with triclosan amendment compared with a fivefold increase without triclosan. This work demonstrates that triclosan impacts anaerobic soil communities at environmentally relevant levels.

AB Municipalities utilize aquatic environments to assimilate their domestic effluent resulting in eutrophication, anoxia, toxicity and endocrine disruption of aquatic biota. The objective of this study was to assess the potential cumulative impacts of municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) discharges in the Grand River on the health status of a sentinel species and the fish community downstream of 2 MWWE discharges. The fish communities downstream of the MWWE outfalls demonstrated differences in the abundance and diversity, species and family richness, % tolerance and % vulnerability when compared to the fish community upstream or further downstream of these points of effluent discharge. In both years studied, the fish community exposed to MWWE in the riffle-run habitats demonstrated reductions in the proportion of the most prominent fish (Rainbow Darter, Ethoestoma caeruleum) downstream of the outfalls, and a significant increase in the proportion of large mobile, tolerant-omnivorous fish species such as suckers and sunfish. There was less variability in the responses of the fish community to MWWE in the same season between years than between seasons within the same year. An examination of how impaired health of a sentinel species exposed to MWWE discharges parallels changes in the fish community is also conducted. This study successfully demonstrates the cumulative impact of urban development, including multiple outfalls of treated wastewater effluents on fish populations and communities. Municipalities are the major source of nutrients and pharmaceuticals and personal care products to aquatic systems, and they need to consider their impacts carefully with increasing urban population growth and ageing demographics.

AB Reduction of bulk organic matter, nitrogen, and pharmaceutically active compounds from primary effluent during managed aquifer recharge was investigated using laboratory-scale batch reactors. Biologically stable batch reactors were spiked with different concentrations of sodium azide to inhibit biological activity and probe the effect of microbial activity on attenuation of various pollutants of concern. The experimental results obtained revealed that removal of dissolved organic carbon correlated with active microbial biomass. Furthermore, addition of 2 mM of sodium azide affected nitrite-oxidizing bacteria leading to accumulation of nitrite-nitrogen in the reactors while an ammonium-nitrogen reduction of 95.5 % was achieved. Removal efficiencies of the hydrophilic neutral compounds phenacetin, paracetamol, and caffeine were independent of the extent of the active microbial biomass and were >90% in all reactors, whereas removal of pentoxifylline was dependent on the biological stability of the reactor. However, hydrophobic ionic compounds exhibited removal efficiency >80 % in batch reactors with the highest biological activity as evidenced by high concentration of adenosine triphosphate.

AB A new methodology previously used to study partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4.2 > log Kow > 6.6) in complex heterogeneous systems such as mixed liquor in bioreactors was applied to the synthetic hormone 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), that is an organic micropollutant commonly present in sewage. This model considers the mixed liquor as a three-compartment matrix, in which the pollutant coexists in three states: freely dissolved, sorbed to particles, and sorbed to dissolved and colloidal matter (DCM). In this way, it is possible to gain a better knowledge about the affinity of the pollutant for all these phases, through the determination of equilibrium constants Kpart and KDCM. According to the results, the measured partition coefficients related to EE2 are in the range of 315439 L/kg (log Kd 2.52.64). The values of Kpart and KDCM determined by this model were 384 L/kg and 45 L/kg, respectively, which indicate that EE2 tends to sorb mainly on particles, while the affinity for DCM is poor.

AB To augment the removal of pharmaceuticals different conventional and alternative wastewater treatment processes and their combinations were investigated. We tested the efficiency of (1) two distinct laboratory scale biological processes: suspended activated sludge and attached-growth biomass, (2) a combined hydrodynamic cavitation hydrogen peroxide process and (3) UV treatment. Five pharmaceuticals were chosen including ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac, and an active metabolite of the lipid regulating agent clofibric acid.
   Biological treatment efficiency was evaluated using lab-scale suspended activated sludge and moving bed biofilm flow-through reactors, which were operated under identical conditions in respect to hydraulic retention time, working volume, concentration of added pharmaceuticals and synthetic wastewater composition. The suspended activated sludge process showed poor and inconsistent removal of clofibric acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac, while ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen yielded over 74% removal. Moving bed biofilm reactors were filled with two different types of carriers i.e. Kaldnes K1 and Mutag BioChip (TM) and resulted in higher removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and diclofenac. Augmentation and consistency in the removal of diclofenac were observed in reactors using Mutag BioChip (TM) carriers (85%+/- 10%) compared to reactors using Kaldnes carriers and suspended activated sludge (74%+/- 22% and 48%+/- 19%, respectively). To enhance the removal of pharmaceuticals hydrodynamic cavitation with hydrogen peroxide process was evaluated and optimal conditions for removal were established regarding the duration of cavitation, amount of added hydrogen peroxide and initial pressure, all of which influence the efficiency of the process. Optimal parameters resulted in removal efficiencies between 3-70%. Coupling the attached-growth biomass biological treatment, hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment resulted in removal efficiencies of >90% for clofibric acid and >98% for carbamazepine and diclofenac, while the remaining compounds were reduced to levels below the LOD. For ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac the highest contribution to overall removal was attributed to biological treatment, for clofibric acid UV treatment was the most efficient, while for carbamazepine hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment were equally efficient.

AB Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon that has severe epidemiological ramifications world-wide. It has been suggested that antibiotics that have been discharged into the natural aquatic environments after usage or manufacture can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). These environmental ARGs could serve as a reservoir and be horizontally transferred to human-associated bacteria and thus contribute to AR proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anthropogenic load of antibiotics in Northern Pakistan and study the occurrence of ARGs in selected samples from this region. 19 sampling sites were selected; including six rivers, one dam, one canal, one sewage drain and four drug formulation facilities. Our results show that five of the rivers have antibiotic levels comparable to surface water measurements in unpolluted sites in Europe and the US. However, high levels of antibiotics could be detected in the downstream river in close vicinity of the 10 million city Lahore, 1100, 1700 and 2700 ng L-1 for oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole respectively. Highest detected levels were at one of the drug formulation facilities, with the measured levels of 1100, 4100, 6200, 7300, 8000, 27000, 28000 and 49000 ng L 21 of erythromycin, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole respectively. ARGs were also detected at the sites and the highest levels of ARGs detected, sulI and dfrA1, were directly associated with the antibiotics detected at the highest concentrations, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Highest levels of both antibiotics and ARGs were seen at a drug formulation facility, within an industrial estate with a low number of local residents and no hospitals in the vicinity, which indicates that the levels of ARGs at this site were associated with the environmental levels of antibiotics.

AB Background: The widespread utilization of organic compounds in modern society and their dispersion through wastewater have resulted in extensive contamination of source and drinking waters. The vast majority of these compounds are not regulated in wastewater outfalls or in drinking water while trace amounts of certain compounds can impact aquatic wildlife. Hence it is prudent to monitor these contaminants in water sources until sufficient toxicological data relevant to humans becomes available. A method was developed for the analysis of 36 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroid hormones (androgens, progestins, and glucocorticoids), personal care products and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs) using a single solid phase extraction (SPE) technique with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method was applied to a variety of water matrices to demonstrate method performance and reliability.
   Results: UHPLC-MS/MS in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes was employed to achieve optimum sensitivity while reducing sample analysis time (<20 min) compared with previously published methods. The detection limits for most compounds was lower than 1.0 picogram on the column while reporting limits in water ranged from 0.1 to 15 ng/L based on the extraction of a 1 L sample and concentration to 1 mL. Recoveries in ultrapure water for most compounds were between 90-110%, while recoveries in surface water and wastewater were in the range of 39-121% and 38-141% respectively. The analytical method was successfully applied to analyze samples across several different water matrices including wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water at different stages of the treatment. Among several compounds detected in wastewater, sucralose and TCPP showed the highest concentrations.
   Conclusion: The proposed method is sensitive, rapid and robust; hence it can be used to analyze a large variety of trace organic compounds in different water matrixes.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) are introduced into the agricultural environment through irrigation with treated effluents and application of biosolids. Transport processes can determine the fate of PCs and the associated risks related to their exposure in the environment. The aim of this work was to evaluate the combined effects of biosolids application and irrigation with treated effluents on the mobility of PCs in soil and to elucidate the main mechanisms affecting their transport. Column-leaching experiments revealed that application of biosolids generally increased the retardation of PCs, whereas treated effluents increased the mobility of weakly acidic PCs in the biosolids-amended soils. Experiments conducted at environmentally relevant PC concentrations (similar to 1 mu g/L) highlight the importance of irreversible sorption as a possible mechanism for low leachability. Data generated from this study suggest that (i) transport behavior of PCs can be affected by common biosolids application to arable land; (ii) treated effluents increase the mobility of weakly acidic PCs mainly by increasing of the soil solution pH and not due to complexation of the PCs with dissolved organic matter; and (iii) it is highly important to evaluate transport behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations and not to base modeling on data obtained from experiments conducted in high concentrations.

AB Growing use of xenobiotic substances, synthetic fragrances, pesticides, drugs, and other contaminants is leading to their increasing concentrations in the aquatic environment (over 1 mu g/L). Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTP) are unable to degrade these contaminants entirely. In this study, solar photo-Fenton process is proposed and optimized as a tertiary treatment for MWTP effluents containing emerging contaminants (ECs) and other micro-pollutants. A three-level factorial experimental design (3(3)), modified with 2 x 3 axial and 6 central runs to make it spherical was carried out for optimization using Statgraphics software. The influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage, iron (II) concentration and temperature were assessed over accumulated energy (QUV kJ/L as the response factor) necessary to remove more than 95% of the micro-pollutants. Pareto graphic and response surfaces showed that Fe (II) concentration, temperature and their interaction are the variables that influence the response factor the most. Finally, the optimal operating conditions were successfully applied to the treatment of a real MWTP effluent at pilot plant scale removing 80% of total micropollutants after 0.56 kJ/L.

AB In this study, high permeability flat sheet polysulfone nanofiltration membranes were prepared for amoxicillin (AMX) recovery from pharmaceutical wastewater. Membrane fabrication includes two steps: raw ultrafiltration membrane synthesis by phase inversion method and nanaofiltration membrane synthesis by surface photopolymerization. Raw ultrafiltration membranes were synthesized using different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as pore former and different coagulation bath temperatures (CBTs). The synthesized ultrafiltration membranes were modified using UV-assisted polymerization technique and their performance in the separation of AMX at different pHs, were studied. The results showed that the more irradiation time, the smaller surface pore size. Moreover, the membranes made with higher molecular weight of PEG and coagulation bath temperatures were more susceptible for UV-modification at these conditions; fabricated membranes had higher flux as well as relatively high AMX separation. Moreover, pH enhancement increased AMX rejection by 85%. The effect of irradiation on membrane surface morphology was studied by SEM surface images and the morphological effects of pore former and coagulation bath temperatures on membrane structure were confirmed by SEM cross section images. A fairly comprehensive discussion about the effects of PEG, coagulation bath temperature and irradiation time on membrane structure and AMX recovery performance was represented in this study.

AB To study the possibility of producing better water quality from municipal wastewater, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant with flat sheet (FS) and hollow fiber (HF) membranes coupled with another pilot plant equipped with nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were operated to treat municipal wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Rincon de Leon, Alicante (Spain). This study was focused on improving the quality of the permeate obtained from the MBR process when complemented by NF or RO stages with respect to salinity, organic matter and nutrients. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies of 10 EMPs were evaluated, comparing the reductions achieved between the wastewater treatment by MBR (adsorption to sludge and biodegradation) and the later treatment using NF or RO (mainly size exclusion). The results showed that the high quality of water was obtained which is appropriate for reuse with salinity removal efficiencies higher than 97%, 96% for total organic carbon (TOC), 91% for nitrates (NO3-) and 99% for total phosphorous (TP). High removal efficiencies were obtained for the majority of the analyzed EMP compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REMOVAL; GENERATION
AB The pre-treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by Fenton oxidation with zero-valent iron (ZVI) and hydrogen peroxide was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The influence of different crucial parameters such as the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, the ZVI concentration and the capacity of the ZVI/H2O2 system to treat different organic loading have been evaluated. The optimal conditions for degradation led to TOC reductions of up to 80% in only 1 h of treatment. This degree of organic mineralization was reached by using moderate loadings of ZVI and hydrogen peroxide (ZVI/TOC weight and H2O2/TOC molar ratios of 12 and 3.2, respectively). Moreover, the use of waste-metallic iron shavings in terms of TOC removal compared to commercial ZVI powder may be a promising and cheaper development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation, is effective in improving the quality of, municipal wastewater effluents by eliminating organic micropollutants. Nevertheless, ozone process design is still limited by (i) the large number of structurally diverse micropollutants and (ii) the varying quality Of wastewater matrices (especially dissolved, organic matter). These issues were addressed by grouping 16 micropollutants according to their, ozone and hydroxyl radical, ((OH)-O-center dot) rate constants and normalizing the applied ozone dose to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (i.e., g O-3/g DOC). Consistent elimination of micropollutants., was observed in 10 secondary municipal wastewater effluents spiked with 16 micropollutants (similar to 2 mu g/L) in the absence of ozone demand exerted by nitrite. The elimination of ozone-refractory micropollutants was well predicted by measuring the (OH)-O-center dot exposure by the decrease of the probe compound p-chlorobenzoic acid. The average molar (OH)-O-center dot yields (moles of (OH)-O-center dot produced per mole of ozone consumed) were 21 +/- 3% for g O-3/g DOC = 1.0, and the average rate constant for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot with effluent organic matter was (2.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(4) (mg C/L)(-1) s(-1). On the basis of these results, a DOC-normalized ozone dose, together with the rate constants for the reaction of the selected micropollutants with ozone and (OH)-O-center dot, and the measurement of the (OH)-O-center dot exposure are proposed as key parameters for the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutants during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents with varying water quality.

AB Despite the fact that some hydrophobic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been found to accumulate in river sediments, little is known about the contribution of these compounds to the toxicity of the whole sediment. We sampled river sediments from two urban creeks with an unsewered drainage area to investigate the toxicity for a benthic organism, Chironomus yoshimatsui. The concentrations of selected hydrophobic PPCPs, triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC) and galaxolide (HHCB) were analysed using gas chromatographic mass spectroscopy or liquid chromatographic mass spectroscopy and were found to lie within the range 50 to 200ngg(-1). The toxicity of the three individual contaminants for the chironomid was also determined. The toxicity of TCC was found to be the strongest, with an NOEC value of 2.5gg(-1). Combining the toxicity and measured environmental concentration, the ecological risk was assessed and the contribution of these contaminants to the whole sediment toxicity estimated, assuming additivity. The hazard quotient of all three compounds, determined without assessment factor, ranged between 0.01 and 0.1. The combined contribution of the three compounds to total sediment toxicity was as high as 8.2%, but other unknown factors may also make an important contribution.

AB Antibiotics are pharmaceutical compounds widely used to treat a broad range of infections. These chemicals appear to be recalcitrant compounds when released to water systems, and their presence at the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and surface waters has been widely documented. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a sulfonamide commonly used to treat urinary infections, is one of them. Ozonation was proved to be a suitable method to remove SMX antibiotic in water. However, it is stated that a high ozone dosage would be necessary to achieve the complete mineralization of the intermediates. In this work, ozonation is coupled with a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) in order to completely degrade SMX and its metabolites from water solutions. Moreover, a precise description of the microbial community in the bioreactor is provided by means of traditional microscopy and molecular biology techniques. The results obtained showed high Total Organic Carbon removals at the end of the biological treatment (89% removal). Furthermore, nitrates produced during the aerobic SBBR's performance were monitored and eliminated by adding an anoxic stage, achieving an overall nitrogen removal of 86%. A bacterial community analysis of the SBBR during aerobic and aerobic-anoxic conditions was performed, targeting the bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. These results revealed a dominant contribution of bacteria from the Proteobacteria class, with a major contribution from the Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales orders during the bioreactor performance, counting 52% of the total population.

The volume of the surfactant rich phase (V-s), aqueous phase (V-w), preconcentration factor (C-F), distribution coefficient (K-d), and percentage of recovery (%R) were evaluated to obtain the optimum condition for phase separation of parabens. Satisfactory results were obtained whereby the preconcentration factor for methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and benzylparaben were close to 65, 60, 80, and 45, respectively, at 0.5% weight of surfactant. The presence of DC193C gave a low phase volume ratio but insignificant result was observed with the increased of surfactant concentration. The parabens were well separated on a reverse-phase Chromolith C-18 column (100mmx4.6mm) with a gradient elution (acetonitrile: water; 30:70 v/v) and detected at 254nm. The proposed method was successfully applied to environmental samples such as river water, treated wastewater, sea water, and tap water with satisfactory results. The method detection limit was 0.1-0.2 ppb and the recoveries were 71.2-97.7% with the relative standard deviations of 0.3-2.1%.

AB The concentration of a range of endocrine disruptors: 17-beta-estradiol, estrone, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol-A, pentachlorophenol, triclosan, and butylbenzylphthalate, was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the Wetland zone of Xochimilco, a periurban area of Mexico City, during an annual cycle. Samples were taken based on their level of use and by selecting sampling points related with activities such as agriculture, livestock, and urban, as well as their potential presence in water at the Cerro de la Estrella Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which supplies the majority of water (>90 %) to the study area. The compounds analyzed are present in a wide range of products from cosmetics to home care, pharmaceuticals, and subproducts of the food industry. The importance of identifying these compounds lies in the fact that they can disrupt the endocrine system of vertebrates, in particular reproductive gland function, affecting the development of organisms and their offspring. Pentachlorophenol, triclosan, bisphenol-A, butylbenzylphthalate, estrone, and 17-beta-estradiol were detected in concentrations in nanogram-per-liter levels; 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol was always below the detection limit. The compounds showed a trend toward greater concentrations in the rainy season, probably due to the runoff that carries these compounds into the system.

AB Little information exists on the co-occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacterial pathogens, and organic wastewater-associated chemicals (OWCs) within Great Lakes tributaries. Fifteen watershed sites and one beach site adjacent to the Little Calumet River-Portage Burns Waterway (LCRPBW) on Lake Michigan were tested on four dates for pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, chloride, color, ammonia- and nitrate-nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, sulfate, turbidity, and atrazine; for concentrations of FIB; and for genes indicating the presence of human-pathogenic enterococci (ENT) and of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (EC) from various animal sources. Nineteen samples were also tested for 60 OWCs. Half of the watershed samples met EC recreational water quality standards; none met ENT standards. Human-wastewater-associated OWC detections were correlated with human-influence indicators such as population/km(2), chloride concentrations, and the presence of WWTP effluents, but EC and ENT concentrations were not. Bacterial pathogen genes indicated rural human and several potential animal sources. OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern (musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB, alkylphenols, carbamazepine) and 3 bacterial pathogen genes were detected at the mouth of the LCRPBW, but no such OWCs and only 1 pathogen gene were detected at the beach. The LCRPBW has significant potential to deliver FIB, potential bacterial pathogens, and OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern to the nearshore of Lake Michigan, under conditions enhancing nearshore transport of the river plume. Nearshore mixing of lake and river water, and the lack of relationship between OWCs and FIB or pathogen genes, pose numerous challenges for watershed and nearshore assessment and remediation.

AB Biodegradation of organic wastewater constituents by activated sludge microorganisms is based on enzymatic processes. It is supposed that wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) differ in their enzymatic fingerprints. To determine such fingerprints, activated sludges from nine aerated tanks of six WWTPs were repeatedly sampled and analyzed for the activities of L-alanine aminopeptidase, esterase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, phosphotriesterase, and sulfatase. In one WWTP the enzymatic activities and their variations within 1 week were assayed in various process stages.
   Mostly the enzymatic profiles were dominated by L-alanine aminopeptidase, followed by alkaline phosphatase. They differed in variable contributions of esterase, phosphodiesterase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase. The sulfatase activity was generally low. For the first time phosphotriesterase activity was detected in various samples, but with limited analytical validity. Particle mass-related activities of individual enzymes varied between plants by factors 2-4 and up to 11, when related to suspension volumes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Kinetics of pure compounds in batch agitated reactors are useful data to clarify the characteristics of a given reaction, but they frequently do not provide the required information to design industrial mixed continuous processes because in this case the final and intermediate products interact with the reaction of interest, due to backmixing effects. Simultaneously, the presence and transformations of other compounds, frequent in industrial wastewater treatments, adds more complexity to these types of interactions, whose effect can be different, favorable or unfavorable, for chemical or biological reactions. In this work, batch laboratory reactor data were obtained for the wet oxidation and biodegradation of four phenolic compounds present in a pharmaceutical wastewater and then compared with those collected from industrial continuous stirred tank reactors. For wet oxidation, batch laboratory degradation rates were significantly lower than those found in industrial continuous stirred operation. This behavior was explained by a different distribution of intermediate compounds in lab and industrial treatments, caused by the degree of backmixing and the synergistic effects between phenolic compounds (matrix effects). On the other hand, the specific utilization rates during aerobic biodegradation in the continuous industrial operation were lower than those measured in the laboratory, due to the simultaneous presence of the four pollutants in the industrial process (matrix effects) increasing the inhibitory effects of these compounds and its intermediates.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation is a practical solution for overcoming water scarcity, especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world. However, there are several potential environmental and health-related risks associated with this practice. One such risk stems from the fact that TWW irrigation may increase antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in soil bacteria, potentially contributing to the global propagation of clinical AR. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been recognized as significant environmental AR reservoirs due to selective pressure generated by antibiotics and other compounds that are frequently detected in effluents. This review summarizes a myriad of recent studies that have assessed the impact of anthropogenic practices on AR in environmental bacterial communities, with specific emphasis on elucidating the potential effects of TWW irrigation on AR in the soil microbiome. Based on the current state of the art, we conclude that contradictory to freshwater environments where WWTP effluent influx tends to expand antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes levels, TWW irrigation does not seem to impact AR levels in the soil microbiome. Although this conclusion is a cause for cautious optimism regarding the future implementation of TWW irrigation, we conclude that further studies aimed at assessing the scope of horizontal gene transfer between effluent-associated ARB and soil bacteria need to be further conducted before ruling out the possible contribution of TWW irrigation to antibiotic-resistant reservoirs in irrigated soils.

AB This study reports the synthesis and characterization of composite nitrogen and fluorine co-doped titanium dioxide (NF-TiO2) for the removal of contaminants of concern in wastewater under visible and solar light. Monodisperse anatase TiO2 nanoparticles of different sizes and Evonik P25 were assembled to immobilized NF-TiO2 by direct incorporation into the sol-gel or by the layer-by-layer technique. The composite films were characterized with X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and porosimetry analysis. The photocatalytic degradation of atrazine, carbamazepine, and caffeine was evaluated in a synthetic water solution and in an effluent from a hybrid biological concentrator reactor (BCR). Minor aggregation and improved distribution of monodisperse titania particles was obtained with NF-TiO2-monodisperse (10 and 50 nm) from the layer-by-layer technique than with NF-TiO2 + monodisperse TiO2 (300 nm) directly incorporated into the sol. The photocatalysts synthesized with the layer-by-layer method achieved significantly higher degradation rates in contrast with NF-TiO2-monodisperse titania (300 nm) and slightly faster values when compared with NF-TiO2-P25. Using NF-TiO2 layer-by-layer with monodisperse TiO2 (50 nm) under solar light irradiation, the respective degradation rates in synthetic water and BCR effluent were 14.6 and 9.5 x 10(-3) min(-1) for caffeine, 12.5 and 9.0 x 10(-3) min(-1) for carbamazepine, and 10.9 and 5.8 x 10(-3) min(-1) for atrazine. These results suggest that the layer-by-layer technique is a promising method for the synthesis of composite TiO2-based films compared to the direct addition of nanoparticles into the sol.

AB The capability of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) to remove the iodinated contrast media (ICM) iohexol (IOX) and diatrizoate (DTZ) from municipal wastewater was studied. A selected number of clones of microorganisms present in the biofilm were identified. Biotransformation products were tentatively identified and the toxicity of the treated effluent was assessed. Microbial samples were DNA-sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis in order to confirm the identity of the microorganisms present and determine the microbial diversity. The analysis demonstrated that the wastewater was populated by a bacterial consortium related to different members of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Nitrisporae. The optimum removal values of the ICM achieved were 79 % for IOX and 73 % for DTZ, whereas 13 biotransformation products for IOX and 14 for DTZ were identified. Their determination was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The toxicity of the treated effluent tested to Daphnia magna showed no statistical difference compared to that without the addition of the two ICM. The MBBR was proven to be a technology able to remove a significant percentage of the two ICM from urban wastewater without the formation of toxic biodegradation products. A large number of biotransformation products was found to be formed. Even though the amount of clones sequenced in this study does not reveal the entire bacterial diversity present, it provides an indication of the predominating phylotypes inhabiting the study site.

AB The Fenton-like degradation of nalidixic acid was studied in this work. The effects of Fe3+ concentration and initial H2O2 concentration were investigated. Increasing the initial H2O2 concentration enhances the degradation and mineralization efficiency for nalidixic acid, while Fe3+ shows an optimal concentration of 0.25 mM. A complete removal of nalidixic acid and a TOC removal of 28 % were achieved in 60 min under a reaction condition of [Fe3+] = 0.25 mM, [H2O2] = 10 mM, T = 35 A degrees C, and pH = 3. LC-MS analysis technique was used to analyze the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation pathways of nalidixic acid were proposed according to the identified intermediates and the electron density distribution of nalidixic acid. The Fenton-like degradation reaction of nalidixic acid mainly begins with the electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radical towards the C-3 position which results in the ring-opening reaction; meanwhile, hydroxyl radical attacking to the branched alkyl groups of nalidixic acid leads to the oxidation at the branched alkyl groups.

AB Among all the pharmaceutical drugs that contaminate the environment, antibiotics occupy an important place due to their high consumption rates in both veterinary and human medicine. The present study examined the ability of Pseudomonas putida to grow on the antibiotic wastewater, currently expanding in Tunisia, containing amoxicillin and cefadroxil. P. putida was very efficient to grow quickly in pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) and in reducing the total dissolved solids to 80.1 %. Cytotoxicity of PW, before and after biodegradation with P. putida mt-2, was evaluated in vitro, using the MTT assay, against four human tumor cell lines such as A549 (lung cell carcinoma), HCT15 (colon cell carcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and U373 (glioma cell carcinoma). The PW reduced all human cell lines viability in a dose-dependent manner. This activity was very remarkable against U373 cell line. For this reason, we have tested the genotoxicity of PW using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation. In fact, PW has statistically significant (p < 0.001) influence on DNA. Indeed, the percentage of genotoxicity was 66.87 and 87.5 %, after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively. However, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity decreased strongly when tested the PW obtained after incubation with P. putida mt-2. Our results indicate that P. putida is a promising and improved alternative to treating industrial-scale effluent compared to current chemical treatment procedures used by the industrials.

AB Pharmaceuticals constitute an important environmental issue for receiving waters. A holistic approach, taking into consideration the sources of these compounds (hospitals, domestic use), discharges (wastewater effluent, combined sewer overflows) and related risks to the environment, is therefore needed to develop the best protection strategy.
   The substance flow analysis (SFA) approach, applied, for example, to the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, is an ideal tool to tackle these issues. Four substances were considered: one antibiotic (ciprofloxacin), an analgesic (diclofenac), and two anti-epileptics (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Consumption data for the main hospital of the city (916 beds) and for the population were available. Micropollutant concentrations were measured at different points of the system: wastewater inlet and outlet (WWTP), combined sewer overflows (CSO) and in the receiving waters (Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva). Measured and predicted concentrations were in agreement, except for diclofenac, for which analytical uncertainties were expected. Seven different scenarios were considered (supplementary treatment at the WWTP, at the hospital or at both places, etc.). Based on the results obtained, the supplementary treatment at the WWTP decreases the load of pharmaceuticals reaching surface water by a factor between 2 and 27, depending on the compound and on the technique. The treatment at the hospitals only influences the amount of ciprofloxacin reaching the environment and decreases the release by one third. The contribution of CSO to surface water pollution is low compared to that of the WWTP for the selected compounds. Regarding the risk for the receiving waters, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most problematic compound, with a risk quotient far above 1. In this particular case, a treatment at the WWTP is not sufficient to reduce the risk, and additional measures at the CSO or at the hospital should be considered. SFA is an ideal tool for developing the best strategy for pharmaceutical elimination, but its application depends on data availability and local conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the influences of solid retention time (SRT), nitrification, and microbial activity on the attenuation of pharmaceuticals and estrogens and the total estrogenic activity, using identical bench-scale membrane bioreactors. Phenacetine, acetaminophen, pentoxifylline, caffeine, bezafibrate, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone were effectively attenuated even at short SRT (8 d). However, the attenuation efficiencies of gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, clofibric acid, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were dependent upon SRTs (20 and 80 d). Some acidic pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, diclofenac, bezafibrate, and ketoprofen) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were partially degraded by nitrification. Relatively high removal efficiencies were observed for 17 beta-estradiol and estrone (natural estrogens) compared to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (synthetic estrogen) when nitrification was inhibited. Most of selected pharmaceuticals were not significantly attenuated under presumably abiotic conditions by adding sodium azide except phenacetine, acetaminophen, and caffeine. In this study, carbamazepine was found to be recalcitrant to biological wastewater treatment using membrane bioreactors regardless of the change of SRTs and microbial activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Though decentralized on-site technologies are extensively employed for wastewater treatment around the globe, an understanding of effluent water quality impairments associated with these systems remain less understood than effluent discharges from centralized municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Using a unique experimental facility, a novel comparative, analysis of effluent water quality was performed from model decentralized aerobic (ATS) and septic (STS) on-site wastewater treatment systems and a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant (MTP). The ATS and STS units did not benefit from further soil treatment. Each system received common influent wastewater from the Waco, Texas, USA Metropolitan Area Regional Sewerage System. We tested the hypothesis that MTP effluent would exhibit higher water quality than on-site effluents, based on parameters selected for study. A tiered testing approach was employed to assess the three effluent discharges: select routine water quality parameters (Tier I), whole effluent toxicity (Tier II), and select endocrine-active compounds (Tier III). Contrary to our hypothesis, ATS effluent was not statistically different from MTP effluents, based on Tier I and III parameters, but reproductive responses of Daphnia magna were slightly more sensitive to ATS than MTP effluents. STS effluent water quality was identified as most degraded of the three wastewater treatment systems. Parameters used to assess centralized wastewater treatment plant effluent water quality such as whole effluent toxicity and endocrine active substances appear useful for water quality assessments of decentralized discharges. Aerobic on-site wastewater treatment systems may represent more robust options than traditional septic systems for on-site wastewater treatment in watersheds with appreciable groundwater - surface water exchange.

AB Urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluents are among the possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) spread into the environment. In this work, the effect of UV radiation on antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains was compared with that of chlorination process. Under the investigated conditions, UV disinfection process resulted in a total inactivation after 60 min of irradiation (1.25 x 10(4) mu W s cm(-2)) compared to 120 min chlorine contact time (initial chlorine dose of 2 mg L-1). Moreover, no change in E. coli strains' resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) (minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) > 256 mg L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (MIC > 1024 mg L-1) could be observed after UV treatment, while the treatment affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to ciprofloxacin (CPX) (MIC decreased by 33% and 50% after 60 and 120 min, respectively). Contrarily, chlorination process did not affect antibiotic resistance of the investigated E. coli strains. Finally, the effect of UV radiation on the mixture of three antibiotics was also investigated and photodegradation data fit quite well pseudo first order kinetic models with rip values of 14, 20 and 25 min for CPX, AMX and SMZ, respectively. According to these results, conventional disinfection processes may not be effective in the inactivation of ARB, and the simultaneous release of ARB and antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations into UWWTP effluent may promote the development of resistance among bacteria in receiving water.

AB The photolytic degradation of norfloxacin, enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolone antibacterials widely used in human and veterinary medicine, was investigated under simulated solar irradiation in different water matrices (river water and synthetic wastewater similar by composition to wastewater of pharmaceutical industry). The results showed that investigated fluoroquinolones degrade very quickly and photodegradation followed pseudo first order kinetics. The slowest photodegradation rate was observed in river water for all three fluoroquinolones. In the case of pharmaceutical mixture irradiation, no significant differences in rate constants were observed compared to single-component experiments. The structures of photodegradation products were determined and photodegradation pathways were suggested. Two main processes occurred primary from enrofloxacin depending on pH values: (I) cyclopropane ring cleavage at pH 4 and (II) oxidative photodegradation at pH 8. The structures of the photoproducts E-1 to E-6 are unknown and have not been reported for this fluoroquinolone. For ciprofloxacin two main processes were also identified depending on experimental conditions. Under acidic conditions (pH 4), reactions involved rather the quinolone ring (cleavage of the cyclopropane ring and fluorine solvolysis), while at pH 8 the side-chain reactions took place. The photodegradation pathway of norfloxacin somewhat differed from the previous two. There was no significant dependence on reaction conditions and there were no two different pathways. Determination and identification of photodegradation products were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The obtained results are of importance for assessing the environmental fate of fluoroquinolones in aqueous media. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to concerns about ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants released from wastewater treatment plants, activated carbon adsorption is one of the few processes to effectively reduce the concentrations of micropollutants in wastewater. Although aimed mainly at apolar compounds, polar compounds are also simultaneously removed to a certain extent, which has rarely been studied before. In this study, adsorption isotherm and batch kinetic data were collected with two powdered activated carbons (PACs) to assess the removal of the polar pharmaceuticals 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and cytarabine (CytR) from ultrapure water and wastewater treatment plant effluent. At pH 7.8, single-solute adsorption isotherm data for the weak acid 5-Fu and the weak base CytR showed that their adsorption capacities were about 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the less polar endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). To remove 90 % of the adsorbate from a single-solute solution 14, 18, 70, and 87 mg L-1 of HOK Super is required for EE2, BPA, CytR, and 5-Fu, respectively. Effects of solution pH, ionic strength, temperature, and effluent organic matter (EfOM) on 5-Fu and CytR adsorption were evaluated for one PAC. Among the studied factors, the presence of EfOM had the highest effect, due to a strong competition on 5-Fu and CytR adsorption. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic data and their modeling with a homogeneous surface diffusion model showed that removal percentage in the presence of EfOM was independent on the initial concentration of the ionizable compounds 5-Fu and CytR. These results are similar to neutral organic compounds in the presence of natural organic matter. Overall, results showed that PAC doses sufficient to remove > 90 % of apolar adsorbates were able to remove no more than 50 % of the polar adsorbates 5-Fu and CytR and that the contact time is a critical parameter.

AB In the last years, a lot of emerging contaminants, such as, endocrine disruptors compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in wastewater. Because of their toxicity and possible adverse effects on the environment and humans, their release from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) effluents should be minimized, particularly when a wastewater reuse for crops irrigation is expected. Many processes have been investigated for advanced treatment of UWWTP effluents as well as for emerging contaminant degradation; among these, adsorption process was successfully used to remove EDCs and PPCPs from wastewater. This article shortly reviews EDCs and PPCPs removal from UWWTP effluents by adsorption process using conventional and non-conventional adsorbents. The fate of EDCs and PPCPs in UWWTPs and the implications for agricultural wastewater reuse has been addressed too. In spite of the adsorption process looking to be a valuable alternative to other advanced technologies for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater, some gaps still remain to evaluate the actual feasibility at full scale. However, according to a few studies available in scientific literature on the use of both powdered activated carbon and granular activated carbon at full scale, adsorption process by activated carbon is a promising, potentially effective, and economically feasible solution for producing safe wastewater for agricultural reuse.

AB A 28-day bioassay was performed with Carcinus maenas to evaluate chronic effects caused by exposure to caffeine and ibuprofen (0.1-50 mu g L-1) in sea water. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) was evaluated in hemolymph applying the neutral red retention assay (NRRA); several biomarkers including ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase (DBF), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage were studied in gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and gonad tissues. In crabs exposed to environmental concentrations of the drugs, retention time was reduced by 50%. EROD and DBFOD activities were induced by caffeine in muscle and hepatopancreas tissues (p < 0.05); GST activity was activated by ibuprofen in gill, hepatopancreas and muscle at the highest concentrations tested (p < 0.05). All tissues showed GPX activity and LPO induction (p < 0.05). Crabs exposed to caffeine and ibuprofen showed evidence of DNA damage mainly in hepatopancreas tissues (p < 0.05). Environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals induce LMS and the biochemical responses studied in this crab. This methodology is a suitable technique for assessing pharmaceutical toxicity in the marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental agencies must monitor an ever increasing range of contaminants of emerging concern, including endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). An alternative to using ultra-trace chemical analysis of samples for EDCs is to test for biological activity using in vitro screening assays, then use these assay results to direct analytical chemistry approaches. In this study, we used both analytical approaches and in vitro bioassays to characterize the EDCs present in treated wastewater from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Ontario, Canada. Estrogen-mediated activity was assessed using a yeast estrogenicity screening (YES) assay. An in vitro competitive binding assay was used to assess capacity to interfere with binding of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4) to the recombinant human thyroid hormone transport protein, transthyretin (i.e. hTTR). An in vitro binding assay with a rat peroxisome proliferator responsive element transfected into a rainbow trout gill cell line was used to evaluate binding and subsequent gene expression via the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR). Analyses of a suite of contaminants known to be EDCs in extracts from treated wastewater were conducted using either gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Estrogenic activity was detected in the YES assay only in those extracts that contained detectable amounts of estradiol (E2). There was a positive relationship between the degree of response in the T4-hTTR assay and the amounts of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners 47 and 99, triclosan and the PBDE metabolite, 4-OH-BDE17. Several wastewater extracts gave a positive response in the PPAR assay, but these responses were not correlated with the amounts of any of the EDCs analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Overall, these data indicate that a step-wise approach is feasible using a combination of in vitro testing and instrumental analysis to monitor for EDCs in wastewater and other environmental matrixes.

AB Water sample storage and stabilisation may affect data quality, if samples are managed improperly. In this study three stabilising strategies are evaluated for 46 relevant organic micro-pollutants: addition of the biocides (i) copper sulphate and (ii) sodium azide to water samples directly after sampling with subsequent sample storage as liquid phase and (iii) direct solid phase extraction (SPE), stabilising the samples by reducing the activity of water. River water and treated effluent were chosen as commonly investigated matrices with a high potential of biotransformation activity. Analyses were carried out for sample storage temperatures of 4 and 28 degrees C for water samples stored as liquid phase and for sample storage temperatures of 4, 20 and 40 degrees C for SPE cartridges. Cooling of water samples alone was not sufficient for longer storage times (>24 h). While copper sulphate caused detrimental interferences with nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds, sodium azide proved to be a suitable stabilising agent. The best results could be obtained for SPE cartridges stored cool. Recommendations for samples preservation are provided. (C), 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seventy-three commonly administered pharmaceuticals from twelve different therapeutic classes were investigated at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in northern Italy featuring a conventional activated sludge system (full-scale) and a polishing horizontal subsurface flow bed (pilot plant). Removal of these micro-pollutants by the two systems was assessed in order to evaluate their respective contributions. Mean concentrations and standard deviations were calculated and found to differ for the compounds detected, ranging from few ng/L to over 1165 ng/L in the secondary effluent and from 11 to 533 in the polished effluent. Eighteen compounds were consistently below the detection limit and the remaining 55 compounds were found at a minimum of one sampling point.
   Average removal efficiencies of both treatment steps and in treatment train as a whole are evaluated and discussed, highlighting the difficulties in predicting the fate of pharmaceuticals in both an activated sludge system and a horizontal subsurface flow bed. Comparison between the observed average removal efficiencies and those reported in the literature was also carried out for the pharmaceuticals of interest, and the discrepancies that emerged are discussed. The investigated constructed wetland did show efficacy in removing some of these compounds, and it contributed to the overall removal efficiency of each therapeutic class. Indeed, evaluation of the specific mass loadings of each class of PhC detected in the raw wastewaters, secondary and polished effluent evidences that the investigated constructed wetland is able to further reduce the load of micropollutants, which could become a necessity, especially where the receiving water body is an effluent-dominant river and mitigation measures of the discharge impact are required to protect and safeguard the aquatic environment.

AB This paper presents, for the first time, spatial and temporal occurrence of a comprehensive set of >60 pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater (7 wastewater treatment plants utilising different treatment technologies) and a major river in the UK over a 12 month period. This paper also undertakes a comparison of the efficiency of processes utilised during wastewater treatment and it discusses under-researched aspects of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the environment including sorption to solids and stereoselectivity in the fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters.
   The removal efficiency of analytes strongly depended on the type of wastewater treatment technology employed and denoted <50% or >60% in the case of tricking filter and activated sludge respectively. It should be stressed, however, that the removal rate was highly variable for different groups of compounds. A clear increase in the cumulative concentration of all monitored compounds was observed in receiving waters; thus highlighting the impact of WWTP discharge on water quality and the importance of the removal efficiency of WWTPs. No seasonal variation was observed with regard to the total load of targeted compounds in the river each month. The concentration of each analyte was largely dependent on rainfall and the dilution factor of WWTP discharge. These results indicate that although the drugs of abuse are not present at very high concentrations in river water (typically low ng L-1 levels), their occurrence and possible synergic action is of concern, and the study of multiple groups of drugs of abuse is of significant importance.

AB Everyday domestic activity is a significant source of water pollution. The presence of six household micropollutants in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was assessed in wastewater and sludge. A multi-target analytical method was developed for the quantification of ibuprofen, erythromycin, ofloxacin, 4-nonylphenol, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (triclosan), and sucralose. The micropollutants were extracted from the liquid and solid phases and their concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS. The efficiency of micropollutants' removal within a conventional activated sludge process was assessed. From 50 % to 90 % of ibuprofen and erythromycin was removed from the wastewater liquid phase. Their removal can be attributed to biological degradation as they were not found adsorbed on the outlet sludge. Ofloxacin and triclosan were removed from the liquid phase with similar efficiencies; however, they were adsorbed on the sludge, so it was not possible to determine their removal mechanism (whether biodegradation or displacement to solid phase/sequestration). Sucralose was not removed from wastewater (3 mu g L-1 in inlet and outlet liquid phase) and not adsorbed on the sludge. 4-Nonylphenol concentrations were sometimes higher in the WWTP outlet water; this may relate to the degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates in the wastewater treatment process. 4-Nonylphenol was always present in the outlet sludge.

AB The extent hospital effluent contributes to antimicrobial presence in the environment and its impact on resistance dissemination remains unknown. To investigate the fate of the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin in hospital effluent a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to model levels from hospital use to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent release, in addition to modeling resistance formation potential, hazard quotient (HQ) and swimmer exposure. The mean predicted concentration (PC) of ciprofloxacin in hospital effluent, urban effluent, WWTP effluent, sludge, soil and sea water was 579, 6.06, 2.59, 3.48, 0.006 and 0.15mg/m3, respectively. A parallel surveillance study confirmed levels of ciprofloxacin above or below the limit of detection. The model predicted levels would never exceed the ECOSAR toxicity value. The model predicted a 98% probability of ciprofloxacin exhibiting a HQ > 1 (low toxicity concern). The mean ciprofloxacin PC in WWTP effluent was less than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The probability of conditions in WWTP effluent being favorable for resistance at 20% and 80% of the MIC was 3% and 72%, respectively. In all instances, when the MIC was bound, the probability for resistance formation within soil and sea water was < 1%. The probability of a swimmer being exposed to a level of ciprofloxacin greater than the acceptable daily intake was negligible. The study concluded that release of hospital effluent into the environment may lead to concentrations of ciprofloxacin which are of low toxicity concern but may be conducive to resistance formation and allow for the dissemination of resistance.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are a contaminant of emerging concern throughout the world, including developing countries where centralized water and wastewater treatment plants are not common. In developing countries, household scale water treatment technologies such as the biosand filter (BSF) are used to improve drinking water quality. No studies currently exist on the ability of the BSF to remove EDCs. In this experiment, the BSF was evaluated for the removal of three EDCs, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and 17-ethinyl estradiol (EE2). Removal results were compared to the slow sand filter (SSF) from the literature, which is similar to the BSF in principal but comparisons have revealed differences in removal of other water quality parameters between SSF and BSF. In general, the BSF minimally removed the compounds from spiked lake water as removal was less than 15% for all three compounds, though mass removal much higher than other studies in which the SSF was used. Household bleach was added to the rate was BSF effluent as suggested in order to achieve different Cl- concentrations (0.67, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0mg/L) and subsequent removal of EDCs by oxidation was examined. Concentrations were reduced > 98% for all compounds when the Cl- concentration was greater than 5mg/L. Removal efficiency was > 50% at the 0.67mg/L Cl- concentration, while almost 70% removal was observed for all compounds at the 2.0mg/L Cl- concentration.

AB The antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) and the synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), are present in municipal sewage discharges. To better understand possible interactions between them, male goldfish were exposed to an ethanol control or to nominal concentrations of FLX (0.54 mu g/L) and EE2 (5 ng/L) alone and in combination for 14 days. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess effects on hepatic gene expression and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the plasma proteome. The results showed an increase in estrogen receptor alpha (esr1) and vitellogenin (vtg) gene expression by 1.9-2.4-fold in the FLX and EE2 groups, but this did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, co-exposure up regulated esr1 and vtg gene expression by 5.5- and 5.3-fold, respectively. Fluoxetine and EE2 alone did not affect estrogen receptor beta (esr2), but the co-exposure down regulated esr2 expression by 50%. There was a significant increase in the number of plasma proteins that were related to endocrine system disorders in the FLX and FLX plus EE2 groups. The level of VTG protein was increased in the plasma from goldfish exposed to EE2, FLX, and FLX plus EE2. Our study demonstrates that low concentrations of FLX and EE2 in a simple mixture produce strong estrogen-like effects in the male goldfish.

AB The goal of this series of studies was to identify commercial chemicals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (PB) and that were not being considered in, current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. In this,study, we focus on chemicals that are not on commercial chemical lists such as U.S. EPA's Inventory Update Rule but may be found as byproducts or impurities in commercial chemicals or are likely transformation products from commercial chemical use. We evaluated the 610 chemicals from our earlier publication as well as high production volume chemicals and, identified 320 chemicals (39 byproducts and impurities, and 281. transformation products). that could be potential PB chemicals. Four examples are discussed in detail; these chemicals had a fair amount of information on the commercial synthesis and byproducts and impurities that might be found in the commercial product. Unfortunately for many of the 610 chemicals, as well as the transformation products, little or no information was available. Use of computer-aided software to predict the transformation. pathways in combination., with the biodegradation rules of thumb. and some basic organic chemistry has allowed 281 potential PB transformation products to be suggested for some of the 610 commercial chemicals; more PB transformation products were:not selected, since microbial, degradation often results in less persistent and less bioaccumulative metabolites.

AB The purpose of this study was to find out whether the use of a combination of nanofiltration (NF) and solar photo-Fenton is more efficient than photo-Fenton alone as a tertiary treatment. Five different pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole) dissolved (100 mu g L-1) in natural water were preconcentrated by NF and treated by solar photo-Fenton. Photo-Fenton was operated at pH 5 with 5 mg L-1 of Fe2+. The NF system consists of two membranes operating simultaneously with a total surface area of 5.2 m(2). The photo-Fenton experiments were carried out in a 3 m(2) CPC solar pilot plant with a 35 L total volume. Hydrogen peroxide consumption and the pharmaceutical removal rate were used as the key evaluation parameters. It was demonstrated that at higher initial concentrations of microcontaminants, hydrogen peroxide is used more efficiently and NF pretreatment also reduced the photo-Fenton treatment time. Combined NF and photo-Fenton treatment was therefore found to be a promising approach for wastewater containing extremely low concentrations of microcontaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: This study investigated the oxidation of selected progestagenic steroid hormones by potassium permanganate at pH 6.0 and 8.0 in ultrapure water and wastewater effluents, using bench-scale assays. Second order rate constants for the reaction of potassium permanganate with progestagens (levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, norethindrone and progesterone) was determined as a function of pH, presence of natural organic matter and temperature. This work also illustrates the advantages of using a novel analytical method, the laser diode thermal desorption (LDTD-APCI) interface coupled to tandem mass spectrometry apparatus, allowing for the quick determination of oxidation rate constants and increasing sample throughput.
   Results: The second-order rate constants for progestagens with permanganate determined in bench-scale experiments ranged from 23 to 368 M-1 sec(-1) in both wastewater and ultrapure waters with pH values of 6.0 and 8.0. Two pairs of progestagens exhibited similar reaction rate constants, i.e. progesterone and medroxyprogesterone (23 to 80 M-1 sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 26 to 149 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at pH 6.0 and 8.0) and levonorgestrel and norethindrone (179 to 224 M-1 sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 180 to 368 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at pH 6.0 and 8.0). The presence of dissolved natural organic matter and the pH conditions improved the oxidation rate constants for progestagens with potassium permanganate only at alkaline pH. Reaction rates measured in Milli-Q water could therefore be used to provide conservative estimates for the oxidation rates of the four selected progestagens in wastewaters when exposed to potassium permanganate. The progestagen removal efficiencies was lower for progesterone and medroxyprogesterone (48 to 87%) than for levonorgestrel and norethindrone (78 to 97%) in Milli-Q and wastewaters at pH 6.0-8.2 using potassium permanganate dosages of 1 to 5 mg L-1 after contact times of 10 to 60 min.
   Conclusion: This work presents the first results on the permanganate-promoted oxidation of progestagens, as a function of pH, temperature as well as NOM. Progestagen concentrations used to determine rate constants were analyzed using an ultrafast laser diode thermal desorption interface coupled to tandemmass spectrometry for the analysis of water sample for progestagens.

AB This study investigated biodegradation, transformation and sludge/water partition of two natural estrogens - estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) - in a pilot-scale step-feed anoxic/oxic (A/O) wastewater treatment system. The results show that the total amounts of E1 and E2 (E1 + E2) in the water phase were approximately 9-23% of those in the sludge phase in the reactor tanks. The estrogens accumulated in the return sludge led to the increase in the estrogen concentration in the first-stage anoxic zone. The biodegradation of E1 and E2 in the first-stage aerobic zone was highly efficient. The sludge/water partition coefficients (Log K-d) of E1 and E2 were gradually increased from 2.3 and 2.6 in the first stage to 3.2 and 3.3 in the third stage, respectively, and Log K-d of E2 was higher than that of E1 in each A/O stage. In addition, the Log K-d values of E1 and E2 were larger in the aerobic zones than in the anoxic zones. Under six operation conditions tested, there was a linear relationship between the concentrations of E1 and E2 in the water phase, indicating the transformation between E1 and E2. The calculated mutual conversion equilibrium constant (K) for the transformation between E1 and E2 was significantly higher in the anoxic zones (0.38-0.81) than in the aerobic zones (0.08-0.24).

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are discharged in municipal wastewater. Effects in aquatic organisms exposed to individual pharmaceuticals in the laboratory have raised concerns regarding the environmental impacts of PPCPs, yet environmental exposures are always to complex mixtures. In this study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) showed significantly decreased embryo production after a 6 week exposure to a pharmaceutical mixture (MIX; 0.5 and 10 mu g L-1) of acetaminophen, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil and venlafaxine and to diluted wastewater effluent (WWE; 5% and 25%). Atretic oocytes and altered ovarian histology were significantly increased in female zebrafish exposed to both concentrations of MIX or WWE, which indicates a direct effect on oocyte development that may account for reduced embryo production. Apoptosis within the thecal and granulosa cell layers was identified in female zebrafish with atresia. Exposures to MIX or WINE at both concentrations severely altered kidney proximal tubule morphology, but no histological impacts on other organs were observed. Exposure of embryos to MIX or WWE at the high concentration significantly increased the incidence of developmental abnormalities. Embryo mortality was elevated with exposure to the high concentration of MIX. These studies indicate that chronic exposure of fish to pharmaceutical mixtures and wastewater impacts reproduction and induces histopathological changes, similar to what we have previously seen with single compound exposures. These data suggest that fish populations exposed to pharmaceuticals discharged in wastewater are at risk of negative impacts to reproductive capacity and health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in both receiving and drinking water due to their persistent release in wastewater effluents, raising concerns for environmental and human health. Chronic, aqueous exposure of zebrafish (Danio redo) to environmentally relevant concentrations of acetaminophen (ACE), venlafaxaine (VEN) (10 mu g L-1), carbamazepine (CBZ) and gemfibrozil (GEM) (0.5 and 10 mu g L-1) decreased reproductive output. Atretic oocytes and altered ovarian histology were seen in female zebrafish exposed to CBZ and GEM, suggesting a direct effect on oocyte development that may account for the reduced fecundity. Apoptosis within the theca and granulosa cells was identified in exposed female zebrafish with atretic oocytes by TUNEL positive staining. The incidence of follicular apoptosis was nearly 2-fold higher in exposed females than the controls. All compounds significantly altered kidney proximal tubule morphology but there was no difference in the incidence of apoptotic cells within the kidney between control and exposed in either males or females. Liver histology was altered by ACE and GEM exposure. Parental exposure to pharmaceuticals did not increase developmental abnormalities, hatching success, or mortality in embryos. Yet, direct exposure of embryos to ACE increased developmental abnormalities and mortality; exposure to 0.5 mu g L-1 of all pharmaceuticals increased mortality. CBZ decreased plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentrations in males and females. Overall, these data suggest that low concentration, chronic exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals impacts fish development as well as multiple organ systems in adult fish, leading to effects on reproduction and histology of liver and kidney. These results are significant in understanding the consequences of chronic, low concentration pharmaceutical exposure to fish and suggest that exposed populations are at risk of negative impacts to reproduction and health.

AB This work describes the removal of 6 quinolone antibiotics from wastewaters under different redox conditions (aerobic, nitrifying and anoxic) through batch experiments in laboratory scale activated sludge reactors using mixed liquor from a membrane bioreactor pilot plant (MBR). The main removal pathways for antibiotics from wastewaters involved in each treatment are described. Mass balances indicated that sorption on sludge played a dominating role in the elimination of antibiotics. Sorption potential depended on the redox conditions, being lower in nitrifying (K-d, 414-876 L kg(-1)) and anoxic (K-d, 471-930 L kg(-1)) sludge in comparison with aerobic sludge (K-d, 534-1137 L kg(-1)). Kd was higher for piperazinylic quinolones. Redox conditions also influenced biodegradation, a secondary pathway, which followed first-order kinetics with degradation rates constants ranging from 1.8.10(-3) to 8.2.10(-3) h(-1). Biodegradation rates under anoxic conditions were negligible. The experimental results have also demonstrated much higher removal efficiency by biodegradation (36.2-60.0%) under nitrifying conditions in comparison with aerobic conditions (14.9-43.8%). The addition of allylthiourea, an ammonia monooxygenase inhibitor, inhibited nitrification completely and reduced significantly the biodegradation of target antibiotics (16.5-29.3%). The residual biodegradation in the presence of allylthiourea may be due to the activity of heterotrophs in the enriched nitrifier culture. The removal of the selected antibiotics under the studied redox conditions depended significantly on the bacteria composition of the sludge. These results suggest that despite the known persistence of this group of antibiotics it is possible to enhance their degradation using nitrifying conditions, which at adequate working conditions as high SRT, typical in MBR, become a promising alternative for improving quinolones removal from environment.

AB In this work, home-made Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were studied for passive sampling of 15 endocrine disrupting compounds (4 alkylphenols and steroid hormones) in influent and effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as up- and downstream of the receiving river water.
   POCIS calibration at laboratory conditions was carried out using a continuous-flow calibration system. The influence of the exposure position of the POCIS within the calibration device, horizontal or vertical, to the water flow direction was evaluated. While the sampling rates of most of the target substances were not affected by the sampler position, for cis-ADT, E1, E2 and E3, the vertical position provided the highest analyte accumulation. Hence, the POCIS samplers were preferably exposed vertical to the water flow in overall experiments. Using the continuous-flow calibration device, lab-based sampling rates were determined for all the target compounds (R-SBPA = 0.0326 L/d; R-ScisADT = 0.0800 L/d, R-SE1 = 0.0398 L/d, R-SEQ = 0.0516 L/d, R-STT = 0.0745 L/d, R-SE2 = 0.0585 L/d, R-SEE2 = 0.0406 L/d, R-SNT = 0.0846 L/d, R-SPG = 0.0478 L/d and R-SE3 = 0.1468 L/d), except for DES, MeEE2, 4t0P, 4OP, 4NP5, where the uptake after 14 days POCIS exposure was found to be insignificant or indicated a no linear behaviour. Recoveries from POCIS extractions were in the range between 71 and 152% for most of the target analytes except for DES and E3 with around 59%. Good precision of the sampling procedure up till 20% was observed and limits of detection were at ng/L level. Two deuterated compounds ([H-2(3)]-E2 and [H-2(4)]-EQ) were successfully tested as performance reference compounds (PRC, k(e[2H3]-E2) = 0.0507 L/d and k(e[2H4]-EQ) = 0.0543 L/d)).
   Finally, the POCIS samplers were tested for monitoring EDCs at two wastewater treatment plants, in Halle and Leipzig (Germany). BPA, E1, EQ, E2, MeEE2, NT, EE2, PG and E3 were quantified and their time-weighted average concentrations calculated on the basis of the lab-derived sampling rates were compared with the results based on conventional grab samples. While the influent concentration of BPA, cisADT, E1, TT, PG, EE2 reached the mu g/L level, the rest of the target analytes were determined at ng/L. The analyte concentrations in the effluent never exceed ng/L level except for BPA. The concentration determined by spot sampling was partially lower (BPA, E1, TT) or comparable (EQ. E2, EE2, PG, E3) to the concentration obtained by POCIS using performance reference compounds (PRC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCBI) is an important part of the multixeno-biotic resistance (MXR) defense system in aquatic organisms. The main goal of this study was identification of P-gp inhibitors in contaminated sediments using the effect directed analysis (EDA) approach. The samples were collected from the Gorjak creek (Zagreb, Croatia), a recipient of wastewater effluents from the pharmaceutical hidustry. Sediment samples were extracted and fractionated using a two-tiered approach. Resulting nonpolar, medium polar, and polar fractions were tested on the inhibition of P-gp activity using P-gp overexpressing PLHC-1/dox cells and calcein-AM as model substrate. The obtained ECM) values (up to 757 mu g/g, expressed in toxicity equivalents of model P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A) revealed high inhibitory potential of polar 1 fractions of investigated sediments and clearly reflected the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater. P-gp specific ATPase assay and the cytotoxicity modulation experiments with colchicine indicated that most of the observed P-gp inhibition was due to the presence of noncompetitive inhibitors. A detailed chemical analysis by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) revealed nonionic surfactants, including alcohol polyethoxylates (LAEOs) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs), as the major components of the most active subfractions. Testing of several LAEO and PPG commercial mixtures confirmed their potential to inhibit the fish P-glycoprotein and modulate toxicity of other xenobiotics present in complex environmental samples.
