AB Increased use of antidepressants has led to an increase in their detection in final treated wastewater effluents and receiving streams. Antidepressants are intended to modify human behavior by altering brain chemistry, and because of the high functional conservation of antidepressant target receptors in vertebrates, aquatic organisms may be at risk. The antidepressant bupropion is designed to alter brain norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in humans. The objective of the present study was to understand if alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilisxMorone chrysops) brain by bupropion would alter this predator's ability to capture prey. The authors exposed hybrid striped bass to bupropion in a static system for 6d, followed by a 6-d recovery period. During the present study's 12-d experiment, each hybrid striped bass was fed 4 unexposed fathead minnows every 3d, and the time it took the hybrid striped bass to consume each of those 4 fathead minnows was quantified. After each feeding event, hybrid striped bass brains were harvested and analyzed for changes in several brain neurotransmitter concentrations, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and many of their metabolites. Although bupropion altered the concentration of dopamine and many of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations in the brains on day 3 of the exposure, it did not alter the time to capture prey. This suggests that alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass brain does not alter a predator's ability to capture prey.

AB To quantify the extent of antibiotic contamination and to identity the dominant pollutant sources in the Tiaoxi RiverWatershed, surface water samples were collected at eight locations and analyzed for four tetracyclines and three sulfonamides using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The observed maximum concentrations of tetracycline (623 ng L-1), oxytetracycline (19,810 ng L-1), and sulfamethoxazole (112 ng L-1) exceeded their corresponding Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. In particular, high concentrations of antibiotics were observed in wet summer with heavy rainfall. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics appeared in the vicinity of intensive aquaculture areas. High-resolution land use data were used for identifying diffuse source of antibiotic pollution in the watershed. Significant correlations between tetracycline and developed (r = 0.93), tetracycline and barren (r = 0.87), oxytetracycline and barren (r = 0.82), and sulfadiazine and agricultural facilities (r = 0.71) were observed. In addition, the density of aquaculture significantly correlated with doxycycline (r = 0.74) and oxytetracycline (r = 0.76), while the density of livestock significantly correlated with sulfadiazine (r = 0.71). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole were from aquaculture and domestic sources, whereas sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine were from livestock wastewater. Flood or drainage from aquaculture ponds was identified as a major source of antibiotics in the Tiaoxi watershed. A hot-spot map was created based on results of land use analysis and multivariable statistics, which provided an effective management tool of sources identification in watersheds with multiple diffuse sources of antibiotic pollution.

AB The fate of three endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), namely 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), triclosan (TCS) and bisphenol A (BPA), was studied in activated sludge process. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) on their sorption and biodegradation was also investigated. Three continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used, operating at SRT of 3, 10 and 20 days, respectively. Batch experiments with biomass originated from the aforementioned systems showed that 4-n-NP and TCS are significantly sorbed on the suspended solids, while BPA to a lesser extent. The sorption affinity of target compounds did not seem to be affected by SRT, with the exception of 4-n-NP for which higher values of sorption coefficients were calculated at SRT of 3 days. The operation of continuous-flow systems in the presence of 10-40 mu g L-1 of EDCs indicated that more than 90%, 94% and 97% of BPA, TCS and 4-n-NP, respectively, can be removed during the activated sludge process in systems operating at SRT of 3-20 days. Determination of EDCs in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of their mass flux revealed that biodegradation was the principal removal mechanism of EDCs. For SRT values used in this study, this parameter does not seem to affect significantly percentage biodegradation of BPA. On the other hand, biodegradation of 4-n-NP and TCS was enhanced at SRT of 20 days. Calculation of biotransformation rates showed that the highest values for all EDCs were calculated at SRT of 3 days. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patancheru, near Hyderabad, India, is a major production site for the global bulk drug market. Approximately 90 manufacturers send their wastewater to a common treatment plant in Patancheru. Extraordinary high levels of a wide range of pharmaceuticals have recently been demonstrated in the treated effluent. As little as 0.2% of this effluent can strongly reduce the growth rate of tadpoles, but the underlying mechanisms of toxicity are not known. To begin addressing how the effluent affects aquatic vertebrates, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to 0.2% effluent for 5 d. Several physiological endpoints, together with effects on global hepatic gene expression patterns, were analyzed. The exposed fish showed both an induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) gene expression, as well as enzyme activity. Clinical blood chemistry analyses revealed an increase in plasma phosphate levels, which in humans indicates impaired kidney function. Several oxidative stress-related genes were induced in the livers; however, no significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities or in the hepatic glutathione levels were found. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes were slightly up-regulated following exposure, and moderate levels of estriol were detected in the effluent. The present study identifies changes in gene expression triggered by exposure to a high dilution of the effluent, supporting the hypothesis that these fish are responding to chemical exposure. The pattern of regulated genes may contribute to the identification of mechanisms of sublethal toxicity, as well as illuminate possible causative agents.

AB The ozonation of four pharmaceuticals (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) in ultra-pure (UP) water was studied in the pH range between 2.5 and 9. The experiments allowed the determination of the apparent rate constants for the reactions between ozone and the selected compounds. The values obtained varied depending on the pH, and ranged between 239 and 1.27 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) for metoprolol; 2.62 x 10(4) and 2.97 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) for naproxen; 2.31 x 10(3) and 1.21 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) for amoxicillin: and 215 and 1.57 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) for phenacetin. Due to the acidic nature of these substances, the degree of dissociation of each pharmaceutical was determined at every pH of work, and the specific rate constants of the neutral and ionic species formed were evaluated. Additionally, the simultaneous ozonation of the pharmaceuticals in different water matrices was carried out by considering a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and three secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants. The influence of the operating conditions (initial ozone dose, nature of pharmaceuticals and type of water) on the pharmaceuticals elimination efficiency was established, and a kinetic model was proposed for the evaluation of the partial contribution to the global oxidation of both, the direct ozonation reaction and the radical pathway.

AB The present investigation was on the assessment of the fate of 15 organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) under abiotic (predominantly adsorption) and biotic (predominantly bio-sorption/bio-degradation) conditions in columns packed with the aquifer material. The motivation behind this work was to predict the fate of the OMPs during subsurface flow/riverbank filtration (RBF). Columns were packed with aquifer material that was taken out from the laterals of a RBF well, M-15 during its cleaning operation. OMPs that were selected for the study were frequently detected in the river Yamuna, M-15 and other nearby RBF wells. The list included pharmaceuticals and their raw materials, endocrine disruptors, OMPs found in hospital wastes, steroid and personal care products structurally belonging to acrylates, neutral organics, amines, phenols and fatty acids. Among different OMPs, dimethyl maleate, benzoic acid, guanine and lomustine were found to be more mobile than estriol, decanoic acid, 1-tridecanol, 1- eicosanol, triclosan, stearic acid and cetyl alcohol. The mobility depended on the polarity of the OMPs. The retardation factor of non-polar OMPs was more than the polar ones. However, the mobility of the OMPs was considerably restricted in the biotic column. Retardation factors (R-d) for OMPs varied widely in adsorption column from 3 to 772. In biosorption column, R-d ranged from 6 to 1692 showing better removal except for benzophenone. Although, non-polar OMPs may take several years to travel to wells through the sandy aquifer, however, earlier occurrence of some of the polar OMPs cannot be ruled out. Additional treatment for OMPs is must before public distribution.

AB This study demonstrates a new system for the degradation of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants (e.g., ibuprofen) in water by coupling the naturally occurring ilmenite with hydroxylamine (HA) and persulfate (PS). Ilmenite was able to activate persulfate to generate sulfate radicals (SO4-center dot) and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot). The radical generation was greatly improved by adding small amount of hydroxylamine into the solution, due to the efficient Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle on the ilmenite surface promoted by HA, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy analysis. SO4-center dot and HO center dot contributed comparably to ibuprofen degradation, which was verified by the radical scavenging tests. The degradation was enhanced with increasing ilmenite, PS and HA dosages, but the HA exhibited strong scavenging effect at its high concentrations. The ilmenite/PS/HA process worked well in the real treated wastewater, because the surface-controlled radical generation was less affected by the water matrix. However, the formation of bromate in the bromide-containing water by this process should be concerned. Ibuprofen was partially mineralized, and the degradation products were identified by ESI-tqMS. A radical-induced degradation pathway was proposed based on the product identification. This work provides the mechanistic insights on persulfate activation based on the surface-controlled catalytic processes. It also offers a new strategy to degrade emerging contaminants in water and sheds light on the environmental functions of natural minerals.

AB There is increasing environmental concern about the constant presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water, generally attributed to water discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that are unable to completely remove these compounds. The slight, but continuous, presence of these contaminants in reclaimed water (RW) poses a risk of chronic and sublethal toxicity, and the thyroid axis can likely be a target of many of these PPCPs. In this work, we addressed the effects of RW on the Xenopus laevis thyroid system. The AmphibianMetamorphosis Assay (AMA test) was used with modifications by exposing X. laevis tadpoles to RW samples, and to RW spiked with carbamazepine (CBZ) at 100 and 1000 higher than the average levels environmentally relevant (RW 100x and RW 1000x, respectively). Carbamazepine was selected because it is considered a marker of anthropogenic pollution and could have a potential effect on the thyroid axis. The morphological endpoints and histological alterations to the thyroid gland were evaluated. The results suggested the stimulation of the thyroid gland from exposures to the RW samples, supported by tadpoles' accelerated development and by the histological alterations observed in the thyroid gland. Developmental acceleration was also seen in the tadpoles exposed to the RW-100x and -1000x samples at comparable levels to those seen in exposures to RW samples alone. Hence CBZ did not seem to increase the effects of RW on the thyroid axis. Overall, our results suggested endocrine effects of these RW samples regardless of the CBZ concentration.

AB BACKGROUND In this study, a naturally magnetic semiconductor mineral (NM-SCM) was used as a highly active, easily separable and green catalyst to activate persulfate (SPS) for the degradation of methylparaben (MeP) in aqueous solution by a heterogeneous catalyst system (SPS/NM-SCM). NM-SCM properties were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses. The effects of contributing factors such as solution pH, NM-SCM loading, SPS dosage and initial MeP concentration on MeP degradation were analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken design (BBD). RESULTS The RSM model obtained from the present study (R-2 > 0.99) showed a suitable correlation between the predicted values and experimental results of MeP degradation. Under optimized conditions (pH 6.5, SPS 5 mmol L-1, NM-SCM 0.3 g L-1 and MeP 10 mu mol L-1), a removal efficiency of 99.5% and a mineralization degree of 37% were achieved. The removal efficiency of MeP was reduced in the presence of inorganic ions as follows: chloride > nitrate > carbonate > phosphate. After five successive catalyst reuses, the degradation efficiency was >90%, indicating the excellent potential reusability of NM-SCM catalyst. CONCLUSION Owing to the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species (SO4 center dot-) and easy separation of the catalyst, the integration of NM-SCM and SPS has great potential for the degradation of MeP from water and wastewater matrices.

AB Although reverse osmosis produces high quality reusable water from wastewater the rejected concentrate (ROC) poses potentially serious health hazards to non-target species. This is especially the case when it is disposed into aquatic environments due to the presence of high concentrations of dissolved natural organics, micro-organic pollutants (MOPS) and other pollutants. In batch and column studies we found that granular activated carbon (GAC) was very effective in simultaneously removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 18 MOPs from ROC. The amounts of all DOC fractions adsorbed (0.01-3 mg/g) were much higher than those of the MOPs (0.01-2.5 mu g/g) mainly because ROC contained larger concentrations of DOC fractions than MOPs. However, the partition coefficient which is a measure of the adsorbability was higher for most of the MOPs (0.21-21.6 L/g) than for the DOC fractions (0.01-0.45 L/g). The amount of DOC fraction adsorbed was in the order: humics > low molecular weights > building blocks > biopolymers (following mostly their concentrations in ROC). The partition coefficient was in the order: low molecular weigth nuetrals > humics > building blocks > biopolymers. The MOPs were classified into four groups based on their hydrophobicity (log Kow) and charge. The four positively charged MOPs with high hydrophobicity had the highest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient, with 95-100% removal in the GAC column. The MOPs that are negatively charged, regardless of their hydrophobicity, had the lowest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient with 73-94% removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contamination of agricultural soils by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) resulting from the application of treated wastewater, biosolids and animal wastes constitutes a potential environmental risk in many countries. To date a handful of studies have considered the phytotoxicity of individual PPCPs in crop plants, however, little is known about the effect of PPCPs as mixtures at environmentally relevant levels. This study investigated the uptake and transport, physiological responses and detoxification of a mixture of 17 PPCPs in cucumber seedlings. All PPCPs were detected at higher concentrations in roots compared to leaves, with root activity inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At 5-50 mu g/L, the mature leaves exhibited burnt edges as well as a reduction in photosynthesis pigments. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation increased with increasing PPCP concentrations; and their contents were greater in roots than in leaves for all PPCP treatments. Enzymes involved in various functions, including oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) and xenobiotic metabolism (peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase), were elevated to different levels depending on the PPCP concentration. Glutathione content gradually increased in leaves, while a maxima occurred at 0.5 mu g L-1 PPCPs in roots, followed by a decrease thereafter. This study illustrated the complexity of phytotoxicity after exposure to PPCP mixtures, and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms likely responsible for the detoxification of PPCPs in higher plants.

AB We developed a protocol to quantify 12 emerging contaminants (ECs) (pharmaceuticals and hormones) and pesticides extracted from suspended particulate matter (SPM) of river water and municipal wastewaters samples as well as river sediments. The separation of suspended solids was realized using filtration of water samples. We tested a series of six different filter types. The effect of filtration on the concentrations of dissolved contaminants was evaluated to minimize losses of target compounds. The river sediment samples were lyophilized, and both SPM and sediment samples were subjected to ultrasonic extraction combined with C18 cartridge clean-up. Quantifications were realized using mass spectrometry. The method recoveries of all compounds ranged from 38 to 112 % in all studied matrices; poorer recoveries were achieved for sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac (as low as 38 %), whereas the recoveries for all other compounds in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples were between 68 and 111 %. The detection limits in sediments and SPM from river samples for the 12 analytes varied from 0.7 to 9.4 ng g(-1) and from 21 to 92 ng g(-1) for WWTP SPM samples. All targeted ECs were detected with concentrations ranging from 3 to 5,440 ng g(-1) in the studied matrices with the highest concentrations observed in WWTP SPM samples. A significant portion of the contaminants in a water sample is clearly associated with the suspended particulates. Optimization of water-treatment processes and environmental fate must absolutely consider the fraction of contaminants that is particulate-bound if one hopes to have a reasonable mass balance.

AB One by-product of advances in modern chemistry is the accumulation of synthetic chemicals in the natural environment. These compounds include contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), some of which are endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) that can have detrimental reproductive effects. The role of sediments in accumulating these types of chemicals and acting as a source of exposure for aquatic organisms is not well understood. Here we present a small-scale reconnaissance of CECs in bed sediments of the lower Columbia River and several tributaries and urban streams. Surficial bed sediment samples were collected from the Columbia River, the Willamette River, the Tualatin River, and several small urban creeks in Oregon. Thirty-nine compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from <1 to >1,000ng [g sediment](-1) dry weight basis. Concentrations and frequencies of detection were higher in tributaries and small urban creeks than in the Columbia River mainstem, suggesting a higher risk of exposure to aquatic life in lower order streams. Ten known or suspected EDCs were detected during the study. At least one EDC was detected at 21 of 23 sites sampled; several EDCs were detected in sediment from most sites. This study is the first to document the occurrence of a large suite of CECs in the sediments of the Columbia River basin. A better understanding of the role of sediment in the fate and effects of emerging contaminants is needed.

AB Compounds from the group of cationic surfactants are widely applied in household, industrial, cleaning, disinfectant, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products as their specific properties (antimicrobial, emulsifying, anticorrosion, softening). After use, cationic surfactants are disposed to wastewater-treatment plants and finally with effluent water to surface waters due to their incomplete degradation. Moreover, they can freely circulate in different environmental compartments including living organisms. It becomes indispensable to recognize in more detail behavior, fate and biological effects of cationic surfactants. This analytical problem can be solved with use sensitive and reliable analytical techniques at sample preparation step and final determination step. In recent years, during isolation analytes from environmental samples mainly were used liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) - liquid matrices or solid-liquid extraction (SLE) - solid matrices. This technique involves application of toxic solvents (chloroform), is time-consuming and interferences are co-extracted. Nowadays, in scientific centers are carried out research to replace this traditional technique. So far, the following techniques were applied: solid-phase extraction (SPE) or it modification (HF-LPME) - liquid samples; accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) - solid samples. During the determination of total content of cationic surface active agents in environmental samples were used a traditional spectrophotometry technique and potentiometric titration technique. But those techniques are susceptible of interferences on analysis results (anionic and non-ionic compounds). The chromatographic technique (liquid chromatography) applied at the final determination step gives possibility to determine individual cationic surfactants in solvent extracts of environmental samples. The LC systems coupled with mass spectrometers are most powerful tools during such analysis.

AB Data are presented on the concentrations of alkylphenol and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) and persistent organic compounds in largemouth bass collected from a waste-water dominated stream in downtown Chicago. The fish residue concentrations of APES are compared to concentrations of the APEs in the water that were collected at weekly intervals over two months bracketing the fall (2006) and a spring (2007) fish collection. The concentrations of APEs were significantly higher in the spring-collected fish (5.42 mu g/g) versus the fall (0.99 mu g/g) tand these differences were shared by differences in the water concentrations (spring - 11.47 versus fall - 3.44 mu g/L). The differences in water concentration were negatively correlated with water temperatures observed over the two sampling times. Fish residue concentrations of persistent organic compounds (PCBs, PBDEs, toxaphene, and many legacy pesticides including the DDT family) did not vary from fall to spring. Some of these residue concentrations were comparable to the highest NPE (nonylphenol ethoxylate) homologue concentrations, e.g. NP1EO was 3.5 mu g/g in the bass for the spring, the PBDE-congener 47 and p,p'-DDE averaged 1.0 mu g/g and 0.5 mu g/g, respectively, over both seasons. All the other persistent single-analyte concentrations were lower. Biological endpoints for endocrine effects measured in the same fish showed that there was an apparent positive correlation for physiological effects based on increased vitellogenin levels in males versus concentration of NPEs; however there were no observable histological differences in fall versus spring fish samples.

AB Three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated in parallel to study the effects of trace erythromycin (ERY) and ERY-H2O on the treatment of a synthetic wastewater. Through monitoring (1) daily effluents and (2) concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in certain batch cycles of the three reactors operated from transient to steady states, the removal of carbon, N, and P was affected negligibly by ERY (100 A mu g/L) or ERY-H2O (50 A mu g/L) when compared with the control reactor. However, through analyzing microbial communities of the three steady state SBRs on high-density microarrays (PhyloChip), ERY, and ERY-H2O had pronounced effects on the community composition of bacteria related to N and P removal, leading to diversity loss and abundance change. The above observations indicated that resistant bacteria were selected upon exposure to ERY or ERY-H2O. Short-term batch experiments further proved the resistance and demonstrated that ammonium oxidation (56-95%) was inhibited more significantly than nitrite oxidation (18-61%) in the presence of ERY (100, 400, or 800 A mu g/L). Therefore, the presence of ERY or ERY-H2O (at A mu g/L levels) shifted the microbial community and selected resistant bacteria, which may account for the negligible influence of the antibiotic ERY or its derivative ERY-H2O (at A mu g/L levels) on carbon, N, and P removal in the SBRs.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their degradation products which are present in wastewater and superficial waters are becoming an ecological issue. This research investigated the degradation and mineralization of synthetic solutions of the pharmaceutical compound sildenafil citrate (SC) by single ozonation and ozonation jointed with UV radiation (O-3/UV). The effects of initial drug concentration (50-125 mg L-1), inlet ozone concentration (35-125 g Nm(-3)), and UV radiation on SC degradation and decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated using response surface methodology based on a central composite experimental design. Through the RSM analysis, it was possible to confirm the removal of SC for the entire experimental range. Major intermediates of SC degradation were identified and a degradation pathway was proposed. The kinetics of SC degradation was modeled as a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant ranging between 0.072 and 1.250 min(-1). The SC degradation and TOC removal were strongly enhanced by increasing the concentration of gaseous ozone at the inlet and incorporating UV radiation. The highest TOC removal reached at 60 min was 75%, in the O-3/UV system, with initial SC content of 50 mg L-1 and inlet ozone concentration of 125 g Nm(-3). The degradation rate of SC was increased 3 to 9 times in the presence of UV radiation. Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes appear as a suitable alternative for treatment of the emerging pollutant SC.

AB Many studies have been conducted on the evaluation and monitoring of micropollutants and by-products in wastewater treatment plants. Considering the increase in the production and consumption of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, personal care products, and plasticisers, it is necessary to conduct studies that support the elaboration of laws and regulations that promote the environmentally sustainable use of sludge and effluents. In this work, the biological degradation of amoxicillin was studied under two anaerobic conditions: i) using a 6 L reactor operated under semi-continuous flow; and ii) a batch system with 100 mL sealed glass syringes. According to the statistical analysis, amoxicillin was completely removed from the systems, but biogas production inhibition was observed (p < 0.05). Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis identified amoxicillin penicilloic acid, amoxilloic acid, amoxicillin diketopiperazine and phenol hydroxypyrazine as by-products under anaerobic conditions. Ecotoxicity tests on effluent treated under the batch conditions showed that the addition of higher amounts of amoxicillin inhibited the target species Aliivibrio fischeri and Raphidocelis subcaptata, causing functional decreases of 28.5% and 22.2% when the antibiotic concentration was 2500 mu g L-1. A. fischeri was the most sensitive organism to effluent treated under semi-continuous flow conditions; a continuous reduction in bioluminescence of up to 88.8% was observed after 39 days of feeding, which was associated with by-products accumulation due to unbalanced conditions during anaerobic digestion. Changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the effluent caused the accumulation and removal of AMX-DKP IV and modified the toxicity to Lactuca saliva and R. subcapitata.

AB A novel magnetic nanosphere/nanorod/nanosheet-like photocatalyst Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr was fabricated via a facile one-pot solvothermal method firstly and exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for diclofenac (DCF) and ibuprofen (IBU) removal, where the removal efficiencies of DCF and IBU were 93.81% and 96.78% after 40 min and 30 min visible LED light irradiation, respectively. The best preparation ratios with Bi2S3 mass were 4% and 1% for DCF and IBU removal respectively, which might be attributed to better crystallinities of (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets respectively. Besides, enhanced charge separation and better crystallinity with introduction of Fe3O4 and Bi2S3 promoted higher photocatalytic performance of Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr compared with pure BiOBr, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/BiOBr. Influencing factors experiments (pH, common anions, DOM) results showed beneficial or detrimental effects to a certain extent. While removal efficiencies in matrices of Yellow River (DCF: 55.65%; IBU: 54.90%) and Wastewater treatment plant (DCF: 68.66%; IBU: 58.90%) exhibited lower than those in ultrapure water. Moreover, h+ and e-played the uppermost roles in the DCF and IBU photodegradation according to active species trapping experiment results. Furthermore, four and two main degradation pathways for DCF and IBU removal respectively through 3D EEMs and HRMS analyses were proposed. Lastly, easy separation from water and excellent reusability proved its better potential for emerging pollutants removal in environment remediation area.

AB In recent years, application of biochar for removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions has been of interest due to favorable physicochemical properties and availability of feedstock. However, adsorption behavior has been reported only for raw and micro biochar particles and taking advantage of biochar nanoparticles, which offer superior specific surface area, did not receive any attention. The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption efficiency of produced nanobiochar from pinewood. For this purpose, removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), a globally prescribed pharmaceutical, at very low concentrations (0.5-20 ppb) on as-produced nanobiochar with average particle size of 60 nm was studied. The results showed that nanobiochar can remove up to 95% of CBZ (74 mu g CBZ/g nanobiochar) after 3 h contact time. Adsorption of CBZ on nanobiochar followed Freundlich isotherm model (R-2 = 0.9822) and pseudo-second order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.9994). It was found that increasing pH from 3 to 8 can enhance the adsorption efficiency by 2.3 folds. Also, due to the presence of surfactant in wastewater, the addition of Tween 80 as a model surfactant was studied in the range of 0 to 1 (Tween 80 to CBZ molar ratio) and the results showed that adsorption efficiency can be enhanced by 57%. Thus, the nanobiochar obtained from pinewood residues can be a promising sorbent for micropollutants. (C) 2017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/ oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90 min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/ H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC-MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process. Four byproducts(benzene-1-ethenyl-4-(2-methypropyl), benzene 1-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-isobutyl, 4'-(2-methylpropyl)acetophenone, ibuprofen methyl ester) were detected after UV-LED catalytic degradation of IBP solution. The present study showed that the UV-LED/catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of IBP in comparison to direct photolysis by UV-LED.

AB Chlorpheniramine is a pharmaceutical pollutant and a precursor of carcinogenic nitrosamines during disinfection/oxidation. In our previous study, graphene oxide coated with magnetite (GO-Fe3O4) was capable of removing chlorpheniramine in deionized water by adsorption. This study investigated the removal of chlorpheniramine and its nitrosamine formation potentials (FPs) by adsorption onto magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influence by using real municipal wastewaters as the background. In the results, the adsorption performances of chlorpheniramine in wastewaters decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 suspension>GO-Fe3O4 particles>activated carbon. Chlorpheniramine adsorptions on GO-Fe3O4 particles and activated carbon were reduced by using real wastewaters as the background, whereas chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 suspension was enhanced due to the effects of surface charge on GO-Fe3O4 and ionic strength variation in water. The fittings of adsorption isotherms indicated that the wastewater background reduced the surface heterogeneity of GO-Fe3O4 suspension and improved the adsorption performance. Appreciable removal efficiencies of NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs were observed when GO-Fe3O4 particles were added in real wastewaters. However, when chlorpheniramine was present in wastewaters, chlorpheniramine adsorption and degradation reaction simultaneously occurred on the surface of GO-Fe3O4, increasing NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs in wastewaters after GO-Fe3O4 addition for chlorpheniramine adsorption. The assumption was further demonstrated by observing the NDMA-FP increase during chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 in deionized water. GO-Fe3O4 is a potential adsorbent for chlorpheniramine removal. Nevertheless, the low treatment efficiencies at high doses limit its application for nitrosamine FP adsorptions in real wastewaters.

AB Many pharmaceuticals inevitably end up in surface waters, exerting unwanted biological activity in nontarget organisms. This effect is confined by the compound's environmental persistence. Regulatory laboratory simulation tests are used in persistence assessment and exposure modeling. While doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of laboratory-derived persistence indicators under field conditions, these remain the only inputs for chemical fate models due to difficulties of measuring persistence in situ, especially at large scales. To improve understanding about relationships between laboratory experiments and the environmental fate in streams, we developed a mathematical model of biodegradation in stream networks and combined it with in-stream monitoring data to (i) test if persistence could be evaluated from field data, (ii) check if persistence extracted from laboratory tests applied in the field, and (iii) locate hot spots of biodegradation in a large river basin. The model describes partitioning, and particle settling and resuspension, and is structurally compatible with those applied for evaluating laboratory simulation tests. Application to the Rhine river basin suggests that biotransformation rate constants extracted from laboratory tests underestimate those in the field, yet the percentage of biotransformation in the Rhine basin is less than in the laboratory tests due effective biotransformation being limited to small- and medium-sized streams. In conclusion, our data show that biotransformation rates can accurately be predicted if (i) monitoring is performed across a wide range in stream order and (ii) precise estimates for consumption and removal rates at wastewater treatment plants are known.

AB This study evaluated the ability of cork to adsorb a broad range of phenolic, pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds: phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol carbamazepine, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, triclosan, and methyl paraben. The effect of variables such as the compound concentrations and the amount of cork were studied resulting in a highly pH dependence in the case of phenolic compounds. Maximum removal percentages and uptake values of 75% (1.61 mg/g) for 2,4-dichlorophenol, 55% (1.25 mg/g) for 2-nitrophenol, 45% (1.47 mg/g) for 2-chlorophenol, 20% (0.63 mg/g) for phenol, and 100% for pentachlorophenol, were obtained for a 30 mg L-1 solution at pH 6, showing that the adsorption process increased with greater electronegativity of the phenolic substituting group. Removal percentages and uptakes of 82% (3.56 mg/g) for naproxen, 57% (2.31 mg/g) for ketoprofen, 50% (1.84 mg/g) for carbamazepine, 50% (1.78 mg/g) for methyl paraben, 100% for sodium diclofenac, and 100% for triclosan, were obtained using 5 mg of cork and a 1 mg L-1 solution of each compound. The adsorption process was almost complete after 30 min for all the micropollutants. Experimental equilibrium data were analysed by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models. Cork has proved to be an effective sorbent for the removal of phenols and emerging contaminants from contaminated waters and is a readily available material that can be acquired at minimal or no cost in cork-producing areas.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is an alternative advanced treatment for wastewater reclamation, and it has the potential to control micropollutants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, the relationship of operating conditions in SAT and removals of micropollutants was not clear. In this study, the effects of operating conditions on the removals of PPCPs were evaluated by using lab-scale columns and plant pilot-scale reactors under different operating conditions. Firstly, weathered granite soil (WGS), standard sand (SAND) and Toyoura standard sand (TS) have different soil characteristics such as total organic carbon (TOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). In the columns with these packing materials, the removals of carboxylic analgesics and antilipidemics were effective regardless packing materials. The removals of antibiotics were more effective inWGS than in TS and SAND, indicating high TOC and CEC enhance the sorption in SAT. Secondly, with the extension of hydraulic retention time (HRT), the removals of sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, crotamiton, and antipyrine were improved inWGS columns, and adaptable biodegradation for moderately removable PPCPs was formed. Thirdly, the removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole and crotamiton were higher in the WGS column under vadose condition than in the WGS column under saturated condition, because of aerobic condition in WGS column under vadose condition. Though long HRT and vadose condition had positive influence on the removals of several PPCPs such as sulfamethoxazole, WGS column with an HRT of 7 days under saturated condition removed most PPCPs.

AB The very large number of emerging contaminants entering the water supply makes it desirable to assess these chemicals' environmental fate and behavior without direct measurements. Structure-property prediction models are promising in this regard, and quantitative molecular similarity assessment (QMSA) is one particularly appealing option. This study has two objectives related to QMSA modeling of emerging contaminants: (1) demonstrating that QMSA models can be used to accurately predict an environmental engineering parameter of interest, e.g., in vitro estrogenicity measurements, for highly diverse chemical classes; and (2) assessing the extent to which QMSA approaches can be used to prioritize among unmeasured chemicals and determine which additional measurements will result in maximally increased model accuracy. The results of this study are promising in both regards. QMSA models were found to predict the test parameter, estrogenicity, with cross validation coefficients (q(2)) as high as 0.84. Results of a paired t-test to evaluate the difference in increased model accuracy associated with QMSA-selection versus random-selection of additional compounds yielded statistically significant P-values < 0.0001. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that QMSA could dramatically reduce the number of laboratory and field measurements required to characterize as-yet unknown environmental fate and behavior parameters for diverse emerging contaminants of regulatory interest. Additional preliminary work points to the promise of QMSA for prediction of fundamental adsorption parameters; e.g., distribution coefficient (K-d) for selected pharmaceuticals onto activated sludge during municipal wastewater treatment.

Currently, TNG is considered as a key environmental contaminant due to the discharge of wastewater tainted with the chemical from various military and pharmaceutical industries. The present study describes the use of a nanostructured silica material (Mobil Composite Material no. 48 [MCM-48]) prepared by mixing tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to remove TNG from water. The sorption of TNG onto MCM-48 rapidly reached equilibrium within I It. Sorption kinetics were best described using a pseudo-second order model, whereas sorption isotherms were best interpreted using the Langmuir model. The latter gave a maximum sorption capacity of 55.2 mg g(-1) at 40 degrees C. The enthalpy and entropy of TNG sorption onto MCM-48 were 1.89 kJ mol(-1) and 79.0 J mol(-1). K-1, indicating the endothermic nature of the TNG sorption onto MCM-48. When MCM-48 was heated at 540 degrees C for 5 It, the resulting calcined material (absence of the surfactant) did not sorb TNG, suggesting that the surfactant component of the nanomaterial was responsible for TNG sorption. Finally, we found that MCM-48 lost approximately 30% of its original sorption capacity after five sorption-desorption cycles. In conclusion, the nanostructured silica based sorbent, with high sorption capacity and remarkable reusability, should constitute the basis for the development of an effective technology for the removal of TNG from contaminated water.

AB Valsartan acid (VALA) is a persistent and mobile pollutant, ubiquitously distributed in the aquatic environment. Herein, we assessed the efficiency of UV/free chlorine for the removal of this pollutant. Degradation experiments were performed using different water samples, considering several pH values and concentrations of inorganic anions. Time-course of VALA was measured by injection of different reaction time aliquots in a liquid chromatography (LC) triple quadrupole (QqQ) mass spectrometry (MS) system, whilst the study of potential transformation products (TPs) was evaluated by LC combined with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS system. Formation of volatile disinfection by-products (DBPs) was investigated by gas chromatography (GC) with TOF-MS detection. Compared to free chlorine treatment and UV photolysis, the combination of both parameters significantly enhanced the degradability of VALA. At neutral pH, UV/free chlorine was also more effective than UV/H2O2 to remove VALA from spiked water solutions. Three TPs of VALA were tentatively identified by LC-QTOF-MS, although only one was stable in the UV/free chlorine media. As regards volatile DBPs, the formation of chloroform, dichloroacetonitrile, di- and trichloroacetic acid was noticed. The mass yield of DBPs formation from VALA varied from0.3% (dichloroacetonitrile) to 1.1% (chloroform). The efficiency of UV/free chlorine was first investigated in spiked solutions with increasing complexities: ultrapure, river and treated wastewater. Thereafter, the feasibility of reducing VALA levels in polluted river water was demonstrated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The prevalence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in lotic habitats is increasing, with the main source of these contaminants being effluent from waste water treatment works (WwTW). There is still much uncertainty about the impacts of these PPCPs at environmentally relevant concentrations and their potential effects on aquatic ecology. Behaviour is a sensitive endpoint which can help evaluate possible population level effects from changes in physiology. This paper evaluates the effects of WwTW effluent on a range of behaviours in the freshwater invertebrate, Gammarus pulex. Effluent taken from the outflow of two WwTW in southern England was used in the study. Behavioural analyses, namely feeding rate, phototaxis, activity, velocity and precopula pairing, were measured in G. pulex following a period of one and three weeks after exposure to a 50% or 100% effluent and a control. Mortality remained very low throughout the 3 week experiment (0-10%, n = 20) and no significant changes in moulting frequency were observed (p > 0.05). No significant effects on feeding or velocity or phototaxis following 3 weeks of effluent exposures were observed (p > 0.05). However, significant reductions were observed in the overall activity over 3 weeks across which appeared to be exacerbated by exposure to effluents. Interestingly, males exposed for 3 weeks to WwTW effluent re-paired with unexposed females significantly faster (4-6x) than control animals. This result was consistent between the effluents taken from the two WwTW. The implications of these behavioural changes are currently unknown but highlight the need for a varied set of tools to study the behavioural changes in wildlife. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A microwave-assisted hydrothermal preparation of heterostructured graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (denoted as GBR-T, T = microwave irradiation time) is performed. The prepared GBR-T photocatalysts are identified by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The photocatalytic performance of these GBR-T is evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) under the visible light (lambda > 420 nm) and solar light irradiation. Among all prepared photocatalysts, ca. 93% of IBP photodegradation can be achieved with a degradation rate constant (k) of 0.011 min(-1) under visible-light irradiation upon the optimal microwave-assisted reaction time of 60 min. The improvement is primarily attributable to the higher crystallization degree, specific surface area and increased charge transfer efficiency as verified by XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and TRPL, respectively. The photocatalytic performance of this catalyst is further enhanced in the photodecomposition of IBP (ca. 98.6%) under sun light irradiation. The electron spin resonance (ESR) and liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) studies show that the superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals are the dominant active species in the photocomposition of IBP and degradation intermediates are formed through three probable photodegradation pathways. This investigation provides a simple way to prepare triple 2D heterojuction photocatalysts which could be effectively used in the advanced oxidation process for removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater by using renewable energy.

AB The degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by a synthesized ZnO catalyst and under UVA irradiation was examined. ZnO nanostructures were developed by a facile hydrothermal-assisted method. The effect of ZnO heating time and synthesis reaction, pH, catalyst loading, and SMX initial concentration on process efficiency was studied. Water matrices, such as humic acid (HA) solution and surface water (SW), were also used to resemble real environmental water samples. It was observed that when ZnO is synthesized at pH 7.5, nanorods grow on its surface, while nanoplatelets are formed when synthesis takes place at pH 12.5. SMX removal reached 84% after 60 min of treatment in the presence of 200 mg/L ZnO catalyst (8 h-heated at pH 7.5; C-0 = 10 mg/L). The pseudo-first-order kinetic constants of SMX photodegradation were calculated at 0.039, 0.030 and 0.016 min(-1) for 5, 10, and 20 mg/L SMX, respectively. This decreased efficiency was attributed to the excessive coverage of catalyst surface by SMX molecules, evidenced by SEM micrographs produced after treatment. SMX degradation in SW (12.5%) was considerably lower than in UPW (47.4%) due to the presence of natural organic matter in the first. Interestingly, SMX removal was greatly enhanced in HA matrix (99%) and this can be attributed to the ability of HA to sensitize colloidal ZnO. In all cases, morphological changes of ZnO nanostructures were observed after photocatalytic treatment. It was confirmed that SMX degradation takes place through HO center dot by adding HO center dot quenchers, such as tert-butyl alcohol and methanol, in the reactant mixture.

AB This work presents, a detailed investigation for photocatalytic degradation of the drug furosemide (FRS) using zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on ion-exchanged natural zeolite clinoptilolite (ICLT). The ZnO/ICLT nanophotocatalysts were effectively synthesized by sonoprecipitation method which enhanced the photocatalytic performance by increasing the surface area and decreasing the particle size, compared to conventional precipitated samples. Microstructure and optical properties of prepared catalysts were characterized using XRD, XRF, FESEM, surface particle size distribution, TEM, EDX, BET, BJH, DRS and UV-visible spectroscopy techniques. XRD data confirmed the formation of ZnO. FESEM images revealed small particle size of active metals and low numbers of agglomerations which is in accordance with EDX dot mapping results. The average particle size of ZnO in ZnO (15%)/ICLT whit sonication was 20.5 nm whereas it was 34.8 nm without sonication. Moreover, the literature review indicated that ultrasound irradiation during the precipitation of samples has not been studied yet which highlight the importance of evaluating this nanophotocatalyst for wastewater treatment applications. The maximum degradation rate was observed for 15 wt% ZnO among various contents of ZnO used in synthesized nanocomposites. The influence of key operational parameters such as catalyst dosage, initial FRS concentration and pH on the photocatalytic degradation was assessed. Total organic carbon mineralization rate of FRS solution and energy consumption were also assessed to compare the ability of different processes in FRS degradation. Results showed also excellent reusability of fabricated nanophotocatalyst. Finally a plausible degradation mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of FRS was proposed.

AB The presence of the antibiotics in wastewater and drinking water is of growing concern worldwide, thereby an advanced sustainable technology needs to be developed to decontaminate the antibiotics from water resources. Herein, a series of novel boron nitrile/cadmium aluminate (BN/CdAl2O4) composites photocatalysts were synthesized by using hydrothermal methodology. Thus synthesized BN/CdAl2O4 composites were tested for the photocatalytic degradation of cefoxitin sodium (CFT) antibiotic in aqueous solution. The spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the morphology, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and optical properties of the composites changes as the amount of the BN varies in BN/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite. The resulting BN/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite with a fraction of 0.2 g BN showed most efficient photocatalytic properties than the pure BN, CdAl2O4 and other BN/CdAl2O4 composites owing to its better light-harvesting properties, higher surface area, and better charge separation properties. The results revealed that the solution pH, irradiation times, and initial CFT concentration in solution controls the photocatalytic process and almost 100% CFT degradation was observed at 15 mg/L concentration within 240 min at pH 7. The results of free radicals scavenging experiments demonstrated that both positive hole and (OH)-O-center dot free radical play dominant roles in CFT degradation. The kinetic modeling of CFT photocatalysis process showed better fitting with the first-order kinetic model as compared to the zero-order and second-order kinetic models. This study revealed that BN-0.2/CdAl(2)O(4 )composite has better CFT degradation efficiency and excellent recyclability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, degradation of a pharmaceutical drug, Phenazone (PNZ) has been carried out via heterogeneous photocatalysis, photo-Fenton and in-situ dual process (photocatalysis + photo-Fenton) in suspension and fixed-mode under artificial UV-A as well as under natural solar radiations. Waste material such as foundry sand (FS) was exploited as a supplement for iron in case of photo-Fenton reaction. The distinct processes including photocatalysis and photo-Fenton were found to be competent for the degradation of PNZ as both processes revealed an almost 90-95% removal of PNZ after 180 min of UV irradiations. The degradation was improved to a great extent with remarkable reduction in treatment time of PNZ to almost 105 min when these two individual processes were combined together within the same unit. An almost 14% synergy of dual process over distinct processes was obtained. For fixed-bed studies, TiO2 immobilized hollow circular composite disc already containing FS was utilized which yielded an almost 96% reduction in the concentration of PNZ after 4 h of solar irradiations. The disc was recycled 10 times and its stability and activity was confirmed through XRD, SEM/EDS, and DRS. The mineralization of PNZ was confirmed through significant reduction in COD and generation of anions during the treatment process. The transformation products were examined through GC-MS analysis. The novel technique of in-situ dual process especially in fixed-mode visualized in this study by employing renewable energy and durable catalyst can represent a viable solution to various industries for the treatment of wastewater comprising of bio-recalcitrant pollutants.

AB The combination of adsorption and photocatalytic processes (adsorption/photocatalysis) was studied in the removal of the psychoactive substance caffeine from aqueous solutions at initial pollutant concentration in the range 6-25 mg/L. For this purpose, photoactive ZnO semiconductor was supported on commercial zeolite pellets (ZnO/ZEO) using wet impregnation method. From an engineering point of view, the use of pellets in a packed bed reactor permits to overcome the limitation of slurry systems that need the expensive post-treatment steps for the separation of particles from treated wastewater.
   X-ray diffraction, UV Vis reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements at -196 degrees C were performed to analyze the characteristics of the samples. In particular, it was found that ZnO nanoparticles are in wurtzite phase and incorporated in the mesoporous structure of the zeolite pellets. The final ZnO loading in ZnO/ZEO composites was found to be 6.1 wt%. The comparison between the adsorption and adsorption/photocalytic tests performed with ZnO/ZEO pellets showed that in dark conditions, the caffeine removal was 60% after 120 min of run time, while, in presence of UV light, the almost total removal of caffeine was achieved after the same treatment time. Moreover, also after several reuse cycles of adsorption/photocalytic tests, the removal rate of caffeine did not change, meaning that the photocatalytic oxidation process is able to degrade the caffeine adsorbed on ZnO/ZEO pellets surfaces resulting in the recovery of the adsorption capacity.

AB Locally weighted partial least square (LW-PLS) model has been commonly used to develop adaptive soft sensors and process monitoring for numerous industries which include pharmaceutical, petrochemical, semiconductor, wastewater treatment system and biochemical. The advantages of LW-PLS model are its ability to deal with a large number of input variables, collinearity among the variables and outliers. Nevertheless, since most industrial processes are highly nonlinear, a traditional LW-PLS which is based on a linear model becomes incapable of handling nonlinear processes. Hence, an improved LW-PLS model is required to enhance the adaptive soft sensors in dealing with data nonlinearity. In this work, Kernel function which has nonlinear features was incorporated into LW-PLS model and this proposed model is named locally weighted kernel partial least square (LW-KPLS). Comparisons between LW-PLS and LW-KPLS models in terms of predictive performance and their computational loads were carried out by evaluating both models using data generated from a simulated plant. From the results, it is apparent that in terms of predictive performance LW-KPLS is superior compared to LW-PLS. However, it is found that computational load of LW-KPLS is higher than LW-PLS. After adapting ensemble method with LW-KPLS, computational loads of both models were found to be comparable. These indicate that LW-KPLS performs better than LW-PLS in nonlinear process applications. In addition, evaluation on localization parameter in both LW-PLS and LW-KPLS is also carried out.

AB This study reports a new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective recognition to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) by a non-covalent imprinting process. ASA being part of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is also known as aspirin. Due to human excretion of the drug and its metabolites, persistent environmental contamination of ASA occurs. This requires highly efficient sorbents which permit the isolation of such pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In this regard, we synthesized a MIP by a simple thermal bulk polymerization method using acrylamide (AA) as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the crosslinker. In order to determine the binding capacity of the new polymer several adsorption studies using different solvents were performed. Fitting of the data points with a Langmuir isotherm revealed a maximum adsorption capacity of 328.6 mg g(-1) polymer in water at pH 3. It was observed that the present MIP allowed the simultaneous isolation of ASA and salicylic acid (SA), its major metabolite. This is a main advantage as both, ASA and SA can be isolated in a single extraction step. In a further experiment, the adsorption performance of the imprinted polymer was evaluated and compared to the non-imprinted polymer (NIP) and provided higher capacity values for the MIP. To check the ability of reusability, the polymer was loaded with standard solutions for several times and the percentage of removal was calculated after each treatment. Finally, the applicability of the polymer for the isolation of ASA was investigated for river water as a more complex sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is known to be effective for chemical oxidation and disinfection of water and wastewater. Recently, light emitting diode (LED) has been recognized as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable source of UV to replace conventional mercury lamps, so-called UV-LED. Less is known about the effectiveness of UV-LEDs, i.e., UVA, UVB, and UVC in comparison, for the decomposition of recalcitrant organic chemicals. In this study, direct photolytic decomposition and TiO2 photocatalytic decomposition of model pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen (ACT), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), was tested, and the effects of different UV-LED wavelengths on their decomposition were investigated. UV wavelength was found to be a more important parameter for the decomposition than light intensity. Shorter wavelength UV in order of UVC > UVB > UVA was more effective for the decomposition of the pharmaceuticals. Photocatalytic decomposition was much more significant than photolytic decomposition. Decomposition kinetics of the pharmaceuticals followed SMX > DCF > IBP > ACT, reflecting their molecular structures. Results on the mineralization of the pharmaceuticals also supported the observed trends for their disappearance. The investigation was resumed with microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a known lethal biological toxin often found in water resource, and the similar result to the pharmaceuticals was also observed for MC-LR. This study and the consequent results would facilitate applications of UV-LEDs for the treatment of water contaminated with recalcitrant toxic chemicals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antineoplastic drugs are important in the treatment of cancer. Some interact directly with the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are of utmost importance in terms of risk. As highly active compounds, antineoplastics and their metabolites are largely excreted into wastewater and are found in the aquatic environment up to the lower mu g/L range. Their predicted environmental concentrations are often below the action limit set in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline. An in-depth risk assessment regarding their presence and effects in the aquatic environment is often not performed, and there is a lack of knowledge. This study considered whether there is an underestimation of possible risks associated with the presence of antineoplastic drugs with regard to trigger value stated in the EMA and FDA guidelines. In a balance, we identified a total of 102 active pharmaceutical ingredients of the ATC-group L01 (antineoplastic agents), which are environmentally relevant. In Germany, 20.7 t of antineoplastic agents was consumed in 2012. The share of drugs with DNA-damaging properties increased within the last 6 years from 24 up to 67 %. Solely, capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil amount together 8 t-which corresponds to 39 % of the total antineoplastic consumption. Around 80 % of the total mass consumed could be attributed to prescriptions issued by office-based practitioners and is mostly excreted at home. Based on the different mode of actions, a case-by-case evaluation of the risk connected to their presence in the environment is recommended. DNA-damaging drugs should be assessed independently as no action limit can be assumed.

AB Emerging contaminants traditionally have not been measured in the environment, but they recently have been detected in various water systems as a result of advancements in analytical methods. These contaminants pose potential threats to ecosystems and public health, but are generally not regulated, nor are they required to be routinely monitored. This paper presents the implementation of watershed-scale monitoring-site selection as an effective monitoring design for emerging contaminants. The study aimed to identify critical areas of emerging contaminants for both point and nonpoint sources in five selected watersheds in the United States with different land-use compositions and climate conditions. Spatial association analysis using the Getis-Ord's Gi* statistic was employed to identify clusters of point and nonpoint emerging contaminants considering the impact of neighboring subwatersheds. This analysis identified subbasins containing major wastewater treatment systems as point-source hotspots and those containing and surrounded by concentrated agricultural activities or urban residential areas as nonpoint-source hotspots The results, supported by the measurement data, indicated that the outlets of these identified hotspots should be monitored during both dry- and wet-weather periods in order to understand their impacts on receiving waters. The significance of monitoring point- and/or nonpoint-source pollution was dictated by the pollution source distribution, watershed characteristics, and climate settings. The approach in this study provides a quantitative basis for selecting monitoring locations and managing emerging contaminants that can be applied to other watersheds.

AB Annular centrifugal contactors (ACCs), which use centrifugal force to separate the dispersion of two immiscible liquids of different densities, have been utilized in many industrial fields, such as the petroleum, hydrometallurgy, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical processing, protein extraction, enantioselective chemical separation, biodiesel synthesis, and nuclear industries. Detailed hydrodynamic information, such as the liquid hold-up volume and the interface radius, is very important for successful design and operation of ACCs. A new method, namely, the liquid-fast-separation method, was developed to (1) obtain the parameters of the liquid hold-up volume, the actual phase ratio (aqueous phase/organic phase, a/o) of two phases in the mixing zone, and the interface radius, and (2) investigate the effects of the rotor speed, the total flow rate, the flow ratio (a/o), and the diameter of the heavy phase weir on these parameters. The experimental results indicated that the parameters of the liquid hold-up volume, the actual phase ratio (a/o) of two phases in the mixing zone, and the interface radius could be obtained using the liquid-fast-separation method. Moreover, the effects of the rotor speed, the total flow rate, the flow ratio (a/o), and the diameter of the heavy phase weir on these parameters could also be obtained. These results provide a more complete understanding of the fluid flow in ACCs to enable further advancements in their design and operation.

AB Two different technical approaches based on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), solar Fenton homogeneous photocatalysis (hv/Fe2+/H2O2) and heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspensions were studied for the chemical degradation of the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in secondary treated effluents. A bench-scale solar simulator in combination with an appropriate photochemical batch reactor was used to evaluate and select the optimal oxidation conditions of ofloxacin spiked in secondary treated domestic effluents. The concentration profile of the examined substrate during degradation was determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. Mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The concentrations of Fe2+ and H2O2 were the key factors for the solar Fenton process, while the most important parameter of the heterogeneous photocatalysis was proved to be the catalyst loading. Kinetic analyses indicated that the photodegradation of ofloxacin can be described by a pseudo-first-order reaction. The rate constant (k) for the solar Fenton process was determined at different Fe2+ and H2O2 concentrations whereas the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) kinetic expression was used to assess the kinetics of the heterogeneous photocatalytic process. The conversion of ofloxacin depends on several parameters based on the various experimental conditions, which were investigated. A Daphnia magna bioassay was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the parent compound and its photo-oxidation by-products in different stages of oxidation. In the present study solar Fenton has been demonstrated to be more effective than the solar TiO2 process, yielding complete degradation of the examined substrate and DOC reduction of about 50% in 30 min of the photocatalytic treatment.

AB Increasing research has suggested that biosolids generated from municipal wastewater treatment can be a major sink for many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their land application potentially introduces these contaminants into the terrestrial and aquatic environments. In this study, methods were developed for the analysis of 14 PPCPs in biosolids and soils using pressurized liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass, spectrometry. Recoveries were over 50% for all analytes except diphenhydramine (similar to 30%) in soils. Soil properties or type of biosolids showed minor effects on method recoveries. Estimated method limits of quantification (LOQ) range from 0.1-15 ng g(-1) for soil and 0.3-27 ng g(-1) for biosolids. A field study utilizing the methods revealed that other than carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, all targeted compounds were detected in biosolids. Diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, triclosan and triclocarban were detected up to the mu g g(-1) range with the highest concentration of 23 mu g g(-1) for triclocarban. Seven of the PCCPs found in biosolids were also detected in agricultural soils amended with these biosolids and several (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and triclocarban) appeared to be persistent in soils. Triclocarban was also found most abundant in soils with the highest average concentration of 0.2 mu g g(-1) while the rest of compounds were in the lower ng g(-1) range. Generally, the concentrations found on the fields were 2-3 degrees of magnitude lower than in the biosolids, which is likely to be due to dilution, degradation and leaching processes.

   BEHAVIOR; SURFACE
AB Iopromide (an X-ray contrast agent) and trimethoprim (an antibacterial drug) are frequently detected pharmaceuticals in effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in surface waters due to their persistence and high usage. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that a significantly higher removal rate in nitrifying activated sludge as compared to conventional activated sludge was observed for both iopromide and trimethoprim. When the activity of the nitrifying bacteria was inhibited, the percent removal of iopromide decreased from 97 to 86% while trimethoprim removal decreased from 70 to 25%. The metabolite of iopromide identified when nitrification was not inhibited was a dehydroxylated iopromide at the two side chains. However, when the nitrifying bacteria were inhibited the metabolite identified was a carboxylate, formed during the oxidation of the primary alcohol on the side chain of iopromide. These results suggest that the nitrifying bacteria are important in the observed biodegradation of iopromide in the activated sludge with higher solid retention time (SRT). Results from the laboratory-scale study were corroborated by the observed removal efficiencies in a full-scale municipal WWTP, which showed that iopromide (ranging from 0.10 to 0.27 Ag/ L) and trimethoprim (ranging from 0.0.08 to 0.53 Ag/ L) were removed more effectively in the nitrifying activate sludge which has a higher SRT (49 days) than in the conventional activated sludge (SRT of 6 days). In nitrifying activated sludge, the percent removal of iopromide in the WWTP reached 61%, while in conventional activated sludge, average removal was negligible. For trimethoprim, removal was limited to about 1% in the conventional activated sludge, while in the nitrifying activated sludge, the removal was increased to 50%.

AB Antilipidemic drugs are routinely detected in effluent and surface waters downstream of wastewater treatment plants. A mixture exposure study with nine environmentally relevant antilipidemic drugs was performed with zebrafish (Danio rerio, ZF) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, FHM) embryos to investigate the effects on sensitive embryologic stages. Zebrafish embryos were exposed nominally to: (a) 0.005 mM, (b) 0.05 mM, or (c) 0.5 mM of each drug in the mixture. Fathead minnow embryos were exposed nominally to: (a) 0.0005 mM, (b) 0.005 mM, or (c) 0.05 mM of each drug in the mixture. Several of the individual drug concentrations were within ranges previously found in the environment. Multiple metrics demonstrate that (a) exposure of ZF and FHM embryos to antilipidemic drugs during embryonic development results in lethal and sublethal effects, (b) ZF were more sensitive than FHM based on median lethal concentration (LC50 0.02 mM and 0.05 mM, respectively), but FHM exhibited more severe abnormal sublethal morphologies than zebrafish embryos, and (c) the sublethal effects differed between the two species. This model identified novel specific endpoints for assessing sensitive, sublethal effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Abnormal myofiber birefringence pattern, hemorrhage, and heart rate are not included in standard evaluations but each of these metrics demonstrated a dose-dependent response in this study. Results demonstrate risk to fish development with potential repercussions at the population level, especially if environmental concentrations increase. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Manure fertilization and wastewater irrigation can introduce the biologically potent synthetic progestins into agricultural soils, causing endocrine disruption in organisms of nearby surface waters. Therefore, this study investigated the sorption and desorption potential of etonogestrel, medroxyprogesterone, gestodene, norgestrel, cyproterone acetate, levonorgestrel, and dienogest in five agricultural soil-water systems. Sorption data were well-described by the linear sorption model. In most batch systems, cyproterone acetate exhibited the highest affinities for soils, followed by etonogestrel, medroxyprogesterone, levonorgestrel, gestodene, norgestrel, and dienogest. The sorption magnitudes (logK(oc) or logK(d)) were significantly correlated with the progestin hydrophobicities (R-2 = 0.72-0.86, p < 0.05). The K-d values of the progestins were also significantly correlated with organic carbon content and pore volumes of the soils (R-2 = 0.68-0.98, p < 0.05). In addition, 0.5 M urea resulted in 3-19% decreases in K-d values of the progestins. Taken together, these data indicated that hydrophobic partitioning interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, and pore filling were the sorption mechanisms for the progestins in soil-water systems. No significant desorption hysteresis was observed for the progestins, indicating that they can be readily desorbed under rainfall or irrigation events. Based on the sorption and desorption data, we estimated the dynamic transport of the progestins in conventional agricultural management systems, and predicted the concentrations of the progestins as a function of soil-sorbed concentration, water-soil ratio, and dilution factor of receiving waters. This study will improve the understanding of the risks posed by the progestins under field-scale hydrological conditions.

AB Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and Norfloxacin are second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic against bacterial DNA gyrase, which reduces DNA strain throughout replication. As DNA gyrase is essential through DNA replication, subsequent DNA synthesis and cell division are inhibited. Direct photolysis of fluoroquinolones was studied by using UV irradiation in the presence or absence of other substances that generate free radicals. This study aimed to assess the effect of Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in removing ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by using a simulating model of wastewater contained urea at pH 4. A known concentration of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were prepared in an appropriate aqueous solution in presence or absence 0.2M urea and adjusted at pH 4. The dissolved drugs were irradiated with UVB-lamp in a dark place for 60 minutes. The percent of removal and the rate of elimination (k) of each drug were calculated. The direct photolysis effect of UVB irradiation was observed with ciprofloxacin which amounted to 24.4% removal compared with 12.4% removal of norfloxacin after 60 minutes of irradiation. The effect of UVB irradiation was enhanced by urea to reach 38.9% and 15% for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The calculated k of ciprofloxacin has amounted to three folds of that of norfloxacin. Direct photolysis of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin can be achieved simply by using a simulation model of 0.2 M urea and UVB irradiation at pH 4. UVB is highly effective in removing ciprofloxacin compared with norfloxacin by 2-3 folds.

AB Today, the unusual use of antibiotics and the entry of these compounds into the environment have caused global concern. The antibiotics even in low concentrations in the range of ng/L and mu g/L can cause effects in humans and animals due to their low degradability, high solubility and cumulative properties in water. This study was performed to removal of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles in a batch system. The effects of different parameters including pH (3-11) adsorbent dosage (0.2-2 g/L), contact time (2-120 min), initial concentration (10-100 mg/L) and temperature (283-318 K) on the adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles were investigated. The results of this study showed that the maximum adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles has occurred in pH = 7. By increasing the adsorbent dose, adsorption capacity has decreased. Also, with increasing Penicillin G concentration, the adsorption capacity was increased. The maximum adsorption capacity of silica nanoparticles was 211.35 mg/g (optimum conditions of pH = 7, adsorbent dose of 0.2 g/L, contact time of 60 min, Penicillin G concentration of 100 mg/L and temperature of 218 K). The results showed that the adsorption of Penicillin G by silica nanoparticles was more consistent with Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.81). Also, the results of kinetic study showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic. The result of temperature and thermodynamics parameter showed that the values of Delta S degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta G degrees were positive, negative and negative respectively.

AB Anthropogenic activity is increasing the presence of contaminants that enter waterways through wastewater effluent and urban and/or agricultural runoff, generally in complex mixtures. Depending on the mode of action of the individual contaminant within the mixture, toxicity can occur due to contaminants having similar or dissimilar modes of action. However, it is unknown how the metabolome responds to sublethal contaminant mixtures in the keystone genus Daphnia. In the present study we examined D. magna metabolic responses to acute sublethal exposure of propranolol, carbamazepine, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as well as in binary (propranolol-carbamazepine, propranolol-PFOS, carbamazepine-PFOS) and tertiary mixtures (carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS), all at 10% of the median lethal concentration of the population (LC50). The metabolome was measured using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and characterized using principal component analysis, regression analysis, and fold changes in metabolite relative to the unexposed (control) group. The averaged principal component analysis scores plots revealed that carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS exposures were significantly different from the control treatment. After normalizing the toxicity of each contaminant, we found that some metabolites responded monotonically, whereas others displayed a nonmonotonic response with increasing toxicity units. The single contaminant exposures and 2 binary mixtures (propranolol-carbamazepine, and propranolol-PFOS) resulted in minimal changes in the identified metabolites, whereas the carbamazepine-PFOS and carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS displayed increases in several amino acid metabolites and decreases in glucose. Overall, our results highlight the sensitivity of the metabolome to distinguish the composition of the contaminant mixtures, with some mixtures displaying heightened responses versus others.

AB The reduction of commonly used X-ray contrast iohexol (IOX) by the electrooxidation process is presented in this study. To begin with, the effect of anode material was examined, and different mixed metal oxide electrodes (MMOs) such as Ti/RuO2, Ti/Pt, Ti/IrO2-RuO2, Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5, Ti/Ta2O5-SnO2-IrO2, and Pt/SnO2 were used. To assess experimental conditions at Ti/RuO2 anode, provided the highest removal efficiency, the response surface method was applied and the key influencing parameter was the process time. The determined optimal conditions were triplicated with real wastewater samples, and the average degradation efficiency of IOX was found to be 99%. By-products of the IOX degradation on the Ti/RuO2 anode have been identified using density functional theory and LC/MS-MS analysis. The results showed that IOX degradation opened with OH group detachment and resulted in the formation of a by-product with a molecular mass of 804 g mol(-1). Further degradation mechanism took place due to the breakup of C-4-C-10 and C-5-I-7 bonds with a by-product formed as 603 g mol(-1). Iodide atom replacement by OH groups caused the formation of a molecular fragment with 375 g mol(-1) molecular weight. The further disintegration of C-2-C-11 and C-6-N-16 sigma- bonds led to the formation of molecular masses of 133, 126, and 119 g mol(-1), respectively.

AB From the application of concepts derived from the gas-liquid absorption film model, the competition between ozone reactions with 72 water emerging or priority contaminants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) and the initiation steps of the hydroxyl radical decomposition of ozone in ozone alone and combined with hydrogen peroxide oxidation systems has been studied. With this information, the ozone preferential reaction, that is, the ozone direct reaction or the formation of free radicals and the kinetic absorption regime are known. In a second step, the ratio of removal rates of the contaminants studied by reacting with hydroxyl radical and ozone has also been estimated. With this, the way contaminants are preferentially removed (from their reaction with ozone or from the reaction with free radicals) can also be known and, hence, whether or not an ozone advanced oxidation system is convenient to be applied. For instance, most of the contaminants studied in this work at concentrations lower than 50gL(-1) and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations lower than 50mgL(-1) react with ozone under chemical control regime so that both direct and free radical reactions theoretically compete. However, under chemical control, typical concentration of scavengers present in wastewater or surface water would inhibit the free radical reactions and, at least theoretically, for many contaminants studied here, the direct ozone reaction is the principal removal way. When mass transfer controls the process rate only contaminants with a hydroxyl and ozone rate constant ratio 1.6x10(6) M(-1)s(-1) would be preferentially removed through free radical way.

AB Diphenhydramine (DPH) is one of the pharmaceuticals commonly found in the effluent stream after wastewater treatment, and the cause of its environmental persistence needs to be addressed urgently. Smectite minerals are common soil components with large surface area, expandable interlayer, and high cation exchange capacity (CEC), thus are capable of adsorbing or intercalating inorganic or organic cations on the surface or in the interlayer. In this study the intercalation of DPH in the interlayer of a Ca-smectite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, infra-red, and thermogravimetric analyses supported by molecular dynamic simulation. At the low (0.2-0.3 CEC) and high (0.6-0.7 CEC) adsorption levels, the intercalated DPH might take a horizontal monolayer or a bilayer configuration, resulting in a d(001) expansion to 15 or 17 angstrom, respectively. As the amount of DPH intercalation increased, a gradual, yet systematic, dehydration due to removal of hydrated inorganic cation Ca2+ from the interlayer was observed. In addition, the intercalated DPH had a slightly higher thermal stability due to the shield effect of the host mineral smectite against heat. The uptake of DPH by the smectite was attributed to both electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged mineral surfaces and the positively charged tertiary amine and cation exchange interactions between DPH+ and hydrated Ca2+. Thus, smectite minerals could serve as a sink to remove dissolved DPH from water on the one hand, and as a carrier to transport intercalated DPH in the environment on the other hand.

AB A combination of surrogate parameters and indicator compounds were measured to predict the removal efficiency of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) using low pressure (LP)-UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP), engaged with online sensor-based monitoring system. Thirty-nine TOrCs were evaluated in two distinct secondary wastewater effluents in terms of estimated photochemical reactivity, as a function of the rate constants of UV direct photolysis (k(UV)) and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) oxidation (k(OH)(center dot)). The selected eighteen TOrCs were classified into three groups that served as indicator compounds: Group 1 for photo-susceptible TOrCs but with minor degradation by (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (diclofenac, fluoxetine, iohexol, iopamidol, iopromide, simazine and sulfamethoxazole); Group 2 for TOrCs susceptible to both direct photolysis and (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (benzotriazole, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, naproxen and sucralose); and Group 3 for photo-resistant TOrCs showing dominant degradation by (OH)-O-center dot oxidation (atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, gemfibrozil, primidone and trimethoprim). The results indicate that TOC (optical-based measurement), UVA(254) or UVT254 (UV absorbance or transmittance at 254 nm), and total fluorescence can all be used as suitable on-line organic surrogate parameters to predict the attenuation of TOrCs. Furthermore, the automated real-time monitoring via on-line surrogate sensors and equipped with the developed degradation profiles between sensor response and a group of TOrCs removal can provide a diagnostic tool for process control during advanced treatment of reclaimed waters.

AB To date, very few prescriptive studies have been reported in the literature concerning the catalytic removal of pharmaceutical substances in wastewater using H-2 in the presence of O-2 for the in situ formation of H2O2, while the mechanism of the reaction has not been studied in detail yet. Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent used extensively in catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) applications and can be used for the elimination of pharmaceuticals from waste water. In the present work, an attempt has been made to elucidate the actual effects of the in situ production of hydrogen peroxide on the CWAO of pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the effects of the nature of the active phase (Pd, Pt, and Rh), as well as the feed gas composition have been examined toward the reaction at hand. The results showed that 1% Pd/Al2O3 and 1% Rh/Al2O3 are the most effective catalysts for the elimination of paracetamol from the reaction medium using hydrogen-rich streams, having a conversion of up to 70% in 2 h. A maximum conversion of paracetamol of 90% was obtained in just 30 min of reaction over 1 wt.% Rh/Al2O3, when using pure hydrogen in the feed. Total organic carbon measurements performed over the latter catalyst showed that practically no organic carbon is removed from the liquid phase, indicating the conversion of paracetamol to a different organic (probably aromatic) compound, through hydrogenation. Toxicity tests that followed showed a dramatic decrease in the toxicity of the products solution, indicating that paracetamol hydrogenation might be a promising method for the elimination of its toxicity.

AB The long-term abuse of antibiotics such as norfloxacin (NOR) poses a significant threat to aquatic environments. The development of efficient and economical treatments is still a pain point in the industry. Herein, we reported a directly robust carbonization-pyrolysis method to synthesize iron and nitrogen co-doped biochar material (Fe@N co-doped biochar) that was first applied to NOR removal through persulfate (PS) activation. The catalytic performance and operating factors were systematically investigated. It was found that 10 mg/L NOR achieved 95% degradation within 20 min under optimal reaction conditions. The removal rate of NOR could still achieve 80% and almost 50% of NOR was completely mineralized after five cycles. Through combined electron-paramagnetic-resonance analysis, quenching experiments, and X-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy tests, center dot OH, center dot SO4-, and O-1(2) were confirmed as reactive oxygen species in catalytic reaction. Iron activated PS to produce center dot OH and center dot SO4- through electron transfer and nitrogen-containing functional groups (graphitic N, C-OH/C = N) accepted electrons from PS to generate O-1(2). The radical pathway involving hydroxyl radicals and the nonradical pathways involving singlet oxygen together accounted for the rapid degradation of NOR. The degradation pathways were comprehensively established, including defluorination, decarboxylation, piperazine ring breakage and nalidixic ring transformation. This study shed light on a new mechanism of radical and nonradical co-dominated PS activation and proposed a simple and inexpensive antibiotic wastewater treatment system.

AB The occurrence of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals in streams is increasingly being reported, yet the impacts of these contaminants of emerging concern on aquatic ecosystems are relatively unknown. Bacteria and fungi are vital components of stream environments and, therefore, exposure to antimicrobials may have important consequences for ecosystem services, such as carbon cycling. The objective of this study was to investigate how two antimicrobials, ciprofloxacin and climbazole, impact detrital biofilm metabolism in urban and rural streams. To establish baseline conditions, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of red maple (Acer rubrum) biofilms was measured in one urban and one rural stream. In mesocosm studies, the BOD of biofilms on singleand mixed-species leaf litter from the same sites was measured after exposure to 10 mu g/L of the antimicrobials, both in combination and individually. The presence of ciprofloxacin and climbazole did not affect BOD compared to the controls at the urban site, although significant differences were identified for select treatments at the rural site. In addition, the BOD of mixed-leaf biofilms was not significantly different from that of single species litter after exposure. Overall, exposure to 10 mu g/L of the antimicrobials did not significantly impact community-level carbon processing by the leaf biofilms, and leaf mixtures did not result in increased biofilm BOD compared to single species leaves. The outcomes of this work demonstrate a need for further research for the understanding the effects of antimicrobials on rural streams to prevent unintended consequences to ecological processes and biota from future development, leaking septic systems, and wastewater spills.

AB Bovine bile was assessed as a novel bio-surfactant pre-treatment to enhance anaerobic digestion of lipid-rich dissolved air flotation (DAF) sludge using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. Bile was dosed at arbitrary concentrations from 0.2-6 g/L. At 0.6 g bile/L, methane yield increased by 7.08%. Doses above 2 g bile/L produced negative impacts on SMP, kinetics and digestion profile. At 6 g/L bile produced a 6% decrease in specific methane production and up to 79% additional inhibitory duration, delayed time of peak methane production by up to 74%, and slowed total digestion time by up to 65%. Reaction kinetics declined linearly with respect to bile addition, reaching half the control value at 6 g/L bile concentration. Subsequent anaerobic toxicity assays between 1 and 6 g bile/L revealed that bile has an inhibitory effect under BMP testing at these higher doses. The economic viability of using bile as a bio-surfactant was assessed. In comparison to the current use of bile as a sale product to pharmaceutical companies, the addition of 0.2 g bile/L to existing slaughterhouse waste streams could increase the value of bile to 220% of its current sale value. The promising results of bile dosed at 0.6 g/L under BMP testing warrant further investigation into long-term impact of bile pre-treatments of high-fat slaughterhouse wastewater in semi-continuous digestion experiments.

AB The acute waste management problems, coupled with the proliferation of small scale industries in many developing countries, make low quality water treatment before use inevitable in the long run. These industries have the potential to discharge effluent containing chemicals and heavy metals into the environment. The indiscriminative use of pharmaceutical products by households in many of these countries is another source of health concern. Low quality water treatment in these countries has however been hampered by the high cost of infrastructure provision and maintenance. Cost-sharing among stakeholders appears to be a promising strategy to finance and maintain the wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study therefore, the willingness and ability of urban open space commercial vegetable farmers to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation purposes has been assessed. One hundred open space commercial vegetable farmers and four vegetable farmers' associations were selected and interviewed in Kumasi in Ghana using semi-structured interview schedules and interview guides respectively. The results of the study show that approximately three out of every five vegetable farmers were willing to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation. The results further show that the probability of being willing to pay by farmers who agreed that the current water they used for irrigation was harmful is approximately 5.3 times greater than that of those who did not. The analysis of the farmers' ability to pay revealed that all the farmers would be capable of paying for reclaimed water at a price of US$0.11/m(3). This has implications for land tenure security and vegetable consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for the produce.

AB Chlorine is widely used in drinking water treatment plants as a common disinfectant, and it also can effectively remove many pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water and wastewater. Two pyrazolone compounds (propyphenazone and aminopyrine) that have been frequently detected in aquatic environments were selected for investigation into their removal during free chlorine disinfection. The influencing factors on the removal of the pharmaceuticals were explored at initial pharmaceutical concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.25 mu M, chlorine dosages ranging from 14.08 to 28.17 mu M and pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0. The results showed high removal efficiencies of the two pharmaceuticals by free chlorine in the order of propyphenazone>aminopyrine. Their removal and reaction rate constants (k(obs)) were clearly dependent on the chlorine dosage and pH. High chlorine dosages accelerated the removal rates of both compounds. The highest removal efficiencies and the highest k(obs) were observed at neutral pH for propyphenazone (>90% for 24 s reaction) and slightly acidic pH for aminopyrine (>85% for 110 s reaction). In addition, the degradation of the two compounds by free chlorine and the structure characteristics of the oxidation byproducts were estimated by non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), ultraviolet (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The results of the NPOC analysis indicated that chlorine cannot completely mineralize propyphenazone or aminopyrine. Chlorine atom substitution, dealkylations and ring-opening reactions may occur during propyphenazone or aminopyrine chlorination according to the UV-Vis and FT-IR analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to range from low parts per trillion to parts per billion levels in surface waters, wastewater effluents, and sediments. These low levels have led to concern for their potential long-term risks to the survival, growth, and reproduction of aquatic organisms. We investigated the acute and chronic effects of sertraline on the life history traits of Ceriodaphnia dubia over the course of three generations under environmentally realistic concentrations. Acute toxicity of sertraline in C dubia offspring resulted in a 48 h median effective concentration of 126 mu g L-1. Under chronic exposure, the lowest concentration to affect fecundity and growth was at 53.4 mu g L-1 in the first two generations. These parameters become more sensitive during the third generation where the LOEC was 4.8 mu g L-1. The median effective concentrations (EC50) for the number of offspring per female, offspring body size, and dry weight were 17.2, 21.2, and 26.2 mu g L-1, respectively. Endpoints measured in this study demonstrate that chronic exposure of C dubia to sertraline leads to effects that occur at concentrations only an order of magnitude higher than predicted environmental concentrations. However, this study also demonstrates that multigenerational effects should be considered in chronic exposure studies because standard toxicity tests do not account for increases in sensitivity in successive generations to toxicants.

AB Streptomycin is a common contaminant in a variety of industrial and agricultural wastewaters. The available information on the potential toxicity of streptomycin of fresh algae implicated in the treatment of biological wastewater is extremely limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of streptomycin on physiological indices and photosynthesis-related gene transcription. The results of short-term batch bioassays indicated that streptomycin was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than to green algae. The EC50 of streptomycin in Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris were 0.28 and 20.08 mg L-1, respectively. These selected streptomycin concentrations inhibited algal cell growth and decreased chlorophyll or phycocyanobilin content. Streptomycin also destroyed the overall membrane system, which was speculated from malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage increasing after streptomycin exposure. Two algae were induced to increase their antioxidant enzyme activities to withstand streptomycin. However, the balance between oxidant substance and antioxidant enzyme was broken, because reactive oxygen species (ROS) content simultaneously increased. Streptomycin inhibited photosynthesis-related gene transcription in C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa. Transcript levels of psaB, psbA, and rbcL in C. vulgaris decreased to only 14.5%, 32.2%, and 9.3% of the control, respectively. Similarly, the transcript levels of psaB, psbD, and rbcL in M. aeruginosa decreased markedly in the present of streptomycin. The transcription of these genes was 12.4%, 26.1%, and 28.4% of the control after 0.1 mg L-1 streptomycin exposure, respectively. Our results demonstrate that streptomycin is toxic to fresh algae, affects photosynthesis-related gene transcription, and blocks electron transport and ROS overproduction.

AB Pilot plant experiments applying solar titanium dioxide photocatalysis and solar photo-Fenton treatment at different pH and iron concentrations with an initial diclofenac concentration of 50 mg L-1 are described.
   In preliminary experiments absence of hydrolysis and slow photolysis under solar irradiation of diclofenac solutions were observed. Solar photo-Fenton treatment with freshly precipitated iron at pH around 7 showed first order kinetics, the reaction taking place on the surface of the iron precipitate. Simultaneous oxidation, precipitation and re-dissolution processes of diclofenac governed photo-Fenton decomposition kinetics at pH 2.8. The use of different iron concentrations (0.03-0.75 mM) showed no influence on the reaction rate in a neutral medium due to reactor geometry. Similar behaviour (no influence of iron concentration) was observed at pH 2.8, due to precipitation problems. A pH of around 4. close to the pK(a), of diclofenac, showed promising results, partly overcoming both iron and diclofenac precipitation. Solar titanium dioxide photocatalysis with Degussa P-25 followed first order kinetics and no precipitation or adsorption occurred.
   Decomposition of diclofenac took around 100 min under all photo-Fenton treatment conditions employed. Decomposition by titanium dioxide photocatalysis took about 200 min. In photo-Fenton treatment, hydrogen peroxide consumption to diclofenac decomposition was about 80-110 mM at pH 2.8 and 40 mM in the other two treatments (neutral pH and pH = 4).

AB Amitriptyline (AMT) is the most widely used tricyclic antidepressant and is classified as a recalcitrant emergent contaminant because it has been detected in different sources of water. Its accumulation in water and soil represents a risk for different living creatures. To remove amitriptyline from wastewater, the Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) stands up as an interesting option since generate highly oxidized species as hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) by environmentally friendly mechanism. In this work, the oxidation and mineralization of AMT solution have been comparatively studied by 3 Electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) where the center dot OH is produced by anodic oxidation of H2O (AO-H2O2), or by electro-Fenton (EF) or photoelectro-Fenton (PEF).
   PEF process with a BDD anode showed the best performance for degradation and mineralization of this drug due to the synergistic action of highly reactive physiosorbed BDD (center dot OH), homogeneous center dot OH and UVA radiation. This process achieved total degradation of AMT at 50 min of electrolysis and 95% of mineralization after 360 min of treatment with 0.5 mmol L-1 Fe2+ at 100 mA cm(-2). Six aromatic intermediates for the drug mineralization were identified in short time of electrolysis by GC-MS, including a chloroaromatic by-product formed from the attack of active chlorine. Short-chain carboxylic acids like succinic, malic, oxalic and formic acid were quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC. Furthermore, the formation of NO3- ions was monitored. Finally, the organic intermediates identified by chromatographic techniques were used to propose the reaction sequence for the total mineralization of AMT. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of antimicrobials in wastewater (WW), surface water (SW), groundwater (GW), and even in potable water from treatment plants has been reported from many countries. Their presence in the water sources is causing the rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thereby threatening our public health, global economy, and development. This necessitates the constant monitoring of these compounds along with the evaluation of their associated risk to aquatic organisms. In this study, GW, WW, and SW samples from different parts of West Bengal (India) were analyzed using the SPE-HPLC-DAD method for detecting two frequently used fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, CIP and ofloxacin, OFL). The highest concentration of CIP and OFL was 5.75 mu g/L (GW) and 17.84 mu g/L (WW), respectively. The antimicrobial activity was determined against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates from WW against CIP, which showed that Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus had developed similar to 69 and similar to 12 times resistance compared to their respective pure strains. The risk assessment showed that CIP poses an insignificant threat to fish and Daphnia (RQ < 1) but a significant threat to green algae and Microcystis aeruginosa (RQ> > 1). OFL concentration also poses a great threat to all the organisms for which the assessment was made (RQ> > 1). Moreover, risk assessment in terms of AMR showed that the present level of these antimicrobials in different water sources could cause the development of resistance among the microbial community (RQ > 1). These results emphasize the need for constant monitoring of pharmaceutical compounds, especially antimicrobials, to be kept under check.

AB One emerging problem that recently has become a vastly acknowledged topic of concern is the environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most common pharmaceuticals found, due to its high utilization and low removal rate in wastewater treatment processes. In this work, Solanum the internal mechanisms triggered by this exposure. For this purpose, plants were exposed to two different DCF concentrations (0.5 mg L-1 and 5 mg L-1). Results obtained here point towards a loss of shoot performance when plants were exposed to very high concentrations of DCF, but no delay or loss of yield in the flowering and fruit stages were ascribed to DCF contamination. Our data shows that a state of oxidative stress due to high reactive oxygen species accumulation was associated with this contamination, with very high DCF levels leading to a rise of lipid peroxidation, possibly accentuated by the inhibition of ROS-scavenging enzymes and unable to be counteracted by the visible upregulation of proline and the thiol-based redox network. Overall, these results allow to infer that in the current environmental context, no noticeable negative effects should be associated with the presence of DCF in soils where this crop is cultivated. However, the oxidative stress and lower biomass associated with the highest concentration are alarming, since DCF levels in the environment are continuously increasing and further measures are necessary to assess this problematic.

AB Enhancing the understanding of the fate of wastewater-derived organic micropollutants in rivers is crucial to improve risk assessment, regulatory decision making and river management. Hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity are two factors gaining increasing importance as drivers for micropollutant degradation, but are complex to study in field experiments and usually ignored in laboratory tests aimed to estimate environmental half-lives. Flume mesocosms are useful to investigate micropollutant degradation processes, bridging the gap between the field and batch experiments. However, few studies have used flumes in this context. We present a novel experimental setup using 20 recirculating flumes and a response surface model to study the influence of hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity on half-lives of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACS). The effect of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange was tested by three treatment levels differing in number of bedforms (0, 3 and 6). Three levels of sediment bacterial diversity were obtained by diluting sediment from the River Erpe in Berlin, Germany, with sand (1 : 10, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 100 000). Our results show that ACS half-lives were significantly influenced by sediment dilution and number of bedforms. Half-lives of CBZ were higher than ACS, and were significantly affected only by the sediment dilution variable, and thus by bacterial diversity. Our results show that (1) the flume-setup is a useful tool to study the fate of micropollutants in rivers, and that (2) higher hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity in the sediment can increase the degradation of micropollutants in rivers.

AB Optimization of photocatalytic degradation of two natural estrogenic compounds, estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) in aqueous medium was performed on TiO2 coated Pilkington Activ (TM) self-cleaning glass as a novel approach to eliminate free nano-TiO2 releasing to the intended environment after treatment. The active glass was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy to characterize the TiO2 nanoparticles. The main purposes were mineralization of target compounds in the treated water during the photocatalytic reaction and also to investigate the oxidation by products. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been applied to optimize the photocatalytic degradation by changing time, pH, and light intensity as effective factors. According to the results, time was the more effective parameter. The maximum efficiency degradation was achieved in alkaline media. Due to interactive effects between variable factors, 1 mg/L aqueous solution of El and 17 beta-E2 in water was totally decomposed by TiO2 photocatalyzed reactions under UV-C irradiation of 10.08 W/m(2) for 52.49 min at pH 9.42. Results of GC-MS analysis were introduced 17-deoxy Estrone and 2-Hydroxyestradiol as intermediate products for El and 17 beta-E2, respectively. All of the peaks finally disappeared after 170 min. Optimized conditions were applied for real sample of wastewater, presenting 30.40% and 56.84% in the efficiency degradation of El and 17 beta-E2, respectively.

AB The organic-diffusive gradients in thin-films (o-DGT) technique has emerged as a promising aquatic passive sampler that addresses many of the challenges associated with current sampling tools used for measurement of polar organic contaminants. This study represents the first comprehensive field evaluation of the o-DGT in natural surface waters, across a wide suite of polar pharmaceuticals and pesticides. We explore the utility and limitations of o-DGT as a quantitative measurement tool compared to grab sampling and the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) across four connected agricultural and wastewater-influenced freshwater systems spanning 600 km from the U.S. border to northern Manitoba, Canada. Overall, the suite of analytes detected with o-DGT and POCIS was similar. Concentrations in water estimated using o-DGT were greater than concentrations estimated from POCIS in 71 of 80 paired observations, and on average, the estimates from o-DGT were 2.3-fold greater than estimates from POCIS. Grab sample concentrations suggested that the systematic underestimation with POCIS were largely a result of sampling rate variation related to flow rate and boundary-layer effects, an issue reported consistently in the POCIS literature. These comprehensive measurements in an agriculturally influenced fast-flowing river, long-term sampling (>40 days) in a large dilute lake system, deployments in wastewaters, and under ice at near-freezing temperatures represent effective stress testing of o-DGT under representative and challenging conditions. Overall, its strong performance and improved accuracy over POCIS supports its use as a robust, quantitative, and sensitive measurement tool for polar organic chemicals in aquatic systems.

AB In this study, the heterogeneous Fenton oxidation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in an aqueous solution was examined over the nano-sized magnetite (Fe3O4) as a catalyst supplied through high-energy planetary ball milling process. To characterize the magnetite samples after and before ball milling operation, the Xray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were applied. The catalytic properties of the magnetite were considerably improved because of the enhancement in its physical properties, resulted from milling process. The findings also indicated that 6 h ball-milled magnetite demonstrated better properties for elimination of CIP of about 89% following 120 min reaction at optimal conditions of H2O2 12 mM, Fe3O4 1.75 g L-1, CIP 10 mg L-1 and pH 3.0. The effects of various operational parameters, including the initial pH of the solution, H2O2 initial concentration, catalyst dosage, milling time and OP initial concentration was investigated. Application of organic and inorganic scavengers considerably decreased the CIP removal efficiency. Correspondingly, with respect to the leached iron values at pH 3, it was concluded that CIP elimination was mainly occurred through heterogeneous Fenton procedure. This process included the adsorption and oxidation phases in which the hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) played a significant role. GC-MS analysis was used for recording of the generated intermediates of the CIP removal in the course of heterogeneous Fenton process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation and removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) on ultrapure (UPW) and natural water (NW) by ozone (O-3) and ozone/powdered activated carbon (O-3/PAC) have been studied. The OMPs atrazine (ATZ, herbicide), carbamazepine (CBZ, anticonvulsant), diclofenac (DCL, anti-inflammatory) and triclosan (TCS, antimicrobial) are incorporated continuously and uncontrolled on water treatment systems (e.g., drinking water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants).
   Batch experiments on ultrapure and natural water showed that ATZ treated with 03 and O-3/PAC has the slowest transformation rate (>90% at 30 min reaction) while CBZ, DCL and TCS were oxidized very fast (>90% at similar to 5 min). The radical scavenger tert-Butyl alcohol (TBA) was used to evaluate the contribution of HO' on the OMPs oxidation. TBA, a hydrophilic compound with low adsorbability, was used as a strong HO' scavenger to assess the role of the OH radical in the oxidation of the OMPs studied. ATZ oxidation was mainly driven by OH radicals. On the contrary, CBZ, DCL and TCS were removed by direct reaction with ozone. Infrared analysis (FTIR) showed changes in the PAC surface functional groups of the carbon exposed to ozone, decreasing its basic properties.
   The acute toxicity assays of the OMPs mixture dissolved in UPW performed with D. magna was significantly reduced by ozonation. The addition of PAC to the ozonation process, strongly improved the acute toxicity removal.Short chain mono- and di-carboxylic acids were identified as some of the oxidation intermediates formed during ozone treatment.

AB Cometabolism is the ability of microorganisms to degrade non-growth substrates in the presence of primary substrates, being the main removal mechanism behind the biotransformation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants. In this paper, a cometabolic Monod-type kinetics, linking biotransformation of micropollutants with primary substrate degradation, was applied to a highly enriched nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) reactor operated under different operational conditions (hydraulic retention time (HRT) and nitrifying activity). A dynamic model of the bioreactor was built taking into account biotransformation, sorption and volatilization. The micropollutant transformation capacity (T-c), the half-saturation constant (K-sc) and the solid liquid partitioning coefficient (K-d) of several organic micropollutants were estimated at 25 degrees C using an optimization algorithm to fit experimental data to the proposed model with the cometabolic Monod-type biotransformation kinetics.
   The cometabolic Monod-type kinetic model was validated under different HRTs (1.0-3.7 d) and nitrification rates (0.12-0.45 g N/g VSS d), describing more accurately the fate of those compounds affected by the biological activity of nitrifiers (ibuprofen, naproxen, erythromycin and roxithromycin) compared to the commonly applied pseudo-first order micropollutant biotransformation kinetics, which does not link biotransformation of micropollutants to consumption of primary substrate. Furthermore, in contrast to the pseudo-first order biotransformation constant (k(biol)), the proposed cometabolic kinetic coefficients are independent of operational conditions such as the nitrogen loading rate applied. Also, the influence of the kinetic parameters on the biotransformation efficiency of NAS reactors, defined as the relative amount of the total inlet micropollutant load being biotransformed, was assessed considering different HRTs and nitrification rates.

AB Thermally activated persulfate (TAP) is discussed in the literature as remediation option for contaminated effluents. The present paper assesses the impact of selected operational parameters on the involved oxidative degradation using ibuprofen (IBU) as model contaminant and sodium persulfate (SPS) as model oxidizing agent. Tested parameters included SPS and IBU initial concentrations, activation temperature, solution pH and ionic strength. A specific objective was to identify the more appropriate kinetics model that can fit with the experimental data under specific conditions. A series of experiments were conducted at 60 degrees C keeping in excess only one of the two reactants (IBU or SPS) while varying the concentration of the other. Polynomial regressions were used to analyze IBU decay and relative t(1/2) were calculated based on the second order polynomial equations obtained. The results showed that at the initial stage of the oxidation (similar to 1-2 half-lives), the reactions can be described by the kinetics rate equation -d[IBU]/dt = 2.71 x 10(-4) (mM min(-1)) [IBU](0.25)[SPS](1) within the experimental conditions applied here e.g. 60 degrees C, pH 6.8-7.0, [IBU](0) 7.33-20.36 mu M and [SPS](0) 1.0-2.8 mM. HPLC/MS analysis showed the absence of by-products throughout the treatment process indicating at least partial mineralization of IBU. The results of this study confirmed that the developed model of TAP technology could be an adequate approach for specific treatment of small volumes of hot spot wastewater containing IBU like hospital effluents.

AB Urban areas in the Brazilian Amazon have grown at an unprecedented rate during the last years. About 90% of the wastewater produced by these urban areas are discharged untreated into Amazonian freshwater ecosystems, constituting a potential environmental pathway for pharmaceuticals and other chemicals consumed by modern societies (e.g. psychostimulants, personal-care products, hormones). The distribution of these chemicals into the Amazon River and their potential risks for freshwater biodiversity have not been evaluated so far. Here, we show the results of the largest chemical monitoring campaign conducted in the Amazon region. We assessed exposure patterns for 43 pharmaceuticals and other urban contaminants in 40 sampling sites distributed along the Amazon River, three major tributaries (Negro, Tapaj acute accent os and Tocantins Rivers), and four large cities of the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santare acute accent m, Macap acute accent a, Bele acute accent m). We assessed risks for freshwater biodiversity using species sensitivity distributions and mixture toxicity approaches. We found that urban areas constitute important hotspots for chemical contamination, with mixtures containing up to 40 different compounds and exposure concentrations reaching the world's maxima for some of them. We show that chemical pollution can result in longterm effects for up to 50-80% of aquatic species next to urban areas. Moreover, we identified several ubiquitous compounds which can be used as tracers of anthropogenic pressure in the Amazon basin. We conclude that the chemical burden created by urbanization significantly contributes to a biodiversity loss in the region and should be further controlled.

AB A novel cathode of macroporous graphene aerogel (GA) with high specific surface area was proposed for the electro-Fenton (E-Fenton) system. The GA was prepared by reduction self-assembly method. The physicochemical properties were characterized in details. The GA displayed a low electrochemical resistance and exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity. Comparing with the traditional carbon fiber and graphite felt cathodes, the GA cathode showed more positive oxygen reduction potential of 0.07 V (versus saturated calomel electrode). In E-Fenton system, H2O2 could be in situ electro-generated efficiently and continuously via a twoelectron oxygen reduction reaction on the GA cathode. The electron transfer number n was calculated to be 1.0-2.0 for GA. The production of H2O2 of 107.6 mg L-1 was obtained for GA in 90 min. Good performance was exhibited to degrade antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Results showed that nearly 100% ciprofloxacin degradation ratio and 91% TOC removal were achieved in 90 min and 120 min, respectively, which were much higher than control groups. The mineralization current efficiency was 12.75% in 30 min. It was attributed to the plenty of macropores of GA acted as reaction trap to accelerate electro-generated H2O2 decomposing by Fe2+ to form OH efficiently, which was verified by probe molecule trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis. Simultaneously, the strong charge transfer ability of GA was beneficial to the conversion of Fe3+/Fe2+. The GA also presented distinguished reusability and stability. Therefore, GA is a promising candidate material for E-Fenton cathode due to low cost, high efficient and corrosion resistance.

AB Ternary extractive distillation (TED) is an effective and sustainable separation process for treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing ethyl acetate/isopropanol/water, corresponding to three binary azeotropes, to realize the recovery of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. Visual Basic software was used to optimize the extractive distillation process using a single solvent and mixed solvent in different proportions based on a sequential iterative optimization method, and the optimal mixture proportion (30% DMSO+70% EG) of the mixed solvent was determined. The economic and environmental performance of the extractive distillation process with a mixed solvent combined with partial thermal coupling technology was studied. The heat recovery within the separation process was further improved by the energy-efficient heat exchanger network synthesis (HENs) option. The economic and environmental performance of the mixed solvent extractive distillation process combined with heat pump technology was also explored. The results show that for the ternary extractive distillation process, the use of mixed solvent can significantly reduce energy consumption, which can lead to lower total annual cost (TAC) and CO2 emission. Compared with a conventional separation process with mixed solvent, the extractive distillation process combined with partial thermal coupling and heat pump technology further improves the economic and environmental performance. The TAC and CO2 emission of the mixed solvent separation process combined with partial thermal coupling technology were reduced by 12.183% and 19.869%, respectively. The TAC and CO2 emission of the mixed solvent separation process combined with heat pump distillation technology were reduced by 34.782% and 37.156%, respectively, which indicates the feasibility of using these two energy-saving processes for continuously updated cleaner production.

AB In this paper, biochar (BC) was prepared from discarded grapefruit peel and modified to prepare magnetic biochar (MBC). Physical and chemical properties of BC and MBC were characterized, and the results showed that the type of iron oxide loaded by MBC was gamma-Fe2O3. Compared with BC, MBC has a larger specific surface area and pore volume, with more oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. BC and MBC were used to adsorb and remove endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) bisphenol A (BPA) from simulated wastewater. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of BPA adsorption by BC and MBC were mainly in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the Langmuir model. This indicates that the adsorption of BPA on BC and MBC is mainly a chemically controlled monolayer adsorption. Adsorption thermodynamics show that BC and MBC adsorption of BPA is a spontaneous exothermic reaction, and lowering the temperature is conducive to the adsorption reaction. The effect of solution pH on the adsorption of BPA by both was significant. The optimum pH for BC and MBC to absorb BPA was 6 and 3, respectively. The concentration of Na+ in the range of 0-0.10 mol.L-1 can promote the adsorption of BPA to MBC. MBC loaded with gamma-Fe2O3 not only has excellent magnetic separation ability, but can also reach about 80% of the initial adsorption capacity after four cycles of adsorption. By analyzing the adsorption mechanism, it was found that the H-bond and the pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) were the main forces for BC and MBC to adsorb BPA.

AB This study experimented with the novel approach of using a microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) treatment train to treat the effluent of a primary settling tank at the Inland Empire Utility Agency in Chino, CA. The pilot used polyvinylidene fluoride hollow-fiber MF modules as pretreatment for an RO skid, which used Hydranautics ESPA2 membranes in a two-stage configuration with a feed capacity of 6 gallon per minute (gpm). In this pilot configuration, researchers monitored the removal of 38 most prevalent contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) through the MF/RO process. To investigate how operating the RO process at two fixed recovery rates of 55% and 80% would affect the performance of the MF/RO membranes, researchers applied different fluxes (8, 10, 12 and 14 gal/d/ft(2) (gfd)) and evaluated the removal of CECs in 1-stage and 2-stage RO configurations. The occurrence of CECs in the MF influent, MF effluent, RO permeate, and RO concentrate were analyzed and studied. In the first phase (1-stage the RO process), flux of 14 gfd showed a better rejection value of inorganics (95.2%) when compared with those of other fluxes. Meanwhile, in the second phase (2-stage RO process), flux of 12 gfd showed a better rejection of inorganics (93.7%) when compared with those of other fluxes. Although concentrations of CECs slightly decreased in the RO permeate as the flux has increased, statistical analysis showed no significant differences between different fluxes in terms of CEC rejection.

AB The present study reports the synthesis of metal-free polymeric catalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), through sonochemical method followed by thermal treatment. The synthesized g-C3N4 was characterized using XRD, DRS, FESEM, TGA, EDX, etc. and the characterization results revealed that it possesses medium band-gap energy, high thermal and chemical stability. The photo-activity of the catalyst was also evaluated using degradation of 5-Fluorouracil under different experimental conditions. The results revealed that the addition of H2O2 during sonolysis process did not show any significant synergy. This is attributed to the low vapor pressure of H2O2 that does not allow it to diffuse into the cavitation bubble to produce (OH)-O-center dot radicals through sonolysis process. Using sono-hybrid process, more than 90% degradation was seen within 5 min of treatment with a rate constant of 3.95 x 10(-2) s(-1). In alkaline medium, 5-Fluorouracil degradation occurred through defluorination and subsequently substitution of -OH group to the aromatic ring leading to formation of intermediates such as 2-fluoro-3-oxopropanoic acid and urea. While sono-hybrid advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) helped towards complete mineralization through formation of smaller molecular compounds such as maleic acids, lactic acids, propanol, etc. On the other hand, the maximum synergy effect of similar to 2.4 was seen for sonocatalysis process followed by hybrid-AOPs of (US + g-C3N4 + H2O2 + UVC) with a synergy factor of similar to 2.2. Also, the synthesized catalyst exhibited the same catalytic activity even after 5 runs of sono-photocatalysis process for degradation of 5-Fluorouracil.

AB The use of antibiotics in the dairy farming for curing and growth promotion results in the production of massive quantities of non-recyclable wastewater by the conventional purification techniques. Additionally, waste milk is produced during the drug withholding periods, which is not suitable for human or animal consumption and cause huge economic loss as well as present serious environmental waste. This study was designed to investigate the decomposition of various antibiotic compounds in un-buffered aqueous solutions and milk samples by ozonation process. Commonly administered broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and sulphadiazine were selected as model examples in the current investigation. Gradual exposure of these antibiotics to increasing ozone gas concentration induced increasing removal percentages of the antibiotics in spiked water and milk samples. The removal reached 95% across all the tested treated antibiotics with ozone dose as low as 75 mg L-1. It was noted that the removal of antibiotics in milk samples is more efficient with faster rate constants. This was attributed to the self-buffering characteristic of milk that maintains the neutral pH, keeping the amine groups un-protonated and more reactive towards the electrophilic attack by the molecular ozone. H-1 NMR as well as HPLC experiments support the near complete removal of antibiotics and indicated the break down to simpler and more soluble fragments of acidic nature. Bacterial growth experiments, conducted with E. coil, and milk ageing experiments provided clear evidences that the resulting decomposition byproducts lack both toxicity effect and antimicrobial activity. This study provides a viable route to remove hazardous materials, which contribute to a growing issue of antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria.

AB Recently, lincomycin has been detected frequently in aquatic environment, especially in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. Public concerns have been raised due to its adverse bio-effect and potential of inducing resistance genes. In this study, hydrothermal treatment (HT) was applied to remove lincomycin from high-concentrated pharmaceutical waste water. Influence factors (e.g., temperature, initial concentration and pH) were investigated from kinetics perspective. Meanwhile, degradation byproducts were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), based on that transformation pathways were proposed. Finally, the toxicity of lincomycin degradation intermediates were evaluated by Microcystis cells. The results showed that lincomycin was eliminated efficiently via HT and an obvious lag time existed in its degradation process. An autocatalytic model was developed successfully based on the degradation kinetics analysis. The model showed good fitness with experiments data (R-2 > 0.99). Observed reaction constant (k) increased when reaction temperature varied from 110 to 160 degrees C; it decreased from 0.034 to 0.015 min(-1) as pH ranged from 2.0 to 6.0. Additionally, increasing initial concentration of lincomycin promoted its degradation, while it showed a different trend once the concentration exceeded 300 mg L-1. A total of 7 major intermediates were identified, based on which hydrolysis, hydroxylation and desulfuration were inferred as the mainly evolution processes. Finally, toxicity evaluation indicated that both lincomycin and its degradation byproducts have no inhibition on algal strains. Thus, it is concluded that HT is an efficient method for removing lincomycin.

TI Sorption of Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals, and Herbicides to Biochar in

AB Agricultural practices are increasingly incorporating recycled waste materials, such as biosolids, to provide plant nutrients and enhance soil functions. Although biosolids provide benefits to soil, municipal wastewater treatment plants receive pharmaceuticals and heavy metals that can accumulate in biosolids, and land application of biosolids can transfer these contaminants to the soil. Environmental exposure of these contaminants may adversely affect wildlife, disrupt microbial communities, detrimentally affect human health through long-term exposure, and cause the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study considers the use of biochar co-amendments as sorbents for contaminants from biosolids. The sorption of pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin, triclocarban, triclosan), and heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb) to biochars and biochar-biosolids-soil mixtures was examined. Phenylurea herbicide (monuron, diuron, linuron) sorption was also studied to determine the potential effect of biochar on soil-applied herbicides. A softwood (SW) biochar (510 degrees C) and a walnut shell (WN) biochar (900 degrees C) were used as contrasting biochars to highlight potential differences in biochar reactivity. Kaolinite and activated carbon served as mineral and organic controls. Greater sorption for almost all contaminants was observed with WN biochar over SW biochar. The addition of biosolids decreased sorption of herbicides to SW biochar, whereas there was no observable change with WN biochar. The WN biochar showed potential for reducing agrochemical and contaminant transport but may inhibit the efficacy of soil-applied herbicides. This study provides support for minimizing contaminant mobility from biosolids using biochar as a co-amendment and highlights the importance of tailoring biochars for specific characteristics through feedstock selection and pyrolysis-gasification conditions.

TI Micropollutants removal from retentates generated in ultrafiltration and

AB One important disadvantage of using ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) for reclamation of secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is the necessity to dispose of the UF and NF retentates. Different advanced treatments including coagulation (iron and alum), oxidation (chlorine, permanganate and ozone) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption were compared for their efficiencies in removing 11 selected micropollutants and effluent organic matter (EfOM) from UF and NF retentates generated in the filtration of secondary effluents. Ozone exhibited better micropollutants and UV254 removal efficiencies than chlorine and permanganate. Similar abatement of organics was observed when the same specific oxidant dose was applied to UF and NF retentates. Coagulation preferentially removed high molecular weight compounds, being ineffective for the elimination of most micropollutants. In general terms, iron coagulation was more efficient than alum, since iron achieved higher DOC and UV254 removal at lower molar doses. In addition, PAC was an effective method for removing micropollutants, especially hydrophobic and aromatic compounds. The hybrid coagulation/ozonation process improved micropollutants and EfOM (DOC and UV254) removal. A specific ozone dose of 1 mg O-3 mg DOC-1 was able to almost completely remove selected micropollutants from the UF retentate. The final effluent, which is likely more biodegradable and less toxic, could be recirculated to biological treatment processes in the WWTP, avoiding the continuous discharge of non-biodegradable micropollutants through the WWTP effluents.

AB In line with the Directive 2013/39/EU the most representative surface waters, regarding pharmaceuticals contamination, were selected based on a Portuguese nationwide monitoring exercise. To meet this purpose, and given that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as the major point sources of pharmaceuticals environmental contamination, the occurrence, fate and environmental risk assessment (ERA) of eleven of the most consumed pharmaceuticals, belonging to several therapeutic classes were assessed in 15 WWTPs (influents (WWIs) and effluents (WWEs)), from five different regions during one year (4 sampling campaigns).
   Results showed that all samples were contaminated with at least 1, and up to 8 from the 11 targeted pharmaceuticals. The highest concentrations observed were 150 and 33 mu g L-1 for WWI and WWE, respectively.
   Regarding temporal and spacial influence, winter, Alentejo, Algarve and Center regions presented higher mass loads. The ERA posed by 7 of the selected pharmaceuticals presented a risk quotient higher than 1 to the three trophic levels. Our findings highlighted that the rivers Mondego, Tagus, Ave, Trancao, Fervenca and Xarrama should be selected as surface water monitoring stations.
   This study gives a good overview on pharmaceuticals contamination in WWTPs and its impact on surface waters in Portugal. Thus, a more integrative approach to rank and prioritize pharmaceuticals, based on an integrated assessment of ERA and exposure of surface water, was provided to support the future selection of the 6 most representative monitoring stations in Portugal, as required by the above mentioned directive.

AB Physiological responses to, and recovery from, exposure to 3 concentrations of a pharmaceutical mixture (diclofenac and propranolol) were examined experimentally in Baltic Sea blue mussels Mytilus edulis trossulus collected with increasing distance to a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) outlet. Respiration, absorption efficiency and consumption were measured, and also combined into scope for growth (SFG). The response and recovery patterns varied both between exposure concentrations and sampling site within the bay. After exposure, mussels exposed to the highest concentration (2000 mu g l(-1)) in general had lower SFG, and mussels from 2 (out of 3) sites exposed to the medium concentration (200 mu g l(-1)) had higher SFG than the controls. In general, mussels from the 2 sites nearest the WTP recovered from the exposure response, while individuals collected further from the WTP outlet were more affected by the exposure and did not recover to the same extent. The response pattern of consumption was mainly affected by exposure concentration, whereas respiration was affected by all 3 factors (concentration, time of measurement, sampling site). Absorption efficiency was not affected at all. The differences in responses and recovery patterns could possibly be explained by the mussels sampled closer to the WTP having a history of higher food availability, improving their general health status, and/or a history of pre-exposure to natural disturbances, as well as to the test substances, via the WTP effluent. Pre-exposure to stressors could have both positive and negative impact on a community by increasing the resilience towards some stressors, but may also reduce the adaptability when facing other stressors.

AB Synthetic progestogens represent a class of pharmaceuticals widely used in oral contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapies. They reach the aquatic environment through wastewater effluents; however, environmental concentrations and effects on non-target organisms are poorly known. Given the important role of progestogens regulating fish spawning processes, this study aimed at assessing the in vitro interference of four currently used progestogens-drospirenone (DRO), levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone (NOR) and cyproterone acetate (CPA) - with key enzymatic activities involved in the synthesis of active steroids in carp (Cyprinus carpio). The enzymatic pathways investigated were (a) CYP17 (C17,20-Iyase) and CYP11 beta involved in the synthesis of androgens, (b) CYP19 that catalyses the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, and (c) 2013-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (2013-HSD) responsible for the synthesis of maturation-inducing hormones. All tested progestogens significantly inhibited the synthesis of androgens: DRO (IC50: 3.8 mu M) was the strongest inhibitor of CYP17 followed by CPA (IC50s: 183 mu M). Moreover, NOR (IC50: 0.4 mu M), DRO (IC50: 1.8 mu M) and CPA (IC50s: 87 mu M) inhibited CYP11 beta. An inhibition by NOR of ovarian CYP19 activity, and by DRO and CPA of 2013-HSD was also observed, but at rather high concentrations (500 mu M). Overall, this study highlights the potential of synthetic progestogens, and particularly DRO and NOR, to interfere with the biosynthesis of androgens in carp gonads. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are a contaminant of emerging concern throughout the world, including developing countries where centralized water and wastewater treatment plants are not common. In developing countries, household scale water treatment technologies such as the biosand filter (BSF) are used to improve drinking water quality. No studies currently exist on the ability of the BSF to remove EDCs. In this experiment, the BSF was evaluated for the removal of three EDCs, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and 17-ethinyl estradiol (EE2). Removal results were compared to the slow sand filter (SSF) from the literature, which is similar to the BSF in principal but comparisons have revealed differences in removal of other water quality parameters between SSF and BSF. In general, the BSF minimally removed the compounds from spiked lake water as removal was less than 15% for all three compounds, though mass removal much higher than other studies in which the SSF was used. Household bleach was added to the rate was BSF effluent as suggested in order to achieve different Cl- concentrations (0.67, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0mg/L) and subsequent removal of EDCs by oxidation was examined. Concentrations were reduced > 98% for all compounds when the Cl- concentration was greater than 5mg/L. Removal efficiency was > 50% at the 0.67mg/L Cl- concentration, while almost 70% removal was observed for all compounds at the 2.0mg/L Cl- concentration.

AB Improving the adsorption speed and capacity of adsorbents is essential for the removal of antibiotic pollutants in water. Herein, hierarchical porous biochars (OHPBCs) with an ultrahigh specific surface area and an effectively adjustable pore structure were prepared using a waste, onion skin, by a facile chemical activation strategy. The as-prepared OHPBC-5 exhibited the maximum specific surface area of 3787.6 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 1.95 cm(3) g(-1). OHPBC-5 presented a rapid adsorption equilibrium (within 10 min), and the maximum adsorption capacities towards ofloxacin (OFL) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) were 1134.76 and 1281.25 mg g(-1), respectively. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir isotherm model were suitable for analyzing the adsorption process of OHPBC-5 to OFL and SDZ, indicating that the adsorption of OFL and SDZ on OHPBC-5 was the chemisorption on homogenous surface. Besides, OHPBC-5 provided a wide applicable pH range and ionic strength concentration. Furthermore, the removal mechanism of OFL and SDZ was analyzed and discussed systematically. More importantly, OHPBC-5 could be regenerated and reused three times without significant reduction in its adsorption capacity. OHPBC-5 also showed highly efficient adsorption performance for tetracycline (exceeded 900 mg g(-1)) and macrolide (exceeded 500 mg g(-1)) antibiotics. And it also maintained a high removal efficiency in real river water environment. This study can provide a reference for the preparation of high-efficiency adsorbents from waste biomass for wastewater treatment.

AB As important emerging contaminants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most intensively prescribed pharmaceuticals introduced to drinking water due to their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment. While concentrations of NSAIDs in drinking water are generally low, they have been attracting increasing concern as a result of their disinfection byproducts (DBPs) generated in drinking water disinfection. In this work, detection methods were set up for four representative indole-derivative NSAIDs (indomethacin, acemetacin, sulindac, and etodolac) using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadruple mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-tqMS). ESI+ was better for detection of indomethacin and sulindac, whereas ESI- was suitable to detection of acemetacin and etodolac. With optimized MS parameters, the instrument detection and quantitation limits of the four indole derivatives were achieved to be 1.1-24.6 ng/L and 3.7-41.0 ng/L, respectively. During chlorination, indomethacin and acemetacin could undergo five major reaction types (chlorine substitution, hydrolysis, decarboxylation, C-C coupling, and C-N cleavage) to form a series of DBPs, among which 19 were proposed/identified with structures. Based on the revealed structures of DBPs, transformation pathways of indomethacin and acemetacin in chlorination were partially elucidated. Notably, individual and mixture toxicity of indomethacin and acemetacin before/after chlorination were evaluated using a well-established acute toxicity assessment and a Hep G2 cell cytotoxicity assay, respectively. Results showed that the predicted acute toxicity of a few chlorination DBPs were higher than their precursors; chlorination substantially enhanced the mixture cytotoxicity of indomethacin by over 10 times and slightly increased the mixture cytotoxicity of acemetacin.

AB The sustainable development of human activities is directly related to the protection of the environment by lowering the anthropogenic stress. Pharmaceuticals - due to their growing consumption (use in medicine. veterinary, animal production, cosmetics) and their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants - are classified as a group of new and rapidly emerging pollutants which have been proven to have a negative impact onto water organisms. In order to ensure the proper protection of human health and the environment there is an urgent necessity of determining pharmaceuticals in clinical. cosmetic, food and environmental samples. Gas (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are valuable techniques for such determination, especially when they are coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS; LC-MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS; LC-MS/MS). The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of sustainability features of analytical techniques in the light of necessity to determine trace amounts of pharmaceuticals in the aforementioned different matrices. Using the Delphi method we performed an analysis of the key sources of the competitive advantages of the application of GC and GC-MS techniques for determining the pharmaceutical residue in clinical, cosmetic. food and environmental samples - compared to techniques based on HPLC or LC-MS. The analysis covered the following areas: (i) the features of the technique, (ii) the price. and (iii) the applicability in various sectors of economy.

AB With the increasing use of treated wastewater and biosolids in agriculture, residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in these reused resources may contaminate food produce via plant uptake, constituting a route for human exposure. Although various PPCPs have been reported to be taken up by plants in laboratories or under field conditions, at present little information is available on their metabolism in plants. In this study, we applied carrot cell cultures to investigate the plant metabolism of PPCPs. Five phase I metabolites of carbamazepine were identified and the potential metabolism pathways of carbamazepine were proposed. We also used the carrot cell cultures as a rapid screening tool to initially assess the metabolism potentials of 18 PPCPs. Eleven PPCPs, including acetaminophen, caffeine, meprobamate, primidone, atenolol, trimethoprim, DEET, carbamazepine, dilantin, diazepam, and triclocarban, were found to be recalcitrant to metabolism. The other 7 PPCPs, including triclosan, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, sulfamethoxazole, and atorvastatin, displayed rapid metabolism, with 0.4-47.3% remaining in the culture at the end of the experiment. Further investigation using glycosidase hydrolysis showed that 13-20.6% of initially spiked naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil were transformed into glycoside conjugates. Results from this study showed that plant cell cultures may be a useful tool for initially exploring the potential metabolites of PPCPs in plants as well as for rapidly screening the metabolism potentials of a variety of PPCPs or other emerging contaminants, and therefore may be used for prioritizing compounds for further comprehensive evaluations.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals have been reported in wastewater effluent at the nanogram to low microgram-per-liter range, and include bupropion (BUP), fluoxetine (FLX), sertraline (SER), and venlafaxine (VEN). To assess the effects of antidepressants on reproductive anatomy, physiology, and behavior, adult male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 21 days either to a single concentration of the antidepressants FLX, SER. VEN, or BUP, or to an antidepressant mixture. The data demonstrated that exposure to VEN (305 ng/L and 1104 ng/L) and SER (5.2 ng/L) resulted in mortality. Anatomical alterations were noted within the testes of fish exposed to SER and FLX, both modulators of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Additionally, FLX at 28 ng/L induced vitellogenin in male fish a common endpoint for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Significant alterations in male secondary sex characteristics were noted with single exposures. Effects of single compound exposures neither carried over, nor became additive in the antidepressant mixtures, and reproductive behavior was not affected. Analysis of brain tissues from the exposed fish suggested increased uptake of FLX, SER and BUP and minimal uptake of VEN when compared to exposure water concentrations. Furthermore, the only metabolite detected consistently in the brain tissues was norfluoxetine. Similar trends of uptake by brain tissue were observed when fish were exposed to antidepressant mixtures. The present study demonstrates that anatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants. The observation that antidepressant uptake into fish tissues is selective may have consequences on assessing the mode-of-action and effects of these compounds in future studies.

AB In this study the interactions between toxicity removals and Kemicetine, COD removals, intermediate products of Kemicetine and COD components (CODs originating from slowly degradable organics, readily degradable organics, inert microbial products and from the inert compounds) were investigated in a sequential anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR)/aerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system with a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The total COD and Kemicetine removal efficiencies were 98% and 100%, respectively, in the sequential ABR/CSTR systems. 2-Amino-1 (p-nitrophenil)-1,3 propanediol, 1-p-amino phenyl, p-amino phenol and phenol were detected in the ABR as the main readily degradable inter-metabolites. In the anaerobic ABR reactor, the Kemicetin was converted to corresponding inter-metabolites and a substantial part of the COD was removed. In the aerobic CSTR reactor the intermetabolites produced in the anaerobic reactor were completely removed and the COD remaining from the anerobic reactor was biodegraded. It was found that the COD originating from the readily degradable organics did not limit the anaerobic degradation process, while the CODs originating from the slowly degradable organics and from the inert microbial products significantly decreased the anaerobic ABR reactor performance. The acute toxicity test results indicated that the toxicity decreased from the influent to the effluent of the aerobic CSTR reactor. The ANOVA test statistics showed that there was a strong linear correlation between acute toxicity, CODs originating from the slowly degradable organics and inert microbial products. A weak correlation between acute toxicity and CODs originating from the inert compounds was detected. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), an emerging class of highly recalcitrant water contaminants, have raised considerable concerns in environment community. Graphitic carbon nitride (CN) has shown a great potential towards the photodegradation of water contaminants under visible light irradiation. However, the conventional bulk CN (BCN) presents the amorphous structure, resulting in an inefficient yield of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) for the complete mineralization of PPCPs. This study provides fundamental insights into significantly enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation via improving the crystallinity of the pristine CN materials. Experimental measurements and accompanying density functional theory (DFT) computational analysis suggest that the crystalline carbon nitride (CCN) exhibited an enhanced adsorption ability towards the dissolved O-2. Upon the light irradiation, the adsorbed O-2 molecules readily undergo a direct two-electron reduction reaction on the CCN surface, instead of the conventional two successive single-electron reduction reactions on the BCN surface, to produce H2O2 subsequently converting into center dot OH radicals. Along with the improved charge separation efficiency and electron transfer ability, CCN-based materials show superior photocatalytic activity towards PPCPs-type pollutants, compared with the pristine BCN catalysts. Importantly, the catalyst show excellent photodegradation activities under natural sunlight irradiation, at low PPCPs concentration (20 mu g/L), in the mixed PPCPs solution or in the real wastewater/water samples, indicating the potential of CCN to enable practical ex situ destructive treatment of PPCPs-contaminated groundwater.

AB In this study, the spatial and temporal-distribution of 41-multiclass organic compounds were assessed in three estuaries of the Basque Country, from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab (active) sampling methods and an extra campaign combining both, grab and passive sampling methods. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were also evaluated to assess their impact on the estuaries. Moreover, the physicochemical features (phosphate and nitrate concentrations, pH, etc.) of each site were measured and included in the statistical analysis. Anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and acetaminophen), hypertensive drugs (irbesartan and valsartan), a stimulant (caffeine), an artificial sweetener (acesulfame) and a corrosion inhibitor (2-hydroxybenzothiazole) were the most ubiquitous compounds. Due to the stratification of the waters in the estuary of Bilbao two independent sources were identified: WWTP and harbour activities. In the case of Gernika and Plentzia, both are estuaries with a high tidal dilution, and the main sources were localized in the effluents of the WWTPs. In addition to this, the use of POCIS provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long sampling period. Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined at each estuary and WWTP effluent for acute and chronic effects. In the case of acute toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were obtained for the angiotensin II receptor blockers (telmisartan, eprosartan, etc.), diuron and diclofenac. In the case of the chronic toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were estimated for caffeine, diclofenac, bezafibrate and sulfadiazine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic micropollutants enter effluent streams and then flow into receiving waters. The volume adversely affects aquatic biota substantially. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop methods for their elimination. The aim of this study was the removal of organic micropollutants with different properties from WWTP (wastewater treatment plant) effluent in fixed bed columns packed with several combinations of sand, granular activated carbon (GAC), and granular clay-carbonaceous composite. Two types of bentonite-powder activated carbon-based granules (Ben-AC) were prepared within this work, with different calcination temperature. It was found that higher calcination temperature enhanced the surface porosity and adsorption potential versus studied micropollutants due to dihydroxylation resulting in higher chemical activity. Introduction of these granules in the place of GAC in a fixed bed column enhances the removal degree of micropollutants and typical water quality parameters. For example, the reduction degree of color, phosphate, and nitrate concentrations increased from 83%, 69%, and 4% to 95%, 83%, and 24% for column I and II, respectively. The concentration of carbamazepine, octylphenol, nononylphenol, and anthracene was reduced by 75%, 83%, 72%, 99% in column I, while using column II or III their removal was: 86%, 97%, 99%, 99%, respectively. Independent of the column filling, the removal of carbamazepine was the lowest (75-86%), while the highest retention was obtained for anthracene (99%). The study of column performance in the treatment of effluent in time showed that column filled with Ben-AC-400 guaranteed high removal degree in the operating time. The batch adsorption data were better described by both the Langmuir model.

AB Caffeine, a widely found component in food and pharmaceuticals, is harmful to ecosystem when discharged into the environment because of its non-eco-friendly nature and recalcitrant properties. Complete caffeine degradation by methanogenesis was successful for the first time in a man-made bioreactor. We confirmed the success through continuously operating a bioreactor, testing the methane potential and determining the kinetic behaviour. In the continuous operation, an 87.5 +/- 5.3% removal efficiency of caffeine was observed using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor for the digestion of coffee processing wastewater in the long-term process. In methane potential tests with caffeine as the sole substrate, the complete conversion from caffeine to CH4 was achieved in a caffeine-rich environment with a caffeine concentration up to 2000 mg/L. We have proposed and confirmed a reaction equation for the caffeine degradation by methanogenesis based on the stoichiometric relationship between the degraded caffeine and the increased end-products: CH4, NH4+-N and CO2. In the kinetic behaviour experiment, the regular monitoring the residual caffeine and the end-products indicated that methanogenic degradation of caffeine clearly includes two major steps: caffeine converting to intermediates and the intermediates converting to CH4. The major accumulated intermediates should be hydrolysis products and the process of hydrolysis products converting to volatile fatty acids was identified to be the rate-limiting step of caffeine degradation. This work provided a new thought to microbial caffeine degradation and will be useful in developing innovative technology for bioenergy harvest at the same time of decaffeination.

AB The effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been extensively reused for various purposes in many regions of the world, including landscape and agricultural irrigation. However, the elimination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in conventional WWTPs is not complete and consequently they may be present in effluent which, can be used for soil irrigation. This work discusses the efficiency of electro based processes, applied to soil slurry aiming PPCPs removal. Three different cell designs were tested, with three-, two-and one-compartment(s) (3C-, 2C- and 1C-cell, respectively). In the case of the 3C- and 2C-cells, ion exchange membranes were used for compartment division. Three PPCPs with different physical and chemical characteristics were studied: bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) and oxybenzone (MBPh). All experiments were carried out for 3 days with a current density of 0.02 mA cm (2). After the electro based experiments, 44%-100% of the three contaminants were removed (mobilized and/or degraded) from the soil slurry. The highest removal rates (> 83%) were achieved for BPA and EE2. BPA and MBPh were mainly mobilized towards an anode compartment, whereas EE2 was mainly degraded. Among all the tested cell designs, 1C-cell showed a broader range to contaminants removal from soil through electrodegradation. The 1C-cell also presents the main advantage of degrading the PPCPs of removing and accumulating them in another compartment, where degradation might not occur. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ozonation is a promising technology for the treatment of biorefractory compounds. Parabens belong to a chemical family of apparently innocuous preservatives that have been used in the food and cosmetic industries for several years. Oxidation of different parabens, such as methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and butylparaben (BP), was carried out using. O-3 in ultrapure water. A design of experiments procedure-has, been, carried out in order to optimize the ozonation,process as well as to study the interaction between the studied variables: pH and temperature (T). In addition to the application of the single ozonation, ozone-combined processes were studied under the optimal conditions obtained for O-3 (namely, pH 8 and T = 20 degrees C). The tested processes were O-3/Fenton, O-3/H(2)Q(2),.O-3/UV, O-3/UV/H2O2, O-3/photo-Fenton, O-3/UV/TiO2, and O-3/UV/TiO2/H2O2. According to the experimental results, single ozonation is a more effective treatment than O-3-/H2O2 and O-3/Fenton processes. In addition, the introduction of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation results, in all cases, in a faster and more efficient removal of the parabens, because of the contribution of ozone photolysis to the radical-mediated pathway. The most efficient method for the degradation of these emerging, pollutants was O-3/UV/TiO2/H2O2. The influence of different aqueous matrices (namely, ultrapure water, river water, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and reservoir water) on the removal of the target pollutants has been analyzed:The direct ozonation pathway is the predominant degradation mechanism and a remarkable synergistic effect of bicarbonate ions has been demonstrated.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) are from the group of pharmaceutical and personal care products known to be persistent and non-biodegradable in wastewater treatment. Adsorptive removal of CBZ and DTZ using superparamagnetic iron oxide (magnetite, Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs), along with those coated with either methacrylic acid (MAA), Al (OH)(3), or SiO2 were evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyzes revealed that the NPs were about 10 nm in diameter. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the presence of carboxyl group on MAA-coated NPs, and hydroxyl group on alumina-and silica-coated NPs. Results suggest that the major fraction of the drugs is adsorbed by the NPs in about 6-8 h. Maximum DTZ adsorption capacities (based on Freundlich isotherm) of MAA-, Al(OH)(3)-, and SiO2-coated NPs (112.46, 82.20, and 90.48 mg/g, respectively) were much higher than that of the uncoated NPs (66.17 mg/g). Based on batch adsorption studies, an optimal adsorption condition was proposed, i.e. CBZ and DTZ concentration of 100 mu g/L, 0.05 g of NPs, adjusted pH of 8, and exposure time of 7 h. At this condition, the maximum adsorption of CBZ was about 32.7, 47.3, 51.1, and 50.2% with uncoated, MAA-coated, Al(OH)(3)-coated, and SiO2-coated NPs, respectively. The equivalent removal for DTZ by the NPs was at 44.3, 52.8, 60.6, and 38.1%, respectively. Further desorption studies revealed that about 85.56 and 78.00% of adsorbed CBZ and DTZ can be readily released from Al(OH) 3- and MAA-coated NPs, respectively.

AB Pharmaceutical industries are amongst the foremost contributor to industrial waste. Ecological well-being is endangered owing to its facile discharge. In the present study, heavy metals and organic contaminants in waste water were characterized using atomic absorption spectrophotometer and GC-MS, respectively. Mutagenicity and genotoxic potential of pharmaceutical waste water were investigated through bacterial reverse mutation assay and in vitro comet assay, respectively. Ames test and comet assay of first sample were carried out at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 % v/v effluent with distilled water. Chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) were found in high concentrations as compared to WHO- and EPA-recommended maximum limits. Arsenic was found to be the most abundant metal and its maximum concentration was 0.8 mg.L-1. GC-MS revealed the presence of lignocaine, digitoxin, trimethoprim, caffeine, and vitamin E in waste water. Dose-dependent decrease in mutagenic index was observed in both strains. Substantial increase in mutagenicity was observed for TA-100, when assay was done by incorporating an enzyme activation system, whereas a slight increase was detected for TA-102. In vitro comet assay of waste water exhibited decrease in damage index and percentage fragmentation with the increase in dilution of waste water. Tail length also decreased with an increase in the dilution factor of waste water. These findings suggest that pharmaceutical waste water being a mix of different heavy metals and organic contaminants may have a potent mutagenic and genotoxic effect on exposed living organisms.

AB Sulfamethoxazole is a common antibiotic that is frequently detected in wastewater and surface water. This study investigated the biodegradation and metabolic pathway of sulfamethoxazole by Pseudomonas psychrophila HA-4, a cold-adapted bacterium. Strain HA-4, which uses sulfamethoxazole as its sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated at a low temperature (10 A degrees C) and identified as P. psychrophila by physico-biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strain HA-4 removed sulfamethoxazole at temperatures ranging from 5.0 A degrees C to 30 A degrees C, with the maximal removal rate at 10 A degrees C. The maximal removal rate of sulfamethoxazole by strain HA-4 was 34.30 % after 192 h at 10 A degrees C. The highest percentage of unsaturated fatty acid was determined to be 23.03 % at 10 A degrees C, which adheres to the characteristic for cold-adapted psychrophiles and psychrotrophs. At low concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, the growth kinetics correlated well with the Haldane model. The single-substrate parameter values of sulfamethoxazole on cell growth were determined to be mu (max) = 0.01 h(-1), K (s) = 20.91 mg/l and K (i) = 170.60 mg/l. Additionally, the major intermediates from sulfamethoxazole biodegradation by strain HA-4, including aniline, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, 4-aminothiophenol and sulfanilamide, were identified by GC-MS and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) analysis. The results demonstrate that strain HA-4 has the potential to degrade sulfamethoxazole at low temperatures.

AB We determined whether or not the chloramination or ozonation of amines and hydrazines listed in Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) results in the formation of N-nitrosamines when reacted in secondary wastewater effluent. We selected 12 primary, 2 secondary, 2 tertiary amines and 3 hydrazines from the PRTRs of Japan, the USA, and Korea. In this study, based on the assumption that there is a production of N-nitrosamines by not only the original selected amines and hydrazines but also-the intermediate products in case of chloramination and ozonation, it was examined whether precursors were identified by selected amines and hydrazines based on the gap of the N-nitrosamines formation potential between day 0 and day 10 rather than analyzing the contribution depending on the concentration of selected amines and hydrazines. Many of the primary amines (notably 2,6-xylidine) and all of the secondary and tertiary amines produced N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by chloramination. Furthermore, the primary amines 2,6-xylidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4-aminoazobenzene, p-chloroaniline, and p-cresidine produced more NDMA than did the secondary amines. The secondary amines produced mainly NDMA. Ozonation produced NDMA only from the hydrazine 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, and at a higher concentration than by chloramination. We identified 2,6-xylidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4-aminoazobenzene, p-chloroaniline, p-cresidine, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, diethylamine, 4,4'-methylenebis(N,N-dimethyl)benzenamine, and chinomethionat as warranting further study.

AB Chemical degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) amitriptyline hydrochloride, methyl salicylate, and 2-phenoxyethanol by means of several advanced oxidation processes, including 254 nm UV radiation and Fenton's reagent, has been studied in different water matrixes, such as ultrapure (UP) and surface waters and two secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants. The influence of the operating variables on the elimination of these compounds in UP water was established, and kinetic parameters for their degradation, such as quantum yields along a pH range of 3-11 and second-order rate constants for their oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, were determined. Specifically, for the reactions of oxidation of the three PPCPs with hydroxyl radicals, the use of a competition kinetic model in Fenton's reagent experiments allowed evaluation of their rate constants, whose values were (10.3 +/- 0.3) X 10(9) M-1.s(-1) for amitriptyline hydrochloride, (7.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(9)M(-1).s(-1) for methyl salicylate, and (4.3 +/- 0.1) X 10(9) M-1.s(-1) for 2-phenoxyethanol. Furthermore, the simultaneous oxidation of these selected PPCPs in three different water systems (surface water from a reservoir and two secondary effluents) was studied, and the influence of the operating conditions on the removal efficiency was established. Finally, a kinetic model was proposed for the prediction of the elimination of these compounds by UV radiation and a UV/H2O2 system in these water matrixes, with theoretical results that agreed well with the experimental ones.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of medium-pressure I imps in the direct and indirect photodegradation of tetracyclines (TCs). We conducted a kinetic study of the process, determining the quantum yield for three tetracyclines (tetracycline, chlorotetracycline and oxytetracycline). We also analyzed the influence of different operational variables, such as: initial concentration; solution pH; presence of natural organic matter (NOM); the chemical composition of water, using ultrapure water (UW), surface water (SW), groundwater (GW), and wastewater (WW); the behavior of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, and the system toxicity during TCs photodegradation The results obtained shown that medium-pressure mercury lamp radiation is effective for the photooxidation of TCs in aqueous phase, mainly when these are at low concentrations. The rate constants obtained indicate that the photodegradation is pH-dependent and favored at pH 10 regardless of the tetracycline considered. The presence of H2O2 in the medium substantially increased the TC degradation rate and considerably reduced the time required to degrade 100% of the initial TC concentration. The TC photooxidation rate was higher in natural waters than in ultrapure water, attributable to the presence of dissolved organic matter, which can act as a photosensitizer, thereby favoring indirect TC degradation through the formation of radical species such as HO center dot. TOC values at the end of the treatment indicated that the percentage mineralization is a function of the initial TC concentration. The medium toxicity increased at the beginning of TC photooxidation, and treatment times of around 60 min are generally required for the toxicity to be lower than in the original solution.

AB Tetracyclines (TCs) are a group of widely used antibiotics that have been frequently found in the aquatic environment. The potential reactions of TCs with common water disinfection oxidants such as chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and free available chlorine (FAC) have not been studied in depth and are the focus of this study. The oxidation kinetics of tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline and iso-chlorotetracycline by CLO2 and FAC are very rapid (with large apparent second-order rate constants k(app) = 2.24 x 10(5)-1.26 x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) with ClO2 and k(app) = 1.12 x 10(4)-1.78 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) with FAC at pH 7.0) and highly dependent on pH. Species-specific rate constants are obtained by kinetic modeling that incorporates pH-speciation of TCs and the oxidants (for FAC), and reveal that TCs primarily react with ClO2 and FAC by their unprotonated dimethylamino group and deprotonated phenolic-diketone group. The modest difference in reactivity among the four TCs toward the oxidants is consistent with expectation and can be explained by structural influences on the two reactive moieties. Product evaluation shows that oxidation of TCs by ClO2 leads to (hydr)oxylation and breakage of TC molecules, while oxidation of TCs by FAC leads to chlorinated and (hydr)oxylated products without any substantial ring breakage. Results of this study indicate that rapid transformation of TCs by oxidants such as ClO2 and FAC under water and wastewater treatment conditions can be expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Synthetic musk fragrances are common personal care product additives and wastewater contaminants that are routinely detected in the environment. This study examines the presence of eight synthetic musk fragrances [7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN), 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyran (HHCB), 5-acetyl-1,1,2,6-tetramethyl- 3-iso-propylindane (ATII), 4-acetyl-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butylindane (ADBI), 6-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindane (AHMI), 6,7-dihydro-1,1,2,3,3,-pentamethyl-4-(5H)-indanone (DPMI), 1-tert-butyl- 3,5-dimethyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (musk xylene), and 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitro-2,6-dimethylacetophenone (musk ketone)] in source water and the removal of these compounds as they flow through a Midwestern conventional drinking water plant with lime softening. The compounds were measured in water, waste sludge, and air throughout the plant. HHCB and AHTN were detected in 100% of the samples and at the highest concentrations. A mass balance on HHCB and AHTN was performed under warm and cold weather conditions. The total removal efficiency for HHCB and AHTN, which averaged between 67-89%, is dominated by adsorption to water softener sludge and its consequent removal by sludge wasting and media filtration. Volatilization, chlorine disinfection, and the disposal of backwash water play a minor role in the removal of both compounds. As a result of inefficient overall removal, HHCB and AHTN are a constant presence at low levels in finished drinking water.

AB The main objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the decomposition and mineralization of nitroimidazoles (Metronidazole [MNZ], Dimetridazole [DMZ], and Tinidazole [TNZ]) in waste and drinking water using gamma irradiation; (2) to study the decomposition kinetics of these nitroimidazoles; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy of nitroimidazole removal using radical promoters and scavengers. The results obtained showed that nitroimidazole concentrations decreased with increasing absorbed dose. No differences in irradiation kinetic constant were detected for any nitroimidazole studied (0.0014-0.0017 Gy(-1)). The decomposition yield was higher under acidic conditions than in neutral and alkaline media. Results obtained showed that, at appropriate concentrations, H2O2 accelerates MNZ degradation by generating additional HO center dot; however, when the dosage Of H2O2 exceeds the optimal concentration, the efficacy of MNZ degradation is reduced. The presence of t-BuOH (HO center dot radical scavenger) and thiourea (HO center dot, H-center dot and e(aq)(-) scavenger) reduced the MNZ irradiation rate, indicating that degradation of this pollutant can take place via two pathways: oxidation by HO center dot radicals and reduction by e(aq)(-) and H-center dot. MNZ removal rate was slightly lower in subterranean and surface waters than in ultrapure water and was markedly lower in wastewater. Regardless of the water chemical composition, MNZ gamma irradiation can achieve i) a decrease in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon, and ii) a reduction in the toxicity of the system with higher gamma absorbed dose.

AB There is an increasing trend to require more efficient use of water resources, both in urban and rural environments. A major mechanism that can be used to achieve greater efficiencies is the reuse of water that once would have been discarded into the environment after use. The reuse of water for agricultural irrigation is often viewed as a positive means of recycling water due to the potential large volumes of water that can be used. Recycled water can have the advantage of being a constant, reliable water source and reduces the amount of water extracted from the environment. In addition, in some cases treatment requirements may be need to be less than for water used in an urban environment due to less potential human contact. There are concerns and unknowns, however, about the impact of the quality of the recycled water, both on the crop itself and on the end users of the crops. Water quality issues that can create real or perceived problems in agriculture include nutrient and sodium concentrations, heavy metals, and the presence of contaminants such as human and animal pathogens, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors. Social attitudes to the use of crops that have been irrigated with recycled waters and the resulting impact on market value of crops are also a major consideration. This paper will discuss the benefits from using different types of recycled water and outline the current knowledge and opinions relating to risks such as water quality issues.

AB The rejection of emerging trace organics by a variety of commercial reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), and ultra-low-pressure RO (ULPRO) membranes was investigated using TFC-HR, NF-90, NF-200, TFC-SR2, and XLE spiral membrane elements (Koch Membrane Systems, Wilmington, Massachusetts) to simulate operational conditions for drinking-water treatment and wastewater reclamation. In general, the presence of effluent organic matter (EfOM) improved the rejection of ionic organics by tight NF and RO membranes, as compared to a type-II water matrix (adjusted by ionic strength and hardness), likely as a result of a decreased negatively charged membrane surface. Rejection of ionic pharmaceutical residues and pesticides exceeded 95 % by NF-90, XLE, and TFC-HR membranes and was above 89 % for the NF-200 membrane. Hydrophobic nonionic compounds, such as bromoform and chloroform, exhibited a high initial rejection, as a result of both hydrophobic-hydrophobic solute-membrane interactions and steric exclusion, but rejection decreased significantly after 10 hours of operation because of partitioning of solutes through the membranes. This resulted in a partial removal of disinfection byproducts by the RO membrane TFC-HR. In a type-II water matrix, the effect of increasing feed water recoveries on rejection of hydrophilic ionic and nonionic compounds was compound-dependent and not consistent for different membranes. The presence of EfOM, however, could neutralize the effect of hydrodynamic operating condition on rejection performance. The ULPRO and tight NF membranes were operated at lower feed pressure, as compared to the TFC-HR, and provided a product water quality similar to a conventional RO membrane, regarding trace organics of interest.

AB Biopolymer-based particles may be prepared using a soft-template method. Surfactants are among the most popular soft templates, but synthetic surfactants may be toxic or hazardous for humans and the environment. In this research, for the first time, natural surfactants were used to prepare spherical and doughnut-like particles. Two different powder types were prepared with the use of kraft lignin and natural extracts, which were derived from Saponaria officinalis L. and soap nuts of the Sapindus mukorossi tree, which contain saponins as surface active agents. A detailed characterization of the synthesized bio-based spheres was made with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, dispersion analysis (PSD, PdI), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, determination of porous structure parameters (low-temperature N2 sorption), elemental analysis (EA) and thermal stability analysis (TGA/DTG). Moreover, their sorption abilities with respect to pharmaceutically active cetirizine dihydrochloride (as reference compound) was tested. The adsorption efficiency around 90% for both materials was observed at pH 6.2 with the concentration of 10 mg/L of an active compound. Moreover, the equilibrium was reached after 240 min and it was concluded, that material prepared with the use of Sapindus mukorossi extract is a more efficient sorbent. The use of natural precursors may reduce environmental hazards and unnecessary waste, and the prepared particles may find future applications as novel eco-friendly materials, for example as adsorbents of harmful substances and in enzyme immobilization.

AB Non-negligible concentrations of chemicals products are often contained in worldwide wastewaters. Although they can be eco-toxic, they are generally poorly removed in water treatment plants. Their accumulation in the environment has become a crucial problem since they present a serious risk to the flora and the fauna. An important fraction of these molecules are pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, diclofenac -anti-inflammatory drugs, carbamazepine, and diazepam - anti epileptic medications. Their adsorption onto clay minerals and particularly on kaolinite offers an efficient and cheap perspective for wastewaters depollution. In this work, we investigated the adsorption mechanisms and the eventual competition of these molecules on kaolinite by means of density functional theory calculations. We show that these compounds adsorb more favorably than water on the kaolinite (001) basal aluminol-terminated surface mainly through hydrogen, 7C, and London interactions. The most strongly adsorbed molecule on kaolinite is paracetamol, with an adsorption energy of -159.4 kJ.mol(-1), while the less strongly adsorbed is diazepam, with an adsorption energy of -96.8 kJ. mol(-1). This latter is only adsorbed by means of dispersion interactions. Also, we show that the adsorption of these molecules on kaolinite presents no risk of generating toxic by-products and that, by heating the clay to 360 K, all these compounds can be desorbed, which demonstrates the regenerability of the material. Hence, kaolinite is an interesting and cheap candidate for pharmaceutical compounds removal from wastewaters. In addition, we unravel the mechanisms of adsorption of these molecules, offering a better understanding of the chemicals adsorption on a common clay mineral.

AB The issue of protecting aquatic ecosystems from biologically active compounds (BACs) such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals detected in aquatic environments at low concentrations has become urgent. Presently, literature provides much information about BACs that at low concentrations cause significant damage to hydrobionts, but a physicochemical explanation for these phenomena has appeared only relatively recently. Experimental findings have shown that diluted aqueous solutions of BACs are self-organized disperse systems, whose disperse phase (nanoassociates) rearranges upon dilution, which is accompanied by nonmonotonous changes in the physicochemical and biological properties of the system. This work introduces the study of fluorescence and UV absorption of aqueous diluted systems of a biogenic succinic acid (SA), used as an antihypoxic and antioxidant pharmaceutical. It is shown for the first time that the fluorescence spectra (A ex at 225 nm) of SA systems are informative at the calculated concentrations range from 1.10(-17) to 1.10(-5) M. The nonmonotonous concentration dependence of fluorescence intensity (lambda(ex) at 225 nm, lambda(em) at 350 nm) is in good agreement with the data on nanoassociates' size, as well as with both the physicochemical properties of SA systems and their biotesting results, which were obtained using the certified procedures for monitoring the toxicity of natural waters and wastewater. The observed coherence between the fluorescence intensity of SA systems and the nanoassociates' size allows for the conclusion that it may be possible to consider fluorescence as a potential marker of self-organization and bioeffects of diluted aqueous BACs systems.

AB Light-driven degradation of organic contaminants by photocatalytic nanoparticles has attracted significant attention for wastewater treatment applications. However, implementation of these approaches has been limited by challenges in reactor design, which often require post-treatment separation of nanoparticles or exhibit low reactivity owing to immobilization of particles at the surface of heterogeneous supports. In this work, we present a material design strategy that circumvents these challenges by encapsulating photocatalytic particles in three-dimensional polymer networks, leading to structurally-stable photocatalytic hydrogels that were used as the walls of a flow reactor. This design leverages the volumetric reactions of commonly-implemented slurry reactors but circumvents the need for downstream separation of photocatalytic particles. A two-step soft lithography technique was used to fabricate a patterned poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) hydrogel composite with embedded titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles that were employed as a photocatalyst. In this configuration, contaminant molecules introduced via a flow channel were absorbed into the hydrogel, and subsequently diffused to the surface of the embedded photocatalyst particles where they were oxidized upon light irradiation. Using reactor configurations with low residence times (15 seconds) and moderate UV irradiation (0.28 mW cm(-2) at 365 nm), we demonstrated removal of up to 33% of model contaminant methylene blue (MB) and 13% of the antibiotic norfloxacin, both of which were introduced at a concentration of 3 mg L-1. The influence of molecular design parameters, such as hydrogel ionic strength, crosslinking density, and photocatalyst loading on transport and reactor performance were investigated and shown to have a strong influence on the transport properties of the hydrogels, providing options for optimizing the material to enhance treatment efficiency.

AB Fenton oxidation is one of the promising advanced oxidation processes for the efficient elimination of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. The strong oxidation ability of this process is attributed to the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) in the solution. In the present study, heterogeneous micro-sized zeolite catalysts that contain iron have been used in the Fenton-like process. This process enables operation in a wide pH range and facilitates the reuse of catalysts. Indeed, the coupling of the heterogeneous Fenton reaction with membrane filtration will ensure catalyst retention in the effluent compartment during the continuous water treatment. This study then investigated the fouling control strategies and membrane long-term stability in the heterogeneous Fenton reactor. During the filtration of the zeolite catalyst suspension, the critical flux for irreversible fouling was determined. One of the strategies to control membrane fouling can then be to choose an operating flux below this critical flux. In the case where a flux value above the critical flux is chosen, the results demonstrated total efficiency of hydrodynamic backwashing to eliminate hydraulically reversible fouling. Concerning the question of polymeric membrane long-term stability, it has been demonstrated that due to contact with the Fenton medium, membrane material undergoes oxidation and polymeric chain scissions. This latter is strongly linked to the decline in the mechanical resistance of membranes. In the tested conditions, despite the degradation to membrane material, the critical flux for irreversible fouling remained unchanged on aged membranes.

AB Antibiotics are not efficiently removed in conventional wastewater treatments. In fact, different advanced oxidation process (AOPs), including ozone, peroxide, UV radiation, among others, are being investigated in the elimination of microcontaminants. Most of AOPs proved to be efficient on the degradation of antibiotics, but the mineralization is on the one hand not evaluated or on the other hand not high. At this work, the UV-based hybrid process, namely Photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation (PEO), was applied, aiming the mineralization of microcontaminants such as the antibiotics Amoxicillin (AMX), Norfloxacin (NOR) and Azithromycin (AZI). The influence of the individual contributions of electrochemical oxidation (EO) and the UV-base processes on the hybrid process (PEO) was analysed. Results showed that AMX and NOR presented higher mineralization rate under direct photolysis than AZI due to the high absorption of UV radiation. For the EO processes, a low mineralization was found for all antibiotics, what was associated to a mass-transport limitation related to the low concentration of contaminants (200??g/L). Besides that, an increase in mineralization was found, when heterogeneous photocatalysis and EO are compared, due to the influence of UV radiation, which overcomes the mass-transport limitations. Although the UV-based processes control the reaction pathway that leads to mineralization, the best results to mineralize the antibiotics were achieved by PEO hybrid process. This can be explained by the synergistic effect of the processes that constitute them. A higher mineralization was achieved, which is an important and useful finding to avoid the discharge of microcontaminants in the environment.

AB In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) as reliable and highly efficient adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals from water. CDCs were produced from titanium carbide at temperatures within the range of 800-1400 degrees C employing chlorine as extraction agent. The materials were physicochemically characterized and tested in the adsorption of two relevant pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DCF) and metronidazole (MNZ)) in aqueous solutions. We found that the specific surface area in combination with a low functionalized surface plays a key role on the adsorption capacity of the material while the average pore size determines the kinetics of the process. Notably, the CDCs showed an outstanding adsorptive behaviour compared to different conventional carbon materials under the same operating conditions, which was attributed not only to their high surface areas but mainly to their strong hydrophobic properties. The optimum material (specific surface area of 1676m(2) g(-1)) showed extremely high adsorption capacity values (551 and 410 mg g(-1) for DCF and MNZ, respectively). Remarkably, the process was very fast (10 min of equilibrium time) even using low doses of adsorbent (0.3 mg mL(-1)). The performance of the optimum CDC was also demonstrated in bi-component systems while its versatility was demonstrated in a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, obtaining a good performance in terms of adsorption capacity (up to similar to 400 mgDCF g(-1)) and kinetics (equilibrium time of 10 min). These results demonstrate the promise of CDCs for reliable, effective and fast flow-through tertiary water treatment.

AB A promising sustainable strategy to valorize cellulose to high-value adsorbents for trace pharmaceuticals, like diclofenac sodium (DCF), in the water is demonstrated. Carbon nanospheres (CN) as the DCF adsorbent were derived from cellulose through a one-pot microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization method. CN exhibited efficient DCF removal (100% removal of 0.001 mg/mL DCF in 30 s and 59% removal of 0.01 mg/mL DCF in 1 h). The adsorption kinetics and isotherm data were well-fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous as confirmed by the thermodynamic parameters. Multiple characterization techniques including SEM/EDS, FTIR, FTIR-imaging and zeta potential were applied to qualitatively investigate the adsorption process. pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding were proposed as the dominant adsorption interactions. CN also demonstrated effective adsorption capacity towards three other commonly-detected contaminants in the wastewater including ketoprofen (KP), benzophenone (BZP), and diphenylamine (DPA), each bearing partial structural similarity with DCF. The affinity of the contaminants towards CN followed the order DPA > BZP > DCF > KP, which could be explained by the different configurations and chemical units. It was speculated that for DCF and KP, the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion produced by dissociated carboxyl groups can impede the adsorption process as compared to DPA and BZP. This methodology could offer further insights into the drug adsorption on the cellulose-derived carbon adsorbents and the use of bioderived carbons for treatment of wastewaters contaminated with pharmaceuticals.

AB The concentration of antiretroviral drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) effluents and surface waters of many countries has increased significantly due to their widespread use for HIV treatment. In this study, the removal of stavudine and zidovudine under UV254 photolysis or UV254/H2O2 was investigated in a micro capillary film (MCF) photoreactor, using minimal water samples quantities. The UV254 quantum yield of zidovudine, (2.357 +/- 0.0589).10(-2) mol ein(-1) (pH 4.0-8.0), was 28-fold higher that the yield of stavudine (8.34 +/- 0.334).10(-4) mol ein(-1) (pH 6.0-8.0). The second -order rate constant k(OH,i) of reaction of hydroxyl radical with the antiretrovirals (UV254/H2O2 process) were determined by kinetics modeling: (9.98 +/- 0.68).10(8) M-1 s(-1) (pH 4.0-8.0) for zidovudine and (2.03 +/- 0.18).10(9) M-1 s(-1) (pH 6.0-8.0) for stavudine. A battery of ecotoxicological tests (i.e. inhibition growth, bioluminescence, mutagenic and genotoxic activity) using bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri, Salmonella typhimurium), crustacean (Daphnia magna) and algae (Raphidocelis subcapitata) revealed a marked influence of the UV dose on the ecotoxicological activity. The UV254/H2O2 treatment process reduced the ecotoxicological risk associated to direct photolysis of the anti-retrovirals aqueous solutions, but required significantly higher UV254 doses (>= 2000 mJ cm(-2)) in comparison to common water UV disinfection processes.

AB While the discharge of groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds to surface waters is widely reported, assessments of its ecological threat are rare in the scientific literature, largely being restricted to comparisons of riparian groundwater concentrations to water quality guidelines for protecting aquatic life. Here we investigated potential negative impacts on the benthic community from overlapping petroleum hydrocarbon - chlorinated solvent plumes discharging to an urban stream using in-field ecological assessment methods (targeting both meio- and macrobenthos) over multiple scales. Several lines of evidence were suggestive of detrimental impacts from the plumes, including reduced total abundance and richness of benthic taxa, reduced or enhanced abundances of individual benthic taxa, and an altered benthic community structure. However, the findings were not conclusive, as the evaluation was complicated by substantial small-scale (<20 m) spatial variation in concentrations of many other groundwater contaminants, making it difficult to determine reference areas (i.e., those with similar substrate and chemistry, but lacking exposure to plume compounds) and isolate impacts from a single factor. Furthermore, detections of the wastewater indicator acesulfame also demonstrated the issue of uncertain influences from unmeasured contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals). Some of the assessment methods showed greater promise than others (e.g., sampling along a gradient rather than having separate impacted and reference sites), which may provide guidance on future field applications. Overall, the study findings suggest a need for further inquiry into the most appropriate application of ecological and ecotoxicological assessment methods to groundwater-based contamination hazards.

AB The increasing worldwide consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ibuprofen (IBU) is leading to the widespread and persistent occurrence of these chemicals and their transformation products in soils and waters. Although at low concentrations, the continuous discharge of these micropollutants and the incomplete removal by the actual wastewater treatments can provoke accumulation in the environment with risks for the trophic chain. Non-target organisms as duckweed can be used for the environniental monitoring of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants. In this work, plants of Lama gibba L were exposed to high (020 and 1 mg L-1) and environmentally relevant (0.02 mg L-1) concentrations of IBU to investigate their removal and metabolization capacity. The main oxidized IBU metabolites in humans (hydroxy-IBU and carboxy-IBU) Were determined in tht intact plants and in the growth solutions, together with non-destructiVe physiological parameters and phytotoxic indicators. The IBU uptake increased with the increasing of IBU concentration in the medium, but the relative accumulation of the pharmaceutical and generation of hydroxy-IBU was higher in presence of the lower IBU treatments. Carboxy-IBU was not found in the plant tissue and solutions. The changes observed in growth and photosynthetic performances were not able to induce phyto-toxic effects. Apart from a mean physical-chemical degradation of 82%, the IBU removal by plants was highly efficient (89-92.5%) in all the conditions tested, highlighting the role of L gibba in the biodegradation of emerging contaminants.

AB In the rainy season, rice growing areas in Vietnam often become flooded by up to 1.5 m water. The floodwater brings contaminants from cultivated areas, farms and villages to the rice fields resulting in widespread contamination. In 2012 and 2013, the inorganic and organic contaminants in floodwater was investigated in Thanh Hoa and Hue. Water samples were taken at 16 locations in canals, paddy fields and rivers before and during the flood. In total, 940 organic micro-pollutants in the water samples were determined simultaneously by GC-MS method with automatic identification and quantification system (AIQS), while ICP-MS was used for determination of ten trace elements in the samples. The concentrations of 277 organic micro-pollutants and ten elements (As, Cu, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn, Al) ranged from 0.01 to 7.6 mu g L-1 and 0.1 to 3170 mu g L-1, respectively, in the floodwater. Contaminants originated from industrial sources (e. g. PAH) were detected at low concentrations, ranged from 0.01 to 0.18 mu g L-1, while concentrations of pollutants originated from domestic sources (e. g. sterols, pharmaceuticals and personal care products and pesticides) were ranged from 0.01 to 2.12 mu g L-1. Isoprocarb had the highest detection frequency of 90%, followed by isoprothiolane (88%) and fenobucarb (71%). The results indicated that contaminants in floodwater come from untreated wastewater from villages, and the agricultural activities are the major sources of increased pesticides resuspended in the floodwater in this study.

AB We investigated the impact of ionic strength, hardness and surfactant on the removal of the widely used drug naproxen (NAP) onto the developed porous sugarcane bagasse (PSB). The experiments demonstrated that increases in ionic strength, surfactant and hardness impacted on the removal of NAP from aqueous phase. The surface of the developed materials showed very high (52 %) carbon content and low (2.3 %) moisture content. The presence of hydroxyl and carboxylate groups might be responsible for the removal of NAP, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic study. The developed material showed relatively higher surface area of 669.76 m(2) g(-1), and pore volume of 1.15 cm(3) g(-1) with average particle size of 37.5 A mu m, justifying its utility for the adsorption process. The developed material also showed heterogeneous surface morphology and graphite-like pattern. The mechanism of adsorption was explained based on spectroscopic analysis. The computed thermodynamics parameters (Delta HA degrees A = -22.03 kJ mol(-1), Delta SA degrees A = -54.53 J mol(-1) K-1 and Delta GA degrees A = - 5.50 kJ mol(-1)) confirmed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. Experiments were also conducted to optimize the operating parameters for maximum possible removal of NAP from aquatic environment. Regeneration of spent adsorbent was carried out using microwave irradiation, achieving similar to 83.11 % desorption. The energy recovered from the loaded NAP in terms of higher heating value was 14.15 MJ kg(-1), further enhancing its utilization. The low cost of PSB (USD 19.49) also justifies its utilization for wastewater treatment from the economic perspective.

AB Photocatalysis has been applied for the elimination or reduction concentration of emerging pollutants in water. One of them, is the moxifloxacin (MOX), a fluoroquinolone that have a potential to develop resistant bacteria and have been present toxicity. The MOX achieves the environment due to inefficient wastewater treatment and incorrect disposal. Aiming to find a sustainable solution for photocatalytic process, compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) reactors have been proposed. In this sense, the present study investigates the application of CPC reactor for the degradation of MOX using sunlight and artificial light (UV-A lamp). In addition, the acute toxicity for L. sativa seeds and A. cepa bulbs, as well as the MOX cytotoxicity and genotoxicity for A. cepa root were investigated before and after treatment. The MOX degradation was around 65% using the sunlight and 44% with the artificial light. This difference was due to the kind of incident radiation (direct and diffuse), as well as the type of radiation (visible and/or ultraviolet) used in the processes. For L. sativa the acute toxicity was eliminated after MOX treatment using sunlight. A. cepa root length increased before the treatment and reduced significantly after it, what can indicate hormesis occurrence. MOX cytotoxicity was not observed. In contrast, genotoxicity assays showed high frequency of chromosomal aberrations for MOX solution, indicating elevated genotoxicity that was eliminated after solar treatment. The transformation products of MOX after CPC reactor solar treatment did not show cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in A. cepa and acute toxicity in L. Sativa. The results indicates that photocatalysis in a CPC solar reactor is efficient for MOX toxicity removal in the treated solutions.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are a class of pharmaceuticals that are ubiquitously found at trace levels (mu g/L) in wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. Due to their polar features, they are not effectively removed during conventional water treatment and provide an iodine source for the formation of iodinated-disinfection by-products (I-DBPs) during disinfection. This work examined the suitability of organic parameters (i.e. total organic carbon (TOC), ultraviolet absorbance (UVA(254)), total fluorescence (TF) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA)), as surrogate correlation models to estimate the removal of seven target ICMs. Three advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), LPUV/H2O2, LPUV/Cl-2 and LPUV/NH2Cl, were applied to develop the surrogate correlation models. Pearson correlation coefficients were compared with linear correlation models to determine the ideal surrogate parameter for each model type. The formation of iodinated-haloacetic acids (IHAAs) were also monitored for each AOP treatment. Results did not show any significant differences for ICM attenuation across the AOP treatments, illustrating UV photolysis is the main driving force to attenuate ICMs. Surrogate correlation models demonstrated a good correlation (R-2 = 0.8211 and 0.7887) and strong Pearson correlation (R = 0.9602 and 0.8881) for UVA(254) during LPUV/Cl-2 and LPUV/H2O2 treatment. Additionally, two I-HAA, monoidoacetic acid (MIAA) and bromoiodoacetic acid (BIAA), were detected (up to 2.4 mu g/L) after LPUV/ Cl-2 and LPUV/NH2Cl AOP treatment.

AB Phthalic acid esters (PAEs), especially dibutyl phthalate (DBP) pollution in the environment, have attracted worldwide attention. Four Phragmites australis-based, mesocosm-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) were operated for one year to study the removal efficiency and mechanisms of DBP in the reclaimed water. The average removal efficiencies for DBP were 93.77 +/- 3.27%, 94.9 +/- 2.60% and 97.0 +/- 3.00% in the VFCWs under HLRs of 0.33, 0.22 and 0.11 m/d, respectively. DBP can be accumulated and degraded by wetland plants and its concentration in the roots (0.256-8.45 mg/kg) were higher than in the leaves (0.243-0.482 mg/kg). The concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and phthalic acid (PA) were 0.142 -2.35 mg/kg and 0.113-0.545 mg/kg respectively in the plant tissues. The concentrations of DBP were 38.2-271 mu g/kg in the substrates. Mass balance for DBP indicates that the estimated plant uptake and substrate adsorption of total DBP is negligible. This suggests that biodegradation and other process are the primary pathways for DBP removal in VFCWs. The results of 16S rDNA and ITS rDNA high-throughput sequencing indicated that both bacterial and fungal community diversity decreased with the exposure of DBP. Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium and Curvularia genera may be the main participants in the biodegradation of DBP in the CWs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters. In this study, biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems, and moreover, the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants. First, the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first-order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data. The degradation rate constants (k(bio)) were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals, indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals. Further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed, for the first time, that the electrophilicity index (omega), a measure of electrophilic power, served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k(bio) than the conventional log K-ow (a measure of hydrophobicity) in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems. However, the correlation strength (goodness-of-fit) between omega and k(bio )deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent. Our results show that omega can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes.

AB Antibiotics are introduced into agricultural fields by the application of manure or biosolids, or via irrigation using reclaimed wastewater. Antibiotics can enter the terrestrial food chains through plant uptake, which forms an alternative pathway for human exposure to antibiotics. However, previous studies mainly focused on detecting residues of the parent antibiotics, while ignoring the identification of antibiotics transformation products in plants. Here, we evaluated the uptake and metabolism of clarithromycin (CIA) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) in lettuce under controlled hydroponic conditions. The antibiotics and their metabolites were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QToF-MS/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatograph Micromass triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). The structure of CLA, SDZ and N-acetylated SDZ were confirmed with synthesized standards, verifying the reliability of the identification method. Eight metabolites of CIA and two metabolites of SDZ were detected in both the leaves and roots of lettuce. The metabolites of CLA included phases I and II transformation products, while only phase II metabolites of SDZ were observed in lettuce. The proportion of CLA metabolites was estimated to be greater than 70%, indicating that most of the CIA was metabolized in plant tissues. The proportion of SDZ metabolites was lower than 12% in the leaves and 10% in the roots. Some metabolites might have the ability to increase or acquire antibacterial activity. Therefore, in addition to the parent compounds, metabolites of antibiotics in edible vegetables are also worthy of study for risk assessment and to determine the consequences of long-term exposure.

AB In this study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was synthesized by (L)-ascorbic acid reduction, which was a relatively mild and environmental friendly reduction method, and the adsorption of organic contaminants was compared to graphene oxide (GO) to probe the potential adsorption mechanisms. The morphology properties of GO and RGO were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared transmission (FTIR), Raman spectrometer, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adsorption affinities of GO and RGO for phenanthrene and 1-naphthol were studied in batch experiments. The effects of pH and surfactants were also assessed. The results demonstrated that RGO reduced by (L)-ascorbic acid show significantly greater adsorption affinity for both phenanthrene and 1-naphthol than GO, and even greater than most of RGOs that reduced by the strong reductive reagents. This was mainly attributed to the hydrophobic interaction, pi-pi interaction, and H-bonding between graphene sheets and organic contaminants. Both GO and RGO showed stronger adsorption to phenanthrene than to 1-naphthol. The adsorption of 1-naphthol increased with decreasing pH and reached a maximum around pH = 7.34. The surfactants, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfaonate (SDBS) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), had negligible influence on adsorption to GO. Note that CTAB significantly inhibited the adsorption of phenanthrene/1-naphthol on RGO, which could be attributed to the pore blockage effect. In addition, RGO could be regenerated and reused with high recyclability over five cycles. The present study suggests that RGO obtained via (L)-ascorbic acid reduction can be deemed as a promising material for organic contaminated wastewater treatment.

AB The removal of ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and cinoxacin (CINO) antibiotics from wastewater was investigated using V2O5-ZnO coated carbon nanofibers (V2O5-ZnO@CNF) as an adsorbent. The V2O5-ZnO@CNF nanocomposite was characterized using characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersion x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The characterization results revealed that the V2O5-ZnO nanoparticles were incorporated on the surface of carbon nanofibers. The effects of different experimental parameters such as adsorbent amounts, contact time, initial pH, that affect the removal process were optimized using response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions were found to be 018 g, 6.5 and 20 min for the adsorbent amount, sample pH and contact time, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 71.4 and 87.7 mg g( -1) for cinoxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. In addition, the adsorption isotherms and kinetics were used to investigate the adsorption mechanism. The data followed the order: Langmuir (R-2 = 0.09942-0.9996) > Dubinin-Radushkevich (R-2 = 0.9257-0.9557 > Temkin (R-2 = 0.79991-0.9132), > Flory-Huggins (R-2 = 0.7432-0.8813) > Freundlich (R-2 = 0.7057-0.7808). Furthermore, the data was better described by pseudo- second-order kinetics, this implied that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption process as the rate-limiting mechanism through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and CIPRO or CINO.

AB A simple and convenient method was used to prepare novel granular carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for enhanced adsorption of pharmaceuticals. By heating CNTs powder at 450 degrees C in air, followed by filtration, the obtained granular adsorbent exhibited high surface area and pore volume since the heating process produced some oxygen-containing functional groups on CNT surface, making CNTs more dispersible in the formation of granular cake. The porous granular CNTs not only had more available surfaces for adsorption but also were more easily separated from solution than pristine CNTs (p-CNTs) powder. This adsorbent exhibited relatively fast adsorption for carbamazepine (CBZ), tetracycline (TC) and diclofenac sodium (DS), and the maximum adsorption capacity on the granular CNTs was 369.5 mu mol/g for CBZ, 284.2 mu mol/g for TC and 203.1 mu mol/g for DS according to the Langmuir fitting, increasing by 42.4%, 37.8% and 38.0% in comparison with the pristine CNTs powder. Moreover, the spent granular CNTs were successfully regenerated at 400 degrees C in air without decreasing the adsorption capacity in five regeneration cycles. The adsorbed CBZ and DS were completely degraded, while the adsorbed TC was partially oxidized and the residual was favorable for the subsequent adsorption. This research develops an easy method to prepare and regenerate granular CNT adsorbent for the enhanced removal of organic pollutants from water or wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with peroxy chemicals, such as H2O2 and peroxydisulfate (PDS), have been considered potentially highly effective disinfection processes. This study investigated the inactivation of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores as surrogates for pathogens under UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS conditions, with the aim to provide further understanding of UV-based advanced disinfection processes (ADPs). Results showed that one additional log of inactivation of E. coli was achieved with 0.3 mM H2O2 or PDS at 5.2 X 10(-5) Einstein.L-1 photo fluence (at 254 nm) compared with UV irradiation alone. Addition of H2O2 and PDS greatly enhanced the inactivation rate of MS2 by around 15 folds and 3 folds, respectively, whereas the inactivation of B. subtilis spores was slightly enhanced. Reactive species responsible for the inactivation were identified to be center dot OH, SO4 center dot-, and CO3 center dot- based on manipulation of solution conditions. The CT value of each reactive species was calculated with respect to each microbial surrogate, which showed that the disinfection efficacy ranked as center dot OH > SO4 center dot- > CO3 center dot->> O-2(center dot-)/HO2-. A comprehensive dynamic model was developed and successfully predicted the inactivation of the microbial surrogates in surface water and wastewater matrices. The concepts of UV-efficiency and EE/O were employed to provide a cost-effective evaluation for UV-based ADPs. Overall, the present study suggests that it will be beneficial to upgrade UV disinfection to UV/H2O2 ADP for the inactivation of viral pathogens.

AB Groundwater quality effects from septic ranks were investigated in the Woodville Karst Plain, an area that contains numerous sinkholes and a thin veneer of sands and clays overlying the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) Concerns have emerged about elevated nitrate concentrations in the UFA, which is the source of water supply in this area of northern Florida At three sites during dry and wet periods in 2007-2008, water samples were collected from the septic tank, shallow and deep lysimeters, and drainfield and background wells in the UFA and analyzed for in chemical indicators including nutrients. nitrate isotopes, organic wastewater compounds (OWCs), pharmaceutical compounds, and microbiological indicators (bacteria and viruses) Median NO3-N concentration in groundwater beneath the septic tank drainfields was 20 mg L-1 (8 0-26 mg L-1) After adjusting for dilution, about 25 to 40% N loss (from dentrification, ammonium sorption, and ammonia volatilization) occurs as septic tank effluent moves through the unsaturated zone to the water table Nitrogen loading rates to groundwater were highly variable at each site (3 9-12 kg N yr(-1)), as were N and chloride depth profiles in the unsaturated zone Most OWCs and pharmaceutical compounds were highly attenuated beneath the drainfields: however, five OWCs (caffeine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, phenol, galaxolide, and tris(dichloroisotopropyl)phosphare) and two pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole) were detected in groundwater samples Indicator bacteria and human enteric viruses were detected in septic tank effluent samples but only intermittently in soil water and groundwater Contaminant movement to groundwater beneath each septic tank system also was related to water use and differences in lithology at each site.

AB Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been detected in the environment in the range of ng L-1-mu g L-1 due to its low degradability in some wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the use of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor to effectively degrade ketoprofen in a defined liquid medium was assessed. The fungus eliminated ketoprofen to nondetectable levels in 24 h when it was added at 10 mg L-1 whereas at low concentration of 40 mu g L-1 it was almost completely removed (95%) after 5 h. Low extracellular laccase activity was detected in the T. versicolor cultures but the addition of the laccase-mediator system did not lead to ketoprofen oxidation. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole reduced ketoprofen oxidation. These data suggest that the first oxidation step is cytochrome P450 mediated. During time-course degradation experiments, three intermediates were structurally elucidated and quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS and NMR: 2-[3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid, 2-[(3-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid, and 2-(3-benzoyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid. The latter was reported for the first time in biological systems. After 7 d of incubation, only small amounts of 2-[(3-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid (0.08 mg) remained in the liquid medium in comparison with the initial ketoprofen dose (1.0 mg), suggesting possible mineralization of ketoprofen.

AB Cattail (Typha latifolia L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) can effectively remove inorganic contaminants from soils and biosolids, but their role in the attenuation of organic contaminants, such as antimicrobials, is currently poorly understood. Uptake by plants is one of several mechanisms by which plant-assisted attenuation of antimicrobials can be achieved. The objectives of this growth room study were to evaluate the plant uptake of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and examine their partitioning between plant roots and aboveground biomass (AGB). Plant uptake of the two C-14 labeled antimicrobials was studied at two environmentally relevant concentrations (5 and 10 mg L-1). Plants were destructively sampled every 3-4 d during the 21-d growth period. Accumulation of CIP and SMX in both plant species was greater in the roots than in the AGB. The percentage uptake values of the two antimicrobials were significantly greater for cattail (34% for CIP, 20% for SMX) than for switchgrass (10% for both CIP and SMX). Translocation factors of the two antimicrobials were <1 for both plants, indicating slow movement of the antimicrobials from the roots to the shoots. For cattail roots, the BCF for CIP (1.58 L g(-1)) was significantly greater than that for SMX (0.8 L g(-1)). By comparison, BCFs for switchgrass roots did not differ significantly between CIP (0.88 L g(-1)) and SMX (1.13 L g(-1)). These results indicate greater potential for cattail to phytoextract CIP and SMX and significantly contribute to the attenuation of these antimicrobials in systems designed for the phytoremediation of contaminated wastewater.

AB The phytotoxicity and degradation of ofloxacin (OFX) in duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza based system was estimated in this study. For that, OFX was added in an environmentally relevant range (0.01-1.0 mg L-1) in medium (Hoagland nutrient) and toxicity biomarkers, i.e. changes in plant biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), photopigment (Chl-a, Chl-b and carotenoids), protein content, antioxidative enzymes (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; and ascorbate peroxidases, APX) in fronds were estimated. The batch-scale setups (250 ml) was prepared in triplicate for each concentration of OFX and reared in growth chambers (Algae Tron AG 230) for 7 d. Results suggested that the high concentrations of OFX caused a reduction in biomass (4.8-41.3%), relative root growth (RGR), protein (4.16-11.28%) and photopigment contents. The fronds in OFX spiked setups showed an increased level of antioxidative enzymes: CAT (0.230-0.338 mmol(H2O2) mg(-1) protein), APX (0.043-0.074 mmol(ascorbate) mg(-1) protein), and SOD (0.267-0.317 U mg(-1) protein) than control. At the end (7 d), the residual OFX content in the medium was also estimated, and results suggested a significant (p < 0.05) reduction (93.73-98.36%) in OFX content than control setup (54.76-75.53%) at the end of the experimentation. The trend of residual OFX suggested phytodegradation as a significant mechanism of antibiotic degradation other than hydrolysis and photodegradation processes. This study indicates that duckweed can be an effective bio-tool for the removal of environmental relevant concentration of the antibiotics from the wastewater.

AB This study is focused on the assessment of potency of electron beam (EB) irradiation for the degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin (OFC) in aqueous medium. The influence of parameters like, initial concentration, solution pH, and presence of various additives viz., NO3, NO2, propanol, thiourea, H2O2 and different water matrices were examined on the degradation of OFC. The degradation followed the pseudo first-order reaction kinetics with dose constant values of 1.861, 0.917, 0.659 and 0.540 kGy(-1) for the following initial concentrations: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mmol L-1 with their corresponding (G(-OFC)) values of 0.389, 0.600, 0.779 and 0.936, respectively. OFC degradation in the presence of different additives showed decrease in the dose constant, mainly owing to the competition reactions of OFC and other scavengers with the radiolytically generated reactive radical species, especially HO center dot radicals. Addition of H2O2 exhibited synergistic effect on OFC degradation and mineralization extent. The effectiveness of EB prominently reduced in wastewater when compared to ultrapure, surface and ground water due to the higher scavenging rates of the reactive species. Based on the Gaussian calculations and LC-QTOF-MS analysis, it was inferred that OFC radiolytic degradation was mainly attributed to oxidative HO center dot radicals and the direct cleavage of OFC molecules. Possible removal pathways for OFC using EB irradiation were proposed with identification of almost twenty one transformation products. The OFC transformation products did not exhibited any cytotoxicity even at 1.0 kGy dose, ensuring the ability of EB technology to make water reusable and recyclable for several applications.

AB Investigations have focused on the removal and transformation of pharmaceuticals during drinking water and wastewater treatment. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the changes of the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity based on different modes of action (MoAs) during chlorination, chloramination and ozonation processes of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ). The results illustrated that ozonation enhanced the cytotoxicity and the chromosome damage effects on CHO-K1 cells detected by cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay based on high-content screening technique, though ozonation showed the highest removal efficiency for CBZ. Non-target chemical analysis followed by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for the transformation products (TPs) suggested that the chromosomal damage effects could probably be attributed to 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)quinazoline-2-one (BQM) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD). In contrast to CBZ itself and the ozonated sample, the chlorinated and chloraminated samples caused DNA damage effects in SOS/umu test. Acridine, 9 (10) H-acridone, chlorinated 9 (10) H-acridone and TP-237, which were first identified in the chlorination or chloramination processes, were predicted to be the DNA damaging agents. These genotoxic TPs were primarily generated from the oxidation of seven-membered N-heterocyclic in CBZ. This study highlighted the potential adverse effects generated in ozonation process and the oxidation of N-heterocyclic containing pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses a range of risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Consumers contribute to pharmaceutical pollution via use and disposal of medications, though data on such behaviors is limited. This paper investigates the purchasing, use, and disposal practices among a population that has been researched only minimally to date, yet will determine pharmaceutical pollution for decades to come: young adults represented by a university student population. We employed an online, 21-question survey to examine behaviors related to pharmaceuticals among students at the University of Vermont (n = 358). Results indicate that the majority of respondents had purchased medications in the previous 12 months (94%), and had leftover drugs (61%). Contrary to previous studies of older populations, only a small proportion of students had disposed of drugs (18%); municipal trash was the primary route of drug disposal (25%), and very few students disposed drugs via flushing (1%). Less than a quarter of students were aware of drug take-back programs (24%), and only 4% had ever used take-back services. These findings indicate that the university student population may be storing a large volume of unused drugs.that will require future disposal. Increasing awareness of, access to, and participation in pro-environment pharmaceutical behaviors, such as purchasing over-the-counter medication in smaller quantities and utilizing drug take-back programs, could minimize future pharmaceutical pollution from this population.

AB Pharmaceutical persistent pollutants pose a serious threat to the environment. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, hydroxyapatite-based biomaterials as photocatalysts to degrade micro pollutants. Diclofenac and fluoxetine were selected for these initial tests. Hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(OH)(2), HAp) is one of the most commonly used biomaterials/bioceramics, being a major constituent of bone. In this work sustainable HAp-based materials of marine origin, obtained from cod fish bones, were used; these photocatalysts were previously fully studied and characterised. Both single-phase HAp and HAp-titania multicomponent materials (1 wt% TiO2) were employed as UV light photocatalysts, the latter showing better performance, indicated by higher degradation rates of both compounds. The HAp-titania photocatalyst showed excellent degradation of both persistent pollutants, the maximum degradation performance being 100% for fluoxetine and 92% for diclofenac, with pollutant and photocatalyst concentrations of 2 ppm and 4 g/L, respectively. Variations in features such as pollutant and photocatalyst concentrations were investigated, and results showed that generally fluoxetine was degraded more easily than diclofenac. The photocatalyst's crystallinity was not affected by the photo degradation reaction; indeed the material exhibited good photostability, as the degradation rate did not decrease when the material was reused. Tests were also performed using actual treated wastewater; the photocatalyst was still effective, even if with lower efficiency (-20% and -4% for diclofenac and fluoxetine, respectively). TOC analysis showed high but incomplete mineralisation of the pollutants (maximum 60% and 80% for DCF and FXT, respectively). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years measurable concentrations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown in the aquatic environment as a result of increasing human consumption. Effects of five frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid and piroxicam in 0.1 mg ml(-1) concentration) in batch cultures of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus, Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii), and eukaryotic algae (Desmodesmus communis, Haematococcus pluvialis, Cryptomonas ovata) were studied. Furthermore, the effects of the same concentrations of NSAIDs were investigated in natural algal assemblages in microcosms. According to the changes of chlorophyll-a content, unicellular cyanobacteria seemed to be more tolerant to NSAIDs than eukaryotic algae in laboratory experiments. Growth of eukaryotic algae was reduced by all drugs, the cryptomonad C. ovata was the most sensitive to NSAIDs, while the flagellated green alga H. pluvialis was more sensitive than the non-motile green alga D. communis. NSAID treatments had weaker impact in the natural assemblages dominated by cyanobacteria than in the ones dominated by eukaryotic algae, confirming the results of laboratory experiments. Diversity and number of functional groups did not change notably in cyanobacteria dominated assemblages, while they decreased significantly in eukaryotic algae dominated ones compared to controls. The results highlight that cyanobacteria (especially unicellular ones) are less sensitive to the studied, mostly hardly degradable NSAIDs, which suggest that their accumulation in water bodies may contribute to the expansion of cyanobacterial mass productions in appropriate environmental circumstances by pushing back eukaryotic algae. Thus, these contaminants require special attention during wastewater treatment and monitoring of surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The majority of previous research investigating the fate of endocrine-disrupting compounds has focused on single processes generally in controlled laboratory experiments, and limited studies have directly evaluated their fate and transport in rivers. This study evaluated the fate and transport of 4-nonylphenol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone in a 10-km reach of the Redwood River in southwestern Minnesota. The same parcel of water was sampled as it moved downstream, integrating chemical transformation and hydrologic processes. The conservative tracer bromide was used to track the parcel of water being sampled, and the change in mass of the target compounds relative to bromide was determined at two locations downstream from a wastewater treatment plant effluent outfall. In-stream attenuation coefficients (k(stream)) were calculated by assuming first-order kinetics (negative values correspond to attenuation, whereas positive values indicate production). Attenuation of 17 beta-estradiol (k(stream) = -3.2 +/- 1.0 day(-1)) was attributed primarily due to sorption and biodegradation by the stream biofilm and bed sediments. Estrone (k(stream) = 0.6 +/- 0.8 day(-1)) and 4-nonylphenol (k(stream) = 1.4 +/- 1.9 day(-1)) were produced in the evaluated 10-km reach, likely due to biochemical transformation from parent compounds (17 beta-estradiol, 4-nonylphenolpolyethoxylates, and 4-nonyphenolpolyethoxycarboxylates). Despite attenuation, these compounds were transported kilometers downstream, and thus additive concentrations from multiple sources and transformation of parent compounds into degradates having estrogenic activity can explain their environmental persistence and widespread observations of biological disruption in surface waters.

AB Nowadays the removal of organic micropollutants is one of the major challenges of water and wastewater treatment plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of persulfate addition on micropollutants degradation by ionizing radiation. In this system, the radicals SO4 center dot-/OH center dot can be present simultaneously due to persulfate reaction with solvated electrons. Ibuprofen (IB), progesterone (Pg) and benzotriazole (BT) have been selected for this study. The degradation of micropollutants was followed at various radiation doses and under the influence of persulfate (S2O82-) addition at a fixed dose (30 Gy), in deionized and tap water. In deionized water the addition of 500 mu M persulfate improved the degradation of BT, IB and Pg by 17%, 36% and 24% respectively and the removal of micropollutants was increased when the concentration of persulfate ions increased. No influence of the presence of persulfate ions was observed in tap water. Contrary to tap water experiments, the persulfate (500 mu M) increases the elimination of BT slightly in the presence of bicarbonate ions. In the case of IB and Pg the influence of persulfate addition is significant even in the presence of bicarbonate ions which indicate that the bicarbonate ions do not completely inhibit the influence of persulfate addition in tap water. Even if the bicarbonate ions have an inhibitory effect on the irradiation system, it was suggested that the inhibition could be explained by the presence of nitrate ions, which would prevent the formation of sulfate radicals.

AB The present study deals with the treatment of an artificial pharmaceutical waste which contained amoxicillin (AMX) by using successively an electrocoagulation (EC) with Ca(NO3)(2) as an electrolyte and a nanofiltration (NF) with a Nanomax-50 membrane. The effect of the current intensity and of the operating pressure was investigated for separately EC and NF, respectively. The AMX removal as a function of pH and initial AMX concentration was also investigated for the separately conducted EC and NF processes. The best percentage removal of AMX by EC and NF was recorded to be 52.7 % and 99.0 %, respectively. In the case of the sequential processes EC followed by NF, the removal of AMX was 98.2 % and 97.5 % at pH 2.5 and 10, respectively. The contribution of both EC and NF towards the AMX removal efficiency in the case of the sequential process was very much significant. It is remarkable that the EC pre-treated feed into NF was explored with several benefits such as high removal efficiency, calcium involved in EC process, prolonged membrane life and reduced power consumption. The electrogenerated solids (the sediment and the cathode deposit) were characterized using Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) coupled to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Thermo Gravimetry Analysis (TGA). It appeared that calcium was involved in the electrogenerated solids. It gave a cathode deposit of Ca(OH)(2) in which some AMX was embedded.

AB This work aims to control foaming in a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) by optimizing the organic loading rate (OLR) and sludge retention time (SRT) values to decrease the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production used for the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Four lab-scale SMBRs were operated for a period of more than 8 months to determine the biokinetic coefficients and optimize the SMBR systems operation under the SRT of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 days and OLRs of 0.03-0.32 gCOD/L.day. The investigation revealed that the lowest foaming quantity was at an organic loading rate of 0.32 gCOD/L.day and a sludge retention time of 15 days related to few protein concentration of EPS. The results also showed that the foaming quality at the OLR of 0.03 gCOD/L.day was higher compared to the greater OLRs in all SRTs. It was found that the yield (Y), the endogenous decay coefficient (k(d)), the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), and the saturation constant (K-s) of four SMBRs were in the range of 0.073-0.310 mg/mg, 0.985-3.119 day(-1), 1.249-3.672 day-1, and 2.63-106.671-232.55 mg/mg, 1-3.156 day mgCOD/L, respectively. Furthermore, the most appropriate operating condition to activated sludge among the SMBRs was the OLR of 0.1 gCOD/L.day and SRT of 15 days. Under these optimum conditions, a 92.8 % COD removal efficiency and 3.708 1/day mu(max) were achieved.

AB The European Union (EU) approved in 2015 a Watch List of pollutants of emerging concern especially harmful for the aquatic environment (Decision 2015/495/EU). In this work, we explore the application of an inexpensive and environmentally-friendly catalytic system based on modified natural magnetite (Fe3O4-R400) and H2O2 for the removal of all the pharmaceuticals included in the EU Watch List (hormones: estrone, 17-beta-estradiol and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol; macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin; and the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory diclofenac). The experiments were carried out with a representative initial concentration of the drugs (1000 mu g L-1) at a circumneutral pH value (pH(0) = 5) within the temperature range of 17-50 degrees C. A low catalyst concentration (0.2 g L-1) was used while the applied amount of H2O2 corresponded to the stoichiometric one for the complete mineralization of the drugs (4-6 mg L-1). Operating under ambient-like conditions, total conversion of the target pollutants as well as the aromatic intermediates was achieved. Notably, total organic carbon was strongly reduced (> 50%), being the residual carbonaceous products short-chain organic acids. The applicability of the catalytic system was demonstrated using different real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents spiked with the mixture of pharmaceuticals. Apart from the complete removal of pharmaceuticals in relatively short reaction times (60-90 min), the disappearance of total coliforms was warranted. Remarkably, the catalyst showed a reasonable stability, with low iron leaching (< 0.7 mg L-1) and maintaining its magnetic properties almost unchanged.

AB A visible light-induced, Cu-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst was synthesized by a microwave hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic efficiency was investigated in the degradation of model water pollutants like Methylene Blue (dye) and ibuprofen (pharmaceuticals), as well as the inactivation of Escherichia coli (bacteria). The Cu-doped BiVO4 samples showed better efficiency than undoped BiVO4, and the 1 wt.% Cu-doped BiVO4 sample showed the best efficiency. The degradation of Methylene Blue reached 95%, while the degradation of ibuprofen reached 75%, and the inactivation of E. coli reached 85% in irradiation with visible light. The appearance of additional absorption band shoulders and widening of the optical absorption in the visible range makes the prepared powder an efficient visible light-driven photocatalyst. Moreover, the formation of an in-gap energy state just above the valance band as determined by density functional theory (DFT) first principle calculation, facilitates the wider optical absorption range of the doped system. Similarly, this in-gap energy state also acts as an electron trap, which is favorable for the efficient separation and photoexcited charge carriers' transfer process. The formation of oxygen vacancies due to doping also improved the separation of the charge carrier, which promoted the trapping of electrons and inhibited electron hole recombination, thus increasing the photocatalytic activity. No decrease in the efficiency of the 1 wt.% Cu-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst in the degradation of ibuprofen over three consecutive cycles revealed the stability of the photocatalyst towards photocorrosion. These findings highlight the multifunctional applications of Cu-doped BiVO4 in wastewater containing multiple pollutants.

AB Solar driven photocatalysis is considered as an environmental friendly treatment for micropollutant removal from secondary wastewater treatment plant effluents. The photo-Fenton process is efficient in persistent organic pollutant degradation and the use of low cost reactors with variable light path length such as raceway pond reactors (RPR) has been recently proposed. The aim of the study was to develop a simplified kinetic model predicting micropollutant removal rate as a function of environmental variables (irradiance and temperature), geometrical variables (light path length) and operating variables (reactant concentration). The parameters were obtained by fitting the model to 36 experimental conditions in 1.25-L cylindrical reactors at lab scale and then validated in a 360-L RPR at pilot plant scale. In the studied range, 10-40 degrees C, temperature enhances the photo-Fenton reaction rate by: i) accelerating the oxidation of ferrous iron with hydrogen peroxide (thermal Fenton); and ii) making the light absorption coefficient of ferric iron higher, that is the VRPA. The proposed photo-Fenton model takes into account both effects and properly fit experimental data. Considering 90% removal of the pesticide acetamiprid at an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L, a treatment capacity of 135 mg/m(2) h was achieved with low reactant concentrations, 10 mg/L Fe2+ and 50 mg/L H2O2. The presented results encourage the application of this modeling strategy for process optimization, design and operation of raceway pond reactors for micropollutant removal by solar photo-Fenton.

AB Iron is the most common metal by mass on earth and represents the basic element of industrial society. The usage of iron to synthesize consumer products and to remediate environment is an attractive approach. This perspective presents applications of the high-valent iron oxo compound (FeO42-)-O-VI (ferrate) in sustainable organic synthesis and treatment technology. In synthesizing organic molecules, C-H bond activation and selectivity are two basic ingredients of efficiency, which are attainable by ferrate. Examples of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and conversion of alcohols to aldehyde/ketone are presented. In addition, many other organic molecules of amines, aniline, phenolic, and thiol functionalities can be oxidized by ferrate. This oxidation chemistry of ferrate is expedient in transforming pharmaceuticals, micropollutants in bodies of water with implications for human and ecological health. A wide range of micropollutants, which are commonly found in drinking water resources and wastewater effluents, can be efficiently oxidized by ferrate on a seconds to minutes time scale. These molecules include endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, beta-blockers, antidepressants, X-ray contrast media, and cosmetic products. The reaction pathways of transformation of the studied pharmaceuticals are discussed. The results of the evaluation of toxicity of the oxidized products are given. The reduced product of ferrate is the environmentally friendly and magnetic iron(III) oxide. Ferrate, as a green molecule, has true potential in sustainable production of organics and treating emerging pollutants in water.

AB Anticancer drugs are harmful substances that can have carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, genotoxic, and cytotoxic effects even at low concentrations. More than 50 years after its introduction, the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CP) is still one of the most consumed anticancer drug worldwide. CP has been detected in water bodies in several studies and is known as being persistent in the aquatic environment. As the traditional water and wastewater treatment technologies are not able to remove CP from the water, different treatment options such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are under discussion to eliminate these compounds. The present study investigated the degradation of CP by three different AOPs: UV/H2O2, UV/Fe2+/H2O2 and UV/TiO2. The light source was a Hg medium-pressure lamp. Prescreening tests were carried out and afterwards experiments based on the optimized conditions were performed. The primary elimination of the parent compounds and the detection of transformation products (TPs) were monitored with LC-UV-MS/MS analysis, whereas the degree of mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Ecotoxicological assays were carried out with the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. CP was completely degraded in all treatments and UV/Fe2+/H2O2 was the fastest process, followed by UV/H2O2 and UV/TiO2. All the reactions obeyed pseudo-first order kinetics. Considering the mineralization UV/Fe2+/H2O2 and UV/TiO2 were the most efficient process with mineralization degrees higher than 85%, whereas UV/H2O2 achieved 72.5% of DOC removal. Five transformation products were formed during the reactions and identified. None of them showed significant toxicity against V. fischeri. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trace quantities of pharmaceuticals are continuously being discharged into the environment through domestic and industrial wastewater effluents, causing concern among scientists and regulators regarding potential long-term impacts on aquatic ecosystems. These compounds and their metabolites are constantly interacting with organisms at various life-cycle stages and may differentially influence the development of embryonic, larval, juvenile, and adult stages. To understand the possible cumulative effects of exposure to carbamazepine (CBZ), a multigenerational approach was taken in which survival, reproduction, respiration, growth, brood size, and biomass of Ceriodaphnia dubia were assessed at sublethal concentrations over the course of three successive generations. CBZ exposure significantly decreased fecundity at 196.7 mu g/L in the F0 and F1 generations over 2 weeks and acclimatized at 264.6 mu g/L in the F2 generation. Similarly, a significant decrease of neonate dry weight was observed at the 196.7 mu g/L CBZ treatment in the F1 generation, and it acclimatized at 264.6 mu g/L treatment level in the F2 generation. Median time to first brood release was significantly delayed at 264.6 mu g/L in the F2 generation, indicating slower maturation. Results over three successive generations are not different than what one would obtain by testing simply the F0 generation. Furthermore, the effects measured were observed at concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than are environmentally relevant, and it is unlikely that CBZ poses a substantial risk to the environment regarding the end points measured in this study. However, additional research through laboratory and field multigenerational studies may be required to understand the overall risk of CBZ to other nontarget organisms.

AB Water quality can change along a river system due to differences in adjacent land use patterns and discharge sources. These variations can induce rapid responses of the aquatic microbial community, which may be an indicator of water quality characteristics. In the current study, we used a random forest model to predict water sample sources from three different river ecosystems along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., less disturbed mountainous area, wastewater discharged urban area, and pesticide and fertilizer applied agricultural area) based on environmental physicochemical indices (PCIs), microbiological indices (MBIs), and their combination. Results showed that among the PCI-based models, using conventional water quality indices as inputs provided markedly better prediction of water sample source than using pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), and much better prediction than using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and substituted PAHs (SPAHs). Among the MBI-based models, using the abundances of the top 30 bacteria combined with pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria (PARB) as inputs achieved the lowest median out-of-bag error rate (9.9%) and increased median kappa coefficient (0.8694), while adding fungal inputs reduced the kappa coefficient. The model based on the top 30 bacteria still showed an advantage compared with models based on PCIs or the combination of PCIs and MBIs. With improvement in sequencing technology and increase in data availability in the future, the proposed method provides an economical, rapid, and reliable way in which to identify water sample sources based on abundance data of microbial communities.

AB This research aims to compare the disinfection and degradation effectiveness in water of a commercial suspension of nano-TiO2 (TiO(2)Levenger) with the standard TiO(2)Degussa P25. Photo-inactivation and photo-degradation experiments were conducted with UVA-vis light. Concerning the disinfection, the effects of TiO2 dose (0-2 g/l), water matrix, bacterium type (Gram-positive or Gram-negative), and bacterial regrowth after the photo-treatments were studied for each catalyst. The experimental results show that Enterococcus sp. (Gram-positive) was more resistant to the photo-treatments than Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) for both catalyst; however, postirradiation trends showed similar behavior for both bacteria, favoring regrowth for short-treated cells and decay for longer-treated ones. Caffeine was selected as a model substance of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. In terms of caffeine removal, the effects of TiO2 dose (0-2 g/l) and water matrix were analyzed. Besides, the comparison between mechanical coagulation-flocculation-decantation and simple decantation of TiO2 was carried out. The results show that simple decantation allowed the recovery of 97.5% of TiO2 Degussa P25 and TiO2 Levenger within 1 day of simple decantation, while applying the proposed mechanical coagulation-flocculation decantation 99.7% of recovery of both catalysts was achieved in 2 hours. Finally, the subsequent reuse of both catalysts was proved with little loss of efficiency in terms of photo-disinfection during the four cycles. Nevertheless, the standard TiO2 Degussa P25 photo-degradation efficiency of caffeine decreases considerably as compared to commercial suspension of TiO2 Levenger concerning the reutilization.

AB Modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) and screen printed electrode (SPE) based on ethyl benzoyl acetate (EBA) were prepared and investigated as lanthanum ion selective electrodes. Effect of various plasticizers (o-NPOE, TCP, DBP, DOS, and DOP) and ionophore content was studied. The reaction mechanism between La(III) and beta-diketone ionophore at the electrode surface was studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and IR spectra measurement. The best performance was obtained using modified SPE and CPE electrodes with o-NPOE and TCP plasticizers. These electrodes showed potentiometric response with a Nernstian slope of 21.0, 19.5 and 20.5 mV decade(-1) over a concentration range from 1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1 with a fast response time of 9, 10 and 13 s over the linear concentration range for modified SPE (electrode I; TCP plasticizer) and two modified CPE plasticized with o-NPOE (electrode II) and TCP (electrode III), respectively. The electrodes exhibited constant potentiometric response in pH range 4-8, 5-8 and 4-7 for electrodes I, II and III, respectively. They showed satisfactory good sensitivity toward lanthanum ions with regard to most common transition metal ions. The sensors were applied for determination of La(III) ion in different water samples (tap water and wastewater) with satisfactory and good reproducibility results. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The industrial production unavoidably generates waste in many cases but that should be recycled and reused following the principle of circular economy. New waste treatment methods or green technologies with zero waste should be developed in order to solve this problem. Since zero emission technology is a difficult task, it is rather typical that waste treatment process is developed. A typical example can be found in pharmaceutical industries because these plants generate wastewaters with high organic content, so-called process wastewaters (PWWs). These waters should be definitely treated before discharging, their organic content must be removed and then the PWW may be usually allowed into the sewer. Nowadays, the physicochemical methods are increasingly used since they have a smaller footprint compared with that of the biological treatments. On the other hand, the polluting organic substances can be recovered and recycled or reused. In our novel method, distillation is applied that is based on relative volatility differences of the individual components. The more volatile organic pollutants of the treated PWWs are obtained as the top product of the distillation, preferably in reusable form. The bottom product of distillation, namely the PWW should satisfy the discharge limits. Our novel innovative method is developed to remove and reuse the organically bound halogens and to reduce the chemical oxygen demand below the emission limit of PWWs. Our method is implemented and this well-planned industrial apparatus meets the requirement of the Sustainable Water Solutions and Circular Economy, and moreover the payback time of the investment is less than 2 years.

AB Photodegradation of estrone (E1) was investigated under simulated solar radiation in absence and presence of the different fractions of humic substances (HS), namely humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and XAD-4 fraction. The pseudo-first order photodegradation rate constants increased from 0.1137 h(-1), in ultrapure (MQ) water, to 0.1774, 0.1943 and 0.3109 h(-1), in presence of HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. Half-life time decreased from 6.10 h in MQ water to 3.91, 3.57 and 2.23 h in presence of HA, FA and XAD-4, respectively. These results evidence the relevant photosensitizing effect of XAD-4 fraction of HS on the degradation of E1, which, to the best of our knowledge have never been studied.
   Photodegradation studies were also conducted in organic matter-rich environmental aquatic matrices, namely fresh, estuarine and waste water. After 2 h, photodegradation achieved values ranged between 35.6 and 57.1% in natural water samples, compared with 26.4% in ultrapure water. The higher photo degradation occurred in an estuarine water sample, known to be rich in XAD-4 fraction and poor in HA, indicating that not only the presence of organic matter, but also its type, are determinant in the E1 photodegradation rate.
   Finally, the use of sodium azide as singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) scavenger during the phototransformation of E1 in ultrapure and in two wastewater samples allowed to conclude that O-1(2) has an important role in the E1 photodegradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Monitoring for contaminants of emerging concern in drinking water using
   POCIS passive samplers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER; PHARMACEUTICALS; CALIBRATION; RATES
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) have been detected in drinking water world-wide. The source of most of these compounds is generally attributed to contamination from municipal wastewater. Traditional water sampling methods (grab or composite) often require the concentration of large amounts of water in order to detect trace levels of these contaminants. The Polar Organic Compounds Integrative Sampler (POCIS) is a passive sampling technology that has been developed to concentrate trace levels of CEC to provide time-weighted average concentrations for individual compounds in water. However, few studies to date have evaluated whether POCIS is suitable for monitoring contaminants in drinking water. In this study, the POCIS was evaluated as a monitoring tool for CEC in drinking water over a period of 2 and 4 weeks with comparisons to typical grab samples. Seven "indicator compounds" which included carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, estrone and sucralose, were monitored in five drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in Ontario. All indicator compounds were detected in raw water samples from the POCIS in comparison to six from grab samples. Similarly, four compounds were detected in grab samples of treated drinking water, whereas six were detected in the POCIS. Sucralose was the only compound that was detected consistently at all five plants. The POCIS technique provided integrative exposures of CECs in drinking water at lower detection limits, while episodic events were captured via traditional sampling methods. There was evidence that the accumulation of target compounds by POCIS is a dynamic process, with adsorption and desorption on the sorbent occurring in response to ambient levels of the target compounds in water. CECs in treated drinking water were present at low ng L-1 concentrations, which are not considered to be a threat to human health.

AB The homogeneous advanced oxidation process UV/H2O2, using UV radiation (lambda = 254 nm) at low H2O2 concentration, was studied at bench scale for the treatment of secondary effluent spiked with atrazine. The transformation of the effluent organic matter in terms of its biodegradability, atrazine and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal was investigated. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) scavenging and radiation scattering are discussed, along with a rough estimation of treatment costs in terms of energy requirements. The results demonstrated that an UV/H2O2 process at low H2O2 initial dose ([H2O2](0) = 5 mg L-1 and photonic flow = 14.9 mu Einstein s(-1)) was effective in removing 100 mu g L-1 of atrazine in secondary effluent, although hydroxyl radical scavenging was quantified at about 60% of the hydroxyl radical production. Effluent organic compounds were responsible for 85% of the total hydroxyl radical scavenging and for the 12-fold reduction of the atrazine removal rate. Moreover, the natural matrix affected directly the energy required by the lamps to produce (OH)-O-center dot, which increased more than tenfold in relation to deionizal water. Low doses of H2O2 were unable to promote biodegradability increment in secondary effluents, although H2O2/DOC ratios over 3 achieved significant mineralization of effluent organic matter (higher than 50%). At a low H2O2 concentration, the system removes micropollutants without any significant modification of secondary effluents (SE) physic-chemical parameters. However, there will be less elimination of more recalcitrant micropollutants, due to the greater (OH)-O-center dot scavenging than when there are higher H2O2 dosages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ibuprofen is amongst the most worldwide consumed pharmaceuticals. The present work presents the first data in the occurrence of ibuprofen in Portuguese surface waters, focusing in the north area of the country, which is one of the most densely populated areas of Portugal. Analysis of ibuprofen is based on pre-concentration of the analyte with solid phase extraction and subsequent determination with liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection. A total of 42 water samples, including surface waters, landfill leachates, Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), and hospital effluents, were analyzed in order to evaluate the occurrence of ibuprofen in the north of Portugal. In general, the highest concentrations were found in the river mouths and in the estuarine zone. The maximum concentrations found were 48,720 ngL(-1) in the landfill leachate, 3,868 ngL(-1) in hospital effluent, 616 ngL(-1) in WWTP effluent, and 723 ngL(-1) in surface waters (Lima river). Environmental risk assessment was evaluated and at the measured concentrations only landfill leachates reveal potential ecotoxicological risk for aquatic organisms. Owing to a high consumption rate of ibuprofen among Portuguese population, as prescribed and non-prescribed medicine, the importance of hospitals, WWTPs, and landfills as sources of entrance of pharmaceuticals in the environment was pointed out. Landfill leachates showed the highest contribution for ibuprofen mass loading into surface waters. On the basis of our findings, more studies are needed as an attempt to assess more vulnerable areas.

AB Nitroglycerin (NC), a nitrate ester, is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as an explosive in dynamite and as propellant. Currently NC is considered as a key environmental contaminant due to the discharge of wastewater tainted with the chemical from the military and pharmaceutical industry. The present study describes hydrolytic degradation of NC (200 mu M) at pH 9 using either conventional or microwave-assisted heating at 50 degrees C. We found that hydrolytic degradation of NC inside the microwave chamber was much higher than its degradation using conventional heating. Products distributions in both heating systems were closely related and included nitrite, nitrate, formic acid, and the novel intermediates 2-hydroxypropanedial (O=CHCH(OH)HC=O) and glycolic acid (CH(2)(OH)COOH). Two other intermediates glycolaldehyde (CH(2)(OH)CHO) and glyoxylic acid (CHOCOOH) were only detected in the microwave treated samples. The molar ratio of nitrite to nitrate in the presence and absence of microwave heating was 2.5 and 2.8, respectively. In both microwave assisted and conventional heating a nitrogen mass balance of 96% and 98% and a carbon mass balance of 58% and 78%, respectively, were obtained. The lower C mass recovery might be attributed to further unknown reactions, e.g., polymerization of the aldehydes CH(2)(OH)CHO. CHOCOOH and O=CHCH(OH)HC=O. A hydrolytic degradation pathway for NC was proposed involving denitration (loss of 2 NO(2)(-)) from the two primary carbons and the loss of one nitrate from the secondary carbon to produce 2-hydroxypropanedial.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and azithromycin (AZ) are commonly prescribed antibiotics for various infections in humans and are frequently detected in biosolids. Ecological and human health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ are not well understood, but necessary for formulating policies on safe use and management of biosolids. A tiered integrated risk assessment (IRA), based on the World Health Organization (WHO) framework and the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule, was conducted to assess human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ. The IRA utilized the hazard quotient (HQ) approach to evaluate risks to various receptors of concern (including humans, animals, and birds) in sixteen exposure pathways and three conservative biosolids land application scenarios. The scenarios consisted of (i) single-heavy (100 Mg ha(-1)) land application of biosolids containing 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ (USEPA, 2009), (ii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing typical (median; USEPA, 2009) CIP or AZ concentrations, and (iii) long-term (annual for 40-y) land application of biosolids containing the 95th percentile concentrations of CIP or AZ. The unrealistically conservative screening level (Tier 1) assessment identified three pathways of potential concern: biosolids -> soil -> plant (CIP); biosolids -> soil -> soil organism (CIP and AZ); and biosolids -> soil -> soil organism -> predator (CIP and AZ). Subsequent tier (refined; more realistic) assessments and pollutant limits (calculated based on the USEPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule) suggested negligible human and ecological health risks from biosolids-borne CIP and AZ under real-world biosolids application scenarios. Pollutant concentration limits were 12 mg CIP kg(-1) and 2.2 mg AZ kg(-1); suggesting that pollutant load tracking is not needed for the majority (75% for CIP and 90% for AZ) of USA biosolids. Biosolids-bome antibiotic resistance (currently not addressed in any risk assessment model) is the principal uncertainty limiting risk assessment of biosolids-bome antibiotics including CIP and AZ.

AB Clofibric acid (CA) is an active metabolite of the blood lipid lowering agent clofibrate, a pharmaceutical designed to work as agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa). It is the most commonly reported fibrate in aquatic environments with low degradation rate and potential environmental persistence. Previous fish exposures showed that CA may impact spermatogenesis, growth and the expression of fat binding protein genes. However, there are limited data on the effects of chronic multigenerational CA exposures.
   Here, we assessed chronic multigenerational effects of CA exposure using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a teleost model. Zebrafish were exposed through the diet to CA (1 and 10 mg/g) during their whole lifetime. Growth, reproduction-related parameters and embryonic development were assessed in the exposed fish (F1 generation) and their offspring (F2 generation), together with muscle triglyceride content and gonad histology. In order to study the potential underlying mechanisms, the transcription levels of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism pathways were determined.
   The results show that chronic life-cycle exposure to CA induced a significant reduction in growth of F1 generation and lowered triglyceride muscle content (10 mg/g group). Also, an impact in male gonad development was observed together with a decrease in the fecundity (10 mg/g group) and higher frequency of embryo abnormalities in the offspring of fish exposed to the lowest CA dose.
   The profile of the target genes was sex- and tissue-dependent. In F1 an up-regulation of male hepatic pparaa, pparb and acox transcript levels was observed, suggesting an activation of the fatty acid metabolism (provided that transcript level change indicates also a protein level change). Interestingly, the F2 generation, raised with control diet, displayed a response pattern different from that observed in F1, showing an increase in weight in the descendants of CA exposed fish, in comparison with control animals, which points to a multigenerational effect.

AB The release of pharmaceutical products, especially antibiotics, into natural waters has become one of the main environmental concerns in recent years. Amoxicillin (AMX) is widely used in the treatment of human infections and is commonly detected in domestic and industrial wastewater. This work aims to study the elimination of AMX using functional water-soluble polymers (FSP) assisted by ultrafiltration membranes through the washing and enrichment method. For this, three polymers with different charge ratios (cationic:anionic) of 2:1 (FSP-1), 1:2 (FSP-2) and 1:1 (FSP-3) were synthesized. Polymers were synthesized by radical polymerization and characterized by FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Removal studies were carried out evaluating variables such as pH, ionic strength, concentration of FSP and AMX. Through the washing method, it was found that the conditions with the highest removal efficiency for FSP-1 was 97% at pH 11.0, molar ratio (40:1), and 100 mg L(-1)AMX, FSP-2 of 72% at pH 3.0, molar ratio (40:1), and 40 mg L-1 of AMX; while FSP-3 was 82% at pH 7.0, molar ratio (100:1), and 40 mg L-1 of AMX. Meanwhile, the maximum removal capacity obtained by the enrichment method was 705.8, 385.3, and 397.8 mg g(-1) FSP-1, FSP-2 and FSP-3, respectively. The results suggest that FSPs coupled to ultrafiltration membranes are an alternative for the environmental remediation of antibiotic-type contaminants such as AMX. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study is on photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical residues of atenolol (ATL) and acetaminophen (ACT) present in secondary effluent under visible light irradiation stimulated by Ag doped ZnO (Ag-ZnO) photocatalyst. Lawsonia inermis leaf extract was used for reduction of Zinc sulphate to ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). Further, ZnO NPs were doped with Ag and characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDX, surface area analyzer, UV-Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry to analyze the structure, morphology, chemical composition, and optical property. FT-IR analysis revealed major functional groups such as OH, C=O, and SEM analysis depicted the polyhedron shape of the NPs with size range of 100 nm. Ag-ZnO NPs were used in the photocatalytic degradation of ATL and ACT, and its removal was evaluated by varying initial contaminant concentration, catalyst dosage, and initial pH. Findings indicate that Ag-ZnO NPs demonstrated relative narrow bandgap and efficient charge separation that resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination. The photocatalytic degradation of ATL and ACT fitted well with pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Further, it was found that under optimal conditions of 5 mg/L of contaminants, pH of 8.5, and catalyst dose of 1 g/L, degradation efficiency of 70.2% (ATL) and 90.8% (ACT) was achieved for a reaction time of 120 min. More than 60% reduction in TOC was observed for both contaminants and OH center dot pathway was found to be the major removal process. Ag-ZnO photocatalyst showed good recycling performance, and these findings indicate that it could be cost effectively employed for removing emerging contaminants under visible light radiation.

AB In this study, the visible-light-driven Z-scheme g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/rGO heterojunctions with 2D/2D/2D configurations are prepared via a facile, rapid and low temperature microwave-assisted method. The physicochemical properties and morphologies of these heterostructured photocatalysts are characterized by various spectroscopies such as XRD, XPS, TEM/SEM, PL, FT-IR, UV-Visible spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The prepared g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/3 wt% rGO photocatalysts (incorporated with optimal 3 wt% of rGO) possess ca. 86 and 98% of ibuprofen (IBF) photodegradation under the visible light (lambda > 420 nm) and solar light irradiation, respectively. The formation of well crystallized structure, morphology (nanoplates structure of Bi2WO6), higher visible light absorption and specific surface area (25.4 m(2) g(-1)) are responsible for the superior performance of g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/3 wt% rGO. Moreover, the larger interfacial contact (identified by HRTEM) between triple 2D g-C3N4/Bi2WO6/rGO heterostructures can lead to surpassing interfacial charge carrier dynamics and reduce the combination of electron-hole pairs. IBF photodegradation intermediates and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are further investigated by using LC-MS/MS, indicating the superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) are involved in the photodegradation of IBF and accordingly five intermediates are produced via three possible reaction pathways. The anti-hormonal effects of IBF and the photodegraded intermediate products are also evaluated by yeast-based bioassays. The results show that the intermediate products of photodegraded IBF have lower antagonistic effect on human hormone receptors than the pristine IBF.

AB Microalgae have been largely considered for biofuel production; however, further research focusing on its wide potential also in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries is still scarce. It is a promising raw material for several bioproducts, due to high growth rate, CO2 biofixation, and nutrient assimilation from wastewater and does not require large areas for cultivation compared to conventional crops. This study characterized six microalgae (Chlorella sp., C. vulgaris, Desmodesmus sp., D. brasiliensis, Botryococcus braunii, and B. terribilis) regarding growth parameters, total protein, carbohydrate, lipid, ash, and chlorophyll contents. The focus was lipid composition; thus, detailed results of fatty acid profile and polar lipid identification in total lipids are presented. The highest biomass productivity (42.6 mg L-1 day(-1)) and third highest lipid content (21.9%) were achieved by C. vulgaris, with 23.0% alpha -linolenic and 5.6% gamma -linolenic in total fatty acids. Both are of interest for food and pharmaceutical industries and a vegan alternative to currently consumed fish oil. B. braunii showed higher lipid accumulation, oleic acid as the major fatty acid, but significantly low growth rate. B. terribilis presented intense lipid accumulation, at intra- and extracellular levels, but a high percentage of lipids should be hydrocarbons. Lipid and biomass characterization identified different bioproducts and high-value food additives that could be explored to establish a multi-product biorefinery instead of focusing exclusively on biodiesel production, which has been extensively studied but is not economic competitive in the current market.

AB Phenolic compounds are chemicals that appear quite frequently across a broad spectrum of industrial process streams and wastewaters such as those from the pharmaceutical, petrochemical and refineries, plastics, wood, paint, and paper industries. As phenol is both toxic and harmful to the environment, the discharge and disposal of wastewater containing phenol is strictly regulated across the world, leading to the universal need of treating phenolic wastewaters for their discharge and reuse. The aim of this paper was the study of phenol removal by adsorption with polymer resin DOWEX OPTIPORE (TM) L493 Adsorbent, focusing on the typical stumbling blocks of adsorption technologies: removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and resin recovery. The potential of this resin for phenol removal was evaluated under different conditions at laboratory scale in packed-bed glass columns. Findings show that phenol removal was highly efficient, reaching values of 99.9% removal in single/solute studies and at least 95% in natural samples with high concentrations of additional total organic carbon. Equilibrium studies were carried out in order to build isotherm curves at 30 degrees C and 60 degrees C. The adsorption isotherm parameters were determined for various isotherm models through linear and nonlinear regression. Regeneration through temperature desorption has been tested on this resin, showing that quantitative desorption of phenol is possible at moderate temperature and pressure (100 degrees C, 1 bar). In conclusion, the results have identified DOWEX OPTIPORE (TM) L493 as an appropriate adsorbent for phenol, which shows great potential as an alternative to less environmentally friendly materials.

AB The direct discharge of improperly treated effluent from sago industry poses a great threat to water bodies due to the high amount of organic matter. This work investigated ZnO photocatalytic degradation under aerated and non-aerated conditions, and photo-Fenton aiming to reduce the chemical oxygen demand in sago effluent. Photolysis of sago effluent in the presence of ultraviolet irradiation and aeration resulted in 68% of the chemical oxygen demand removal. The results indicate high chemical oxygen demand reductions for different concentrations of sago effluent at 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 diluted with distilled water following the ZnO photocatalytic treatment under the aerated conditions. The chemical oxygen demand reductions of 90-95% and 85% were obtained using 3 g/L of ZnO, after 2 h of aerated and non-aerated photocatalytic treatments, respectively, for the sago effluent ratio of 1:1000. On the other hand, the combination of the most concentrated sago effluent at 1:10 and non-aerated ZnO photocatalytic treatment resulted in no appreciable chemical oxygen demand reduction at only 8%. The concentrations of Fe2+ (10-60 mM) and H2O2 (50-150 mM) greatly influenced the degradation rates of chemical oxygen demand. The optimum parameters of 10 mM of Fe2+ and 50 mM of H2O2 were able to reduce 97% of the chemical oxygen demand of the 1:1000 sago effluent under the photo-Fenton treatment with 2 h of ultraviolet irradiation. Thus, both ZnO photocatalysis and photo-Fenton can be applied as the possible treatment methods to reduce the chemical oxygen demand in effluent from sago processing.

ID DESALINATION
AB Water scarceness has become a serious dispute in many countries now-a-days. So it is necessary for every individual to conserve water in their day to day domestic activities. Industries must be equipped with proper water treatment and recycling units with the intention of recycling water used by them. Thereby the recycled water should be meritoriously reused for other purposes. Industries like Dye and Pharmaceutical industries should be compulsorily equipped with waste water treatment plants, for example Reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Reverse osmosis systems plays a crucial chunk in wastewater treatment thus reducing the silt density index, hydroxyl ion concentration, etc. Generally reverse osmosis systems are used for providing ultra-fine purified water from saline water, waste water and also conduit water. Reverse osmosis systems bear a simple user-friendly setup and are easy to operate in all problems expository situations effectively. Hence it is clear that a pertinent control mechanism should be followed for the competent functioning of the process. This work focuses on the design and implementation of an Active disturbance rejection control system (ADRC) on an experimental RO membrane water system to address large set-point changes and variations in feed water. The transfer function of the system is to be formulated by suitable mathematical modelling of the reverse osmosis process and the outcome is corroborated with the System Identification toolbox available in MATLAB, with the help of real time observed values. This model then was used as the basis for the design of a nonlinear Active disturbance control system, using geometric control techniques.

AB Alternative processes need to be designed for the treatment of industrial effluents containing pharmaceutical and personal care products to improve their quality, permit the reuse of water for industrial applications and meet the standards set by environmental regulations prior to discharge. This type of effluent is a major source of water pollution since conventional activated sludge-based treatments are not effective in removing micropollutants.
   Carbamazepine, caffeine and triclosan are important trace contaminants commonly found in wastewater treatment plants, and were selected as target compounds to be treated in a cyclic anoxic/aerobic membrane bioreactor. This study aims to evaluate the biomass' characteristics and activity, and its influence over membrane fouling when treating the aforementioned compounds. Caffeine is known to be partially biodegraded whereas triclosan can inhibit microorganism's activity. In order to evaluate this effect, complimentary batch experiments were set up to determine whether triclosan might inhibit nitrification.
   Low ammonia removal efficiencies were observed in both experimental systems, therefore suggesting that nitrification was being inhibited probably due to the presence of triclosan. The ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor process demonstrated to be an efficient and appropriate technology for chemical oxygen demand removal, achieving an average of 97%, for caffeine reaching up to 93.7 +/- 9.7 removal efficiencies, and 89.7 +/- 8.3% for triclosan. For carbamazepine the removal was lower (36.2 +/- 6.8%) due to its recalcitrance. Furthermore, biomass filterability indicators displayed high sludge deterioration increasing substantially the fouling. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A scientific advisory panel was convened by the State of California to recommend monitoring for chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic systems that receive discharge of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and stormwater runoff. The panel developed a risk-based screening framework that considered environmental sources and fate of CECs observed in receiving waters across the State. Using existing occurrence and risk threshold data in water, sediment, and biological tissue, the panel applied the framework to identify a priority list of CECs for initial monitoring in three representative receiving water scenarios. The initial screening list of 16 CECs identified by the panel included consumer and commercial chemicals, flame retardants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and natural hormones. The panel designed an iterative, phased strategy with interpretive guidelines that direct and update management actions commensurate with potential risk identified using the risk-based framework and monitoring data. Because of the ever-changing nature of chemical use, technology, and management practices, the panel offered recommendations to improve CEC monitoring, including development of bioanalytical screening methods whose responses integrate exposure to complex mixtures and that can be linked to higher-order effects; development or refinement of models that predict the input, fate, and effects of future chemicals; and filling of key data gaps on CEC occurrence and toxicity. Finally, the panel stressed the need for adaptive management, allowing for future review of, and if warranted, modifications to the strategy to incorporate the latest science available to the water resources community.

AB The conversion of the antibiotic ofloxacin and the beta-blocker atenolol by means of TiO2 photocatalysis was investigated. Irradiation was provided by a UVA lamp at 3.37 x 10(-6) einstein/s photon flux, while emphasis was given on the effect of catalyst type and loading (50-1500 mg/L), initial substrate concentration (5-20 mg/L), initial pH (3-10) and the effect of H2O2 (0.07-1.4 mM) as an additional oxidant on substrate conversion and mineralization in various matrices (i.e. pure water, groundwater and treated municipal effluent). Conversion was assessed measuring sample absorbance at 288 and 224 nm for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while mineralization measuring the dissolved organic carbon. Degussa P25 TiO2 was found to be more active than other TiO2 samples for either substrate degradation, with ofloxacin being more reactive than atenolol. Conversion generally increased with increasing catalyst loading, decreasing initial substrate concentration and adding H2O2, while the effect of solution pH was substrate-specific. Reaction rates, following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression, were maximized at a catalyst to substrate concentration ratio (w/w) of 50 and 15 for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while higher ratios led to reduced efficiency. Likewise, high concentrations of H2O2 had an adverse effect on reaction, presumably due to excessive oxidant scavenging radicals and other reactive species. The ecotoxicity of ofloxacin and atenolol to freshwater species Daphnia mayna was found to increase with increasing substrate concentration (1-10 mg/L) and exposure time (2448 h), with atenolol being more toxic than ofloxacin. Photocatalytic treatment eliminated nearly completely toxicity and this was more pronounced for atenolol. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of the present study was to evaluate the immobilization and retention of caffeine (CFN) in soil and the influence of biochar for the CFN transport in agricultural soil. The biochar was produced from the Ulva reticulata seaweed biomass (ULBC) under the slow-pyrolysis with a heating rate of 7 degrees C/min at 500 degrees C and characterized using XRD and FTIR. The CFN retention and transport abilities in loamy sand and ULBC amended (2.5%) soil were evaluated under various pH values range of 3-10 and at various CFN concentrations using batch and column experiments. The surface orientation of ULBC was portrayed as the randomized distribution of hetero and homogeneous nature. The highest retention capacity (40 mu g/g) was obtained at pH 4.0. Soil amendment with ULBC shows a higher retention affinity towards CFN, of up to 150 mu g/g than soil, with minimal pH dependence. The maximum CFN adsorption capacities of soil and amended soils were 420 and 820 mu g/g, respectively, based on the Langmuir model. Batch experiments suggested the adsorption of CFN by the biochar amended loamy soil is governed by the electrostatic attraction. The column experiment data demonstrated a high transport potential of CFN in the loamy sand; however, a strong cumulative reduction of transport (58%) was observed with the application of ULBC into the loamy sand. Thus, the addition of seaweed biochar as an amendment in soils with biosolids and wastewater irrigation may reduce the mobilization of CFN to the aquatic system and possibly reduce plant uptake.

ID BREAST-CANCER; WASTE-WATER; BY-PRODUCTS
AB Parabens are alkyl esters of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, which is derived from a family of synthetic esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Among all the kinds of paraben, two parabens (methyl paraben, MP; and npropyl paraben, PP) are the most generally used as preservatives in personal care products, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food also, and are often presented together. However, a number of studies have reported that the toxicity of parabens affects the water environment, and human as well. This study utilized M13 phage display technology to provide easy, efficient, and relatively inexpensive methods to identify peptides that bind to MP and PP, respectively, to remove in wastewater. At first, biopanning was performed, to sort MP and PP specific binding phages, and three cases of experiment, including negative control (NC), which could sort unspecific binding phage, were conducted at the same time. Phage binding affinity tests were substituted by concentration reduction using antibody conjugated magnetic beads, and paraben concentration was measured by HPLC. Analysis showed that the MP concentration reduction of 38% was the highest in M4 phage, while the PP concentration reduction of 44% was the highest in P3 phage. We successfully screened two peptides specific to MP and PP, namely, MP4 and PP3, respectively; the results showed that the MP concentration reduction in MP4 was the highest at 44%, and the PP concentration reduction in PP3 was the highest at 39%, and their specificity was measured by the capture rate between target and control. In conclusion, the phage display technique shows applicability to the removal of parabens in water; furthermore, it also shows the possibility of the detection or removal of other chemicals.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of two pharmaceuticals, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole, and their binary mixture on aquatic organisms, marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri, crustacean Daphnia magna, and vascular plant Lemna minor. The binary mixture of the drugs showed the highest toxicity towards the model organisms. Diclofenac had an average toxicity which posed a high environmental risk to aquatic organisms, while sulfamethoxazole was characterized by a low toxicity with low environmental risk. The organism most sensitive to diclofenac was A. fischeri (IC50 = 8.72 +/- 1.14 mg L-1) and for sulfamethoxazole and the binary mixture, it was L. minor (IC50 = 12.56 +/- 4.48 and 4.83 +/- 0.43 mg L-1, respectively). The toxicity of the mixture was predicted using the Concentration Addition and Independent Action models, and the results were compared with the experimental data. None of the models suitably predicted the real toxicity of the pharmaceutical mixture. Interactions between the mixture components were confirmed by calculating the mixture toxicity index values which showed that the pharmaceuticals displayed synergistic or partial additive effects which depended on the selected test organism and test duration. When added as a complex matrix to wastewater (at a concentration of 2 mg L-1 each), the pharmaceuticals did not display increased toxicity. This observation confirms that the presence of micro-contaminants in aquatic environments may cause interactions between different compounds, the results of which are difficult to predict and model.

AB Nanorods of zinc oxide photocatalyst are fabricated through a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal method as a green preparation process in comparison with the conventional hydrothermal method. The influence of the preparation method on the morphological, structural, and optical properties of the prepared materials is investigated. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanorod is tested against the degradation of some dyes and pharmaceuticals under the solar simulator. XRD data showed that ZnO NRs exhibited a hexagonal wurtzite phase. Photoluminescence of ZnO-S2 revealed a noticeable separation of photo-generated charged carriers and delaying their recombination. The bandgaps of samples ZnO-S1 and ZnO-S2 are calculated by using UV-DRS spectroscopic measurements and found to be 3.22 and 2.96 eV, respectively. All results confirmed that the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method is a more effective and green preparation process than hydrothermal one for ZnO nanorods production. It is found that samples prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal method (ZnO-S2) showed a higher degradation rate for MB than that prepared by hydrothermal one (ZnO-S1). Microwave-assisted ZnO-S2 showed complete degradation of other different dyes; Acid red, Remazol red, and Rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight indicating non-selectivity of photocatalytic activity for ZnO nanorods. However, the analgesic pharmaceuticals and antibiotics compounds are completely degraded over microwave-assisted ZnO-S2 after 90 min of light irradiation. Furthermore, it is found that the degradation activity of prepared ZnO nanorods fitted with the first-order kinetic. As well, the result displayed that inorganic ions hinder the photocatalytic degradation of dyes with the following the order; phosphate ions > chloride ions > sulfate ions approximate to nitrate ions.

AB Tramadol (TRA) is a widely used human pharmaceutical and a well-established emerging pollutant and its potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on humans as well as its fate in aqueous systems demand full investigation. The present study is a multidisciplinary approach and provides important insights on the potential risks of Tramadol on humans accompanied by its photolytic transformation under simulated solar irradiation. The present study revealed that Tramadol can induce genotoxic and cytotoxic effects under the specific experimental conditions, significantly depended on the tested concentration. In addition, the photolytic transformation of Tramadol was investigated in detail under simulated solar irradiation in two different water matrices: ultrapure water (UW) and treated wastewater (WW). Differences in the degradation rates were observed between UW and WW, being slower in WW. The results showed that more than 70% of Tramadol was removed after 240 min in UW ([TRA] = 10 mg L-1, I = 500 W m(-2)). After this period, TOC removal was found to be about 40%. Transformation of N atoms into NO3 and NH4+ followed a similar trend reaching up to 38% release. Tramadol degraded mainly by HO center dot radicals and O-1(2) through a self-sensitizing process while direct photolysis was also significant. Hydroxylation, demethylation and N-oxidation of the parent compound were found to be the main degradation pathways confirming the important role of HO and O-1(2) in the photolytic process. Toxicity measurements showed a noticeable increase of the inhibition for Vibrio fischeri at the first stages which coincide with the formation of the major TPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study was aimed at the degradation of sulfonamides (SNs) via oxidation with Fe(VI). The reaction kinetics, identification of degradation byproducts and their toxicity were investigated. The pH solution and Fe(VI) loading had significant effects on the degradation of the sulfonamides. The maximum degradation rate occurred at pH 3.0 with a 6:1 ratio Fe(VI): sulfonamide, obtaining 100% degradation of 15 mg L-1 SN within 5 min. Although Fe (VI) also showed an appreciable reactivity towards SNs (k(app) = 9.85-19.63 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) at pH 7. The influence of solution pH on the values of keep can be explained considering the specific reaction between Fe(VI) and SNs. Degradation rates are also influenced by the presence of inorganic ions in different water matrixes. For this reason, ions present in groundwater enhanced the SNs degradation through a synergistic effect among carbonates, sulfates and Fe(VI).
   Degradation byproducts identified, through UPLC analysis, allowed us to proposed three degradation pathways depending on pH. At acid pH there is a cleavage of C-S and S-N bonds. At neutral pH nitroso and nitro-derivates are formed. At basic pH hydroxylation is the main reaction.
   The cytotoxicity assay of HEK-293 and J774 cell lines exposed to Fe(VI) indicated that transformation byproducts had a lower toxicity than SNs as baseline products. Accordingly, this research suggests that Fe(VI) can act as a chemical oxidant to remove SNs antibiotics and it can be used to treat antibiotic pollution in wastewater.

AB The Hooghly River (HR) estuary is the first deltaic off-shoot of the perennial and transboundary river, Ganga, India. HR receives industrial and domestic waste along with storm-water run-off from Kolkata city and the adjoining districts. Organic micropollutants (OMPs) have been collectively termed for plasticizers, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are extensively consumed and disposed in the waste streams. Hence emerging OMPs were investigated to obtain the first baseline data from the Hooghly riverine sediment (HRS) along urban and suburban transects using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentration range of OMPs in the HRS varied between 3 and 519 ng/g for carbamazepine, 5-407 ng/g for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2-26 ng/g for musk ketone, 2-84 ng/g for triclosan, 2-199 ng/g for bisphenol A (BPA), 2-422 ng/g for plasticizers (phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA)) and 87-593 ng/g for parabens. Carbamazepine concentration in sediment was an useful marker for untreated wastewater in urban waterways. High concentrations of BPA and PAEs in the suburban industrial corridor together with significant correlation between these two type of OMPs (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.01) likely reflect a common source, possibly associated with the plastic and electronic scrap recycling industries. Among all the categories of OMPs, plasticizers seems to exhibit maximum screening level ecological risk through out the study area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel carbon quantum dots modified potassium titanate nanotubes (CQDs/K2Ti6O13) composite photocatalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment combined with calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated formation of potassium titanate nanotubes and successful deposition of CQDs onto K2Ti6O13. The photocatalytic performance of CQDs/K2Ti6O13 composite was evaluated by degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) under the irradiation of visible light and lights with the wavelengths of 365, 385, 420, 450, 485, 520, 595 and 630 nm. The results showed that the photocatalytic activity of CQDs/K2Ti6O13 hybrid material was greatly enhanced compared with the neat K2Ti6O13 calcined at 300 degrees C. The narrowed band gap energy (E-g) and transfer of photo-excited electron by CQDs inhibited the immediate combination of electron-hole pairs, thus promoting photocatalytic activity. Moreover, CQDs/K2Ti6O13 exhibited a broad spectrum of photocatalytic ability and it was interesting that the photocatalytic activity decreased with the increase of the irradiation wavelength. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching tests suggested the hole (h(+)) and hydroxyl radical (OH) played the primary roles in photocatalytic degradation of AMX. Moreover, CQDs/K2Ti6O13 showed good reusability for AMX photocatalytic degradation after five successive runs. This study proposed an available method for titanate nanomaterials modification, and the developed novel CQDs/K2Ti6O13 hybrid material is promising for potential application on antibiotics removal from water and wastewater.

AB The degradation of diclofenac (DCF), trimethoprim (TMP), carbamazepine (CBZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by laccase from Trametes versicolor was investigated. Experiments were conducted using the pharmaceuticals individually, or as a mixture at different initial concentrations (1.25 and 5 mg/L each). The initial enzymatic activity of all the treated samples was around 430-460 U-(DMP)/L. The removal of the four selected pharmaceuticals tested individually was more effective than when tested in mixtures under the same conditions. For example, 5 mg DCF/L was completely removed to below its detection limit (1 mu g/L) within 8 h in the individual experiment vs. after 24 h when dosed as a mixture with the other pharmaceuticals. A similar trend was visible with other three pharmaceuticals, with 95 vs. 39%, 82 vs. 34% and 56 vs. 49% removal after 48 h with 5 mg/L of TMP, CBZ, and SMX tested individually or as mixtures, respectively. In addition, at the lower initial concentration (1.25 mg/L each), the removal efficiency of TMP, CBZ, and SMX in mixtures was lower than that obtained at the higher initial concentrations (5 mg/L each) during both the individual and combined treatments. Four enzymatic transformation products (TPs) were identified during the individual treatments of DCF and CBZ by T. versicolor. For TMP and SMX, no major TPs were observed under the experimental conditions used. The toxicity of the solution before and after enzymatic treatment of each pharmaceutical was also assessed and all treated effluent samples were verified to be non-toxic.

AB Recent regulation policies are focusing on the presence of priority and emerging pollutants in water, among them, pharmaceutical residues are of particular public concern since trace of these molecules is commonly found in drinking and superficial waters. Progresses in innovative technologies for wastewater treatment are mandatory in order to improve their abatement efficiencies for water source prevention and reclamation. The OH-based technologies, a group of different techniques usually called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), can be used to mineralize organic pollutants. In particular, combined treatments based on UV light appear to be more eco-friendly, also giving very interesting removal efficiencies if opportunely devised. Moreover, many of the commonly detected pharmaceutical compounds are susceptible to degradation by UV at disinfection doses. In this paper, the removal of ibuprofen (IBP)a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)from synthetic water streams was explored using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at fixed wavelength and intensity (254nm; 400mJm(-2)). IBP initial concentration (C-IBP0) was varied in the range 30-60mgL(-1). The treatment time, the initial IBP concentration, pH and the presence of nitrates were investigated by several sets of experiments in order to study their effect on IBP degradation, showing very promising results. IBP removal of 75% was obtained at pH 6.0 with a concentration of NaNO3 of 10mgL(-1) and at pH 6.6 with an initial concentration of ibuprofen of 60mgL(-1). Moreover, a reaction mechanism has been proposed, which fits well in the experimental results, and the kinetic constants of 0.026 and 0.015 were statistically evaluated.

AB The biological treatment of an hospital effluent has been monitored during 150 days in an activated sludge system followed by an ultrafiltration membrane (BBR-UF). After 75 days, support media was added into the bioreactor to develop a biofilm and to compare process performances of the two reactor configurations: activated sludge (AS-UF) or biofilm biological reactor (BBR-UF). The removal efficiencies of (chemical oxygen demand) COD, (total suspended solids) TSS, (volatiles suspended solids) VSS, and (total nitrogen) TN with the BBR-UF were 93.2%, 100%, 99.9% and 91.3%, respectively, compared to 87.9%, 99.6%, 97.5% and 91.1% with the AS-UF. Codeine, ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, roxithromycin, metronidazole, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, gemfibrozil, pravastatin, and iohexol were highly removed by BBR-UF, while low removal was observed for the same molecules in the AS-UF. This could be attributed (1) to the increase of biomass concentration, (2) to the increase of sludge resident time or (3) to sorption on the biofilms. During continuous reactor operation, (trans membrane pressure) TMP increase in BBR-UF was negligible whereas membrane module in AS-UF required a regular physical maintenance. In the last case, membrane fouling was attributed to the modification of the concentration of the produced exopolymeric substances like protein and polysaccharide. The addition of biofilm supports media improved the performances of AS-UF and also decreased the negatives effects of the biomass on the membrane for the treatment of hospital wastewaters.

AB In this study, the microwave-assisted sol-gel method and chemical reduction were used to synthesize Cu-TiO2 nanorod composites for enhanced photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in the presence of UV and visible lights. The electron microscopic images showed that the Cu nanoparticles at 4.5 +/- 0.1 nm were well-deposited onto the surface of TiO2 nanorods after chemical reduction of Cu ions by NaBH4. The X-ray diffractometry patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic results indicated that Cu species on the Cu-TiO2 nanorods were mainly the mixture of Cu2O and Cu-0. The Cu-TiO2 nanorods showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward BPA photodegradation under the irradiation of UV and visible lights. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k(obs)) for BPA photodegradation by 7 wt% Cu-TiO2 nanorods were 18.4 and 3.8 times higher than those of as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods and Degussa P25 TiO2, respectively, under the UV light irradiation. In addition, the k(obs) for BPA photodegradation by 7 wt% Cu-TiO2 nanorods increased by a factor of 5.8 when compared with that of Degussa P25 TiO2 under the irradiation of 460 +/- 40 nm visible light. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using one-dimensional Cu-TiO2 nanorods for photocatalytic degradation of BPA and other pharmaceutical and personal care products in water and wastewater treatment plants.

AB The pervasiveness of pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the aquatic ecosystem through the discharge of wastewater, and their potential to biomagnify within this ecosystem, is now recognised. Residues of diclofenac and ibuprofen are currently being detected in surface waters and aquatic organisms throughout the UK and Europe. However, the levels of these residues in fish and other aquatic organisms, particularly lower trophic level prey species, have not yet been determined. While exposure to diclofenac is known to adversely affect fish, the degree to which other aquatic organisms are exposed and impacted through continuous ingestion of contaminated prey and interaction with the aquatic habitat remains unknown. The extent and effects of exposure to ibuprofen also remain largely unknown. As an exploratory subset of a broader study to investigate the detectability of diclofenac in alternative biological matrices, we analysed hair samples from Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra, n=28) for residues of the two NSAIDs using GC-MS. The otters were collected from six counties in England as part of an ongoing otter health monitoring project at the Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre in Chacewater, UK. Diclofenac was qualitatively detected in five hair wash and 15 extract samples, and ibuprofen was determined to be present in at least two of the hair extract samples. Here, we provide preliminary evidence that otters are exposed to both NSAIDs and argue for further studies to identify residue loads in the otters and their prey to fully assess the pervasiveness of these compounds and potential risks of ongoing exposure to them.

AB The aim of this study was to demonstrate the complementarities of combining membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment with nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration for the removal of trace organic contaminants for potential indirect potable water recycling applications. Four commercially available NF/RO membranes, namely NF270, NF90, BW30 and ESPA2, were selected for this investigation. Challenge tests were conducted with 40 trace organic compounds at concentrations of approximately 2 mu g/L in initial wastewater solutions using a laboratory scale MBR system and a cross-flow NF/RO rig. The results suggest that the MBR system effectively removes hydrophobic and biodegradable trace organic compounds. The adsorption of these hydrophobic compounds onto the MBR mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) leads to an extended retention time in the biological reactor, thereby enhancing their removal. The remaining, mostly hydrophilic, trace organic compounds were shown to be effectively removed by NF/RO membranes. The combination of MBR and a low pressure RO membrane resulted in more than 95% removal or removal to below the analytical detection limit of all 40 trace organic compounds investigated in this study. The results also suggest that NF/RO membrane fouling could be mitigated by appropriate membrane selection. Despite a relatively high initial permeate flux, negligible flow rate decline was observed with an NF membrane and a low pressure RO membrane over more than 25 h of filtration, possibly due to the smooth surfaces of these two particular membranes.

AB Two configurations of membrane bioreactors, were identified to achieve enhanced biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal, and assessed over more than two years with two parallel pilot plants of 2 m(3) each. Both configurations included an anaerobic zone ahead of the biological reactor, and differed by the position of the anoxic zone: standard pre-denitrification, or post-denitrification without dosing of carbon source. Both configurations achieved improved phosphorus removal. The goal of 50 mu gP/L in the effluent could be consistently achieved with two types of municipal wastewater, the second site requiring a low dose of ferric salt ferric salt < 3 mgFe/L. The full potential of biological phosphorus removal could be demonstrated during phosphate spiking trials, where up to 1 mg of phosphorus was biologically eliminated for 10 mg BOD5 in the influent. The post-denitrification configuration enabled a very good elimination of nitrogen. Daily nitrate concentration as low as 1 mgN/L could be monitored in the effluent in some periods. The denitrification rates, greater than those expected for endogenous denitrification, could be accounted for by the use of the glycogene pool, internally stored by the denitrifying microorganisms in the anaerobic zone. Pharmaceuticals residues and steroids were regularly monitored on the two parallel MBR pilot plants during the length of the trials, and compared with the performance of the Berlin-Ruhleben WWTP. Although some compounds such as carbamazepine were persistent through all the systems, most of the compounds could be better removed by the MBR plants. The influence of temperature, sludge age and compound concentration could be shown, as well as the significance of biological mechanisms in the removal of trace organic compounds.

AB Metoprolol is widely used as a beta-blocker and considered an emerging contaminant of environmental concern due to pseudo persistence in wastewater effluents that poses a potential ecotoxicological threat to aquatic ecosystems. Microbial removal of metoprolol in the redox-delineated hyporheic zone (HZ) was investigated using streambed sediments supplemented with 15 or 150 mu M metoprolol in a laboratory microcosm incubation under oxic and anoxic conditions. Metoprolol disappeared from the aqueous phase under oxic and anoxic conditions within 65 and 72 days, respectively. Metoprolol was refed twice after initial depletion resulting in accelerated disappearance under both conditions. Metoprolol disappearance was marginal in sterile control microcosms with autoclaved sediment. Metoprolol was transformed mainly to metoprolol acid in oxic microcosms, while metoprolol acid and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol were formed in anoxic microcosms. Transformation products were transient and disappeared within 30 days under both conditions. Effects of metoprolol on the HZ bacterial community were evaluated using DNA- and RNA-based time-resolved amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA, respectively, and were prominent on 16S rRNA rather than 16S rRNA gene level suggesting moderate metoprolol-induced activity-level changes. A positive impact of metoprolol on Sphingomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively, was observed. Nitrifiers were impaired by metoprolol under oxic and anoxic conditions. Collectively, our findings revealed high metoprolol biodegradation potentials in the hyporheic zone under contrasting redox conditions associated with changes in the active microbial communities, thus contributing to the attenuation of micropollutants.

AB With the significantly increasing pharmaceutical and antibiotics industry in Algeria, the elimination of biomass is of utmost importance since the latter represents a large part of waste from the manufacturing process. In this work, the elimination of hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) and Congo red dye is part of the Pleurotus mutilus biomass recovery process. Thus, biosorption has been studied in a discontinuous system. Optimal conditions were estimated by variations in contact time, temperature, initial pollutant concentrations, and simultaneous removal of both pollutants. The greatest uptake capacities achieved were 36.68 mg/g of and 15.08 mg/g of Cr(VI). The initial concentrations of both pollutants being equal to 50 mg/l, for a duration time of 180 min and a temperature of 300 K. Based on the values of the coefficient of determination R-2, chi(2), and ARE, the isothermal equilibrium data were better represented by Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The kinetic biosorption of the two pollutants was well described using the pseudo-first-order model. The biosorption process is controlled by external mass transfer. The physical process in nature of Cr(VI) and (CR) biosorption has been justified based on the values obtained of Delta G degrees and Delta H degrees. Globally, this work demonstrates the considerable potential of Pleurotus mutilus for the elimination of anionic pollutants. Research results indicate that this biomass, a waste material, first destined for incineration, was recovered without any treatment. Due to its low cost, it could serve as an inexpensive source for recovering heavy metals and dyes from dilute contaminated water.

AB Among the many classes of pollutants, bioactive contaminants including pesticides, herbicides, and other pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are causing significant concern. These chemicals have been linked directly to contamination of freshwater and food sources, threatening water and food security. Contamination from antibiotics, one class of PhACs, is also considered to link strongly to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Pollution from these contaminants has hit developing countries harder as a consequence of less stringent legislation on waste discharge from agricultural industries. Current sampling and monitoring methods [e.g. liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)] are expensive, time-consuming, immobile and require skilled users. Recent development of devices fitted with molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been found to be particularly attractive owing to their low cost, stability, high selectivity and mobility. MIPs also can be used to extract these organic pollutants at low concentrations. The latest development of magnetic MIPs (MMIPs) further facilitates the separation and recovery of these absorbents by using an external magnetic field after the target molecules have been bound, thus avoiding laborious centrifugation and filtration for separation and recovery. The purpose of this perspective is to summarize the recent development of MMIPs in the past ten years. We will focus on their applications in food industries and the agricultural sector. Several potential developments in combined analytical techniques using MMIPs also will be discussed. As pollution to our environment is now a focal point in human life, new analytical techniques based on MMIPs will be of great interest to the science communities.

AB Psychotropics, especially benzodiazepines, are commonly prescribed worldwide. Poorly eliminated at wastewater treatment plants, they belong to a group of emerging contaminants. Due to their interaction with the GABA(A) receptor, they may affect the function of the nervous system of non-target organisms, such as aquatic organisms. The toxicity of oxazepam, a very frequently detected benzodiazepine in continental freshwater, has been largely studied in aquatic vertebrates over the last decade. However, its effects on freshwater nonvertebrates have received much less attention. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of oxazepam on the juvenile stage of a freshwater gastropod widespread in Europe, Radix balthica. Juveniles were exposed for a month to environmentally-relevant concentrations of oxazepam found in rivers (0.8 mu g/L) and effluents (10 mu g/L). Three main physiological functions were studied: feeding, growth, and locomotion. Additionally, gene expression analysis was performed to provide insights into toxicity mechanisms. There was a strong short-term activation of the feeding rate at low concentration, whereas the high dose resulted in long-term inhibition of food intake. A significant decrease in mortality rate was observed in juveniles exposed to the lowest dose. Shell growth and locomotor activity did not appear to be affected by oxazepam. Transcriptomic analysis revealed global overexpression of genes involved in the nervous regulation of the feeding, digestive, and locomotion systems after oxazepam exposure. The molecular analysis also revealed a possible interference of animal manipulation with the molecular effects induced by oxazepam exposure. Overall, these results improve our understanding of the effects of the psychoactive drug oxazepam on an aquatic mollusc gastropod.

AB Silver-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (Ag-ZnO NPs) were successfully synthesized by the Sol-gel method coated with polyethylene glycol as a stabilizing and capping agent. The UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis was done to analyze the optical property of the nanoparticles. XRD pattern showed the hexagonal structure of ZnO nanoparticles and the reduction in the intensity of the peaks of Ag-ZnO NPs indicates the incorporation of Ag+ ions in the ZnO lattices. The surface structural properties of the NPs were confirmed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). The elemental composition of nanoparticles was confirmed by EDAX and XRF-Spectroscopy. The functional group of ZnO and Ag nanoparticles were determined by FT-IR spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of Ag-ZnO NPs was studied against ponceau and the maximum degradation percentage was observed to be 89% at 140 min. Further, Ag-ZnO NPs unveiled high potent antibacterial activity against the selected bacterial pathogens and it also rendered significant anticancer activity in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Consequently, the fluorescent microscopic analysis confirmed the increasing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) loss in the HaCaT cells that leads to the apoptosis induction. Hence, the selected combination of nanoparticles has proven to exhibit higher photocatalytic, antibacterial and anticancer activity. In the near future, it could be an efficient tool for eradicating the dye pollution from wastewater and also preferably be utilized in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries to prevent skin cancer.

AB A ranking system for monitoring-based process control was developed to select indicator compounds that can predict the attenuation of a broader range of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in reclaimed water by low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP)-UV advanced oxidation processes (AOP5). The selected TOrCs were classified into three groups depending on their relative reactivity to UV direct photolysis and center dot OH oxidation. Group 1 includes the photolabile TOrCs, which are easily photodegraded with no additional oxidants by either LP or MP-UV light and include acesulfame, diclofenac, and sulfamethoxazole. Group 2 consists of the moderate photodegradable compounds with high reactivity of center dot OH oxidation, which include benzotriazole, fluoxetine, and hydrochlorothiazide as indicator compounds for assessing LP-UV AOP and propranolol, diltiazem, and diphenhydramine for MP-UV AOP. Group 3 is photo-resistant TOrCs, but highly reactive with center dot OH radicals and includes carbamazepine and DEET as appropriate indicator compounds. Therefore, the proposed ranking system is expected to provide a comprehensive monitoring tool to water reuse utilities for prioritizing a list of indicators to assess the treatment efficacy of UV AOPs that allows for subsequent operational control to achieve the treatment goal. This is the first strategic framework and guidelines for building a customizable tool of process control that depend on the site-specific occurrence profile of wastewater effluents and the UV system (UV lamp spectral output and power density).

AB This study used freshwater rotifers to evaluate the effects of two endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which can be considered emergent contaminants in urban and rural wastewater and are of ecotoxicological importance. LH stimulates the synthesis of testosterone, whereas FSH promotes the maturation of follicles and sperm in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, in rotifers, there are no reports of the effects of chronic exposure to these hormones when added to reconstituted culture medium, as a way to study potential adverse effects that might occur in the environment. Therefore, we studied the reproductive effects of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus Pallas 1766 using a 4-day reproductive assay. Our results indicate that LH has a significant effect in increasing the production of females, males, and cysts, while FSH had no significant effect compared to control treatment. Additionally, our results indicate that LH exposure resulted in 0.33% of organisms being deformed, whereas FSH exposure resulted in 1.09% of organisms being deformed. Deformations included: (a) abnormal growth of lorica, (b) joined foot-head, (c) deformed anterior spine, and (d) deformed parthenogenetic eggs. The organisms with LH-induced deformations did not reproduce and only lived 48 h after 4 days of exposure, while those with FSH-induced deformities survived 15 days and produced 105 cysts with a hatching percentage of 58.10%. Our goal was to contribute to the knowledge of endocrine systems and endocrine hormones of rotifers, to explain the potential mechanism of endocrine disruption that results in adverse effects in freshwater rotifers.

AB Eight recently isolated microalgal species from Northern Sweden and the culture collection strain Scenedesmus obliquus RISE (UTEX 417) were tested for their ability to remove 19 pharmaceuticals from growth medium upon cultivation in short light path, flat panel photobioreactors. While the growth of one algal species, Chlorella sorokiniana B1-1, was completely inhibited by the addition of pharmaceuticals, and the one of Scenedesmus sp. B2-2 was strongly inhibited, the other algal strains grew well and produced biomass.
   In general, lipophilic compounds were removed highly efficient from the culture medium by the microalgae ( > 70% in average within 2 days). The most lipophilic compounds Biperiden, Trihexyphenidyl, Clomipramine and Amitriptyline significantly accumulated in the biomass of most algal species, with a positive correlation between accumulation and their total biomass content. More persistent in the growth medium were hydrophilic compounds like Caffeine, Fluconazole, Trimetoprim, Codeine, Carbamazepin, Oxazepam and Tramadol, which were detected in amounts of above 60% in average after algal treatment.
   While Coelastrella sp. 3-4 and Coelastrum astroideum RW10 were most efficient to accumulate certain compounds in their biomass, two algae species, Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 and Chlorella saccharophila RNY, were not only highly efficient in removing all 19 pharmaceuticals from the growth medium within 12 days, at the same time only small amounts of these compounds accumulated in their biomass allowing its further use. Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 was able to remove most compounds within 6 days of growth, while Chlorella saccharophila RNY needed 8-10 days."Wild" Nordic microalgae therefore are able to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients, equally or more efficient than the investigated culture collection strain, thereby demonstrating their possible use in sustainable wastewater reclamation in Nordic conditions.

AB High efficiency and facile separation are desirable for catalysts used in water treatment. In this study, a magnetic catalyst (nitrogen doped iron/activated carbon) was prepared and used for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The catalyst was characterized using BET, SEM, XRD, VSM and XPS. Results showed that iron and nitrogen were successfully loaded and doped, magnetic Fe2N was formed, large amount of active surface oxygen and Fe(II) were detected, and the catalyst could be easily separated from water. Diclofenac was then degraded using the catalyst in ultrasound system. The catalyst showed high catalytic activity with 95% diclofenac removal. Analysis showed that center dot OH attack of diclofenac was a main pathway, and then center dot OH generation mechanism was clarified. The effects of catalyst dosage, sonication time, ultrasonic density, initial pH, and inorganic anions on diclofenac degradation were studied. Sulfate anion enhanced the degradation of diclofenac. Mechanism in the catalytic ultrasonic process was analyzed and reactions were clarified. Large quantity of oxidants was generated on the catalyst surface, including center dot OH, O-2(-center dot), O-center dot and HO2 center dot, which degraded diclofenac efficiently. In the solution and interior of cavitation bubbles, center dot OH and "hot spot" effects contributed to the degradation of diclofenac. Reuse of the catalyst was further investigated to enhance its economy, and the catalyst maintained activity after seven uses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water quality characteristics and emerging organic pollutants were sampled along the San Pedro-Guayllabamba-Esmeraldas River and its main water pollution streams in the summer of 2013. The annual flow rate of the stream is 22 000 Mm(3) y(-1) and it collects the wastewater of Quito-Ecuador in the Andes and supplies drinking water to the city of Esmeraldas near the Pacific Ocean. The most persistent emerging pollutants were carbamazepine and acesulfame, which were found to be stable along the San Pedro-Guayllabamba-Esmeraldas River, whereas the concentration of most other organic emerging pollutants, such as caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and steroidal estrogens, was degraded to a large extent along the 300 km flow. The mass rate of the sum of cocaine and benzoylecgonine, its metabolite, was increased along the stream, which may be attributed to coca plantations and wild coca trees. This raises the possibility of using river monitoring as an indirect way to learn about changes in coca plantations in their watersheds. Several organic emerging pollutants, such as venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulphamethoxazole, and benzoylecgonine, survived even the filtration treatment at the Esmeraldas drinking water system, though all except for benzoylecgonine are found below 20 ng L-1, and are therefore not likely to cause adverse health effects. The research provides a way to compare drug consumption in a major Latin American city (Quito) and shows that the consumption of most sampled drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, sulphamethoxazole, ethinylestradiol) was below their average consumption level in Europe, Israel, and North America.

AB Hydrochlorothiazide (6-chloro-1,1-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide), a thiazidic diuretic very frequently used in the treatment of hypertension, has been oxidized by means of UV radiation, Fenton's reagent and ozone. The influence of some operating variables was established, and the main kinetic parameters were determined. Specifically, for the photodegradation process, quantum yields ranging between 0.028 and 0.048 mol Eins(-1) were obtained depending on the temperature and pH. At the same time, in the ozonation process and by using competition kinetics, the values deduced for the second-order rate constants varied from 91.3 M-1 s(-1) at pH = 3 to 16400 M-1 s(-1) at pH = 9. Similarly, competition kinetics was also used in the Fenton's reagent process for the determination of the rate constants for the reaction of this pharmaceutical with hydroxyl radicals, and the value deduced at 20 degrees C was (5.7 +/- 0.3) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1). The oxidation of this selected pharmaceutical was also followed in some water systems (a surface water from a reservoir SW. and a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant SE), by UV radiation and ozone. The influence of the operating conditions on the removal efficiency was established, and specifically for the ozonation process, a kinetic model was proposed for the prediction of the elimination of the selected pharmaceutical in these water systems, which could well reproduce experimental data.

AB One of the most crucial problems in catalysis is the loss of catalytic activity. When analyzing or designing a reactive system involving a decaying catalyst, a rate law adjusted for the catalyst deactivation should be utilized. An example of deactivating catalysts is supported-iron catalysts used in the heterogeneous Fenton-like oxidations of organic compounds. In this study, the observed reaction rate of such reactive systems was modeled ? through separable kinetics ? with a general rate expression that was written in terms of a rate law, describing the reaction kinetics on the fresh catalyst, and an activity term, accounting for the catalyst deactivation. The model was developed and verified for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of selected dyes (Reactive Yellow and Red) over Fe-Y zeolite and drugs (Diclofenac and Naproxen) over magnetite/multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which experienced notable deactivation during the reaction. It was found that the reaction rate followed LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics while the catalyst decay rate was second order in the present activity and first order in the concentration of the fouling species, which presumably resulted from the degradation of the organic compounds. The effect of the temperature on the rate expression parameters was also studied. The model included parameters such as the reaction and decaying rate constants, reaction and decaying activation energies, adsorption constant, and enthalpy of adsorption. The rate expression proved to satisfactorily describe the concentration?time trajectories in all the studied reactions despite their differences in the utilized catalysts, reacting organic compounds, and/or conditions, which verified the robustness of the model

AB Beta-blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) enter the environment through the improper disposal of drugs in garbage, sinks, or toilets as well as via excretion after their intended use. Beta-blockers and SSRIs are resistant to biodegradation and highly water soluble, leading to limited removal capabilities by wastewater treatment plants. As a result, these compounds can easily enter the aquatic environment in a biologically active state, posing risks to the behavior, anatomy, and physiology of aquatic organisms through exposure. However, there is insufficient research on the effects of beta-blockers on aquatic vertebrates to have a complete understanding of the impact of beta-blocker pollution on aquatic organisms. Exposing fathead minnows at environmentally-relevant concentrations allows for an accurate representation of how beta-blockers and SSRIs affect and accumulate in aquatic vertebrates. Singular exposures to two beta-blockers and two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at seven days modeled how pollution affects aquatic wildlife during acute exposure events. After exposure, the entire organism was analyzed quantitatively by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and qualitatively by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Imaging allowed for the determination of the part of the organism in which the drugs were accumulating. Results showed that after seven days of exposure there was accumulation of both the beta-blockers and SSRIs in the fathead minnows. This data represents the first application of LC-MS quantitation guided by MALDIMSI in aquatic toxicology-type research in environmental analytical chemistry. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The bacteriostatic antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), have frequently been found in wastewater and surface water, which raises the concerns about their ecotoxicological effects. The indirect photochemical transformation has been proven to be an efficient way to degrade SMX and TMP. In this study, the reaction mechanisms of the degradation by SMX and TMF by OH radicals were investigated by theoretical calculations. Corresponding rate constants were determined and the eco-toxicity of SMX and TMP and its degradations products were predicted using theoretical models. The results indicate that the most favorable pathways for the transformation of SMX and TMP are both center dot OH-addition reaction of benzene ring site with lowest Gibbs free energy barriers (6.86 and 6.21 kcal mol(-1)). It was found that the overall reaction rate constants of center dot OH-initial reaction of SMX and TMP are 1.28 x 10(8)M(-1)s(-1)and 6.21 x 10(8)M(-1)s(-1)at 298 K, respectively. When comparing the eco-toxicity of transformation products with parent SMX and TMP, it can be concluded that the acute and chronic toxicities of the degraded products are reduced, but some products remain harmful for organisms, especially for daphnid (toxic or very toxic level). This study can give greater insight into the degradation of SMX and TMP by center dot OH through theoretical calculations in aquatic environment.

AB Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae provides a very promising alternative for producing carbohydrate-rich biomass to convert into bioethanol and value-added biocompounds, such as vitamins, pigments, proteins, lipids and antioxidant compounds. Spirulina platensis may present high yields of biomass and carbohydrates when it is grown under mixotrophic conditions using cheese whey. However, there are no previous studies evaluating the influence of this culture system on the profile of fatty acids or antioxidant compounds of this species, which are extremely important for food and pharmaceutical applications and would add value to the cultivation process. S. platensis presented higher specific growth rates, biomass productivity and carbohydrate content under mixotrophic conditions; however, the antioxidant capacity and the protein and lipid content were lower than that of the autotrophic culture. The maximum biomass yield was 2.98 +/- 0.07 g/L in growth medium with 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentration was the same for the biomass obtained under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with 2.5% and 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentrations showed no significant differences except for that in the growth medium with 10.0% whey, which presented an average value of 22.37 +/- 0.14 mg gallic acid/g. Mixotrophic cultivation of S. platensis using whey can be considered a viable alternative to reduce the costs of producing S. platensis biomass and carbohydrates, shorten cultivation time and produce carbohydrates, as it does not require adding expensive chemical nutrients to the growth medium and also takes advantage of cheese whey, an adverse dairy industry byproduct.

AB Synthesis and characterization of energy-efficient visible-light-responsive carbon-doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (C-TiO2NP) is reported. The characterization results of C-TiO2NP using BET, TEM, DLS, and XRD indicate the following: (1) the C-TiO2NP have high surface area (77.02 m(2)/g), (2) size range of 5.00-10.00 nm and (3) zeta potential of 19 (pH 4.0), 4 (pH 7.0) and -21 (pH 10.0) while (4) the XRD results shows a peak pattern indicating that C-TiO2NP is mostly in the anatase phase. The photocatalytic properties of C-TiO2NP is investigated in this study using gemifloxacin antibiotic under LED in the visible region (lambda(max) similar to 450 nm). Results shows that C-TiO2NP have significant catalytic properties under LED visible light (up to similar to 74% within 60 min). On the other hand, no degradation is observed for control TiO2NP using LED visible light under equivalent experimental conditions. Using control TiO2NP with H2O2 under LED visible light results in a percentage degradation of similar to 33.0%. Upon using C-TiO2NP with H2O2, the % degradation increases from similar to 33.0 to 64.0%. Although H2O2 generally enhances the activity of bare TiO2NP under UV irradiation, the % degradation under LED in the presence of C-TiO2NP and H2O2 (similar to 64%) is smaller than that in the presence of C-TiO2NP only (similar to 74%). Results demonstrates the applicability of C-TiO2NP as an energy-efficient and cost-effective photocatalyst under LED visible light for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB This study demonstrates the adsorptive recovery of high-concentration Iopamidol (TOP) from aqueous solution. IOP is a highly valuable X-ray iodinated contrast agent (ICA), and the reuse of the adsorbent activated carbon (AC) is via elution with alcohol. Of the adsorbents selected, coconut powder AC (CPAC) displayed the best adsorption performance for IOP. The results of batch investigation into adsorption kinetics, isotherms, activation energy, and thermodynamic calculations support the occurrence of a physisorption process. The adsorption mechanism has been determined using the intraparticle diffusion model. A Boyd plot has revealed that IOP adsorption onto CPAC was mainly governed by particle diffusion. CPAC also exhibited excellent adsorptive performance toward IOP, which was efficiently eluted and recovered using methanol in a semicontinuous flow system. Moreover, the spent CPAC was efficiently regenerated and reused in five adsorption/desorption cycles. The characterization of CPAC samples by SEM, DRIFT, and TGA shows that IOP is absorbed onto CPAC, leading to significant decreases in the BET surface area and pore volume and shift of the pore diameter. pi-pi, donor-acceptor complex, van der Waals, and hydrogen-bond interactions are governed by the IOP adsorption. Hydrogen-bond interactions between IOP and alcohols play a crucial role in the desorption process. IOP was completely eluted, and the surface properties of CPAC were recovered after elution in the flow system. This study demonstrates that many benefits can be achieved from adsorption/desorption processes, such as those in wastewater treatment and the recovery of valuable compounds, as adsorbent recycling simplifies the operations and reduces treatment costs.

AB Natural and synthetic progestins in receiving streams can disrupt the normal endocrine systems of fish. Norethindrone (NET) is a widely used synthetic progestin that often appears in wastewater effluents. For this research, adult female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were exposed to NET at three concentrations. The effects of NET on the following biological factors were evaluated: the histology of the ovaries and livers, the anal fin morphology, and transcription of genes related to steroidogenesis signaling pathways in the livers. After 42 d exposure to NET at 33.0 ng L-1 and 347.5 ng L-1, rapid masculinization, an increase in the number of atretic and postovulatory follicles in the ovary, enhanced vascularization, degenerated hepatocytes and irregular nuclei in the livers were observed. Exposure to NET did not affect the expression of the androgenic and estrogenic receptor genes and Cyp19a except for a significant up-regulation of Er alpha. However, the expression of Vtg A, Vtg B, and Vtg C were markedly inhibited in the females exposed to three concentrations of NET. Compared to the control female, exposure to NET at 33.0 ng L-1 and 347.5 ng L-1 caused a 4.4- and 5.8-fold increase in the expression of Hsd17 beta 3 in the livers, respectively. The results demonstrate that NET can cause rapid masculinization of female G. affinis, hepatopathological alterations and inhibited expressions of Vtg A, Vtg B, and Vtg C. The results imply that G. affinis populations might be threatened in NET-contaminated environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane-based liquid filtration systems have been highlighted as a key green process engineering platform for process intensification. While these systems have been successfully commercialized in desalination and micro/ultra/nanofiltration, it is yet challenging to expand the limited operating conditions (ambient temperature in an aqueous environment) of the currently available membranes, and to solve the exacerbating environmental burden during the fabrication of polymeric membranes. Herein, a new green and compact fabrication method is proposed for both (i) fabricating a robust membrane that can function beyond the typical operating conditions of conventional membranes and (ii) minimizing waste creation and production time. In this work, contrary to the conventional phase inversion method, a spray-coating technique was employed to fabricate a thin composite membrane with high temperature stability and fast solvent permeability. The proposed compact fabrication method can reduce the carbon footprint and the usage of polymers and solvents more than twofold, and eliminate the time-consuming coagulation and washing steps, both of which generate an enormous amount of solvent-contaminated wastewater (up to 50 billion liters per year). Furthermore, the process used dimethyl sulfoxide to bypass conventional N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a green solvent, and can simultaneously fabricate a membrane ready to use within a half-day. The resulting membrane exhibited remarkable stability and performance for the separation of solutes in N,N-dimethylformamide, even at elevated temperatures not feasible with conventional polymeric membranes, and so it is a candidate for potential use in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.

AB The pharmaceutical compound indomethacin is not totally removed in wastewater treatment plants, whose effluents flow into aquatic environments; concentrations in the 0.1-100 ng/L range are commonly found in surface waters, and its fate is unknown. Here, biological, photochemical and thermal degradation assays were conducted under stress and non-stress conditions to estimate its degradation rate in riverwater and establish its degradation products over time. The results revealed that direct sunlight irradiation promoted the complete degradation of indomethacin (2 mu g/L) in less than 6 hr, but indomethacin was detected over a period of 4 months when water was kept under the natural day-night cycle and the exposure to sunlight was partially limited, as occurs inside a body of water. The biological degradation in water was negligible, while the hydrolysis at pH 7.8 was slow. Residues were monitored by ultra-pressure liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight/mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction, and six degradation products were found; their structures were proposed based on the molecular formulae and fragmentation observed in high-resolution tandem mass spectra. 4-Chlorobenzoic and 2-acetamido-5-methoxybenzoic acids were the long-term transformation products, persisting for at least 30 weeks in water kept under non-stress conditions. Furthermore, the degradation in the presence of sediment was also monitored over time, with some differences being noted. The adsorption coefficients of indomethacin and degradation products on river sediment were calculated; long-term degradation products did not have significant adsorption to sediment.

AB Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic and mood stabilizing drug that has been detected in wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water, at frequencies in surface water ranging from 47 to 97%. Because lamotrigine is a weak base (pK(a) = 5.7) that appears in two protonation states in natural waters, this study examined the direct photodegradation of lamotrigine (11.4 to 12.0 mg L-1) in simulated sunlight using liquid chromatography-UV diode array detection and buffered aqueous solutions at pH 3.3, 5.3, and 7.7. Lamotrigine's half-life varied little (100 + 3 to 112 + 2 h) with solution pH, but its specific light absorption rate was 12 times higher, and its reaction quantum yield was 13 times lower, at pH 7.7 versus pH 3.3. In the estimated midday, midsummer sunlight in Denver, CO, USA (latitude 39.8617 degrees N), lamotrigine's estimated photodegradation rate was more than twice as fast at pH 7.7 versus pH 3.3. Lamotrigine's photoproducts were detected by liquid chromatography-UV diode array detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Solution pH was shown to affect the identities and relative abundances of lamotrigine's photoproducts. Some photoproducts appeared only in solutions containing protonated lamotrigine, and others appeared only in solutions containing neutral lamotrigine. As a result, different reaction mechanisms were proposed. Finally, lamotrigine's reaction quantum yield (2.51 +/- 0.07 x 10(-5) mol einstein(-1) at pH 7.7) and other results suggested that lamotrigine and three photoproducts are approximately as resistant to direct photodegradation as carbamazepine, a frequently detected pharmaceutical in surface waters.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorous loading into waterways from designated beneficial uses of reclaimed water is a growing concern in many parts of the United States. Numerous studies have documented that organic microconstituents present in the reclaimed water can be utilized as indicators of its influence on surface water bodies. However, little to no information is available on the environmental attenuation of these microconstituents relative to the nutrients, which is a critical component in determining the effectiveness or limitations of those markers as a tool for elucidating their origins. In this study, the stability of selected markers (sucralose, carbamazepine, gadolinium anomaly, iohexol, and atenolol) was evaluated through bench-scale studies designed to simulate environmental conditions associated with biodegradation, adsorption, and photolysis. The primary pathway for nitrogen reduction was biodegradation (greater than 99%) while the highest phosphorous removal was due to adsorption (30-80%). Soils with low organic content were selected for this study. Sucralose was the most recalcitrant microconstituent in the environment with less than 15% removal by adsorption, biodegradation, or photolysis. Iohexol was too susceptible to photolysis (90% removal), and atenolol was susceptible to biodegradation (60-80% removal). Gd anomaly was fairly stable (less than 30% removal) in the environment. Carbamazepine was another efficacious marker for wastewater, but was susceptible (50% removal) to photolysis. Of the selected microconstituents, only atenolol showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for nitrate and none of the microconstituents showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for phosphorus.

AB Purpose Pharmaceuticals are an integral part of a dignified life. However, a lack of degradability and threats to the welfare of living beings cause concern due to their emission into the environment. There is also a lack of knowledge about cause and consequence. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the development of educational programmes which should increasingly include the topic 'pharmaceuticals in the environment'.
   Methods Considering the current literature, we developed a corresponding series of worksheets (Online Resource) and sample solutions on an introductory level and integrated them into our curriculum.
   Results The material compiled for the worksheets was arranged in a logical order and considers several subtopics. The worksheets aim to support the examination of related aspects such as environmental effects, emissions, wastewater treatment plants, degradation, degradation by-products, advanced oxidation processes, hydraulic retention times, half-life times, biosolids, exposition pathways, precautionary principle, classification schemes for pharmaceuticals and, related to the structure-activity relationship, the design for degradability. The students managed to work on the tasks in an appropriate manner and received a good overview of the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.
   Conclusions Tasks that were presented to students regarding the topic 'pharmaceuticals in the environment' contributed to a better understanding of the possible risks of medical care on an introductory level. The tasks have been incorporated into a logic series of worksheets (Online Resource) with sample solutions available. Alternatively, the material would be appropriate for the preparation of a corresponding lecture on this topic.

AB Affordable and environmentally sustainable sanitation practices are required to improve public health and contribute to resource security. Human urine recovery can optimize resource demand and minimize waste in the sanitation sector while providing agricultural producers access to recycled nutrients. Nexus thinking was applied in resource management related to human urine to assess the energy demand using a life cycle approach and economic performance using a cost-benefit approach. Business as usual practices regarding water supply and wastewater management in flushing toilets and the use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture were compared to a proposed optimization with reduced water flushing in a toilet or urinal, and the proposed urine logistics with a waterless urinal and the use of urine fertilizer. The energy demand was 92-192 kWh in business as usual, 94-117 kWh in proposed optimization and 38 kWh in proposed urine logistics, resulting in a potential saving of 25-154 kWh per person a year in the proposed scenarios. The financial cost was 67-108 USD in business as usual, 9-57 USD in proposed optimization and 32 USD in proposed urine logistics, resulting in a potential benefit of 30-96 USD per person a year. Sensitivity analysis of key parameters was considered in the proposed urine logistics to support decision making. Urine recovery as presented in this study contributes to multi-sectoral integrated management of resources mainly through natural resource savings, pollution prevention and fertilizer provision optimizing the water-energy-nutrient nexus.

AB The increased use of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) has contributed to the contamination of water systems and put pressure on the development of new techniques to deal with this problem. Acetaminophen (paracetamol), a common analgesic and antipyretic drug, and caffeine, a known central nervous system stimulant, are being used frequently by many people and found in large amounts in wastewater systems. In this work, their removal, by photocatalytic degradation, was promoted using magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) based on iron oxides. Besides being obtained from cheap and plentiful source, the magnetic properties of these NPs provide an easy way to separate them from the solution when the reaction is complete. Three types of hematite-based NPs, one pure (1) and two of them composed by a magnetite core partially (2) or completely (3) covered by a hematite shell, were synthesized and characterized. Sample 2 was the best photocatalyst for both pollutants' photo-assisted degradation. Under UV-vis irradiation and using a 0.13 g catalyst/L solution, the total acetaminophen and caffeine degradation (20 ppm/150 mL) was achieved in 45 min and 60 min, respectively. The identification of some of the intermediate products was carried out by liquid chromatography in combination with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A complementary Density Functional Theory (DFT) study revealed the relative stability of several species formed during the acetaminophen and caffeine degradation processes and gave some insight about the most favorable degradation pathways.

AB The present study evaluated the capacity of a semi-closed, tubular horizontal photobioreactor (PBR) to remove pesticides from agricultural run-off. The study was carried out in summer (July) to study its efficiency under the best conditions (highest solar irradiation). A total of 51 pesticides, including 10 transformation products, were selected and investigated based on their consumption rate and environmental relevance. Sixteen of them were detected in the agricultural run-off, and the estimated removal efficiencies ranged from negative values, obtained for 3 compounds, namely terbutryn, diuron and imidacloprid, to 100%, achieved for 10 compounds. The acidic herbicide MCPA was removed by 88% in average, and the insecticides 2,4-D and diazinon showed variable removals, between 100% and negative values. The environmental risk associated to the compounds still present in the effluent of the PBR was evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs), calculated using the average and highest measured concentrations of the compounds. HQ values > 10 (meaning high risk) were obtained for imidacloprid (21), between 1 and 10 (meaning moderate risk) for 2,4-D (2.8), diazinon (4.6) and terbutryn (1.5), and <1 (meaning low risk) for the remaining compounds diuron, linuron and MCPA. The PBR treatment yielded variable removals depending on the compound, similarly to conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study provides new data on the capacity of microalgae-based treatment systems to eliminate a wide range of priority pesticides under real/environmental conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study compares the performance of several ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), in combination with filtration, in terms of trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal efficiency and energy and cost requirement. It was shown that the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) scavenging rate of the secondary wastewater effluent decreased as a result of an additional pretreatment step, leading to an increase of ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures at the same ozone dose. Adding filtration such as sand filtration or granular activated carbon filtration (GACF) as a pretreatment increased the removal efficiency of TrOCs by all tested ozone-based AOPs and reduced the minimum effective ozone dose for TrOC elimination. When the applied ozone dose is more than this minimum effective ozone dose, the elimination of TrOCs can be observed. For example, because of the use of anion resin filtration, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol elimination contributed by the process of ozone-based AOP increased from 34.6 to 42.1% at an ozone dose of 1.0 g O-3/g dissolved organic carbon. Ozone-based AOPs coupled with filtration as a pretreatment were found to be more cost-efficient than the single AOPs at all ozone dose levels. The energy consumption of ozone-based AOPs was decreased by more than 25% when applying GACF as a pretreatment. In comparison with other filtration techniques, the pretreatment of secondary effluents by GACF before ozonation was proven to be the most cost-effective method for TrOC elimination.

AB Gliclazide is a pharmaceutical product used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, this drug is considered to be highly undesirable when present in the environment. We tested in vitro the biodegradation of gliclazide as the sole source of carbon and energy by a microbial consortium. After a 5-month adaptation period in batch culture, two bacterial strains were isolated and identified, namely, Aeromonas hydrophila and Serratia odorifera. With an initial concentration of gliclazide at 0.5 g/L, these two bacteria and their combined culture degraded gliclazide with a specific activity of 22.3, 24.1, and 19.2 ng/(mg center dot h) and a yield of 88.88%, 82.94%, and 95.88%, respectively. Experimental results reveal a removal efficiency of 98.904% at an inlet concentration of 5 g/L and a flow rate of 14 L/h. The maximum removal efficiency of the biotrickling filter was 99.6%, at a gliclazide inlet concentration of 0.5, 1, and 5 g/L and a flow rate of 6.3 L/h. Interestingly, it was observed that after a period of 12 months, the two dominant strains differed from those present in the initial inocula. Thus, the high elimination efficiencies obtained in this study reveal the interest of the use, for the first time, of a biotrickling filter for the study of the biodegradation of gliclazide. Obtaining a microbial consortium strongly adapted to this substrate may prove to be an interesting alternative for a possible application in the treatment, before discharge, of wastewater containing this molecule or other related molecules, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB The detection of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater has triggered human and ecological health concerns. As highly toxic compounds, chemotherapy agents (CM), such as the cyclophosphamide (CYP) and ifosfamide (IFO) structural isomers, represent a unique threat. This research elucidated the fate of CYP and IFO during ozonation and advanced oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot). Novel semi-batch reactors were used to determine the second-order rate constants for CYP and IFO with O-3 and HO center dot. These reactors provided independent control of the oxidant exposure through continuous and constant aqueous ozone and peroxone (O-3-H2O2) addition. The rate constants for transformation of CYP and IFO by ozone were 2.58 +/- 0.40 M(-1)s(-1) and 6.95 +/- 0.21 M(-1)s(-1), respectively, indicating that ozone alone is not suitable for treating CAs. Transformation of CYP and IFO by hydroxyl radicals was fast, with rate constants of 2.69(+/- 0.17) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1) and 2.73(+/- 0.16) x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1), respectively. The major transformation products formed by O-3 and HO center dot attack consisted of the 4-hydroxy-, 4-keto-, dechloroethyl-, and imino-derivatives of CYP and IFO. Low yields of the active metabolites of the CM, namely phosphoramide mustard and isophosphoramide mustard, were detected. These findings suggest that treated water may retain the ability to alkylate DNA and confer toxicity.

AB It is of ongoing interest to evaluate real-time instruments for monitoring water contaminants for source water control and water reuse system performance applications. Portable fluorescence sensors have the potential to provide instantaneous measurements of fluorescent organic compounds present in chemical and biological pollutants. Comparisons between one-dimensional fluorescence data from portable sensors and data obtained from higher sensitivity benchtop fluorometers, capable of three dimensional spectral acquisition, are needed to evaluate the performance of portable instruments. We tracked fluorescence intensities in titration experiments with diverse pollutants, including two volatile organic compounds (diesel, gasoline), three pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, caffeine, lopinavir), and a pesticide (isoxathion), added to creek water, tertiary treated wastewater, and water from different treatment stages at a water reuse facility. Our results indicated that optical filters with wavelength bands in the tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like peak regions were able to track the peaks of most organic chemicals studied. Fluorescence intensities measured with both portable and benchtop instruments were highly correlated for all samples and all contaminants (R-2 > 0.90). In the final product water of the water reuse facility, both portable and benchtop fluorometers displayed high sensitivity, being able to discern contaminants from the background at concentrations as low as 0.2 ppb. However, in creek water, post-ozone water, and tertiary effluent, pollutant detection limits were much higher for both portable and benchtop fluorometers. Therefore, in waters with substantial background fluorescence, fluorescence-based sensors may be best suited for tracking higher concentrations of organic contaminants, such as those found in chemical spills in source waters.

AB The presence of micro-pollutants in wastewater and in drinking water and its sources, is posing both environmental and health concerns. This work describes the development of weak polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) based hollow fiber nanofiltration (NF) membranes to remove micro-pollutants from aqueous sources. The charge density of weak polyelectrolytes (PEs) can be controlled by the pH of the coating solution, providing an additional parameter to tune the performance of the prepared membranes. In this study, PEMs of weak PEs poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were coated in a layer by layer (LbL) fashion on top of an ultrafiltration support to obtain PEM based NF membranes. Before coating the membranes, the role of the pH during coating on the buildup of multilayers was studied on model surfaces via reflectometry. Detailed investigations were then carried out on the membrane performance, by studying the pure water permeability, salt retention (NaCl, CaCl2 and Na2SO4) and the retention of micro-pollutants of varying size (similar to 200-400 g mol(-1)), charge and hydrophilicity. Variation of the coating pH provided a large degree of control over the separation performance of the weak PEM based membranes. The rejection was found to be dominated by size exclusion together with Donnan exclusion. A PEM membrane prepared at pH 6 showed a high micropollutant retention (60-80%) while showing only low ion retentions. Such a membrane would be well suited to reduce the problem of micro-pollutants, without significant alteration of the ionic composition of the feed.

AB In the current era of human life, we face an increased consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nevertheless, NSAIDs are not entirely metabolized by humans and are thus excreted into domestical effluents, whereas expired medications are recurrently directly disposed into wastewaters. Several studies have already demonstrated that an extensive diversity of pharmaceuticals is present in aqueous effluents and is therefore a matter of serious concern with regard to wildlife and public health. In this perspective, this work is focused on the use of a liquid liquid extraction approach for the removal of NSAIDs from aqueous media. In particular, aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of ionic liquids (ILs) and aluminum-based salts were used for the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. With these systems, extraction efficiencies of NSAIDs up to 100% into the IL-rich phase were obtained in a single-step. Further, the recovery of NSAIDs from the IL medium and the recyclability of the IL-rich phase were ascertained aiming at developing a more sustainable and cost-effective strategy. On the basis of the remarkable increase of the NSAIDs solubility in the IL-rich phase (from 300- to 4100-fold when compared with pure water), water was used as an effective antisolvent, where recovery percentages of NSAIDs from the IL-rich phase up to 91% were obtained. After the "cleaning" of the IL-rich phase by the induced precipitation of NSAIDs, the phase-forming components were recovered and reused in four consecutive cycles, with no detected losses on both the extraction efficiency and recovery of NSAIDs.

AB Iopromide is an X-ray and MRI contrast agent that is virtually non-biodegradable and persistent through typical wastewater treatment processes. This study determined whether molecular transformation of iopromide in a UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) can result in biodegradable products. The experiments used iopromide labeled with carbon-14 on the aromatic ring to trace degradation of iopromide through UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation and subsequent biodegradation. The biotransformation assay tracked the formation of radiolabeled (CO2)-C-14 which indicated full mineralization of the molecule. The results indicated that AOP formed biodegradable iopromide products. There was no C-14 released from the pre-AOP samples, but up to 20% of all radiolabeled carbon transformed into (CO2)-C-14 over the course of 42 days of biodegradation after iopromide was exposed to advanced oxidation (compared to 10% transformation in inactivated post-AOP controls). In addition, the quantum yield of photolysis of iopromide was determined using low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) mercury lamps as 0.069 +/- 0.005 and 0.080 +/- 0.007 respectively. The difference in the quantum yields for the two UV sources was not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval (p = 0.08), which indicates the equivalency of using LP or MP UV sources for iopromide treatment. The reaction rate between iopromide and hydroxyl radicals was measured to be (2.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). These results indicate that direct photolysis is a dominant degradation pathway in UV/H2O2 AOP treatment of iopromide. Other iodinated contrast media may also become biodegradable after exposure to UV or UV/H2O2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUNDPharmaceutical industry generates a large amount of liquid effluents rich in toxic compounds that reach natural water streams, if improperly degraded, being a threat for ecosystems. In this context, ozonation appears as an interesting alternative to conventional treatments. This work aims to study the effect of this technology aided by two ceramic catalysts (the laboratory Mn-Ce-O and the commercial N-150) on the degradation of a mixture of two contaminants: sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac. RESULTS: The presence of the catalysts had no significant impact on pharmaceuticals removal when compared with single ozonation. However, both materials increased the amount of COD removed per mg of ozone applied (0.10 mgCOD(removed) mg(-1)O(3) and 0.067 mgCOD(removed) mg(-1)O(3) for catalytic and single ozonation, respectively). The performance of Mn-Ce-O was very dependent upon the solution pH whereas no significant pH impact was detected for N-150. The generalized kinetic model (GKM) was able to satisfactorily describe the lumped kinetic mechanism concerning COD abatement. Moreover, no differences in the degradation results were observed for the Mn-Ce-O system when comparing two types of waters (ultrapure and natural) used to dissolve the pharmaceutical compounds. Importantly, the presence of the solid catalyst improved ozone usage and reduced the effluents' toxicity.
   CONCLUSIONAlthough work has been published regarding the removal of single emerging contaminants, the analysis of mixtures is not so frequent. The use of Mn-Ce-O truly enhances COD degradation revealing its potential as heterogeneous catalytic material to improve ozone action on pollutants. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is frequently used in combination with ultraviolet (UV) light to treat trace organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In small-scale applications, such as wellhead and point-of-entry water treatment systems, the need to maintain a stock solution of concentrated H2O2 increases the operational cost and complicates the operation of AOPs. To avoid the need for replenishing a stock solution of H2O2, a gas diffusion electrode was used to generate low concentrations of H2O2 directly in the water prior to its exposure to UV light. Following the AOP, the solution was passed through an anodic chamber to lower the solution pH and remove the residual H2O2. The effectiveness of the technology was evaluated using a suite of trace contaminants that spanned a range of reactivity with UV light and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) in three different types of source waters (i.e., simulated groundwater, simulated surface water, and municipal wastewater effluent) as well as a sodium chloride solution. Irrespective of the source water, the system produced enough H2O2 to treat up to 120 L water d(-1). The extent of transformation of trace organic contaminants was affected by the current density and the concentrations of HO center dot scavengers in the source water. The electrical energy per order (E-EO) ranged from 1 to 3 kWh m(-3), with the UV lamp accounting for most of the energy consumption. The gas diffusion electrode exhibited high efficiency for H2O2 production over extended periods and did not show a diminution in performance in any of the matrices.

AB Immobilized TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays containing anatase phases were synthesized through electrochemical oxidation of TiO2 foil. At ultrasonic (US) frequencies of 28 and 1000 kHz, the feasibility of the use of TiO2 NTs was investigated in terms of the production of H2O2 and the degradation of acetaminophen (AAP) and naproxen (NPX), which are pharmaceuticals (PhACs) used for pain relief and which persist despite wastewater treatment. The degradation efficiencies of the PhACs, as well as the production of H2O2, were enhanced in the presence of TiO2 NTs. Furthermore, the reduction of TiO2 slurries after the reaction was achieved at 1000 kHz. The feasibility of the TiO2 NTs was clearly shown in US/Fenton/TiO2 NT process, exhibiting the highest degradation (85.3% for AAP and 96.0% for NPX) at low Fe2+:H2O2 ratio of 20:4 ratio at 1000 kHz. These results could be attributed to the accelerated cycling of Fe2+-Fe3+, assisted by electrons in the presence of TiO2 NTs under US irradiation. In the US/CCI4 process, the degradation rates of both PhACs were improved with an increased concentration of CCl4, implying that the scavenging(center dot)H leads to high concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and the accumulation of reactive chlorine species, while t-BuOH notably inhibited the degradation of the PhACs. In acidic conditions, high degradation efficiencies were observed because of the hydrophobicity of the PhACs, high (OH)-O-center dot activity, and high HOCl/OCI- ratio. Finally, we suggest possible process mechanisms of the US/Fenton/TiO2 NT and US/CCI4 processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diuron, gabapentin, sulfamethoxazole, terbutryn and terbuthylazine are emerging micro-pollutants with concentrations in water and wastewater ranging from tens of ng/L to >10 mu g/L levels. The Fenton oxidation catalysed either by zero-valent iron (Fe(0)) or by Fe(II) salts was studied to treat the targeted micro-pollutants and their mixtures at compound concentrations between 1 and 1000 mu g/L. The Fe(0)-catalytic Fenton oxidation exhibited complete degradation of all micro-pollutants at initial solution pH 3 but at pH 5, the degradation was 90% for diuron, 80% for gabapentin, 95% for sulfamethoxazole, 100% for terbutryn and 70% for terbuthylazine, respectively. Moreover, dissolved organic carbon in multiple micro-pollutant solutions can be reduced by 70% at pH 3 and 46% at pH 5, which were much better than Fe(II)-catalytic Fenton reaction for the same pH conditions. SEM/EDX analysis showed the corrosion of iron surface and FTIR analysis evidenced the adsorption of oxidation by-products onto solid iron surface. Additionally, the toxicity of effluent after the treatment was reduced to minimal and the Behnajady-Modirshahla-Ghanbery (BMG) model fitted well to the kinetics of the mineralisation of the studied micropollutants. Finally, Fe(0) catalyst can be reused up to three times and the process produced no or less sludge at pH 3 and pH 5, respectively. The impact of this study is that the Fe(0)-catalytic Fenton oxidation would be an alternative to the traditional Fenton reaction to combat the environmental issues caused by the emerging micro-pollutants.

TI Occurrence of pharmaceutical metabolites and transformation products in
   the aquatic environment of the Mediterranean area

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active substances (PhACs) in aquatic ecosystems is of great concern due to their constant occurrence in different water systems and potential negative effects on the quality of water and living organisms. After consumption, PhACs are excreted as the parent compound, and/or as free or conjugated metabolites, which might finally arrive to surface and ground waters after their incomplete removal (and possible degradation) in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). A large amount of data about parent PhACs in water has been reported in the literature in the last decade; however, there is a lack of information about the presence of their metabolites and transformation/ degradation products (TPs). Recent publications report that PhACs found in water are only the "top of the iceberg" in relation to the environmental impact associated to the consumption of PhACs. From a scientific-technological point of view, the overall study of PhACs is a challenge and requires to advance with respect to current knowledge and analytical capacities, considering several key aspects, such as the reliable identification and quantification of the compounds, the improvement of the removal efficiency by the WWTPs, the study of their behaviour in the environment (e.g. persistence and biodegradability), and the environmental risk assessment, considering not only the parent PhACs but also their transformation/metabolism products. In this work, it is intended to delve into this problem, presenting a detailed overview on metabolites and TPs of PhACs in environmental waters from the Mediterranean area. Analytical and environmental problems associated to the determination of these compounds are briefly commented, ending the paper with the main conclusions and expected future trends in relation to this field.

AB N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable carcinogenic disinfection by-product, can be formed with high molar yields following chloramination of ranitidine (RNTD), a histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist. Although RNTD and some of its transformation products (TPs) have been studied under chlorination and photo-irradiation, the relationship between RNTD TPs and NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) remaining after those processes is still unclear. This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP. The results showed that NDMA-FP remained due to the presence of RNTD TPs, although RNTD itself was significantly removed by chlorination and/or photo-irradiation. TP-364 was only formed by chlorination of RNTD and could not be removed by photo-irradiation. TP-314 (a stereoisomer of RNTD), -299, and -286, which were mainly formed by photo-irradiation of RNTD but not by photo-irradiation after chlorination, had strong positive correlations with NDMA-FP (R-2 > 0.90; F-test, P < 0.01).

AB Tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand (TAML) activator is a functional analog of peroxidase enzymes, which activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high valence iron-oxo complexes that selectively degrade persistent aromatic organic contaminants (ACs) in water. Here, we develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on measured pseudo first-order kinetic rate coefficients (k(obs)) of 29 ACs (e.g., phenols and pharmaceuticals) oxidized by TAML/H2O2 at neutral and basic pH values to gain mechanistic insight on the selectivity and pH dependence of TAML/H2O2 systems. These QSAR models infer that electron donating ability (E-HOMO) is the most important AC characteristic for TAML/H2O2 oxidation, pointing to a rate-limiting single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. Oxidation rates at pH 7 also depend on AC reactive indices such as f(min)(-) and qH(+), which respectively represent propensity for electrophilic attack and the most positive net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms. At pH 10, TAML/H2O2 is more reactive towards ACs with a lower hydrogen to carbon atoms ratio (#H:C), suggesting the significance of hydrogen atom abstraction. In addition, In k(obs) of 14 monosubstituted phenols is negatively correlated with Hammett constants (sigma) and exhibits similar sensitivity to substituent effects as horseradish peroxidase. Although accurately predicting degradation rates of specific ACs in complex wastewater matrices could be difficult, these QSAR models are statistically robust and help predict both relative degradability and reaction mechanism for TAML/H2O2-based treatment processes.

AB In this study, a microbial electrochemical system (MES) was designed to evaluate the effects of a low frequency low voltage alternating electrical current on denitrification efficacy in the presence of ibuprofen as a low biodegradable organic carbon source. Cylindrical carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh electrodes containing a consortium of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were mounted in the wall of the designed laboratory scale bioreactor. The effects of inlet nitrate concentration (50-800 mg L-1), retention time (2.5-24 h), waveform magnitude (0.1-9.6 Vp-p), adjustable direct current voltage added to offset voltage (0.1-4.9 V), alternating current frequency (10-60 Hz), and waveforms (sinusoidal, square, and ramp) were studied in this work. The results showed that the proposed system removes 800 mg L-1 nitrate up to 95% during 6.5 h. Optimum conditions were obtained in the 8 Vp-p using a frequency of 10 Hz of a sinusoidal waveform. The morphology studies confirmed bacterial morphology change when applying the alternating current. Dehydrogenase activity of biofilms formed on surface of stainless steel electrodes increased to 15.24 mu gTF mg(biomass) cm(-2) d. The maximum bacterial activity was obtained at a voltage of 8 Vp-p. The experimental results revealed that the MES using a low frequency-low voltage alternating electrical current is a promising technique for nitrate removal from pharmaceutical wastewaters in the presence of low biodegradability of carbon sources such as ibuprofen.

AB In this study, ASM41 (as-synthesised MCM-41), MCM-41, MCM-41 encapsulated with graphene oxide (MCM-41-GO) and reduced graphene oxide (MCM-41-G) were fabricated and utilized in the remediation of acetaminophen and aspirin from water. A surfactant template (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) was added to ASM41 to make it more hydrophobic and its effects on the remediation of acetaminophen and aspirin from wastewater was studied. To further improve the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, MCM-41 was encapsulated with GO and G which also aided in easy separation of the adsorbent from the aqueous solution. Comparative studies of the adsorption of acetaminophen and aspirin on all four adsorbents were investigated. Batch adsorption studies of acetaminophen and aspirin were carried out to determine the effects of pH, initial concentration, time and adsorbent dose. Adsorption mechanism was through EDA, pi-pi interactions, and hydrophobic effects. Data from sorption kinetics showed ASM41 had the highest q(m) value for aspirin (909.1 mg/g) and MCM-41-G had the highest qm value for acetaminophen (555.6 mg/g). The significant adsorption by ASM41 can be attributed to increased hydrophobicity due to the retention of the surfactant template. Thermodynamic studies revealed the adsorption process as spontaneous and exothermic. Desorption studies revealed that adsorbents could be regenerated and reused for adsorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, steel pickling waste liquor was employed to obtain reactive nanoscale zero-valent metal (nZVM) with the purpose of engineering application. The degradation of metronidazole reacted with as-prepared nZVM in water was investigated to explore the feasibility of using the nZVM to treat antibiotics in wastewater. The synthesized nZVM was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The results showed that the nZVM (20-40 nm) with crystalline structure had a BET surface area of 35 m(2)/g. XPS and EDS only detected Fe, C and O on the surface, suggesting Ni and Zn distributed inside the core of nanoscale alloy. Degradation of metronidazole followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the observed reaction rate constant (k(obs)) could be improved with increasing nZVM dosage, as well as with diminishing initial metronidazole concentration and pH. A high reaction rate was observed at reduction potential, indicating that electrons and hydrogen species produced by nZVM were driving forces of reaction. The surface area-normalized rate coefficient (k(SA)) for nZVM (0.254 L min(-1) m(-2)) was 375.2 times larger than that for commercial iron powder (6.67 x 10(-4) L min(-1) m(-2)). Several possible pathways of degradation of metronidazole were proposed according to the results of UV-vis spectra and HPLC chromatograms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A microbial process for the degradation of three types of structurally distinct organonitriles (i.e., saturated and unsaturated aliphatic nitrile and aromatic nitrile) was studied. Microorganisms were enriched from the activated sludge of a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant and adapted through providing acetonitrile as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for their growth. The adapted mixed culture was then examined for their capability of degrading acetonitrile, acrylonitrile and benzonitrile under various operational conditions. The performance of biodegradation and the metabolic intermediate- and end-products in the process were monitored. The results show that an average removal rate of 0.083g acetonitrile g(-1)-VSSh(-1), 0.0074g acrylonitrileg(-1)-VSSh(-1) or 0.0029g benzonitrileg(-1)-VSSh(-1) was achieved in the batch bioreactor under the common operational condition of 25 degrees C and pH 7. The biodegradation of acetonitrile and acrylonitrile showed a two-step pathway, with the generation of acetamide followed by acetic acid and ammonia for acetonitrile or acrylamide followed by acrylic acid and ammonia for acrylonitrile. However, the biodegradation of benzonitrile appeared to have only one step, with the direct production of benzoic acid and ammonia, but without benzamide being detected in the process. The results suggest that, depending on the substrates, the adapted mixed culture can develop very different degradation pathways, such as nitrile hydratase plus amidase for acetonitrile or acrylonitrile and nitrilase for benzonitrile. Therefore, the adapted mixed culture has a great potential and flexibility for actual applications in biodegradation of various organonitrile compounds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Application of anaerobically digested sludges and manure (digestates) to agricultural fields reduces the need for fertilizer application, but might also pose environmental risks due to the introduction of various pollutants - including metal trace elements and pharmaceuticals- to amended soils. The simultaneous presence of different contaminants can affect plant uptake, altering the performance of phytoremediation. This work aims to investigate and compare the single and combined effects of Enrofloxacin (Enro) and Cu on their plant uptake from digestate solutions. Plant uptake experiments were carried out by exposing, for 5 days, Phragmites australis to three different concentrations of a liquid digestate doped with Cu and/or Enro. Contaminant concentrations were afterward determined in both plant tissues and digestate solutions. Contaminant speciation in solution and Cu speciation in plant roots were also assessed. Cu plant uptake (mostly in plant roots, Cu concentration varied between 55 and 254 mu g.g(-1)) was observed, especially at low concentration of digestate. At high digestate concentration, Cu uptake decreased clue to the formation of Cu-DOC complexes rendering Cu less bioavailable. The presence of the antibiotic slightly further reduced Cu plant uptake due to the formation of Cu-Enro complexes. Plant roots also accumulated Enro, an accumulation also higher for the lowest concentration of digestate (an increase of 40%), and that slightly increased in the presence of Cu (up to 226 mu g.g(-1)). However, proportion of free Enro in solution decreased (up to 70%) in the presence of Cu due to complexation. Cu speciation in plant roots confirmed the implication of the complexation in the uptake of Cu and Enro when they are simultaneously present in solution. Thus, the presence of amendments (such as digestates) increasing the DOC content, in addition to the interactions between contaminants, should be taken into account for field crop soils as well as for phytoremediation technologies.

AB The contribution of volatilization, sorption and transformation to the removal of 16 Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in two lab-scale conventional activated sludge reactors, working under nitrifying (aerobic) and denitrifying (anoxic) conditions for more than 1.5 years, have been assessed. Pseudo-first order biological degradation rate constants (k(biol)) were calculated for the selected compounds in both reactors. Faster degradation kinetics were measured in the nitrifying reactor compared to the denitrifying system for the majority of PPCPs. Compounds could be classified according to their k(biol) into very highly (k(biol) > 5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)), highly (1 < k(biol) < 5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)), moderately (0.5 < k(biol) < 1 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)) and hardly (k(biol) < 0.5 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1)) biodegradable.
   Results indicated that fluoxetine (FLX), natural estrogens (E1 + E2) and musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN and ADBI) were transformed to a large extent under aerobic (>75%) and anoxic (>65%) conditions, whereas naproxen (NPX), ethinylestradiol (EE2), roxithromycin (ROX) and erythromycin (ERY) were only significantly transformed in the aerobic reactor (>80%). The anti-depressant citalopram (CTL) was moderately biotransformed under both, aerobic and anoxic conditions (>60% and >40%, respectively). Some compounds, as carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), manifested high resistance to biological transformation.
   Solids Retention Time (SRTaerobic >50 d and <50 d; SRTanoxic >20 d and <20 d) had a slightly positive effect on the removal of FLX, NPX, CTL, EE2 and natural estrogens (increase in removal efficiencies <10%). Removal of diclofenac (DCF) in the aerobic reactor was positively affected by the development of nitrifying biomass and increased from 0% up to 74%. Similarly, efficient anoxic transformation of ibuprofen (75%) was observed after an adaptation period of 340 d. Temperature (16-26 degrees C) only had a slight effect on the removal of CTL which increased in 4%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in water resources is widely documented in Europe, North America and Asia. However, in South America, these studies are still incipient. The objective of this study was to screen and identify the presence of pharmaceuticals of various therapeutic classes, including illicit drugs such as cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, in urban drainage channels that flow into the bathing waters of Guaruja city, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Moreover, the ecological potential risks to the aquatic biota were also assessed. The water samples were collected from four beaches of Guaruja in two different points: in the urban drainage channels and in the nearby coast line. A total of 16 compounds were detected using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry: carbamazepine (0.1-8.0 ng/L), caffeine (33.5-6550.0 ng/L), cocaine (0.2-30.3 ng/L), benzoylecgonine (0.9-278.0 ng/L), citalopram (0.2-0.4 ng/L), acetaminophen (18.3-391.0 ng/L), diclofenac (0.9-79.8 ng/L), orphenadrine (0.2-1.5 ng/L), atenolol (0.1-140.0 ng/L), propranolol (limit of detection: LOD-0.9 ng/L), enalapril (2.2-3.8 ng/L), losartan (3.6-548.0 ng/L), valsartan (19.8-798.0 ng/L), rosuvastatin (2.5-38.5 ng/L), chlortalidone (0.1-0.4 ng/L) and clopidogrel (0.1-0.2 ng/L). The hereby data also showed that five of these compounds, namely caffeine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, losartan and valsartan, could raise moderate to severe risks to aquatic organisms (algae, crustaceans and fishes). This study is the first report of the occurrence of several pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in urban drainage channels that flow to the bathing waters in South America, and it is the first quantification of rosuvastatin, chlortalidone and clopidogrel in environmental marine waters of Latin America.

AB Contaminated sites are recognized as the "hotspot" for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria. It is very challenging to understand mechanism of development of antibiotic resistance in polluted environment in the presence of different anthropogenic pollutants. Uncertainties in the environmental processes adds complexity to the development of resistance. This study attempts to develop mathematical model by using stochastic partial differential equations for the transport of fluoroquinolone and its resistant bacteria in riverine environment. Poisson's process is assumed for the diffusion approximation in the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). Sensitive analysis is performed to evaluate the parameters and variables for their influence over the model outcome. Based on their sensitivity, the model parameters and variables are chosen and classified into environmental, demographic, and anthropogenic categories to investigate the sources of stochasticity. Stochastic partial differential equations are formulated for the state variables in the model. This SPDE model is then applied to the 100 km stretch of river Musi (South India) and simulations are carried out to assess the impact of stochasticity in model variables on the resistant bacteria population in sediments. By employing the stochasticity in model variables and parameters we came to know that environmental and anthropogenic variations are not able to affect the resistance dynamics at all. Demographic variations are able to affect the distribution of resistant bacteria population uniformly with standard deviation between 0.087 and 0.084, however, is not significant to have any biological relevance to it. The outcome of the present study is helpful in simplifying the model for practical applications. This study is an ongoing effort to improve the model for the transport of antibiotics and transport of antibiotic resistant bacteria in polluted river. There is a wide gap between the knowledge of stochastic resistant bacterial growth dynamics and the knowledge of transport of antibiotic resistance in polluted aquatic environment, this study is one step towards filling up that gap.

AB Emissions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO,) from spent mycelia of the mold Penicilium notatum and sludge from the effluent treatment facility (ETPS) of a pharmaceutical industry were estimated twice during a two-week composting before vermicomposting. These wastes are dumped in landfills or sometimes used in agricultural fields and no reports are available on their greenhouse gas producing potentials. The solid wastes contained appreciable organic carbon and nitrogen while very high Fe, Mn and Zn were found in ETPS only. Pure wastes did not support germination of Vigna radiata L. while mixing soil with ETPS and spent mycelia at the ratios of 12:1 and 14:1 led to 80% and 50% germination, respectively. The wastes were mixed with cowdung at the ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 for composting. Carbon dioxide emissions were always significantly higher than CH4 emissions from all the treatments due to prevalence of aerobic condition during composting. From some treatments, CH4 emissions increased with time, indicating increasing activity of anaerobic bacteria in the waste mixtures. Methane emissions ranged from 21.6 to 231.7 mu g m(-2) day(-1) while CO2 emissions were greater than thousand times at 39.8-894.8 mg m(-2) day(-1). The amount of C emitted as CH4-C and CO2-C from ranged from 0.007% to 0.081% of total C composted. Cowdung emitted highest CH4 followed by spent mycelia and ETPS while ETPS emitted more CO2 than spent mycelia but lesser than cowdung. Global warming potential of emitted CH4 was found to be in the range of 10.6-27.7 mg-CO2-equivalent on a 20-year time horizon. The results suggest that pharmaceutical wastes can be an important source of CH4 and CO2 during composting or any other stockpiling under suitable moisture conditions. The waste mixtures were found not suitable for vermicomposting after two weeks composting and earthworms did not survive long in the mixtures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alterations of the physical-chemical properties of the oceans due to anthropogenic activities are, at present, one of the most concerning environmental issues studied by researchers. One of these issues is ocean acidification, mainly caused by overproduction and release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic sources. Another component of environmental degradation is related to the production and release of potential toxic compounds, namely active pharmaceutical ingredients, into the aquatic environment that, combined with oceanic acidification, can cause unpredictable and never before considered deleterious effects on non-target marine organisms. Regarding this issue, the hereby study used predictions of future ocean acidification to simulate realistic scenarios of environmental exposure to a common therapeutic drug, salicylic acid (SA), in the marine gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis under different pH values. This species was exposed to a range of pH values (8.2, 7.9 and 7.6), and to already reported environmentally realistic concentrations (5, 25 and 125 mu g/L) of SA. To evaluate the effects of these environmental stressors, key physiological biomarkers (GSTs, CAT, TBARS, AChE and COX) and shell hardness (SH) were quantified. Results from the present study showed that CAT and GSTs activities were enhanced by SA under water acidification; increased lipid peroxidation was also observed in organisms exposed to SA in more acidic media. In addition, the hereby study demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of SA through the inhibition of AChE. Effects were also observed in terms of COX activity, showing that SA absorption may be affected by water acidification. In terms of SH, the obtained data suggest that SA may alter the physical integrity of shells of exposed organisms. It is possible to conclude that the combination of seawater acidification and exposure to toxic xenobiotics (namely to the drug SA) may be strenuous to marine communities, making aquatic biota more susceptible to xenobiotics, and consequently endangering marine life in an unpredictable extent.

AB Water diversion projects have been continuously used to alleviate water quality issues that arise during urbanization. However, studies about whether it has possible effects on the status of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are limited. In this study, the occurrence trends and spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of 50 PPCPs were investigated in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments in Nanjing urban rivers under the background of the water diversion project from the Yangtze River to the Qinhuai River. In the four field campaigns that were embarked on April to July 2018, a total of 40, 38 and 24 PPCPs were detected in surface water, SPM and sediments, respectively, with overall concentrations of 138-1990 ng/L, 3214-33,701 ng/g and 12.1-109 ng/g dry weight (dw) among nine sampling sites. The excessive concentration of caffeine (20.6-905 ng/L) may be evidence of the direct discharge of untreated sewage and an obvious indicator of the overall concentrations of PPCPs. The PPCPs contamination levels in surface water were increased along with the direction of the water diversion in urban runoff, and decreased by 8-31% due to the increase in volume attributable to the water diversion. The distribution coefficients (K-d) of pollutants in the SPM-water phases (3.0-5.6 L/kg) were two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sediment-water phases (0.3-3.3 L/kg). And the positive correlations between their log K-ow and SPM-water log K-d values indicated SPM was the important carrier determining the fate of organic UV filters. Furthermore, the results of ecological risk assessment demonstrated that although the increase in the volume of water caused by the water diversion reduced the overall ecological risks of PPCPs in urban rivers, the current contamination level still represents high risks to algae and fish.

AB Although pharmaceutical and therapeutic products are widely found in the natural environment, there is limited Understanding of their ecological effects. Here we used rotating annular bioreactors to assess the impact of 10 mu g-L-1 of the selected pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, carbamazepine, furosemide, and caffeine on riverine biofilms. After 8 weeks of development, community structure was assessed using in situ microscopic analyses, fluor-conjugated lectin binding, standard plate counts, fluorescent in Situ hybridization, carbon utilization spectra, and stable carbon isotope analyses. The biofilm communities varied markedly in architecture although only caffeine treated biofilms were significantly thicker. Cyanobacteria were Suppressed by all 4 compounds, whereas the nitrogen containing caffeine, furosemide, and carbamazepine increased algal biomass. Ibuprofen and carbamazepine reduced bacterial biomass, white caffeine and furosemide increased it. Exopolymer content and composition of the biofilms was also influenced. Significant positive and negative effects were observed in carbon utilization spectra. In situ hybridization analyses indicated all treatments significantly decreased the gamma-proteobacterial Populations and increased beta-proteobacterial. Ibuprofen in particular increased the alpha-proteobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, cytophaga-flavobacteria, and SRB385 probe positive populations. Caffeine and carbarnazepine additions resulted in significant increases in the high GC354c and low GC69a probe positive cells. Live-dead analyses of the biofilins indicated that all treatments influenced the ratio of live-to-dead cells with controls having a ratio of 2.4, carbamazepine and ibuprofen being 3.2 and 3.5, respectively, and furosemide and caffeine being 1.9 and 1.7, respectively. Stable isotope analyses of the biofilms indicated delta C-13 values shifted to more negative values relative to control biofilins. This shift may be consistent with proportional loss of cyanobacteria and relative increase in algal biomass rather than incorporation of pharmaceutical carbon into microbial biofilm. Thus, at 10 ug.L-1 levels pharmaceuticals exhibit both nutrient-like and toxic effects on riverine microbial communities.

AB A high-efficient, low-cost, and practical biochar implementation method is desired to extend biochar's powerful adsorption performance for environmental remediation. This study presents novel results with advanced biochar application by integrating biochar with biofilter for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from stormwater. Biochars derived from wood dust (BC0) at different pyrolytic temperatures (300, 500, and 700 degrees C, referred as, BC300, BC500, and BC700, respectively) were characterized and investigated for their adsorption of BPA under different pH levels and humic acid (HA) concentrations by batch sorption and fixed-bed column experiments. Microcosm biofilters vegetated with phragmites australis and amended with different biochars were constructed and used for BPA removal under different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Compared with other biochars, BC700 showed a high adsorption rate and capacity due to high specific surface area and pore volume. As a consequence, fixed-bed columns amended with BC700 can remove BPA more efficiently than columns with BC0, BC300, and BC500 from synthetic stormwater, though the treatment performance was affected relatively by pH change and HA concentration. A high correlation (r(2) = 0.899) between the breakthrough time and the product of adsorption rate (k(2)) and capacity (Q(max)) was found, which suggests that batch sorption experiments could be an efficient tool for prediction of breakthrough time. The BPA removal efficiency of microcosm biofilters amended with BC0, BC300, BC500 and BC700 for real stormwater containing 200 mu g/L BPA at HLR of 40 cm/h averaged 4.1, 10.8, 80.3, and 98.4%, which were about 6, 15, 115, and 141 times, respectively, compared to bilfitlers without biochar amendment. Moreover, biochar amendment not only enhanced the BPA removal but also promoted phragmites australis growth, elevated nutrients and increased the E. coli removal efficiency. Hence, biochar-amended biofilters could be a promising approach for enhancing the elimination of endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as BPA from aqueous environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has triggered concern among the general population and received considerable attention from the scientific community in recent years. However, only a few publications have focused on anticancer drugs, a class of pharmaceuticals that can exhibit cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. The present study investigated the photodegradation, biodegradation, bacterial toxicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of cyclophosphamide (CP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The photodegradation experiments were performed at a neutral to slight pH range (7-7.8) using two different lamps (medium-pressure mercury lamp and a xenon lamp). The primary elimination of the parent compounds was monitored by means of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS/MS). NPOC (non-purgeable organic carbon) analyses were carried out in order to assess mineralization rates. The Closed Bottle Test (CBT) was used to assess ready biodegradability. A new method using Vibrio fischeri was adopted to evaluate toxicity. CP was not degraded by any lamp, whereas 5-FU was completely eliminated by irradiation with the mercury lamp but only partially by the Xe lamp. No mineralization was observed for the experiments performed with the Xe lamp, and a NPOC removal of only 18% was registered for 5-FU after 256 min using the UV lamp. Not one of the parent compounds was readily biodegradable in the CBT. Photo transformation products (PTPs) resulting from photolysis were neither better biodegradable nor less toxic than the parent compound 5-FU. In contrast, the results of the tests carried out with the UV lamp indicated that more biodegradable and non-toxic PTPs of 5-FU were generated. Three PTPs were formed during the photodegradation experiments and were identified. The results of the in silico QSAR predictions showed positive mutagenic and genotoxic alerts for 5-FU, whereas only one of the formed PTPs presented positive alerts for the genotoxicity endpoint.

AB As a famous project in China, the water diversion from Yangtze River to Taihu Lake Project has impacts on the water quality of Taihu Lake, especially Gonghu Bay, which is the entrance of the diversion water and the drinking water source for Wuxi and Suzhou. To investigate contamination of the antibiotics in Gonghu Bay in the period of water diversion, 16 antibiotics in 14 water samples collected from Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay in China were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the concentration of total antibiotics in Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay ranged from 1320 to 17,209 ng/L (mean: 3920 +/- 3841 ng/L). The average level of different antibiotics was tetracyclines (range 1082-15,310 ng/L, mean 3161 +/- 3479 ng/L) > quinolones (range 225-1325 ng/L, mean 463 +/- 276 ng/L) > sulfonamides (range n.d.-888 ng/L, mean 402 +/- 248 ng/L) > macrolides (range 12-17 ng/L, mean 14 +/- 2 ng/L), and levels of the detected antibiotics in Gonghu Bay were higher than that in Wangyu River, indicating that the antibiotics pollution in Gonghu Bay were much severer than Wangyu River. Ecological risk evaluation showed that in the Wangyu and Gonghu water, trimethoprim (TMP), sulfacetamide (SAAM), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), and sulfamerazine (SMRZ) presented low ecological risk levels, chlortetracycline (CTC), tetracycline (TC), roxithromycin (ROM), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) had medium level of risk, and oxytetracycline (OTC), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enrofloxacin (ENR) had high level of ecological risk. The total hazard quotient of antibiotic mixtures for each sample site indicated high risk of antibiotics in Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay. In summary, the water diversion could mitigate antibiotic pollution in Gonghu Bay to a certain degree. However, the risk of antibiotics in the Wangyu River and Gonghu Bay is still high.

Also increases in damage index were observed before treatment of 53.1, 59.9, 66.6 and 72.1% at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. After treatment the same biomarkers of oxidative stress decreased with respect to before treatment being to HPC (29.3, 22.5, 41.6 and 31.7%); LPX (14.2, 43.1, 30.7 and 35.5%); PCC (12.6, 21.3, 24.2 and 23.9%); SOD (39.2, 33.9, 49.5 and 37.9%) and CAT (28.6, 35.8, 33.7 and 31.7) at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively (P < 0.05). The damage index were decreased at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h in 48.9, 57.8, 67.3 and 72.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrate the need of performing bioassays in order to characterize an effluent before discharge and not base such a decision only upon current normativity. In addition, it was also concluded that the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process decreases the presence of PCT, oxidative stress, genotoxic damage and LC50 in Hyalella azteca. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Atenolol is a highly prescribed anti-hypertensive pharmaceutical and a member of the group of beta-blockers. It has been detected at concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to low mu g L-1 in waste and surface waters. The present study aimed to assess the sub-lethal effects of atenolol on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and to determine its tissue-specific bioconcentration. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed for 21 and 42 days to three concentration levels of atenolol (1 mu g L-1 environmentally relevant concentration, 10 mu g L-1, and 1000 mu g L-1). The fish exposed to 1 mu g L-1 atenolol exhibited a higher lactate content in the blood plasma and a reduced haemoglobin content compared with the control. The results show that exposure to atenolol at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mu g L-1 significantly reduces both the haematocrit value and the glucose concentration in the blood plasma. The activities of the studied antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were not significantly affected by atenolol exposure, and only the highest tested concentration of atenolol significantly reduced the activity of glutathione reductase. The activities of selected CYP450 enzymes were not affected by atenolol exposure. The histological changes indicate that atenolol has an effect on the vascular system, as evidenced by the observed liver congestion and changes in the pericardium and myocardium. Atenolol was found to have a very low bioconcentration factor (the highest value found was 0.27). The bioconcentration levels followed the order liver > kidney > muscle. The concentration of atenolol in the blood plasma was below the limit of quantification (10 ng g(-1)). The bioconcentration factors and the activities of selected CYP450 enzymes suggest that atenolol is not metabolised in the liver and may be excreted unchanged. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) conducted a survey in 2006 on emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) which included pharmaceuticals, hormones and bisphenol A (BPA). The survey collected 258 samples over a 16 month period from selected source waters and 17 drinking water systems (DWSs), and analyzed them for 48 EOCs using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) for the highest precision and accuracy of analytical data possible. 27 of the 48 target EOCs were detected in source water, finished drinking water, or both. DWSs using river and lake source water accounted for > 90% detections. Of the 27 EOCs found, we also reported the first detection of two antibiotics roxithromycin and enrofloxacin in environmental samples. The most frequently detected compounds (>= 10%) in finished drinking water were carbamazepine (CBZ), gemfibrozil (GFB), ibuprofen (IBU), and BPA; with their concentrations accurately determined by using IDMS and calculated to be 4 to 10 times lower than those measured in the source water. Comparison of plant specific data allowed us to determine removal efficiency (RE) of these four most frequently detected compounds in Ontario DWSs. The RE of CBZ was determined to be from 71 to 93% for DWSs using granulated activated carbon (GAC); and was 75% for DWSs using GAC followed by ultraviolet irradiation (UV). The observed RE of GFB was between 44 and 55% in DWSs using GAC and increased to 82% when GAC was followed by UV. The use of GAC or GAC followed by UV provided an RE improvement of SPA from 80 to 99%. These detected concentration levels are well below the predicted no effect concentration or total allowable concentration reported in the literature. Additional targeted, site specific comparative research is required to fully assess the effectiveness of Ontario DWSs to remove particular compounds of concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tens of thousands of man-made chemicals are in everyday use in developed countries. A high proportion of these, or their transformation products, probably reach the aquatic environment. A considerable amount is known about the environmental concentrations of some of these chemicals (such as metals), especially the regulated ones, but little or nothing is known about the majority. In densely populated countries, most or all rivers will receive both diffuse (e.g. agricultural runoff) and point source (e.g. sewage treatment plant effluent) inputs, and hence be contaminated with complex, ill-defined mixtures of chemicals. Most freshwater organisms will be exposed, to varying degrees, to this contamination. The number of species exposed is in the thousands, and quite possibly tens of thousands. Little is known about whether or not these species are adversely affected by the chemicals present in their environment. Often it is not even known what species are present, let alone whether they are affected by the chemicals present. In a few high-profile cases (e.g. tributyl tin causing imposex in molluscs and oestrogens 'feminizing' male fish), chemicals have undoubtedly adversely affected aquatic species, occasionally leading to population crashes. Whether or not other chemicals are affecting less visible species (such as most invertebrates) is largely unknown. It is possible that only very few chemicals in the freshwater environment are adversely affecting wildlife, but it is equally possible that some effects of chemicals are, as yet, undiscovered (and may remain so). Nor it is clear which chemicals may pose the greatest risk to aquatic organisms. All these uncertainties leave much to chance, yet designing a regulatory system that would better protect aquatic organisms from chemicals is difficult. A more flexible and intelligent strategy may improve the current situation. Finally, the risk due to chemicals is put into context with the many other threats, such as alien species and new diseases that undoubtedly can pose significant risks to aquatic ecosystems.

AB Recycling sludge as a soil amendment has both positive and negative effects because of its enrichment in both nutrients and contaminants. So far; the negative effect has to be extensively investigated that the severities of different types of contaminants also remain unclear. The environmental behavior and risk of organic contaminant and pharmaceuticals, heavy metal and salt as well as pathogenic microorganisms brought by sludge amendment are summarized and discussed here. Organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals are typically found at low concentrations in sludge, the risks from sludge-amended soil decrease over time owing to its biodegradability. On the other hand, application of sludge generally increases soil salinity, which may cause physiological damage to plants grown in sludge-amended soil. In some extent, this negative effect can be alleviated by means of dilution; however, greater attention should be paid to long term increasing possible risk of eutrophication. Heavy metal (particularly of mobile heavy metals, such as Cd) with high concentrations in sludge and soil receiving considerable sludge can cause its incremental abundance in soil and crop contamination, further posing risks to humans, but most cases showed that there remained not excessive in heavy metal caused by sludge amendment. It is worth noting that increasing soil organic matter content may reduce transfer of heavy metal from soil to crops, but not restrict its uptake by crops at all. Combined literature together, it is summarized that heavy metal becomes a relatively severe bottleneck in recycling of sludge as soil amendment due to its non biodegradability and potential damage to health by adventuring contamination from agricultural products. Particular attention should therefore be paid to long term monitoring the change of heavy metals concentration in sludge amended soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, aquatic concentrations of seven parabens were determined in urban streams highly affected by treated or untreated domestic sewage in Tokushima and Osaka, Japan. The detected highest concentrations were 670, 207, and 163 ng l(-1) for methylparaben, n-propylparaben, and n-butylparaben, respectively in sampling sites with watershed area of no sewer system in Tokushima. Conventional acute/chronic toxicity tests were conducted using medaka (Oryzias latipes), Daphnia magna, and Psuedokirchneriella subcapitata for four parabens, which was consistent with our previous study on three parabens, n-butylparaben, butylparaben, and benzylparaben. The aquatic toxicity on fish, daphnia, and algae was weaker for the parabens with a shorter alkyl chain than those with a longer alkyl chain as predicted by their hydrophobicity. Medaka vitellogenin assays and DNA microarray analysis were carried out for methylparaben and found induction of significant vitellogenin in male medaka at 630 mu g l(-1) of methylparaben, while the expression levels of genes encoding proteins such as choriogenin and vitellogenin increased for concentrations at 10 mu g l(-1) of methylparaben. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of seven parabens in Tokushima and Osaka were divided by predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) and hazard quotient (MEC/PNEC) was determined for individual parabens. The MEC/PNEC was highest for n-propylparaben and was 0.010 followed by n-butylparaben (max. of 0.0086) and methylparaben (max. of 0.0042). The sum of the MEC/PNEC for the seven parabens was 0.0049. Equivalence factors were assigned for each paraben on the basis of the toxicity of n-butylparaben for each species, and n-butylparaben equivalence was calculated for the measured environmental concentrations. The MEC/PNEC approach was also conducted for the n-butyl-paraben-based equivalence values. The maximum MEC/PNEC was 0.018, which is lower than the trigger level for further detailed study such as large-scale monitoring for chronic toxicity tests including full-life cycle tests for fish.

AB The adsorption of two representative pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (naproxen and carbamazepine) and one endocrine disrupting compound (nonylphenol) were evaluated on two types of activated carbon. When determining their isotherms at environmentally relevant concentration levels, it was found that at this low concentration range (10-800 ng/L), removals of the target compounds were contrary to expectations based on their hydrophobicity. Nonylphenol (logK(ow) 5.8) was most poorly adsorbed, whereas carbamazepine (logK(ow) 2.45) was most adsorbable. Nonylphenol Freundlich isotherms at this very low concentration range had a much higher 1/n compared to isotherms at much higher concentrations. This indicates that extrapolation from an isotherm obtained at a high concentration range to predict the adsorption of nonylphenol at a concentration well below the range of the original isotherm, leads to a substantial overestimation of its removals. Comparison of isotherms for the target compounds to those for other conventional micropollutants suggested that naproxen and carbamazepine could be effectively removed by applying the same dosage utilized to remove odorous compounds (geosmin and MIB) at very low concentrations. The impact of competitive adsorption by background natural organic matter (NOM) on the adsorption of the target compounds was quantified by using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) in combination with the equivalent background compound (EBC) approach. The fulfilment of the requirements for applying the simplified IAST-EBC model, which leads to the conclusion that the percentage removal of the target compounds at a given carbon dosage is independent of the initial contaminant concentration, was confirmed for the situation examined in the paper. On this basis it is suggested that the estimated minimum carbon usage rates (CURs) to achieve 90% removal of these emerging contaminants would be valid at concentrations of less than 500 ng/L in natural water.

AB The aim of the study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of (methyl and propyl) parabens likely to be environmental contaminants on early and late passage fibroblasts isolated from human skin. The study was carried out on senescent diploid cell lines, namely normal (senescent) dermal fibroblasts CCD-1136Sk (ATCC (R) CRL-2697 (TM)). In order to assess the cytotoxic effect, the MTT test which determines the cells' metabolic activity and the neutral red uptake assay which assesses the cell membrane integrity (NRU test) were applied. Propyl paraben (PrPB) appeared to be more cytotoxic to the analysed dermal fibroblasts (since it reached lower IC50 values); however, none of the tests found a consistent trend for a change in the cells' sensitivity to the analysed parabens as they age, that would be reflected in the determined IC50 values. On the other hand, having analysed the course of the curves of relationships between the cell viability and the preservative concentration, it was found that at the exposure of CCD-1136Sk fibroblasts to propyl paraben, none of the two tests observed different sensitivity of late and early cell passages; however, the exposure of dermal fibroblasts to methyl paraben, determined using the NRU test, indicated a stronger effect of the preservative at a concentration of 50 and 200 mu g/ml on the earliest cells passage (no. 8), compared to the subsequent passages of these cells. At the same time, the compound with a concentration of 50 and 800 mu g/ml was the least toxic to the latest cells passage (no. 20). The presented results indicate that the analysed parabens used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries may be toxic to skin cells; moreover, it is not excluded that with consecutive passaging, differences in the susceptibility to cytotoxic effects may occur. It therefore appears necessary to take into account the possibility of different later and earlier passages cells' reactivity when interpreting the results of studies into the effects of preservatives on the living body. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that humans may be exposed to preservatives due to environmental contamination.

AB Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from drinking water is usually enhanced by advanced oxidation which is not affordable in low income countries. Slow sand filtration has been found to be capable of removing anti-inflammatory compounds, and its low maintenance costs and easy operation make it an attractive technology for treating drinking water in many parts of the world. In addition, slow sand filters can be used at both large and household scales. The biofilm (i.e. schmutzdecke) developed on the top of the sand and within the upper layers of the sand is acknowledged to be responsible for the water purification. However, it is possible that the PPCPs may affect the schmutzdecke development and microbial community within the filters, and consequently the performance of the filter. This study investigated two household slow sand filters (for water purification) operated intermittently with and without contamination by six PPCPs. Eleven parameters were monitored in the affluent and effluent water, including bacterial species present and schmutzdecke biomass development. Results demonstrated that the household slow sand filter performance was not affected by the 2 mu g L-1 of PPCPs in the water. There was no significant difference between filters for total coliforms and E. coli removal, but there was considerable difference between sampling times. Biomass considerably increased with the number of filtrations in both filters and there was no significant difference between filter biomass. However, it was found that more bacterial species were present in the period with no contamination than during the contamination period. Bacillus anthracis and Exiguobacterium sp. showed to be resistant to the effects of the PPCPs. These suggest there are effects of PPCPs on bacterial species within the filter. However, the effect of the PPCPs on biomass was not conclusive in this study and needs to be further investigated.

AB This chapter on urban water in large population centres like Halle/Saale and Leipzig (Germany) focuses on the source, distribution and transport behaviour of xenobiotics as indicator substances for anthropogenic impacts on urban water systems.
   The xenobiotics reported here are micropollutants including pharmaceuticals, personal care products (collectively known as PPCPs) and industrial chemicals, which show low concentrations in urban waters. Such chemicals can be endocrine disrupters or are otherwise eco-toxic. The concepts presented herein required a new methodology for assessing the impact of human activities on the urban water system and processes in urban watersheds. To this end, we used different approaches in relation to the hydrogeological and hydrodynamic settings of the cities of Halle and Leipzig. For the Halle urban area, a conceptual flow and transport model was developed based on interaction between the river Saale and groundwater, and mass fluxes were computed, based on water balance calculations. For Leipzig, as a first approach, we established a monitoring program that involved various urban land use types and investigated their influence on the urban water system. Multivariate statistics and integral pumping tests were applied to account for the spatially highly heterogeneous conditions and time-varying concentrations. At both sites, we demonstrated the use of indicators consisting of physico-chemical parameters, ions, isotopes and compound-specific patterns of xenobiotics. The chosen indicators of pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, redox conditions, nitrate, sulphate, chloride, boron, the isotopes of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and boron, as well as bisphenol A, carbamazepine, technical 4-nonylphenol (t-nonylphenol), galaxolide, tonalide, and gadolinium, helped to balance urban substance fluxes and assess urban effects on surface water quality. From our current quantification, it is clear that predicting contaminant behaviour in urban areas demands a detailed process understanding which cannot be derived from laboratory experiments or phenomenological analyses at the catchment scale. Through an installation of measuring equipment at the interfaces between the unsaturated and saturated zone as well as between ground- and surface water, in situ contaminant transport and rate can be quantified from the cm- up to the m-range.

AB Animals living in aquatic habitats regularly encounter anthropogenic chemical pollution. Typically, the toxicity of a chemical toxicant is determined by the median lethal concentration (LC50) through a static exposure test. However, LC50 values and static tests do not provide an accurate representation of exposure to pollutants within natural stream systems. In their native habitats, animals experience exposure as a fluctuating concentration due to turbulent mixing, temporal variations of contamination (seasonal inputs), and contaminant input type (point vs. non-point). Research has shown that turbulent environments produce exposures with a high degree of fluctuation in frequency, duration, and intensity. In order to more effectively evaluate the effects of pollutants, we created a dynamic exposure paradigm, utilizing both flow and substrate within a small mesocosm. A commonly used pharmaceutical, naproxen, was used as the toxicant and female crayfish (Orconectes virilis) as the target organism to investigate changes in fighting behavior as a result of dynamic exposure. Crayfish underwent either a 23 h long static or a dynamic exposure to naproxen. Following exposure, the target crayfish and an unexposed size matched opponent underwent a 15 min fight trial. These fight trials were recorded and later analyzed using a standard ethogram. Results indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of naproxen, in both static and flowing conditions, negatively impact aggressive behavior. Results also indicate that a dynamic exposure paradigm has a greater negative impact on behavior than a static exposure. Turbulence and habitat structure play important roles in shaping chemical exposure. Future research should incorporate features of dynamic chemical exposure in order to form a more comprehensive image of chemical exposure and predict the resulting sublethal effects from exposure. Possible techniques for assessment include utilizing flow through experimental set-ups in tandem with behavioral or physiological endpoints as opposed to acute toxicity. Other possibilities of assessment could involve utilizing fine-scale chemical measurements of pollutants to determine the actual concentrations animals encounter during an exposure event.

AB Pharmaceutically active substances have recently been recognised as an emerging environmental problem. Human and veterinarian therapeutic agents can contaminate aquatic ecosystems via sewage discharges (human and animal excretion), improper disposal or industrial waste. Very little is known on the effects of pharmaceutical pollutants on aquatic photosynthetic organisms. In this study the effects of erythromycin, tetracycline and ibuprofen on the growth of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and the duckweed Lemna minor FBR006 were studied at concentrations of 1-1000 mug l(-1). At dosage of 1 mg l(-1), erythromycin affected the growth of both Synechocystis and Leinna with a maximum inhibition of 70 and 20%, respectively. Tetracycline had inhibitory effects (20-22% reduction in growth) on Synechocystis at intermediate dosages. The same aminoglycoside antibiotic promoted growth in Lemna by 26% at 10 mug l(-1), while frond development was reduced at 1 mg l(-1) (tetracycline). The anti-inflammatory ibuprofen strongly stimulated the growth of Synechocystis at all concentrations tested (72% increase at 10 mug l(-1)) although inhibited Lemna in a linear dose-dependent manner with a 25% reduction over control levels at a dosage of 1 mg l(-1). The 7 days effective concentration (EC50) calculated for Lemna were 5.6, 1 and 4 g l(-1), respectively, for erythromycin, tetracycline and ibuprofen. Moreover, exposure to the three pharmaceuticals resulted in the production of the stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), in Lemna. Erythromycin and tetracycline were more effective in promoting ABA synthesis compared to ibuprofen. The effects shown by the three therapeutic drugs on Synechocystis and Lemna growth may have potential implications in the assessments of residual environmental risks associated with the presence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems. Promotion of ABA synthesis in Lemna by the two antibiotics and by copper suggests that the plant hormone could be a suitable (additional) indicator for future evaluation of phytotoxicity that results in plant senescence.

AB The toxicity of pharmaceutical pollutants affects aquatic life as well as the environment on all levels of the natural hierarchy. Therefore, to maintain the natural environment it is crucial to exclude pharmaceutical compounds, such as ofloxacin (OFX), sunset yellow (SY), and tartrazine (TRT) from aqueous systems. In this study, a green nanoadsorbent (CS@GOn) will be prepared by the electrostatic interaction of chitosan (CS) and graphene oxide (GO). Characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of CS@GOn will be performed and the cross-linking of CS with GO will be confirmed. Further, batch electrocoagulation (EC) and ultrasonication adsorption (UA) assisted processes will be performed individually and as hybrid systems for the removal of OFX, TRT, and SY from aqueous solutions. The optimum conditions will be evaluated by considering the minimum operating cost (OC). In EC processes, based on the economic >70% removal of OFX, TRT, and SY were achieved at optimum conditions of pH 7, 10 min, and OFX 200 mg/L. However, in UA processes, >83% OFX, TRT, and SY were removed under the same conditions. In hybrid EC and UA processes, >98% OFX, TRT, and SY were removed at the optimized conditions (pH 7, 10 min, and OFX 200 mg/L, dose 0.1 g/200 mL, and 25 degrees C). CS@GOn was reused up to five times after the regeneration. Compared with EC and UA individual processes, hybrid EC and UA processes were more effective for the removal of OFX, TRT, and SY. A feasibility study of EC + UA process will be explored for the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from actual sewage effluent and 95% removal was achieved for a 10 min reaction time of EC and UA. This study provides a promising hybrid EC and UA process with CS@GOn that has excellent biocompatibility, reusability potential, and could be used in a wide range of industrial effluents.

AB The purpose of this paper is to report the study of the fate and distribution of three endocrine disrupting compounds (estrogens); Estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in a laboratory scale submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR). For this matter, both aqueous and solids phases were analyzed for the presence of E1, E2 and EE2. The outcome of this study was that three SMBRs showed enhanced elimination of estrogens in different operational conditions; the estrogen removal was close to 100% in SMBR. Additionally, E1, E2 and EE2 were detected in SMBR sludge at concentrations of up to 41.2, 37.3 and 36.9 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The estrogen removal in the SMBRs was directly influenced by a combination of simultaneous biodegradation-adsorption processes, indicating that the main removal mechanism of the estrogens in the SMBRs is the biodegradation process. The E1, E2 and EE2 were biologically degraded in the SMBR (87-100%). The sorption of estrogens onto activated sludge was from 2%. Therefore, a high potential for estrogen removal by biodegradation in the SMBR was observed, allowing less estrogen concentration in the dissolved phase available for the adsorption of these compounds onto biological flocs. Two different methods were carried out for mass balance calculations of estrogens in SMBR. For the first method, the measured data was used in both liquid and solid phases, whereas for the second one, it was in aqueous phase and solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d) value of E1, E2 and EE2. The purpose of these methodologies is to make easier the identification of the main mechanisms involved in the removal of E1, E2 and EE2 in a SMBR. Both methods can be applied in order to determine the mechanism, fate and distribution of estrogens in a SMBR.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are major contaminants of aquatic environments. The effects on aquatic organisms have been assessed mostly through eco-toxicological tests performed using static exposure systems or flow through systems with constant concentrations. Yet, constant concentration exposures ignore the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemicals in flowing environments. In dynamic systems, a chemical's effect on an organism will vary due to fluctuations in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of the chemical concentration within the plume, which develops due to turbulence interacting with the geomorphology of habitat. The aim of this study was to analyze how different exposure dynamics to the antidepressant fluoxetine might alter the agonistic behavior of aquatic organisms. Male crayfishes, Faxonius virilis, were subjected to 23 h exposures at different concentrations of fluoxetine (control, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/l) in both static and dynamic mesocosm systems. After exposure, sizematched crayfishes, from the same exposure system and fluoxetine concentration, underwent a fifteen minute fight trial. The aggressive intensities and duration of agonistic interactions were quantified. The time spent performing a tailflip was significantly longer for fluoxetine concentrations of 1, 10, 100 mu g/l in the static exposure than in the dynamic exposure. On other hand, the time spent at higher intensities and the time to escalate to the highest intensity of interactions in control treatments were significantly lower in the dynamic exposure than in the static exposure. Whereas, in elevated fluoxetine concentrations, these times were significantly higher in the dynamic than in static treatments. Therefore, we could conclude that the fight dynamics and duration of agonistic behavior in crayfish were affected by static and dynamic exposure paradigms differently. Despite these behavioral changes, serotonin levels in fluoxetine-exposed crayfish did not differ significantly between exposure paradigms. Future research should incorporate different exposure methods that more accurately represent chemical exposure in natural habitats. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage output contains a wide range of organic materials, such as pharmaceutical compounds. These compounds have harmful effects on the environment, such as generation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; therefore, their degradation has been considered as one of the environmental challenges. The purpose of this research is to synthesize graphene reinforced with nanocomposites of iron oxide/zinc oxide/tin oxide and evaluate its ability to photocatalytic degradation of azithromycin in the aqueous environment. GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposite was characterized by various techniques including XRD, FT-IR, TEM and VSM. In the batch system, the effect of pH, contact time, catalyst content and initial concentration of azithromycin was investigated; in this system, under optimal conditions of pH = 3, 120 min with 1 g/L of GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2, 90.06% of 30 mg/L azithromycin were degraded under UV-C irradiation. In the continuous system, the variables of bed height, flow rate and initial concentration of azithromycin have been investigated. The times to reach the column breakthrough point (C-b = 0.02C(0)) at heights of 6, 8 and 10 cm are 5, 8 and 14 min, respectively. By increasing the height of the bed from 6 to 10 cm, the azithromycin degradation rate increases; the reason for this increase can be due to the increase in contact time. The results indicate that the degradation of azithromycin in a constant bed column strongly depends on these parameters; actually, the time to reach the breaking point decreased with increase of flow rate and initial concentration of azithromycin while increasing with increase of bed height. Estimating the empty bed residence time showed that this model is in good agreement with laboratory data. Therefore, considering the high ability of GO@Fe3O4/ZnO/SnO2 to eliminate azithromycin, this compound can be used as an effective catalyst for the degradation of antibiotics in aquatic environments.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are commonly detected organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. Their actual fate in rivers is still incompletely understood as their elimination is highly substance specific and studies often report contradictory results. To elucidate the ceiling of attenuation rates of pharmaceuticals in rivers we carried out a study at a river with favorable conditions for the elimination of organic micropollutants.
   Experiments were carried out at a small stream in Germany. Composite samples were taken at both ends of a 12.5 km long river stretch located downstream of a sewage treatment plant and analyzed for 10 pharmaceuticals. Moreover, pore water samples were taken and in situ photolysis experiments at several sites within the river stretch were performed to assess the importance of these individual elimination mechanisms.
   Pharmaceutical concentration in the surface water at the first sampling site ranged from 3.5 ng L-1 for propranolol to 1400 ng L-1 for diclofenac. In comparison to carbamazepine which was used as persistent tracer, all other pharmaceuticals were attenuated along the river stretch. Their elimination was higher in a sunny, dry weather period (period I) compared to a period with elevated discharge after a heavy rainfall (period II). Overall, the measured elimination rates ranged from 25% for sulfamethoxazole (period II) to 70% for propranolol (period I). Photolysis was only a relevant elimination process for diclofenac and potentially also for sotalol; for these compounds phototransformation half-life times of some hours were determined in the unshaded parts of the river. Biotransformation in the sediments was also an important attenuation process since the concentrations of the other pharmaceuticals in the sediments decreased relative to carbamazepine with depth. For the chiral betablocker metoprolol this biotransformation was also confirmed by a decrease in the enantiomer fractionation from 0.49 at site A to 0.43 at site B and to <0.40 in the deeper sediments.

AB The exposure and fate of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was evaluated using modeled predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) according to the U.S. and the European Union (EU) guidelines and microcosm model ecosystems. According to the U.S. guidance, crude environmental introduction concentrations, the only SSRI that would require environmental assessment would be sertraline. However, the more conservative EU draft guidance PEC would require further assessment of all five SSRIs. Refined PECs developed using the U.S. and the EU guidelines along with estimates of removal by sewage treatment and receiving water dilution factors indicate that the U.S. methodology corresponds better to MEC data determined in the U.S. and Canada. Worst-case (99th centile) PECs for citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were 30, 19, 30, 65, and 122 ng/L, respectively, using the U.S. methodology and 142, 182, 841, 144, and 575 ng/L, respectively, using the EU draft methodology. The dissipation of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine from the water column in aquatic microcosms was best described using a two-compartment model while sertraline followed a one-compartment model. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine water concentrations initially dissipated with first phase half-lives of 3.8 and 1.8 days, respectively, but levelled off at concentrations around 10 mu g/L with second phase half-lives of 76.7 and 59.3 days, respectively, not including those estimated as infinity. Sertraline dissipation tended toward the detection limit with a half-life of 3.4 days. Fluoxetine was found to be the most persistent followed by fluvoxamine and sertraline. Estimated log(K-OC) values for all SSRIs were >4.3 indicating that SSRIs are expected to adsorb to sediment or sludge. Partitioning into other environmental compartments such as this may act as a reservoir from which SSRIs may be re-released into surface waters and indicates the potential susceptibility of benthos.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are commonly detected in the environment. Concern over these compounds in the environment center around the potential for pharmaceuticals to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. The main focus of endocrine disruption research has centered on how estrogenic and androgenic compounds interact with-the endocrine system to elicit reproductive effects. Other classes of compounds, such as progestins, have been overlooked. Recently, studies have investigated the potential for synthetic progestins to impair reproduction and growth in aquatic organisms. The present study utilizes the OECD 210 Early-life Stage (ELS) study to investigate the impacts levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic progestin, on fathead minnow (FHM) survival and growth. After 28 days post-hatch, survival of larval FHM was impacted at 462 ng/L, while growth was significantly reduced at 86.9 ng/L. Further analysis was conducted by measuring specific endocrine related mRNA transcript profiles in FHM larvae following the 28 day ELS exposure to LNG. Transcripts of 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP17, AR, ER alpha, and FSH were significantly down-regulated following 28 d exposure to 16.3 ng/L LNG, while exposure to 86.9 ng/L significantly down-regulated 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP19A, and FSH. At 2392 ng/L of LNG, a significant down-regulation occurred with CYP19A and ER beta transcripts, while mPR alpha and mPR beta profiles were significantly induced. No significant changes occurred in 11 beta-HSD, CYP11A, StAR, LH beta, and VTG mRNA expression following LNG exposure. An ex vivo steroidogenesis assay was conducted with sexually mature female FHM following a 7 day exposure 100 ng/L LNG with significant reductions observed in pregnenolone, 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20-DHP), testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone. Together these data suggest LNG can negatively impact FHM larval survival and growth, with significant alterations in endocrine related responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The passive polar organic chemical integrative sampler in the pharmaceutical configuration (i.e., pharmaceutical-POCIS) was calibrated for sampling at water temperatures of 5, 15 and 25 degrees C to determine the influence of temperature on chemical-specific sampling rates (R-S), thus providing more robust estimates of the time-weighted average concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine-disrupting substances (EDS) in surface water. The effect of water temperature and flow on the R-S of these analytes was evaluated in the laboratory with a static system. The loss of the test compounds from water by uptake into POCIS was linear over an 8-d period, and these experimental data yielded R-S values in the range of 0.07 to 2.46 L/d across the temperature range for the 30 compounds tested. Water temperature and flow influenced POCIS uptake rates, but these effects were relatively small, which is consistent with the theory for uptake into POCIS samplers. Therefore, under a narrow range of water temperatures and flows, it may not be necessary to adjust the R-S for POCIS. Except for acidic drugs and sulfonamide antibiotics, R-S values were positively correlated with octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-OW) of the test compounds. A linear relationship was also observed between R-S and chromatographic retention times on a C18 reversed-phase column. These observations may provide a rapid method for estimating the R-S of additional chemicals in the POCIS. The application of the R-S to POCIS deployed for one month in Lake Ontario, Canada, during the summers of 2006 and 2008 yielded estimates of PPCP and EDS concentrations that are consistent with conventional concentration measurements of these compounds in Lake Ontario surface water.

AB Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals have been shown to occur in considerably high amounts in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and surface waters. The non-steroidal inflammatory drug diclofenac represents one of the most commonly detected compounds. Information concerning possible ecotoxicological risks of the substance are rather scarce. So far there are no data available on its possible effects in fish after prolonged exposure. In order to evaluate sublethal toxic effects of diclofenac in fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to diclofenac concentrations ranging from mug/L to 500 mug/L over a 28 day period were investigated by histopathological methods. In addition, diclofenac residues in various organs were analyzed by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
   The histopathological examinations of diclofenac-exposed fish revealed alterations of the kidney such as an hyaline droplet degeneration of the tubular epithelial cells and the occurrence of an interstitial nephritis. In the gills, the predominant finding consisted in a necrosis of pillar cells leading to damage of the capillary wall within the secondary lamellae. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) at which both renal lesions and alterations of the gills occurred was 5 mug/L. In contrast, the light microscopical examination of the liver, the gastro-intestinal tract, and the spleen did not reveal any histopathological alterations neither in diclofenac-exposed fish nor in solvent controls or control individuals.
   Chemical analysis showed a concentration-related accumulation of diclofenac in all organs examined. The highest amounts could be detected in the liver, followed by the kidney, the gills and the muscle tissue. Dependent on the diclofenac concentration used, the bioconcentration factors (BCF) were 12-2732 in the liver, 5-971 in the kidney, 3-763 in the gills, and 0.3-69 in the muscle respectively. From the present findings it can be assumed, that prolonged exposure in environmentally relevant concentrations of diclofenac leads to an impairment of the general health condition of fish.

AB An environmental risk assessment is presented for mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressive pharmaceutical used for prevention of organ rejection, and its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MPM). Mycophenolic acid will not significantly adsorb to activated sludge. In activated sludge, C-14-MPA attained >80% degradation, supporting an older environmental fate test with the same compound. Based on n-octanol/water distribution coefficient (log D-OW) values of 2.28, 0.48, and <=-1.54 at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively, MPA is not expected to bioaccumulate. Sales amounts of MPA+MPM in Europe were used to derive predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in surface waters; PECs were refined by including expected biodegradation in sewage treatment, average drinking water use, and average dilution of the effluents in the receiving waters per country. In addition, the exposure to pharmaceuticals in the environment (ePiE) model was run for 4 European catchments. The PECs were complemented with 110 measured environmental concentrations (MECs), ranging from below the limit of quantitation (<0.001 mu g/L) to 0.656 mu g/L. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived from chronic tests with cyanobacteria, green algae, daphnids, and fish. The comparison of PECs and MECs with the PNECs resulted in a differentiated environmental risk assessment in which the risk ratio of PEC/PNEC or MEC/PNEC was <1 in most cases (mostly >90%), meaning no significant risk, but a potential risk to aquatic organisms in generally <10% of instances. Because this assessment reveals a partial risk, the following questions must be asked: How much risk is acceptable? and Through which measures can this risk be reduced? These questions are all the more important in view of limited alternatives for MPM and MPA and the serious consequences of not using them. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2259-2278.

AB The Henares-Jarama-Tajo river system is the largest drainage basin in the Province of Madrid, Spain. This area is characterized by the presence of intensive urban and industrial activities influenced by a continental Mediterranean climate with rainfalls presenting substantial fluctuations along the different seasons. This research aimed to monitor seasonal variations in concentrations of 22 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in this river system and to establish the potential risk of sublethal effects on aquatic organisms. A total of 10 sampling sites were selected along the river system with samples collected in each of the four seasons during a year-round schedule. Most of the PhACs detected were present in sampling sites downstream in the vicinity of the most populated cities (i.e. Madrid, Guadalajara and Alcala de Henares). Only two PhACs, fluoxetine and paraxantine, were detected in all sites regardless of the season, and showed median (+/- interquartile range) concentrations of 21.4 (+/- 31.2) ng L-1 and 8.5 (+/- 5.3) ng L-1, respectively. Other PhACs were detected with a frequency >80% and included, caffeine, diphenylhydantoin, hydrochlorotiazide, ibuprofen, ketoprofen. diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, naproxen, carbamazepine and propanolol. Seasonal variations were observed with the highest concentrations in December and the lowest in September. By combining measured environmental concentrations with toxicity data (either publicly available or obtained experimentally in our laboratory), and by calculating an Maximum Risk Index (MaxRI) that each combination of PhACs should have for non exceeding the risk threshold, a high potential for long-term risk (MaxRI < 10) was estimated for most of the sampling sites and sampling dates. This research allowed the characterization of the potential risk for each of the PhACs to exert sublethal effects on aquatic organisms using acute screening methods, justifying the need for chronic data in order to refine the risk of these compounds to aquatic organisms.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the direct photodegradation of nitroimidazoles. For this purpose, i) a kinetic study was performed, determining the quantum yield of the process; and ii) the influence of the different operational variables was analyzed (initial concentration of antibiotic, pH, presence of natural organic matter compounds, and chemical composition of water), and the time course of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and toxicity during nitroimidazole photodegradation was studied. The very low quantum yields obtained for the four nitroimidazoles are responsible for the low efficacy of the quantum process during direct photon absorption in nitroimidazole phototransformation. The R-254 values obtained show that the dose habitually used for water disinfection is not sufficient to remove this type of pharmaceutical; therefore, higher doses of UV irradiation or longer exposure times are required for their removal. The time course of TOC and toxicity during direct photodegradation (in both ultrapure and real water) shows that oxidation by-products are not oxidized to CO2 to the desired extent, generating oxidation by-products that are more toxic than the initial product. The concentration of nitroimidazoles has a major effect on their photodegradation rate. The study of the influence of pH on the values of parameters epsilon (molar absorption coefficient) and k(E)' (photodegradation rate constant) showed no general trend in the behavior of nitroimidazoles as a function of the solution pH. The components of natural organic matter, gallic acid (GAL), tannic acid (TAN) and humic acid (HUM), may act as promoters and/or inhibitors of OH center dot radicals via photoproduction of H2O2. The effect of GAL on the metronidazole (MNZ) degradation rate markedly differed from that of TAN or HUM, with a higher rate at low GAL concentrations. Differences in MNZ degradation rate among waters with different chemical composition are not very marked, although the rate is slightly lower in wastewaters, mainly due to the UV radiation filter effect of this type of water.

AB Landfills have historically remained the most common methods of organized waste disposal and still remain so in many regions of the world. Thus, they may contain wastes resulting from several decades of disposal and decomposition with subsequent release of organic compounds that may have environmental, wildlife and human health consequences. Products containing different types of additives with unique beneficial improvement properties are in daily use. However, when these products are decomposed, additives are release into the environment, some of which have been shown to have negative environmental impacts, resulting in the ban or at least restricted application of some chemicals. New and emerging compounds are continuously discovered in the environment. Herein, we report qualitative and quantitative data on the occurrence of new and emerging compounds with increasing environmental and public health concern in water- and particle phase of landfill leachates. Under normal environmental conditions, several of these chemicals are persistent high-volume products. Identified chemicals in the leachates at nanogram (ng) or microgram (mu g) per liter levels include chlorinated alkylphosphates such as tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), N-butyl benzensulfonamide (NBBS), the insect repellent diethyl toluamide (DEET) and personal care products such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen and polycyclic musk compounds. Among new and emerging contaminants, perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were measured in the water phase at concentrations up to 6231 ng/L. Compared with the other chemicals, PFCs were primarily distributed in water phase. An effective removal method for PFCs and other polar and persistent compounds from landfill leachates has been a major challenge, since commonly used treatment technologies are based on aeration and sedimentation. Thus, the present study has shown that municipal landfill leachates may represent a significant source of concern for legacy, new and emerging chemicals in groundwater. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The PhATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model presented in this paper was developed as a tool to estimate concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in U.S. surface waters that result from patient use (or consumption) of medicines. PhATE uses a mass balance approach to model predicted environmental concentrations (PECS) in 11 watersheds selected to be representative of most hydrologic regions of the United States. The model divides rivers into discrete segments. It estimates the mass of API that enters a segment from upstream or from publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and is subsequently lost from the segment via in-stream loss mechanisms or flow diversions (i.e., man-made withdrawals). POTW discharge loads are estimated based on the population served, the API use per capita, the potential loss of the compound associated with human use (e.g., metabolism), and the portion of the API mass removed in the POTW. Simulations using three surrogate compounds show that PECS generated by PhATE are generally within an order of magnitude of measured concentrations and that the cumulative probability distribution of PECs for all watersheds included in PhATE is consistent with the nationwide distribution of measured concentrations of the surrogate compounds. Model simulations for 11 APIs yielded four categories of results. (1) PECs fit measured data for two compounds. (2) PECs are below analytical method detection limits and thus are consistent with measured data for three compounds. (3) PECS are higher than (i.e., not consistent with) measured data for three compounds. However, this may be the consequence of as yet unidentified depletion mechanisms. (4) PECS are several orders of magnitude below some measured data but consistent with most measured data for three compounds. For the fourth category, closer examination of sampling locations suggests that the field-measured concentrations for these compounds do not accurately reflect human use. Overall, these results demonstrate that PhATE may be used to predict screening-level concentrations of APIs and related compounds in the environment as well as to evaluate the suitability of existing fate information for an API.

AB The photocatalytic degradation in distilled water of 15 selected emerging contaminants (ECs) has been evaluated in a solar pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) plant by using TiO2 photocatalysts immobilized on glass spheres. The durability of the photocatalysts has been evaluated by measuring its performance during 4 consecutive cycles. TiO2 was prepared by the sol-gel method using titanium isopropoxide as precursor, combined with commercial TiO2 Degussa P25 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the pore generating agent. The following microcontaminants in a concentration of 100 mu gL(-1) have been studied: acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan. The fluorine containing ECs, this is, flumequine and ofloxacin, are totally degraded under the studied reaction conditions. By contrary, a progressive decay of the photocatalytic activity is observed for the other contaminants. The contaminants with amine or amide groups but without halogen heteroatoms in the structure record the lowest degradation rates. In order to recover the photoactivity, different strategies using aqueous solutions containing H2O2 under UV irradiation, NaOH, NH4OH and direct heat treatment in air at 400 degrees C, were adopted. For the sake of simplicity, these experiments have been performed in a solarsimulator at 765 W m(-2). In order to determinate the nature of the species adsorbed on the titania active sites, the used and the regenerated photocatalysts were analyzed by XPS. Chemical treatment with NaOH results in the removal of the TiO2 layer. The ECs containing sulphate, fluoride or chloride groups are easily adsorbed on the photocatalyst active sites as compared to the ECs containing amide or amine groups and are easily desorbed by the regeneration treatments. Amongst the different pretreatment studied, calcination and H2O2/UV irradiation are the most efficient methods to recover the photocatalytic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This is the first study to assess human health risks due to the exposure of 'repurposed' pharmaceutical drugs used to treat Covid-19 infection. The study used a six-step approach to determine health risk estimates. For this, consumption of pharmaceuticals under normal circumstances and in Covid-19 infection was compiled to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in river water and in fishes. Risk estimates of pharmaceutical drugs were evaluated for adults as they are most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. Acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) are estimated using the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) or no observable effect level (NOEL) values in rats. The estimated ADI values are then used to calculate predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for three different exposure routes (i) through the accidental ingestion of contaminated surface water during recreational activities only, (ii) through fish consumption only, and (iii) through combined accidental ingestion of contaminated surface water during recreational activities and fish consumption. Higher risk values (hazard quotient, HQ: 337.68, maximum; 11.83, minimum) were obtained for the combined ingestion of contaminated water during recreational activities and fish consumption exposure under the assumptions used in this study indicating possible effects to human health. Amongst the pharmaceutical drugs, ritonavir emerged as main drug, and is expected to pose adverse effects on r human health through fish consumption. Mixture toxicity analysis showed major risk effects of exposure of pharmaceutical drugs (interaction-based hazard index, HIint: from 295.42 (for lopinavir + ritonavir) to 1.20 for chloroquine + rapamycin) demonstrating possible risks due to the coexistence of pharmaceutical in water. The presence of background contaminants in contaminated water does not show any influence on the observed risk estimates as indicated by low HQ(add) values (<1). Regular monitoring of pharmaceutical drugs in aquatic environment needs to be carried out to reduce the adverse effects of pharmaceutical drugs on human health. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antidepressants, even at low concentrations, can reveal some adverse effects on aquatic life due to disturbing homeostasis throughout the central and peripheral nervous system both in vertebrates and invertebrates. To date there have not been any reports regarding the presence of these pharmaceuticals in surface and tap waters in Eastern Europe. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 21 antidepressant pharmaceuticals at specific points of the main Polish river - the Vistula, a smaller river of the Warsaw region - the Utrata, as well as in tap water samples of Warsaw. Samples were collected twice at one month intervals and analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique coupled with the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM).
   This is the first study where active compounds such as moclobemid or trazodone in the environment have been investigated.
   Environmental risk assessment of antidepressants in Poland was estimated on the basis of annuals sale data extracted from the NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia-National Health Service) base of reimbursed pharmaceuticals'. Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of target pharmaceuticals were compared with their measured concentration (MEC).
   Moreover, the application of the EMEA/CHMP guideline for environmental risk assessment of the antidepressants was discussed. The highest concentration of antidepressants was observed in the small river Utrata. In tap water only trace amounts of antidepressants including citalopram (up to 1.5 ng/l), mianserin (up to 0.9 ng/l), sertraline (<3.1 ng/l), moclobemid (up to 0.3 ng/l) and venlafaxine (up to 1.9 ng/l) were detected. However this highlights their inadequate elimination in the drinking waste treatment facility. The presence of antidepressants in drinking water and the aquatic environment could have long-term effects even at low exposure level, especially since synergy amongst pharmaceutical pollutants may occur.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters of the US and Europe, originating largely from two sources, sewage effluent and agricultural runoff. These compounds often occur as mixtures leading to potential combined effects. In order to investigate the effects of a realistic pharmaceutical mixture on an ecosystem, a study utilizing 15 of 12,000 L aquatic microcosms treated with eight common pharmaceuticals (atorvastatin, acetaminophen, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, levofloxacin, sertraline, and trimethoprim) at total (summed) molar concentrations of 0, 0.044, 0.608, 2.664, and 24.538 mumol/L (n = 3) was conducted. Phytotoxicity was assessed on a variety of somatic and pigment endpoints in rooted (Myriophyllum sibiricum) and floating (Lemna gibba) macrophytes over a 35-day period. EC10, EC25 and EC50 values were calculated for each endpoint exhibiting a concentration-dependent response. Generally, M. sibiricum and L. gibba displayed similar sensitivity to the pharmaceutical mixture, with phytotoxic injury evident in both species, which was concentration dependent. Through single compound 7-day daily static renewal toxicity tests with L. gibba, the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin and the blood lipid regulator atorvastatin were found to be the only compounds to elicit phytotoxic effects in the concentration range utilized (0-1000 mug/L). Atorvastatin concentration was highly correlated to decreased pigment content in L. gibba, likely inhibiting the known target enzyme HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Hazard quotients were calculated for both microcosm and laboratory studies; the highest HQ values were 0.235 (L. gibba) and 0.051 (L. gibba), which are below the threshold value of I for chronic risks. The microcosm data suggest that at an ecological effect size of >20%, biologically significant risks are low for L. gibba and M. sibiricum exposed to similar mixtures of pharmaceutical compounds. For M. sibiricum and L. gibba, respective minimum differences of 5 and 1%, were detectable, however, these effect sizes are not considered ecologically significant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The impact of residual pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment has gained widespread attention over the past years. Various studies have established the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in different water bodies throughout the world. In view of the absence of occurrence data in a number of developing world countries, and given the limited availability of analytical resources in these countries, it is prudent to devise methodologies to prioritize pharmaceuticals for environmental monitoring purposes that are site specific. In this work, several prioritization approaches are used to rank the 88 most commonly consumed pharmaceuticals in Lebanon. A simultaneous multi-criteria decision analysis method utilizing the exposure, persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (EPBT) approach is applied to a smaller subset of the original list (69 pharmaceuticals). Several base cases are investigated and sensitivity analysis is applied to one of these base case runs. The similarities and differences in the overall ranking of individual, and classes of, pharmaceuticals for the base cases and the sensitivity runs are elucidated. An environmental risk assessment (ERA), where predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) and risk quotients (RQ) are determined at different dilution factors, is performed as an alternative method of prioritization for a total of 84 pharmaceuticals. The ERA results indicate that metformin and amoxicillin have the highest PECs while 17 beta-estradiol, naftidrofuryl and dimenhydrinate have the highest RQs. The two approaches, EPBT prioritization and ERA, are compared and a priority list consisting of 26 pharmaceuticals of various classes is developed. Nervous system and alimentary tract and metabolism pharmaceuticals (9/26 and 5/26 respectively) constitute more than half of the numbers on the priority list with the balance consisting of anti-infective (4/26), musculo-skeletal (3/26), genito-urinary (2/26), respiratory (2/26) and cardiovascular (1/26) pharmaceuticals. This list will serve as a basis for the selection of candidate compounds to focus on for future monitoring campaigns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital functioning generates a great quantity of contaminants, among which organic materials, heavy metals, and diverse pharmaceuticals are noteworthy that can affect organisms if they are not properly removed from the effluents. The hospital effluent evaluated in the present study came from IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) Clinic 221 in downtown Toluca, State of Mexico, a secondary care facility. The contaminants identified in hospitals have been associated with deleterious effects on aquatic organisms; however, it is necessary to continue with more studies in order to be able to regulate the production of said contaminants which are generally dumped into the city sewage system. The present study had the purpose of evaluating the alterations to embryonic development and teratogenic effects on oocytes Cyprinus carpio after exposure to different proportions of hospital effluent. For said purpose, the physicochemical properties of the effluent were determined. Concentrations of the main microcontaminants were also determined. An embryolethality study out and the determination of the main alterations to embryonic development and teratogenic effects produced, due to exposure of C. carpio at different proportions of the effluent, were carried out. The results showed that the physicochemical properties were within the values permitted by Mexican regulation; however, the presence of contaminants such as NaClO, metals, anti-biotics, anti-diabetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones and beta-blockers, was detected. Lethal concentration 50 was 5.65% and the effective concentration for malformations was 3.85%, with a teratogenic index of 1.46. The main teratogenic alterations were yolk deformation, scoliosis, modified chorda structure, tail malformation, fin deformity and mouth hyperplasia. A high rate of hatching delay was observed. The results suggest that the hospital effluent under study is capable of inducing embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in oocytes of C. carpio. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to determine the effect of sludge stabilization treatments (liming and anaerobic digestion) on the mobility of different pharmaceutical compounds in soil amended by landspreading of treated sludge from different sources (urban and hospital). The sorption and desorption potential of the following pharmaceutical compounds: carbamazepine (CBZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), salicylic acid (SAL), ibuprofen (IBU), paracetamol (PAR), diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), econazole (ECZ), atenolol (ATN), and their solid-liquid distribution during sludge treatment (from thickening to stabilization) were investigated in the course of batch testing. The different sludge samples were then landspread at laboratory scale and leached with an artificial rain simulating 1 year of precipitation adapted to the surface area of the soil column used. The quality of the resulting leachate was investigated. Results showed that ibuprofen had the highest desorption potential for limed and digested urban and hospital sludge. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, diclofenac, and paracetamol were the only compounds found in amended soil leachates. Moreover, the leaching potential of these compounds and therefore the risk of groundwater contamination depend mainly on the origin of the sludge because ibuprofen and diclofenac were present in the leachates of soils amended with urban sludge, whereas paracetamol and salicylic acid were found only in the leachates of soils amended with hospital sludge. Although carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, ketoprofen, econazole, and atenolol were detected in some sludge, they were not present in any leachate. This reflects either an accumulation and/or (bio)degradation of these compounds (CBZ, CIP, SMX, KTP, ECZ, and ATN ), thus resulting in very low mobility in soil. Ecotoxicological risk assessment, evaluated by calculating the risk quotients for each studied pharmaceutical compound, revealed no high risk due to the application on the soil of sludge stabilized by liming or anaerobic digestion.

AB The present work describes the development and validation of a sensitive method for the determination of traces of diverse groups of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors in surface water. Thirty-seven substances have been selected, including 10 pesticides, 6 hormonal steroids and assimilates, 12 pharmaceuticals, 5 alkylphenols, 1 chlorophenol and 3 other well-known human contaminants, 1 UV filter and 2 plasticisers. An automated online solid-phase extraction (SPE) is directly coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Different SPE columns have been tested, and the injection volume has been optimised. The developed analytical methodology is based on the direct injection of 2.5mL of water sample acidified at pH 1.6 on an Oasis HLB loading column (20x2.1mm) with 5-mu m particles. Then, the chromatographic separation is achieved on a Kinetex XB C18 (100x2.1mm; 1.7 mu m) column, and the quantification is realised in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The online SPE step warrants minimal sample handling, low solvent consumption, high sample throughput, saving time and costs. This method allows the quantification of the target analytes in the lower ng/L concentration range, with limits of quantification (LQs) between 100pg/L and 10ng/L, 26 compounds having LQ lower than 1ng/L. The monitoring of two selected MS/MS transitions for each compound allows the reliable confirmation of positive findings even at the LQ level. The developed and validated methodology has been applied to the analysis of various real samples from two French rivers. Twelve target compounds have been detected in the environmental samples, and the major pollutants are pharmaceuticals usually used by humans (paracetamol, carbamazepine, oxazepam, ketoprofen, trimethoprim). The pesticides atrazine and carbendazim have been ubiquitously detected in real samples too. Metronidazole, sulfamethoxazole and diuron were also frequently quantified in the water samples.

AB The prescribed use of pharmaceuticals can result in unintended, unwelcomed, and potentially adverse consequences for the environment and for those not initially targeted for treatment. Medication usage frequently results in the collateral introduction to the environment (via excretion and bathing) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioactive metabolites, and reversible conjugates. Imprudent prescribing and non-compliant patient behavior drive the accumulation of unused medications, which pose major public health risks from diversion as well as risks for the environment from unsound disposal, such as flushing to sewers. The prescriber has the unique wherewithal to reduce each of these risks by modifying various aspects of the practice of prescribing. By incorporating consideration of the potential for adverse environmental impacts into the practice of prescribing, patient care also could possibly be improved and public health better protected.
   Although excretion of an API is governed by its characteristic pharmacokinetics, this variable can be somewhat controlled by the prescriber in selecting APIs possessing environment-friendly excretion profiles and in selecting the lowest effective dose. This paper presents the first critical examination of the multi-faceted role of drug dose in reducing the ambient levels of APIs in the environment and in reducing the incidence of drug wastage, which ultimately necessitates disposal of leftovers. Historically, drug dose has been actively excluded from consideration in risk mitigation strategies for reducing ambient API levels in the environment. Personalized adjustment of drug dose also holds the potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing the incidence of adverse drug events and in lowering patient healthcare costs. Optimizing drug dose is a major factor in improving the sustainability of health care. The prescriber needs to be cognizant that the "patient" encompasses the environment and other "bystanders," and that prescribed treatments can have unanticipated, collateral impacts that reach far beyond the healthcare setting.

AB In an effort to assess the combined risk estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), and estriol (E3) pose to aquatic wildlife across United States watersheds, two sets of predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for significant reproductive effects in fish were compared to predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). One set of PNECs was developed for evaluation of effects following long-term exposures. A second set was derived for short-term exposures. Both sets of PNECs are expressed as a 17 beta-estradiol equivalent (E2-eq), with 2 and 5ng/L being considered the most likely levels above which fish reproduction may be harmed following long-term and short-term exposures, respectively. A geographic information system-based water quality model, Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation (PhATE (TM)), was used to compare these PNECs to mean and low flow concentrations of the steroid estrogens across 12U.S. watersheds. These watersheds represent approximately 19% of the surface area of the 48 North American states, contain 40 million people, and include over 44,000 kilometers of rivers. This analysis determined that only 0.8% of the segments (less than 1.1% of kilometers) of these watersheds would have a mean flow E2-eq concentration exceeding the long-term PNEC of 2.0ng/L; only 0.5% of the segments (less than 0.8% of kilometers) would have a critical low flow E2-eq exceeding the short-term PNEC of 5?ng/L. Those few river segments where the PNECs were exceeded were effluent dominated, being either headwater streams with a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), or flowing through a highly urbanized environment with one or several POTWs. These results suggest that aquatic species in most U.S. surface waters are not at risk from steroid estrogens that may be present as a result of human releases. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Lab-scale GAC sandwich slow sand filters with different GAC layer depths were evaluated for the first time to remove selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (namely DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and tri-closan, 25 mu g/L). Coarse sand (effective grain size of 0.6 mm) was used instead of conventional fine sand. In addition to single sand and GAC filters, GAC sandwich filters were assessed at three filtration rates (i.e. 5 cm/h, 10 cm/h and 20 cm/h) to compare removals. Sandwich filter with 20 cm GAC achieved the best average PPCP removal (98.2%) at 10 cm/h rate. No significant difference of average PPCP removal was found between 10 and 20 cm/h filtration rates for the three GAC sandwich filters (p > 0.05). Among the selected PPCPs, DEET, the recalcitrant compound, was most effectively removed by the GAC sandwich filters. Combining the GAC layers with the slow sand filters significantly enhanced the removal of the target PPCP compounds (p < 0.05), demonstrating that both adsorption and biodegradation contributed to the removals. Furthermore, pseudo-second-order equation (Type 1) could best represent the adsorption kinetics of the four target PPCP compounds onto GAC. In relation to other quality parameters, sandwich filter with 20 cm of GAC also showed good average removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 65.8% and total organic carbon (TOC) of 90.3%, but occurrence of ammonium up to 0.76 mg/L concentration indicated inapplicability of filtration rate of 5 cm/h. No significant difference was found between 10 cm/h and 20 cm/h filtration rates for nitrogen and phosphate removals (p > 0.05). Results of this lab-scale investigation show that GAC sandwich slow sand filter is potentially an effective process for removing PPCPs from tertiary waste water. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The environmental presence of chemicals capable of affecting the endocrine system has become a matter of scientific and public concern after certain endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs) have been detected in the aquatic environment.
   In this work, 31 different EDCs and related compounds (suspect EDCs) belonging to different contaminant classes were studied: 10 estrogens, natural and synthetic, 8 alkylphenolic compounds, bisphenol A, triclosan and tridorocaraban, 4 parabens, 2 benzotriazoles, 3 organophosphorous flame retardants and the chemical marker caffeine, in river water and sediment of four Iberian rivers (Ebro, Llobregat, Jucar and Guadalquivir). An extensive sampling has been undertaken in two monitoring campaigns (2010 and 2011). A total of 77 samples of water and 75 sediments were collected.
   For this propose two different multiresidue analytical methods were applied, using the automated online EQuan/TurboFlo (TM) liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection in tandem.
   In terms of concentrations the compounds found at the highest average concentrations were: nonylphenol monocarboxylate (NP1EC), tolyltriazole (TT), tris(chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCPP) found at average concentrations above 100 ng/L, followed by 1H-benzotriazole and tris(butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP) found at average concentration higher than 50 ng/L. Natural and synthetic hormones were found at low levels not exceeding 16 ng/L and 7 ng/g for water and sediment, respectively, however they contributed to more than 80% of the total estrogenicity of the samples (expressed as the equivalents of estradiol EEQ, ng/L). Regarding the spatial distribution of these contaminants, the Llobregat river was found to be the most contaminated river basin, having sites near the mouth of the river the ones with the highest contaminant load. In the Ebro river basin several hot spots were identified and Jucar showed to be the least contaminated. Overall, the study confirmed the presence of complex mixtures of unregulated contaminants, thus raising concern about their potential interactive effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sorption of 3 pharmaceuticals, which may exist in 4 different forms depending on the solution pH (irbesartan in cationic, neutral and anionic, fexofenadine in cationic, zwitter-ionic and anionic, and citalopram cationic and neutral), in seven different soils was studied. The measured sorption isotherms were described by Freundlich equations, and the sorption coefficients, K-F (for the fixed n exponent for each compound), were related to the soil properties to derive relationships for estimating the sorption coefficients from the soil properties (i.e., pedotransfer rules).
   The largest sorption was obtained for citalopram (average K-F value for n = 1 was 1838 cm(3) g(-1)) followed by fexofenadine (K-F = 35.1 cm(3/n) mu g(1-1/n) g(-1) n = 1.19) and irbesartan (K-F = 3.96 cm(3/n) mu g(1-1/n) g(-1), n = 1.10). The behavior of citalopram (CIT) in soils was different than the behaviors of irbesartan (IRB) and fexofenadine (FEX). Different trends were documented according to the correlation coefficients between the K-F values for different compounds (R-JRB,R-FEX = 0395, p-value<0.01; R-IRB,R-CIT = -0.835, p-value<0.05; R-FEX,R-CIT = 0.759, p-value<0.05) and by the reverse relationships between the KF values and soil properties in the pedotransfer functions. While the K-F value for citalopram was positively related to base cation saturation (BCS) or sorption complex saturation (SCS) and negatively correlated to the organic carbon content (Cox), the K-F values of irbesartan and fexofenadine were negatively related to BCS, SCS or the clay content and positively related to Cox. The best estimates were obtained by combining BCS and Cox for citalopram (R-2= 93.4), SCS and Cox for irbesartan (R-2 = 96.3), and clay content and Cox for fexofenadine (R-2 = 82.9).

AB A fast and sensitive LC-MS/MS method suitable to monitor a set of 24 pharmaceuticals belonging to 9 therapeutical families was developed using an analytical column of reduced dimensions and an appropriate SPE procedure for acidic, basic and neutral analytes. Furthermore, a preliminary assessment of the occurrence and levels of these substances in surface waters of the Leca and Douro rivers, located in the north of Portugal, was conducted. Among 17 different SPE adsorbents tested, some of them often neglected, the JTBaker H2Ophilic provided the best recoveries (average 86%). When compared to the amino and quaternary ammonium adsorbents, the 1 degrees, 2 degrees amino proved the most suitable clean-up media for surface water samples prior to enrichment by SPE. The overall method provided limits of detection generally below 5 ng L-1 and a precision below or around 10% RSD in three non-consecutive days at 500 ng L-1 and around 12% at 50 ng L-1 concentration levels. The confirmatory capabilities of the method developed are especially welcome either through the MS3 spectra or the isotopic pattern. The first known results regarding the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in Leca river confirmed its expected high contamination load and the successful selection of the target pharmaceuticals. Concentrations up to 770 ng L-1 of bezafibrate, 925 ng L-1 of paracetamol, 389 ng L-1 of hydrochlorothiazide and 283 ng L-1 of furosemide were measured. The most ubiquitous in both seasons, February and June 2009, were bisoprolol, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil. In Douro river the abundance and contamination level of pharmaceuticals was much lower which gives a clear indication that the hydraulic features of the river provide enough attenuation of the several contamination sources whereas Leca is highly impacted by insufficiently treated anthropogenic effluents.

AB Despite the large number of pharmaceutically active compounds found in natural environments little is known about their transport behavior in groundwater, which is complicated by their wide range of physical and chemical properties. The transport behavior of five widely used and often detected pharmaceutical compounds and one lifestyle drug has therefore been investigated, using a set of three column experiments. The investigated compounds were the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, the lifestyle drug caffeine, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen. The columns were filled with three different types of sand. The substrates consisted of artificially prepared iron coated sand, artificially prepared organic carbon sand (with 5% leaf compost), and natural aquifer sand from Long Point, Ontario (Canada). The experiments were conducted simultaneously under the same hydraulic conditions and with the same input solution of about 1 mu g.L-1 of each compound. The transport behavior of the organic compounds differed significantly between both the different columns and the different compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the retardation factors for carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen and the organic carbon content of the substrate. While the retardation increased with increasing organic carbon content, no direct relationship was observed between the organic carbon content and the removal of these compounds. In contrast, the retardation factors for sulfamethoxazole and naproxen showed no correlation with the organic carbon content but these compounds were significantly removed in the presence of organic matter. The influence of the Fe3+ surfaces in the iron-coated sand was less significant than expected, with all compounds except for sulfamethoxazole having retardation factors <1.8. Caffeine was so strongly removed during transport through those substrates containing organic carbon that no reliable retardation factor could be determined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the risks to aquatic organisms posed by 12 commonly detected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that are extensively used in Bohai coastal region of China were examined. These were linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), nonylphenol (NP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ERY), bisphenol A (BPA), ofloxacin (OFL), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX), atenolol (ATL) and metoprolol (MET). Their relative risk was ranked based on the proximity between the medians of the reported effect concentrations and measured river or lake water concentrations. The surfactants (LAS) and endocrine disrupting chemicals NP (a breakdown product of the surfactant nonylphenol polyethoxylate) and DEHP (a plasticizer) were identified as posing the greatest risk from this range of chemicals. LAS had a hundred-fold higher risk than any of the pharmaceuticals. The highest risk ranked pharmaceuticals were all antibiotics. Zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg) were added to the comparison as representative heavy metals. Zn posed a risk higher than all the organics. The risk posed by Hg was less than the surfactants but greater than the selected pharmaceuticals. Whereas LAS and DEHP could cause harmful effects to all the wildlife groups, NP and BPA posed the greatest risk to fish. Antibiotics showed the highest risk to algae. Spatial and temporal distributions of PPCPs and EDCs were conducted for risk identification, source analysis and seasonal change exploration. Municipal sewage effluent linked to urban areas was considered to be the major source of pharmaceuticals. With regard to seasonal influence the risk posed by LAS to the aquatic organisms was significantly affected by wet and dry seasonal change. The dilution effects were the common feature of LAS and ERY risks. The difference in LAS and ERY risk patterns along the rivers was mainly affected by the elimination process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sexual disruption in wild fish has been linked to the contamination of river systems with steroid oestrogens, including the pharmaceutical 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, originating from domestic wastewaters. As analytical chemistry has advanced, more compounds derived from the human use of pharmaceuticals have been identified in the environment and questions have arisen as to whether these additional pharmaceuticals may also impact sexual disruption in fish. Indeed, pharmaceutical anti-androgens have been shown to induce such effects under laboratory conditions. These are of particular interest since anti-androgenic biological activity has been identified in the aquatic environment and is potentially implicated in sexual disruption alone and in combination with steroid oestrogens. Consequently, predictive modelling was employed to determine the concentrations of two anti-androgenic human pharmaceuticals, bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate, in UK sewage effluents and river catchments and their combined impacts on sexual disruption were then assessed in two fish models. Crucially, fish were also exposed to the anti-androgens in combination with steroid oestrogens to determine whether they had any additional impact on oestrogen induced feminisation. Modelling predicted that the anti-androgenic pharmaceuticals were likely to be widespread in UK river catchments. However, their concentrations were not sufficient to induce significant responses in plasma vitellogenin concentrations, secondary sexual characteristics or gross indices in male fathead minnow or intersex in Japanese medaka alone or in combination with steroid oestrogens. However, environmentally relevant mixtures of oestrone, 17 beta-oestradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol did induce vitellogenin and intersex, supporting their role in sexual disruption in wild fish populations. Unexpectedly, a male dominated sex ratio (100% in controls) was induced in medaka and the potential cause and implications are briefly discussed, highlighting the potential of non-chemical modes of action on this endpoint.

AB Suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been widely detected in the environment, and are a source of increasing concern. One of the major challenges in assessing the risk associated with EDCs in the environment is that their environmental concentrations are typically extremely low - on the order of ng L-1 to mu g L-1 - making them difficult to quantify without extensive pre-concentration procedures. Further complicating their detection is the fact that they are present in mixtures, sometimes with tens to hundreds of other compounds (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, detergents, natural organic matter).
   The objective of the work described here was to develop a method for rapid monitoring and detection of EDCs at trace concentrations in natural waters. The method makes use of a W-transparent polymer-based concentrator to be used as a passive sampling device. The UV-transparent polymer-based concentrator serves both as a solid phase extraction medium to concentrate EDCs for analysis and exclude many compounds likely to interfere with detection (fines. macromolecules such as organic matter, ionic surfactants), and as an analytical optical cell, allowing rapid EDC quantification without labor-intensive preconcentration procedures. A full-spectrum deconvolution technique is used to determine EDC concentrations from measured UV absorbance spectra in the polymer.
   Experiments were conducted to measure partitioning rate behavior and partition coefficients between the selected polymer (a functional polydimethylsiloxane) and water for seven compounds known or suspected of being endocrine disruptors: estrone, progesterone, estradiol, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone, phenanthrene, triclosan, and 4-nonylphenol. The method was tested for its ability to detect and quantify individual compounds in mixtures containing up to six components. Results show the method to have selectivity suitable for rapid screening applications at many sites where multiple compounds are present. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are regularly released into the environment; in particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics. Erythromycin, naproxen, furosemide and atenolol are reported to be stable for up to 1 year in the environment, which increases the risk for accumulation. In the present study we have measured the occurrence and concentration of phannaceuticals in river Viskan (Jossabron) downstream of a sewage treatment plant in Boras, Sweden. Pharmaceuticals and water samples were tested for potential human risk by evaluating inflammatory responses (NF-kappa B and AP-1) using human T24 bladder epithelial cells and Jurkat T-cells. NF-kappa B activity in T24 cells was significantly reduced by all NSAIDs analysed (diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprophen and dextropropoxyphene), but also by trimethoprim, using environmentally relevant concentrations. NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation was further analysed in response to water samples collected from different locations in Sweden. Dose-dependent down-regulation of AP-1 activity in Jurkat cells was observed at all locations. At two locations (Jossabron and Almenas) down-regulation of NF-kappa B was observed. In contrast, the NF-kappa B response was potentiated by exposure to water from both locations following activation of NF-kappa B by treatment with heat-killed Escherichia coli. To determine the involvement of pharmaceuticals in the responses, T24 cells were exposed to the pharmaceutical mixture, based on the determined levels at Jossabron. This resulted in reduction of the NF-kappa B response following exposure to the pharmaceutical mixture alone while no potentiation was observed when cells were co-exposed to heat killed E. coli and pharmaceuticals. The obtained results demonstrate that the identified pharmaceuticals affect the inflammatory responses and furthermore indicate the presence of unknown substance(s) with the ability to potentiate inflammatory responses.

AB Previous research has documented the ubiquity of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in freshwater, though their persistence and transport is relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the abundance and transport of human and veterinary PPCPs in a rural, central Indiana stream influenced by confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Research objectives also aimed to identify mechanisms controlling abundance and transport PPCP concentrations and stream physicochemical characteristics were measured monthly over one year at multiple sites along a 60 km reach. Overall, human PPCPs were more abundant and measured at higher concentrations than veterinary pharmaceuticals. Veterinary pharmaceutical concentrations (lincomycin, sulfamethazine) were greatest in stream reaches adjacent to CAFOs. No distinct spatial variation was observed for human PPCPs. However, caffeine and paraxanthine had significant temporal variation with higher concentrations in winter. In contrast, DEET had higher concentrations in summer. Pharmaceutical load (mu g/s) ranged from<0.005 to 1808 mu g/s across sites, sampling events and pharmaceutical compounds with human PPCPs having higher loads relative to veterinary pharmaceuticals. Reach input ranged from net retention (sulfamethazine in August) to 1667 mu g/m/d paraxanthine in March. Triclosan had the highest measured mean input into the reach (661 mu g/m/d) and sulfamethazine had the lowest mean input (32 mu g/m/d). Across measured compounds, input of PPCPs into the reach was two orders of magnitude lower than nitrate-N input (57,000 mu g/m/d). Transport metrics indicated acetaminophen and caffeine are transported farther than triclosan though had lower loss velocities (loss relative to abundance). Loss rate of PPCPs was an order of magnitude lower than nitrate-N loss rate. Human PPCPs were more abundant than veterinary pharmaceuticals in this rural watershed influenced by CAFOs. Further, concentrations had significant temporal and spatial variation highlighting differential sources and fates. Thus, mechanisms driving PPCP retention and transport need to be identified to aid management of these emerging contaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Kinetics and product formation of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated in lab-scale experiments during reactions with ozone and OH radicals. Ozone reacts rapidly with the double bond in CBZ, yielding several ozonation products containing quinazoline-based functional groups. The structures for three new oxidation products were elucidated using a combination of mass spectrometric and NMR techniques. The three products were determined to be 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro(1H, 3M-quinazoline-2-one (130,M), 1-(2-benzaldehyde)(1 (1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (130), and 1-(2-benzoic acid)(1H, 3M-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BaQD). Additional kinetic studies of the ozonation products showed very slow subsequent oxidation kinetics with ozone (second-order rate constants, k(O3) = similar to 7 M(-1) s(-1) and similar to 1 M-1 s-1 at pH 6 for BQM and BOO, respectively). Rate constants for reactions with OH radicals, k(OH), were determined as similar to 7 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for BQM and similar to 5 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for BQD. Thus, mainly reactions with OH radicals lead to their further oxidation. A kinetic model including ozone and OH radical reactions allows a prediction of the time-dependent product distribution during ozonation of natural waters. In Rhine River water, CBZ spiked at 500 ng/L was completely oxidized by ozone with applied doses >= 0.3 mg/L. To confirm that the two major ozonation products BQM and BQD are produced as a result of the ozonation of a CBZ-containing natural water, Lake Zurich water samples were spiked with CBZ (1 mu M, 236 mu g/L). The oxidation products were identified via LC-UV. Concentrations of 0.48 and 0.15 mu M for BQM and BQD, respectively, were measured for an ozone dose of 1.9 mg/L. BQM and BQD were also identified in ozonated water from a German waterworks containing CBZ in its raw water with 0.07-0.20 mu g/L. Currently, there are no data available on the biological effects of the formed oxidation products.

AB Two representative carbon catalysts, granular activated carbon (GAC) and carbon nanotube (CNT) were selected for the degradation of acetaminophen (ACT) by persulfate (PS) activation. In this study, the materials characterization study indicated that the surface functional groups and surface area of the GAC were more abundant and larger, respectively, than the CNT. Whereas the contribution of sp(2) and C=O groups of the CNT was superior to the GAC; the structural defect levels and surface charging characteristics (pH(PZC)) were similar in both. The mass-based pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant of the CNT was 1.5 m(-1) g(-1), which was 50 times higher than that of the GAC (0.03 m(-1) g(-1)). Radical and non-radical pathways were evaluated for catalytic reactions by the GAC/PS and CNT/PS systems, respectively. Experimental results using scavenger tests, linear voltammetry, and electron spin resonance (ESR) showed that the radical pathway was dominant in the GAC/PS system, whereas the non-radical pathway was dominant in the CNT/PS systems. To confirm this, the influence of affecting factors such as initial ACT concentration, the dosage of oxidant (PS), and initial pH were also investigated and compared for the two systems. The results showed that the catalytic activity of the GAC/PS system was highly dependent on initial concentrations of ACT and PS, while these were less influential in the CNT/PS system. The removal efficiency of ACT was not affected under a pH of 3-7 in both systems. Reusability experiments were conducted five times, and both the CNT/PS and GAC/PS systems demonstrated that the removal rate of ACT did not notably decrease with the number of experiment repetitions. This means that the application of a carbon catalyst to treat pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater is effective.

AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) modified with mixed-linker strategy have shown advantages in various fields. In this article, a mixed-linker Zr-MOFs, PCN-134, was successfully prepared according to the thermodynamic method and used as a photocatalytic adsorbent for the removal of diclofenac (DF), a representative emerging contaminant. In PCN-134, the connection between Zr-6 clusters and benzene tribenzoate forms 2D layers, which are supported by TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) to form a 3D layer-pillar framework. Since Zr-MOFs allows the partial absence of linkers leading to structural defects while maintaining its framework integrity, the defect density and properties of PCN-134 can be controlled. We synthesized a series of PCN-134s with different TCPP ratios and found the DF uptake of PCN30 was the highest among them due to a delicate balance between porosity and defects. The selected PCN-134 (PCN30) exhibited excellent adsorption performance for the removal of DF from water. The adsorption process is affected by pH and ionic strength. The kinetic data can be well described by pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity of DF is about 2.04 mmol/g, calculated by Langmuir isotherm model. Under visible light irradiation, PCN-134 exhibited high photocatalytic activity in DF degradation experiments. The formation of O-1(2) indicated PCN-134 was dominated by type II photosensitization reaction, and the corresponding productivity was higher than that of single-linker PCN-224. The electron transform between TCPP linker and Zr6 clusters also contributed to the photodegradation of DF. The improved adsorptive and photocatalytic performance was mainly owing to the opened porous structure, extra defect sites, effective energy transfer and the synergistic effect between organic linkers. Further, as PCN-134 can be efficiently recycled, it is a promising photocatalytic adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are essential to preserve human and animal welfare, as well as to prevent illnesses. However, the elevated consumption of drugs, followed by incorrect disposal and inefficient wastewater treatment, may increase their environmental risk. In the case of antibiotics, such as ampicillin, some of the already known consequences are bacterial resistance and some toxic interactions with aquatic organisms. The scope of the present work is to investigate the removal of ampicillin through batch adsorption experiments onto granular activated carbon (GAC). The influence of pH and phase contact time were evaluated. Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were adjusted to experimental data to determine process kinetics. In order to study adsorption equilibrium and thermodynamics parameters, isotherms at 298 K, 298 K and 308 K were constructed. The models of Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips fitted to experimental data. The best results (73% of removal, residual concentration 5.2 mg L-1) were reached at pH 6 and 120 minutes of contact time. Pseudo-first order model better represented the adsorption kinetics (R-2 = 0.99), while the Langmuir equation suited well the experimental isotherms at 288 K and 298 K (R-2 = 0.998 and R-2 = 0.991) and the Sips equation better represented the system at 308 K (R-2 = 0.990). Thermodynamic parameters were estimated as Delta G degrees = -6,000 J mol(-1); -6,700 J mol(-1); -7,500 J mol(-1) at 288 K, 298 K and 308 K respectively, Delta H degrees = 14,500 J mol(-1) and Delta S degrees = 71.0 J mol(-1) K-1. The results indicate that this process is spontaneous, efficient and potentially applicable in the removal of ampicillin from water.

AB Due to the limited efficiency of conventional biological treatment, innovative solutions are being explored to improve the removal of trace organic chemicals in wastewater. Controlling biomass exposure to growth substrate represents an appealing option for process optimization, as substrate availability likely impacts microbial activity, hence organic trace chemical removal. This study investigated the elimination of pharmaceuticals in pre-denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), where biofilm exposure to different organic substrate loading and composition was controlled by reactor staging. A three-stage MBBR and a single-stage reference MBBR (with the same operating volume and filling ratio) were operated under continuous-flow conditions (18 months). Two sets of batch experiments (day 100 and 471) were performed to quantify and compare pharmaceutical removal and denitrification kinetics in the different MBBRs. Experimental results revealed the possible influence of retransformation (e.g., from conjugated metabolites) and enantioselectivity on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals. In the second set of experiments, specific trends in denitrification and biotransformation kinetics were observed, with highest and lowest rates/rate constants in the first (S1) and the last (S3) staged sub reactors, respectively. These observations were confirmed by removal efficiency data obtained during continuous-flow operation, with limited removal (<10%) of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and highest removal in S1 within the three-stage MBBR. Notably, biotransformation rate constants obtained for non recalcitrant pharmaceuticals correlated with mean specific denitrification rates, maximum specific growth rates and observed growth yield values. Overall, these findings suggest that: (i) the long-term exposure to tiered substrate accessibility in the three-stage configuration shaped the denitrification and biotransformation capacity of biofilms, with significant reduction under substrate limitation; (ii) biotransformation of pharmaceuticals may have occurred as a result of cometabolism by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria.

AB Sensitive and selective spectrophotometric procedures were proposed for the determination of Fe(III) and Cu(II) using simple chromogenic reagents. The procedure of iron determination was based on the formation of ternary complex between Fe(III) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-bathophenanthroline (DPBP)-eosin in acid medium. On the other hand, the procedure of copper (II) determination was based on the formation of ternary complex between Cu(II) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-bathophenanthroline (DPBP)-Eriochrome Black-T (EBT) in alkaline medium. The ternary complexes were extracted in the presence of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide with chloroform. The molar absorptivities of the Fe(III)-DPBP-eosin and Cu(II)-DPBP-EBT ternary complexes were 2.23 center dot 10(5) and 9.35 center dot 10(4 )L mol(-1) cm(-1) at 542 and 565 nm, respectively. Beer's law is valid over the concentration ranges from 0.280 to 7.814 and from 0.320 to 8.260 mu g mL(-1) for Fe(III) and Cu(II), respectively. Sandell sensitivity (0.0025 and 0.0679 ng cm(-2)), relative standard deviation (0.257-1.94 and 0.305-1.85), limits of detection (0.076 and 0.045 mu g mL(-1)) and quantification (0.253 and 0.150 mu g mL(-1)) for Fe(III) and Cu(II) ions, respectively, are calculated. The procedures are applied for the determination of Fe(III) and Cu(II) in different polluted water sources, drinking water, river water as well as cooling water and boiler scales. The results obtained are compared with those obtained using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The effects of different tolerances are studied in the presence of masking agents.

AB Here, the degradation of 100 mL of sulfanilamide solutions of pH 3.0 has been comparatively studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) using a stirred tank reactor equipped with a 3 cm(2) boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a 3 cm(2) air-diffusion cathode. In both treatments, organics are destroyed by hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface and in the solution bulk from Fenton's reaction between cathodically generated H2O2 and initially added Fe2+, whereas in PEF, additional photolysis of intermediates under UVA radiation is also feasible. The influence of applied current density and substrate concentration on antibiotic decay, degradation rate and mineralization degree was examined. The sulfanilamide decay always followed a pseudo-first-order reaction, as found by reversed-phase liquid chromatographic monitoring, being faster for PEF. The EF process led to large mineralization of sulfanilamide concentrations up to 2390 mg L-1. Nevertheless, the PEF process was much more potent and allowed achieving total mineralization (>99% of dissolved organic carbon removal) of all the solutions tested. Results showed that the application of this treatment is preferable at low current densities and high substrate concentrations to obtain the best mineralization current efficiencies. Ion-exclusion liquid chromatography revealed that oxalic and oxamic acids were the most persistent generated carboxylic acids. Their Fe(III) complexes were slowly removed by hydroxyl radical in EF and much more quickly photolyzed by UVA light in PEF. Ion chromatography confirmed the main release of NH4 and SO42-, ions, and NO ion in relatively smaller extent, during all the mineralization processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the adsorption, desorption, and biodegradation characteristics of sulfonamide antibiotics in the presence of activated sludge with and without being subjected to NaN3 biocide. Batch experiments were conducted and the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to the observed removal of sulfonamide antibiotics were determined. Three sulfonamide antibiotics including sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadime-thoxine (SDM), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), which had been detected in the influent and the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Taiwan, were selected for this study. Experimental results showed that the antibiotic compounds were removed via sorption and biodegradation by the activated sludge, though biodegradation was inhibited in the first 12 h possibly due to competitive inhibition of xenobiotic oxidation by readily biodegradable substances. The affinity of sulfonamides to sterilized sludge was in the order of SDM > SMM > SMX. The sulfonamides existed predominantly as anions at the study pH of 6.8, which resulted in a low level of adsorption to the activated sludge. The adsorption/desorption isotherms were of a linear form, as well described by the Freundlich isotherm with the n value approximating unity. The linear distribution coefficients (K-d) were determined from batch equilibrium experiments with values of 28.6 +/- 1.9, 55.7 +/- 2.2, and 110.0 +/- 4.6 mL/g for SMX, SMM, and SDM, respectively. SMX, SMM, and SDM desorb reversibly from the activated sludge leaving behind on the solids 0.9%, 1.6%, and 5.2% of the original sorption dose of 100 mu g/L. The sorbed antibiotics can be introduced into the environment if no further treatments were employed to remove them from the biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effluent reuse for soil irrigation is foreseen as a possible strategy to mitigate the pressure on water resources. However, there is the risk of potential accumulation in soil of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs).
   In the present work the electrokinetic remediation (EKR) technology, use of direct current, was applied for the removal of EOCs from a soil irrigated with effluent. For this, a soil collected from a rice field (located in Portugal) was mixed with spiked effluent to simulate flood irrigation in one time-period. The experiments were carried out for 6 days applying a low current intensity of 2.5 mA. Different current strategies were tested: continuous mode, reversed electrode polarization (REP), On/Off time periods, and the combination of the last two. The target EOCs comprises a list of six pharmaceuticals and personal care products widely detected in treated wastewater.
   This study showed that once introduced in soil through effluent irrigation, 20-100% of the EOCs were still present in the soil after 6 days. EKR enhanced up to 20% of the EOCs removal when comparing with control (without current). The EOC removals showed to be related to the microcosm location (anode, central or cathode sections) and dependent of EOCs characteristics. Soil characteristics did not change when On/Off system was combined with REP as a current strategy, and a more homogenous removal of the studied EOCs was achieved in the tested conditions. EKR showed to be a promising technology to be applied in EOCs contaminated soils, not only for removal purposes, but also to avoid possible dispersion in the environment (C)2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The increasing availability of antibiotics in wastewater has created a serious threat to non-target organisms in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity of amoxicillin on duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza during a short-term exposure (7 d). The duckweed was exposed to a range of environmentally relevant (0.0001-0.01 mg L-1) and high (0.1 and 1 mg L-1) concentrations of amoxicillin. Subsequently, biomarkers of toxicity such as growth, pigments (Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids), antioxidative enzyme activity (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; and ascorbate peroxidases, APX), and biochemical content (protein, lipid and starch) were analysed in their fronds. The high dose (1 mg L-1) of amoxicillin caused a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in photopigments, protein, starch and lipid content and an increase in carotenoids/total Chl and Chl a/Chl b ratios in fronds of Spirodela polyrhiza. The results showed a shift in biomarkers: a decrease in frond growth and relative growth rate (RGR) (16.2-53.8%) and an increase in the activities (mmol mg protein(-1)) of CAT (0.021-0.041), APX (0.84-2A9) and SOD (0.12-0.23) in fronds. The significantly (p <0.05) greater reduction in amoxicillin content in duckweed setups (84.6-100%) than in the control (62.1-73%) suggested that phytodegradation is an important mechanism in removing antibiotics from water, apart from hydrolysis and photodegradation, which occur in control setups. Overall, the results suggested a toxic effect of amoxicillin on Spirodela polyrhiza, even at low concentrations, and nonetheless, the duckweed contributed directly to the degradation of antibiotics in the water and throughout the phytoremediation process.

AB This study reports a green method for the synthesis of Gold@Silver@Silver chloride (Au@Ag@AgCl) core-double shells nanoparticles (NPs) using Momordica charantia leaves extract. The formation of core -double shells structure was confirmed by TEM image and further it was supported by elemental mapping and EDX line profile analysis. In this method, the NPs were synthesized without using any toxic reagents and external halide. The phytochemicals present in the leaves extract were responsible for the formation of the NPs. The photodegradation of pharmaceutical active compounds, such as clofibric acid (CA) and ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous solution was also investigated by Au@Ag@AgCl nanoparticles as a photocatalyst under solar irradiation. The catalyst dose was varied from 0.01 to 0.1 g/L and 0.07 g was found as an optimum amount of catalyst. The plausible degradation mechanisms, reaction kinetics and photolysis products of IBP and CA under solar irradiation were also reported in this study. To the best knowledge of the authors, it was for the first time, we report the synthesis of Au@Ag@AgCl (core-double shells) using Momordica charantia leaves extract. The reduction of 2,4,6-trinitro phenol (2,4,6-TNP) was also investigated using Au@Ag@AgCl as a catalyst. The study indicated that a total of 97.5% of 2,4,6-TNP was reduced. It was observed that 97% of IBP and 98% of CA were degraded using Au@Ag@AgCl nanoparticles as a catalyst. The reactive species, such as center dot O-2(-) and Cl-0 were mainly responsible for the photodegradation of IBP and CA under solar irradiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The antidepressant venlafaxine is detected at parts per billion levels in tertiary-treated municipal wastewater effluent. However, the impact of this serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) on non-target aquatic animals is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that environmentally relevant levels of venlafaxine disrupt the highly conserved cortisol and glucose response to stress in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile trout were exposed to venlafaxine (0, 0.2 and 1.0 mu g/L) in a static system with daily renewal for seven days. The fish were then subjected to an acute handling disturbance and sampled either prior to (0 h) or 1,4 and 24h after stressor exposure. Venlafaxine exposure did not affect the handling disturbance-mediated transient elevation in plasma cortisol levels or target tissue glucocorticoid receptor expression. The drug exposure disrupted the interrenal steroidogenic capacity, including altered handling stressor-mediated changes in mRNA abundances of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage. The handling stressor-induced transient elevations in plasma glucose levels were significantly reduced in the venlafaxine-exposed fish. This was not accompanied by changes in liver glycogen content, glucose transporter 2 mRNA abundance or the glycolytic capacity, whereas the capacity for gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism were enhanced. Venlafaxine also brought about changes in the gill of trout, including enhanced lactate dehydrogenase activity and Na+-K+ ATPase protein expression, while the Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity was reduced. Collectively, our results demonstrate that venlafaxine at levels detected in the aquatic environment impacts tissue metabolic capacities and may compromise the adaptive responses to an acute stressor in rainbow trout.

AB The mineralization of flumequine, an antimicrobial agent belonging to the first generation of synthetic fluoroquinolones which is detected in natural waters, has been studied by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) like electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) with UVA light. The experiments were performed in a cell containing a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air-diffusion cathode to generate H2O2 at constant current. The Fe2+ ion added to the medium increased the solubility of the drug by the formation of a complex of intense orange colour and also reacted with electrogenerated H2O2 to form hydroxyl radical from Fenton reaction. Oxidant hydroxyl radicals at the BDD surface were produced from water oxidation. A partial mineralization of flumequine in a solution near to saturation with optimum 2.0 mM Fe2+ at pH 3.0 was achieved by EF. The PEF process was more powerful, giving an almost total mineralization with 94-96% total organic carbon removal. Increasing current accelerated both treatments, but with decreasing mineralization current efficiency. Comparative treatments using a real wastewater matrix led to similar degradation degrees. The kinetics for flumequine decay always followed a pseudo-first-order reaction and its rate constant, similar for both EAOPs, raised with increasing current. Generated carboxylic acids like malonic, formic, oxalic and oxamic acids were quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC. Fe(III)-oxalate and Fe(III)-oxamate complexes were the most persistent by-products under EF conditions and their quicker photolysis by UVA light explains the higher oxidation power of PEF. The release of inorganic ions such as F-, NO3- and in lesser extent NH4+ was followed by ionic chromatography. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microscale sealed vessel pyrolysis (MSSVpy) was used to characterise the hydrophobic (HPO) and colloid (COL) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the effluents (EFFs) of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and several primary source waters (SWs). The EFFs showed a large range of anthropogenically sourced organics - including the metabolites of industrial chemicals (e.g., dioxanes, n- and sec-alkyl substituted benzenes and long chain alkyl phenols), pharmaceuticals (e.g., N- and S-heterocycies) and human waste (e.g., S- and N-organics, steranes/sterenes) - as well as high concentrations of alkyl aromatic and N-organic products (e.g., alkyl indoles, carbazoles and beta-carbolines) attributed to the treatment biota. Some anthropogenic chemicals are potentially toxic at even trace levels, whilst the N-organics may be precursors for toxic N-disinfection by-products. Much lower concentrations of just a few of the anthropogenic and N-organic products were detected by more traditional flash pyrolysis (Flash-py) of the EFF samples, reflecting the higher sensitivity of MSSVpy to many chemical functionalities. Few of these products were detected in the corresponding MSSVpy analysis of the SWs, but these samples did show relatively high abundances of lignin (e.g., alkylphenols) and carbohydrate (e.g., furans) derived products. Their lower EFF abundances are consistent with efficient removal by the water treatment procedures applied. Conversely, the detection of the anthropogenics in the treated EFFs reflects their general resistance to treatment. Their occurrence in the HPO fractions isolated by XAD resin separation suggests a potential relationship with the structurally stable macromolecular fraction of the DOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The widespread occurrence of sulfonamides (SAs) in natural waters, wastewater, soil and sediment has raised increasing concerns about their potential risks to human health and ecological systems. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have become promising technologies to remove such contaminants in the environment. The present study systematically investigated the degradation of four selected SAs with different five-membered heterocyclic rings, namely, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfisoxazole (SIX), sulfathiazole (STZ), and sulfamethizole (SMT), by thermo-activated persulfate (PS) process, and the role of heterocyclic rings was assessed particularly. The results revealed that all the selected SAs could be degraded efficiently by thermo-activated PS process and their decay rates were appreciably increased with increasing temperature. For instance, degradation rates of STZ increased from 0.3 x 10(-3) to 19.5 x 10(-3) min(-1) as the temperature was increased from 30 to 60 degrees C. Under the same experimental conditions, the degradation rates of SAs followed the order of SIX > SMX approximate to STZ > SMT, which was in accordance with decay rates of their R-NH2 moieties. Kinetic results indicated that five-membered heterocyclic rings could serve as reactive moieties toward SO4 center dot- attack, which were confirmed by frontier electron density (FED) calculations. Based on the transformation products identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), five different oxidation pathways, including hydroxylation, aniline moiety oxidation, dimerization, sulfonamide bond cleavage, and heterocyclic ring oxidation/cleavage were proposed. Moreover, the degradation efficiency in real surface water (RSW) was found to be slightly slower than that in artificial surface water (ASW), suggesting that SR-AOPs could be an efficient approach for remediation of soil and water contaminated by these SAs.

AB In this work, we present an integrated dynamic cross-flow electro-Fenton (DCF-EF) system for the treatment of the pharmaceutical, acetaminophen (paracetamol), in aqueous medium. A carbonaceous electrocatalytic membrane was used as cathode, allowing the continuous production of H2O2 during EF in dynamic filtration mode. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) and current were the two driving forces of the system, whose influence strongly affected the global efficiency. It was found that H2O2 production from the electrochemical reduction of dissolved O-2 was favoured at higher TMP values as a consequence of an increase of the O-2 partial pressure, and higher H2O2 amounts entailed an increase in the efficiency of the process. Current also had a positive effect on H2O2 production and acetaminophen degradation and mineralization efficiencies up to an optimal value. Complete degradation of the drug and 44% mineralization were achieved under optimal conditions (2.0 bar and 100 mA). On the other hand, the results pointed out that the use of a Ti4O7 rod as counter electrode (anode) had an important contribution to the mineralization of the acetaminophen's solutions owing to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) on its surface, which highlighted the oxidative power of this anode material. The oxidation mechanisms involved during the process were assessed by electrochemical measurements with both electrodes (carbon membrane and Ti4O7 rod), and a degradation pathway for paracetamol oxidation was proposed based on the identification of the main aromatic and aliphatic degradation by-products. This DCF-EF process is presented as a potential alternative for water treatment and reuse in which the integration of membrane and electrochemical technologies brings together separation science and advanced oxidation.

AB Background. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is one of the most common ingredients of the disinfectants. It is commonly detected in surface and wastewaters where it can interact with the residues of pharmaceuticals that are also common wastewater pollutants. Among the latter, the residues of antineoplastic drugs are of particular concern as recent studies showed that they can induce adverse effect in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations.
   Methods. Ecotoxicity of BAC as an individual compound and in a binary mixture with an antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was determined towards alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a representative of primary producers. The toxicity of the BAC C 5-FU binary mixture was predicted by the two basic models: concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and compared to the experimentally determined toxicity. Additionally combination index (CI) was calculated to determine the type of interaction.
   Results. After 72 h exposure to BAC a concentration dependent growth inhibition of P. subcapitata was observed with an EC50 0.255 mg/L. Comparing the predicted no effect concentration to the measured concentrations in the surface waters indicate that BAC at current applications and occurrence in aquatic environment may affect algal populations. The measured toxicity of the mixture was higher from the predicted and calculated CI confirmed synergistic effect on the inhibition of algal growth, at least at EC50 concentration. The observed synergism may have impact on the overall toxicity of wastewaters, whereas it is less likely for general environments because the concentrations of 5-FU are several orders of magnitude lower from its predicted no effect concentration.
   Discussion. These results indicate that combined effects of mixtures of disinfectants and antineoplastic drugs should be considered in particular when dealing with environmental risk assessment as well as the management of municipal and hospital wastewaters.

AB Due to the lack of analytical standards the application of surrogate parameters for organofluorine detection in the aquatic environment is a complementary approach to single compound target analysis of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFASs). The recently developed method adsorbable organically bound fluorine (AOF) is based on adsorption of organofluorine chemicals to activated carbon followed by combustion ion chromatography. This AOF method was further simplified to enable measurement of larger series of environmental samples. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.77 mu g/L F. The modified protocol was applied to 22 samples from German rivers, a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and four groundwater samples from a fire-fighting training site.
   The WWTP effluent (AOF = 1.98 mu g/L F) and only three river water samples (AOF between 0.88 mu g/L F and 1.47 mu g/L F) exceeded the LOQ The AOF levels in a PFASs plume at a heavily contaminated site were in the range of 162 +/- 3 mu g/L to 782 43 mu g/L F.
   In addition to AOF 17 PFASs were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 32-51% of AOF in the contaminated groundwater samples were explained by individual PFASs wheras in the surface waters more than 95% remained unknown.
   Organofluorine of two fluorinated pesticides, one pesticide metabolite and three fluorinated pharmaceuticals was recovered as AOF by >50% from all four tested water matrices. It is suggested that in the diffusely contaminated water bodies such fluorinated chemicals and not monitored PFASs contribute significantly to AOF. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND The presence of micro-pollutants in conventional wastewater treatment plants raises environmental concerns due to their insufficient removal. Non-biological methods are needed to treat such compounds and this work demonstrates the use of electrochemical oxidation for the degradation of the drug dexamethasone (DEX). RESULTS A cell consisting of a boron-doped diamond anode and a stainless steel or carbon cloth cathode was employed, with Na2SO4 being the electrolyte. DEX degradation rate, at the low level of mg L-1 (0.25-2 mg L-1), increases with increasing current (0.02-0.2 A m(-2)), as well as in the presence of sodium persulfate (50-250 mg L-1); the latter is electrochemically activated to produce additional oxidants and enhances degradation in a synergistic way. A rate constant of 0.194 min(-1) was recorded for 0.5 mg L-1 DEX degradation at 0.2 A m(-2) with 150 mg L-1 persulfate. The water matrix had little effect on performance compared to experiments in pure water; the only exception was the presence of chloride (50-250 mg L-1), which substantially improved rates due to the formation of active chlorine species (up to about five times). Carbon cloth accelerated DEX removal by up to three times compared to stainless steel and this was partly due to its adsorptive capacity; similarly, reactions involving DEX transformation products (TPs) also occurred faster. Seven TPs were identified and profiles were followed; reaction pathways involve hydroxylation, oxidation, decarboxylation and ring-opening reactions, followed by fluorine release in the liquid phase. CONCLUSION A hybrid technology based on electrochemical oxidation and persulfate activation is proposed for the treatment of residual pharmaceuticals in environmental matrices.

AB Entire elimination of pharmaceutical drugs from waste- and domestic-waters has attracted great attention due to their potent adverse effects on human health, particularly the human immune system. Many risks have been related to the presence of different types of drugs at different concentrations in wastewater. These risks include antimicrobial resistance (AMR), endocrine action, hormonal activation of cancers, and photodegradation of drugs. In this study, new nanohybrid materials consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and oxidized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs) were developed to remove a well-known drug, namely, ranitidine that treats stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) reflux disease from aqueous solutions. The characterization of synthesized nanohybrid GO-OCNTs was performed using spectroscopic (FTIR, and XRD), thermogravimetric (TGA) and microscopic (SEM) techniques. Batch adsorption experiments were used to investigate the technical feasibility of using synthesized GO-OCNTs for the removal of ranitidine from aqueous solutions. The effects of different operating conditions such as contact time, nanohybrid mass, solution temperature, solution pH, % crosslinking agent, and GO-to-OCNT ratio on the entire elimination of ranitidine were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the removal of ranitidine was very efficient, where 98.3% removal of the drug from aqueous solutions was achieved with a drug uptake of 97.8 mg g(-1). Moreover, the results indicated the optimum conditions for the removal of ranitidine, which are as follows: contact time = 140 minutes, nanohybrid GO-OCNT mass = 10 mg, solution temperature = 290 K, solution pH = 6.4, % crosslinking agent = 0.5%, and GO to O-CNT ratio = 1 : 4. The equilibrium data were fitted to different adsorption isotherms and Langmuir was found to best describe our data. Dynamic studies demonstrated that ranitidine adsorption followed pseudo-second order, and the thermodynamic parameters confirmed exothermic drug adsorption as well as the physisorption process.

AB Emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals that cannot be completely removed by traditional biological treatments are ubiquitously present in water bodies with detected concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to mg L-1. Advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are promising, efficient, and environmentally friendly for the removal of these pharmaceuticals. In this study, we investigated the degradation kinetics of a model pharmaceutical, clonidine (CLD), via hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) in UV/H2O2 and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) in UV/peroxydisulfate (PS) systems for the first time. The second-order rate constants (k) of protonated cationic CID with center dot OH and SO4 center dot- were measured to be (2.15 +/- 0.07) x 10(9) M-1 s(-l) and (1.12 +/- 0.03) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. We also calculated the plc value of CLD and thermodynamic behaviors for reactions of CLD/HOLD - with center dot OH and SO4 center dot- at M05-2X/6-311++G**//M05-2X/6-31+G** level with SMD solvation model. The pK(a) value was calculated to be 8.14, confirming the literature value. H atom abstraction pathway was the most favorable pathway for both center dot OH and SO4 center dot-, while single electron transfer pathway was thermodynamically feasible only for SO4 center dot- for CLD but not for HCLD+. In addition, the reactivities of both tautomeric forms of CLD (i.e., amino and imino CLD) with both radicals were also investigated. This study contributed to a better understanding on the degradation mechanisms of CID and proposed the possibilities of the elimination of pharmaceuticals by applying AOTs during wastewater treatment processes.

AB In this study, treatment of an antibiotic compound amoxicillin by medium-high frequency ultrasonic irradiation and/or ozonation has been studied. Ultrasonic irradiation process was carried out in a batch reactor for aqueous amoxicillin solutions at three different frequencies (575, 861 and 1141 kHz). The applied ultrasonic power was 75 W and the diffused power was calculated as 14.6 W/L. The highest removal was achieved at 575 kHz ultrasonic frequency (>99%) with the highest pseudo first order reaction rate constant 0.04 min(-1) at pH 10 but the mineralization achieved was around 10%. Presence of alkalinity and humic acid species had negative effect on the removal efficiency (50% decrease). To improve the poor outcomes, ozonation had been applied with or without ultrasound. Ozone removed the amoxicillin at a rate 50 times faster than ultrasound. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect, coupling of ozone and ultrasound gave rise to rate constant of 2.5 min(-1) (625 times higher than ultrasound). In the processes where ozone was used, humic acid did not show any significant effect because the rate constant was so high that ozone has easily overcome the scavenging effects of natural water constituents. Furthermore, the intermediate compounds, after the incomplete oxidation mechanisms, has been analyzed to reveal the possible degradation pathways of amoxicillin through ultrasonic irradiation and ozonation applications. The outcomes of the intermediate compounds experiments and the toxicity was investigated to give a clear explanation about the safety of the resulting solution. The relevance of all the results concluded that hybrid advanced oxidation system was the best option for amoxicillin removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the photo-induced degradation of azithromycin (Azi), erythromycin (Ery) and tylosin (Tyl) was investigated. The three macrolides are regularly found in different kinds of water, and are thus considered a potential environmental risk. In search of efficient ways for elimination, the compounds were systematically irradiated with a polychromatic UVC light source emitting 185, 254 and discretely further up to 580 nm. Due to their specific structural features, the macrolides possess different optical absorption characteristics leading to photodegradation pathways with dissimilar kinetic properties. Hence, the photodegradation products and their kinetics were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high-resolution time of -flight mass spectrometry. Among the degradants, i.e. the products formed during UV irradiation, both sugar moieties and lactone macrocycles were observed. Applying a first order kinetic model, the half-life of Azi was determined as 1.0-3.7 min, that of Ery as 1.0-14.2 min depending on the reaction conditions. The two compounds possess much lower absorption cross-sections than Tyl, in particular at 254 nm. Their half-lives appeared at least three times higher than that of Tyl that has t(1/2) of 0.2-1.0 min. Based on quantum efficiency considerations, it was assumed that the degradation of Ery and Azi was mainly due to hydroxyl radical formation, which originated from water irradiation below 200 nm, whereas Tyl experienced predominantly photo induced degradation. The photodegradants of Azi exhibited half-lives of over 200 min, whereas most of the photo-products of Ery and Tyl showed half-lives of less than 10 min. Photodegradation processes were investigated at pH 3, pH 7 and pH 9 and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Both the educts and the photo products were degraded more rapidly under neutral and acid conditions.

AB Increasing evidence exists that emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) can be bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms. However, the relative role of trophic transfers in the acquisition of emerging pollutants by aquatic organisms remains largely unexplored. In freshwater ecosystems, wastewater treatment plants are a major source of PhACs and EDCs. Here we studied the entrance of emerging pollutants and their flow through riverine food webs in an effluent-influenced river. To this end we assembled a data set on the composition and concentrations of a broad spectrum of PhACs (25 compounds) and EDCs (12 compounds) in water, biofilm, and three aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa with different trophic positions and feeding strategies (Ancylus fluviatilis, Hydropsyche sp., Phagocata vitta). We tested for similarities in pollutant levels among these compartments, and we compared observed bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to those predicted by a previously-developed empirical model based on octanol-water distribution coefficients (D-ow). Despite a high variation in composition and levels of emerging pollutants across food web compartments, observed BAFs in Hydropsyche and Phagocata matched, on average, those already predicted. Three compounds (the anti-inflammatory drug didofenac, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the flame retardant TBEP) were detected in water, biofilm and (at least) one macroinvertebrate taxa. TBEP was the only compound present in all taxa and showed magnification across trophic levels. This suggests that prey consumption may be, in some cases, a significant exposure route. This study advances the notion that both waterborne exposure and trophic interactions need to be taken into account when assessing the potential ecological risks of emerging pollutants in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Membranes that exhibit size-based rejection between small molecules ( < 1500 g/mol) independent of solute charge would be valuable for many separations, but commercial membranes show poor and unpredictable selectivity at this size range. This arises from high pore size polydispersity and charged membrane surfaces that lead to separations affected by solute charge. Furthermore, these membranes are susceptible to fouling. Self-assembly is a promising technique for making polymeric membranes with fouling resistance, high permeability and selectivity along with opportunity for easy fabrication and scalability. We report the first examples of a new class of membrane materials that derive their permeability, size-based selectivity and fouling resistance from the self-assembly of zwitterion-containing amphiphilic random copolymers. Zwitterionic groups strongly resist biomacromolecular fouling due to their high affinity with water, and self-assemble into channel-type clusters of 0.6-2 nm in size. We show that these copolymers self-assemble into bicontinuous nanocdomains. Thin film composite membranes formed by coating these copolymers onto porous supports exhibit permeances as high as 84 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), over three times that of a commercial membrane with similar MWCO. They show size-based selectivity, with a cut-off around 1 nm. This closely matches the size of zwitterionic domains measured by transmission electron microscopy, indicating permeation occurs through these self-assembled "nanochannels." These membranes show excellent fouling resistance during filtration of protein solutions and oil emulsions, completely resisting irreversible fouling and retaining over 96% of their permeance during filtration. These membranes have potential uses in biomolecule separations, purification of pharmaceuticals, and wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to establish the environmental impact of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), good information on the level of exposure in surface waters is needed. Exposure concentrations are typically estimated using information on the usage of an API as well as removal rates in the patient, the wastewater system and in surface waters. These input data are often highly variable and difficult to obtain, so model estimates often do not agree with measurements made in the field. In this paper we present an approach which uses inverse modelling to estimate overall removal rates of pharmaceuticals at the catchment scale using a hydrological model as well as prescription and monitoring data for a few representative sites for a country or region. These overall removal rates are then used to model exposure across the broader landscape. Evaluation of this approach for APIs in surface waters across England and Wales showed good agreement between modelled exposure distributions and available monitoring data. The use of the approach, alongside estimates of predicted no-effect concentrations for the 12 study compounds, to assess risk of the APIs across the UK landscape, indicated that, for most of the compounds, risks to aquatic life were low. However, ibuprofen was predicted to pose an unacceptable risk in 49.5% of the river reaches studied. For diclofenac, predicted exposure concentrations were also compared to the Environmental Quality Standard previously proposed by the European Commission and 4.5% of river reaches were predicted to exceed this concentration. While the current study focused on pharmaceuticals, the approach could also be valuable in assessing the risks of other 'down the drain' chemicals and could help inform our understanding of the important dissipation processes for pharmaceuticals in the pathway from the patient to ecological receptors.

AB In recent years, membrane technologies (nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO)) have received much attention for micropollutant separation from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluents. Practically all micropollutants are retained in the concentrate stream, which must be treated. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been demonstrated to be a good option for the removal of microcontaminants from water systems. However, these processes are expensive, and therefore, are usually combined with other techniques (such as membrane systems) in an attempt at cost reduction. One of the main costs in solar photo-Fenton comes from reagent consumption, mainly hydrogen peroxide and chemicals for pH adjustment. Thus, in this study, solar photo-Fenton was used to treat a real MWTP effluent with low initial iron (less than 0.2 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (less than 2 mM) concentrations. In order to work at neutral pH, iron complexing agents (EDDS and citrate) were used in the two cases studied: direct treatment of the MWTP effluent and treatment of the concentrate stream generated by NF. The degradation of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, flumequine, ibuprofen, ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) spiked in the effluent at low initial concentrations (mu g L-1) was monitored as the main variable in the pilot-plant-scale photo-Fenton experiments. In both effluents, pharmaceuticals were efficiently removed (>90%), requiring low accumulated solar energy (2 kJ uv L-1, key parameter in scaling up the CPC photoreactor) and low iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations (reagent costs, 0.1 and 1.5 mM, respectively). NF provided a clean effluent, and the concentrate was positively treated by solar photo-Fenton with no significant differences between the direct MWTP effluent and NF concentrate treatments.

AB Leachate from stabilized landfill can pose unique challenges to conventional biological wastewater treatment. Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes have garnered recent consideration as an option to reduce the organic strength and recalcitrance of aged landfill leachate. With a bench-scale investigation, the reported work examines the potential for leachate conditioning for further biological treatment by treatment with low-mg/L doses of ozone (0-7.5mg/L O-3). While not sufficient for significant organics mineralization, the tested ozone doses could potentially produce both selective and non-selective oxidation of recalcitrant leachate organic compounds leaving bio-available products in the pre-treated leachate. Leachate conditioning by O-3 or O-3/H2O2 was assessed via monitoring of three anthropogenic organic leachate contaminants(tris-(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tris-(butoxyethyl)-phosphate and 17-estradiol (E2)) with ozonation, and ozonation followed by anaerobic incubation. In addition, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and BOD5 analysis of the ozonated leachate, and methane and total gas formation during the anaerobic incubation were used to assess the degree of leachate conditioning. When treated with O-3 alone, 58% removal of E2 was observed with an ozone dose of 4.5-5.4mg/L. Direct oxidation of the three leachate contaminants was limited with O-3/H2O2 pre-treatment. However, this pre-treatment was observed to have significantly improved degradation of E2 during anaerobic incubation of ozonated leachates (removal rate of E2 was 53.7% with 15 days of incubation), indicating the potential for ozone synthesized co-metabolism. However, overall anaerobic microbial activity was not significantly impacted by the applied ozone pre-treatments, as measured by methane formation, total gas formation, and COD removal during incubation.

AB This study reports the synthesis and characterization of composite nitrogen and fluorine co-doped titanium dioxide (NF-TiO2) for the removal of contaminants of concern in wastewater under visible and solar light. Monodisperse anatase TiO2 nanoparticles of different sizes and Evonik P25 were assembled to immobilized NF-TiO2 by direct incorporation into the sol-gel or by the layer-by-layer technique. The composite films were characterized with X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and porosimetry analysis. The photocatalytic degradation of atrazine, carbamazepine, and caffeine was evaluated in a synthetic water solution and in an effluent from a hybrid biological concentrator reactor (BCR). Minor aggregation and improved distribution of monodisperse titania particles was obtained with NF-TiO2-monodisperse (10 and 50 nm) from the layer-by-layer technique than with NF-TiO2 + monodisperse TiO2 (300 nm) directly incorporated into the sol. The photocatalysts synthesized with the layer-by-layer method achieved significantly higher degradation rates in contrast with NF-TiO2-monodisperse titania (300 nm) and slightly faster values when compared with NF-TiO2-P25. Using NF-TiO2 layer-by-layer with monodisperse TiO2 (50 nm) under solar light irradiation, the respective degradation rates in synthetic water and BCR effluent were 14.6 and 9.5 x 10(-3) min(-1) for caffeine, 12.5 and 9.0 x 10(-3) min(-1) for carbamazepine, and 10.9 and 5.8 x 10(-3) min(-1) for atrazine. These results suggest that the layer-by-layer technique is a promising method for the synthesis of composite TiO2-based films compared to the direct addition of nanoparticles into the sol.

AB The antibiotic sulfonamide drug sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is extensively used in both human and veterinary medicine. Since it cannot be completely eliminated by the typical state-of-the-art wastewater treatment technology, it is frequently detected in the water cycle. SMX, as aromatic amine, can undergo abiotic transformations with the under denitrifying conditions produced nitrogen species nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite (NO2-). NO and aromatic amines are commonly known to form diazonium cations. Depending on the reaction conditions the diazonium cation disintegrates under cleavage of elementary nitrogen and substitutes its diazo-group by an NO(2)(-)group or by hydrogen. Following this approach, two transformation products (TPs) of the persistent SMX under denitrifying conditions were hypothesized and synthesized: 4-nitro-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (4-nitro-SMX) and N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (desamino-SMX). The synthesized compounds were identified by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and used as reference standards for their confirmation and quantification in denitrifying water/sediment batch experiments and in environmental samples. During the denitrifying degradation experiment SMX was no longer detected after 10 days whereas increasing concentrations of the two TPs were observed. However, at day 87 the SMX concentration recovered to 53 +/- 16% of the initial concentration after most of the nitrate was consumed. A retransformation of 4-nitro-SMX to SMX was postulated and confirmed by another anoxic water/sediment test in the absence of nitrate as electron acceptor. Both TPs were also detected in karst spring samples, highlighting the need and benefit of focusing on transformation products in environmental studies. Furthermore, the consideration of the retransformation potential of 4-nitro-SMX can substantially improve the understanding of SMX behavior during processes such as bank filtration and artificial recharge.

AB Various members of the popular fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) have been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water bodies in recent years. This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the fate of FQs in the sediment-water environment. Seven FQS were examined for adsorptive and oxidative interactions with delta-MnO2 under environmental conditions and exhibited reactivity in the order of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin similar to norfloxacin similar to ofloxacin similar to lomefloxacin > pipemidic acid >> flumequine. Four amines that are structurally related to the aniline and piperazine functional groups of HIS showed reactivity to oxidation by delta-MnO2 in the order of 1-phenylpiperazine > aniline > N-phenylmorpholine > 4-phenylpiperidine. Comparison among the above compounds clearly indicates that the piperazine moiety of FQs is the predominant adsorptive and oxidative site to MnO2. Product analyses showed that oxidation by MnO2 results in dealkylation and hydroxylation at the piperazine moiety of FQs, with the quinolone ring essentially intact. The reaction kinetics, reactivity comparison, and product characterization point to a surface reaction mechanism that likely begins with formation of a surface complex between FQ and the surface-bound Mn-IV, followed by oxidation at the aromatic N-1 atomof FQ's piperazine moiety to generate an anilinyl radical intermediate. The radical intermediates subsequently undergo N-dealkylation, C-hydroxylation, and possibly coupling to yield a range of products. Even though the quinolone ring appears to be stable with respect to MnO2, it affects the overall reactivity and potentially product distribution of FQs via substituent effects. Results of this study strongly suggest that manganese oxides commonly present in soils will likely play an important role in the abiotic degradation of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents in the environment.

AB Freshwaters are increasingly exposed to complex mixtures of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from municipal wastewater, which are known to alter freshwater communities' structure and functioning. However, their interaction with other disturbances and whether their combined effects can impact ecological resilience (i.e., the ability of a system to tolerate disturbances without altering the system's original structure and processes) remain unexplored. Using in situ mesocosms in 2 lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic), we assessed whether a pulse exposure to sublethal concentrations of 12 PPCPs affects the ecological resilience of natural phytoplankton communities that experienced an abrupt environmental change involving the destabilization of the water column through mixing. Such mixing events are predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold, leading to more frequent storms, which disrupt stratification in lakes and force communities to restructure. We assessed their combined effects on community metrics (biomass, species richness, and composition) and their relative resilience using 4 indicators (cross-scale, within-scale, aggregation length, and gap length), inferred from phytoplankton communities by discontinuity analysis. The mixing disturbance alone had negligible effects on the community metrics, but when combined with chemical contaminants significant changes were measured: reducing total biomass, species richness, and altered community composition of phytoplankton. Once these changes occurred, they persisted until the end of the experiment (day 20), when the communities' structures from the 2 highest exposure levels diverged from the controls. The resilience indicators were not affected by PPCPs but differed significantly between lakes, with lower resilience found in the eutrophic lake. Thus, PPCPs can significantly alter community structures and reinforce mechanisms that maintain ecosystems in a "degraded state." Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB This study aims at investigating the photocatalytic treatment of bisphenol-A (BPA) under various irradiation sources in order to identify cleaner and more sustainable technologies compared to conventional photocatalytic wastewater treatment systems. For this purpose, parallel experimental runs were carried out in two batch-operated slurry photoreactors under UVA irradiation provided by either a light-emitting diode (UV-LED) or a UV blacklight lamp (UV-BL), as well as in a solar compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor under natural sunlight. The effect of key operating parameters, such as the initial BPA and TiO2 concentrations, water matrix, and treatment time, on the efficiency of the three photocatalytic systems was evaluated. The photocatalytic degradation of BPA was found to fit well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. BPA removal rate increased with catalyst concentration and with decreasing the initial concentration of BPA. The addition of humic acids was found to be inhibitory for all photocatalytic systems. At the best conditions assayed (C-0 = 2.5 mg/L, TiO2 250 mg/L), BPA was completely degraded within 20, 30, and 120 min under UV-LED, solar, and UV-BL irradiation, respectively. The corresponding reaction rates were 0.230, 0.151, and 0.025 min(-1), and TOC removal was 88, 67, and 33% after 90 min of treatment. In all cases. TiO2/UV-LED achieved the highest removal efficiency and it was found to be significantly more energy-efficient than the TiO2/UV-BL system. All in all, LED-driven photocatalysis was found to be advantageous over conventional TiO2/UV-BL systems in terms of performance and sustainability, and an appropriate alternative to solar photocatalysis in areas where sunlight is inadequate.

AB Pharmaceuticals are present in low concentrations (<100 ng/L) in most municipal wastewater effluents but may be elevated locally because of factors such as input from pharmaceutical formulation facilities. Using existing concentration data, the authors assessed pharmaceuticals in laboratory exposures of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and added environmental complexity through effluent exposures. In the laboratory, larval and mature minnows were exposed to a simple opioid mixture (hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone), an opioid agonist (tramadol), a muscle relaxant (methocarbamol), a simple antidepressant mixture (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine), a sleep aid (temazepam), or a complex mixture of all compounds. Larval minnow response to effluent exposure was not consistent. The 2010 exposures resulted in shorter exposed minnow larvae, whereas the larvae exposed in 2012 exhibited altered escape behavior. Mature minnows exhibited altered hepatosomatic indices, with the strongest effects in females and in mixture exposures. In addition, laboratory-exposed, mature male minnows exposed to all pharmaceuticals (except the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor mixture) defended nest sites less rigorously than fish in the control group. Tramadol or antidepressant mixture exposure resulted in increased splenic T lymphocytes. Only male minnows exposed to whole effluent responded with increased plasma vitellogenin concentrations. Female minnows exposed to pharmaceuticals (except the opioid mixture) had larger livers, likely as a compensatory result of greater prominence of vacuoles in liver hepatocytes. The observed alteration of apical endpoints central to sustaining fish populations confirms that effluents containing waste streams from pharmaceutical formulation facilities can adversely impact fish populations but that the effects may not be temporally consistent. The present study highlights the importance of including diverse biological endpoints spanning levels of biological organization and life stages when assessing contaminant interactions.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is monitored under the USEPA High Production Volume (HPV) chemical program and is predominantly used as the active ingredient in select antibacterial bar soaps and other personal care products. The compound commonly occurs at parts-per-million concentrations in processed wastewater treatment residuals (i.e. biosolids), which are frequently land-applied as fertilizers and soil conditioners. Human and ecological risk assessment parameters measured by the authors in previous studies were integrated with existing data to perform a two-tiered human health and ecological risk assessment of land-applied biosolids-borne TCC. The 14 exposure pathways identified in the Part 503 Biosolids Rule were expanded, and conservative screening-level hazard quotients (HQ values) were first calculated to estimate risk to humans and a variety of terrestrial and aquatic organisms (Tier 1). The majority of biosolids-borne TCC exposure pathways resulted in no screening-level HQ values indicative of significant risks to exposed organisms (including humans), even under worst-case land application scenarios. The two pathways for which the conservative screening-level HQ values exceeded one (i.e. Pathway 10: biosolids -> soil -> soil organism -> predator, and Pathway 16: biosolids -> soil -> surface water -> aquatic organism) were then reexamined using modified parameters and scenarios (Tier 2). Adjusted HQ values remained greater than one for Exposure Pathway 10, with the exception of the final adjusted HQ values under a one-time 5 Mg ha(-1)(agronomic) biosolids loading rate scenario for the American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Results were used to prioritize recommendations for future biosolids-borne TCC research, which include additional measurements of toxicological effects and TCC concentrations in environmental matrices at the field level.

AB The rapid rise in the healthcare sector has led to an increase in pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in different aqueous bodies. The toxicity of the PhACs and their ability to persist after conventional treatment processes have escalated research in the field of photocatalytic treatment. Although different photocatalysts have been successful in degrading PhACs, their inherent drawbacks have severely limited their application on a large scale. A substantial amount of research has been aimed at overcoming the high cost of the photocatalytic material, low quantum yield, the formation of toxic end products, etc. Hence, to further research in this field, researchers must have a fair idea of the current trends in the application of different photocatalysts. In this article, the trends in the use of various photocatalysts for the removal of different PhACs have been circumscribed. The performance of different groups of photocatalysts to degrade PhACs from synthetic and real wastewater has been addressed. The drawbacks and advantages of these materials have been compared, and their future in the field of PhACs removal has been predicted using S-curve analysis. Zinc and titanium-based photocatalysts were efficient under UV irradiation, while bismuth and graphene-based materials exhibited exemplary performance in visible light. However, iron-based compounds were found to have the most promising future, which may be because of their magnetic properties, easy availability, low bandgap, etc. Different modification techniques, such as morphology modification, doping, heterojunction formation, etc., have also been discussed. This study may help researchers to clarify the current research status in the field of photocatalytic treatment of PhACs and provide valuable information for future research.

AB Hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture (FeFeIII)-Fe-II layered double hydroxide (LDH) multiwall was grown on carbon-felt (CF) substrate via solvothermal process. The as-deposited FeIIFeIII LDH/CF cathode was composed of highly oriented and well crystallized interconnected nanowalls with high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity over a wide pH range (pH 3-9) for heterogeneous electro-Fenton (HEF) degradation of antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMT) in aqueous medium. Mineralization efficiencies (in terms of TOC removal) of similar to 97%, 93% and 90% was achieved at pH 3, 6 and 9 respectively for FeIIFeIII cathode during HEF treatment of 0.2mM SMT solution at applied current density of 7.5 mA cm(-2) using Ti4O7 anode. Comparative electro-Fenton (EF-Fe2+) with 0.2mM Fe2+ or electrooxidation with H2O2 production (EO-H2O2) studies using raw CF cathode at similar experimental conditions showed relatively lower mineralization with highest TOC removal efficiency of 77% and 64% obtained at pH 3 for EF-Fe2+ and EO-H2O2 respectively. Oxidative degradation of SMT in HEF system was by (i) Ti4O7(% OH) generated at anode surface at all pH studied, (ii) surface catalyzed process and (iii) contribution from homogeneous catalyzed process at pH 3 due to leached iron ions.The prepared (FeFeIII)-Fe-II LDH/CF exhibited excellent catalytic stability with good reusability up to 10 cycles of 4 h treatment at pH 6. Initial SMT solution showed relatively high toxicity but total detoxification of the solution was attained after 8 h of treatment by HEF with (FeFeLDH)-Fe-II-L-III/CF cathode. HEF with FeIIFeIII LDH/CF cathode is an exciting technique for remediation of organic contaminated wastewater.

AB A purified olive extract (POE) rich in phenolic and oleosidic compounds was prepared from olive mill wastewaters by adsorption onto an amphoteric polymer resin with the yield of 2.2% (w/v). In addition to complex and simple phenolic compounds found in the POE, the highly hydrophilic elenolic acid and DEDA (dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid, a non-phenolic secoiridoids) were also present in high concentration (45%, w/w). Among the phenolic constituents, the major compounds are hydroxytyrosol and its glucoside, DEDA linked to hydroxytyrosol (Hy-DEDA), p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid, verbascoside and some flavonoids. The high content (23%, w/w in gallic acid equivalent) and structural diversity of these phenolic compounds confer superior antioxidant potential of POE with an IC50 less than 8.5 mu g/ml determined by DPPH assay. The stability of bioactive components during storage of the extract and changes in antioxidant properties were studied under different conditions. Determination of kinetics of degradation revealed that air/oxygen is the determinant factor which influences the stability of POE under low temperature storage conditions, while exposure to sunlight did not have significant effect on their stability. Whilst an increase in storage temperature decreased the total content of phenolic compounds (20-24% reduction) and non-phenolic secoiridoid aglycons, a high antioxidant capacity was still observed particularly in the nitrogen-protected POE samples (93-95% of the initial value). This was believed to be due to the transformation of hydroxytyrosol-containing complex phenols, especially the secoiridoid ester Hy-DEDA, into free phenolic monomer. This contributed significantly to the maintenance of a high antioxidant potency of the whole extract during storage. The high antioxidant, radical scavenging activity and stability of the extract suggest potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines the oxidative disposal of Prozac (R) (also known as Fluoxetine, FXT) through several oxidative processes with and without UV irradiation: for example, TiO2 alone, O-3 alone, and the hybrid methods comprised of O-3 + H2O2 (PEROXONE process), TiO2+ O-3 and TiO2+ O-3 + H2O2 at the laboratory scale. Results show a strong pH dependence of the adsorption of FXT on TiO2 and the crucial role of adsorption in the whole degradation process. Photolysis of FXT is remarkable only under alkaline pH. The heterogeneous photoassisted process removes 0.11 mM FXT (initial concentration) within ca. 60 min with a concomitant 50% mineralization at pH 11 (TiO2 loading, 0.050 g L-1). The presence of H2O2 enhances the mineralization further to >70%. UV/ozonation leads to the elimination of FXT to a greater extent than does UV/TiO2: i.e., 100% elimination of FXT is achieved by UV/O-3 in the first 10 min of reaction and almost 97% mineralization is attained under UV irradiation in the presence of H2O2. The hybrid configuration UV + TiO2 + O-3 + H2O2 enhances removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in ca. 30 mm leaving, however, an important inorganic carbon (IC) content. In all cases, the presence of H2O2 improves the elimination of DOC, but not without a detrimental effect on the biodegradability of FXT owing to the low organic carbon content in the final treated effluent, together with significant levels of inorganic byproducts remaining. The photoassisted TiO2/O-3 hybrid method may prove to be an efficient combination to enhance wastewater treatment of recalcitrant drug pollutants in aquatic environments.

AB Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) exhibited an excellent removal efficiency and a high tolerance in the treatment of antibiotics wastewater. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of AGS with abundant binding sites might serve as the first barrier to prevent the direct contact of antibiotics and cells, thereby keeping the stability of MS. In this study, the investigations in the fluorescence properties and the molecular weight of AGS-EPS after interaction with tetracycline (TC) were combined to reveal the resistance mechanism of AGS-EPS against TC. The two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) was utilized to analyze the interaction priority of the AGS-EPS components with TC. Results showed that TC interacted with proteins and humic add in AGS-EPS by forming a complex through hydrogen bond and van der Waals force. Compared with humic acid, TC could preferentially interact with proteins and form more stable complexes. Moreover, the components with the larger molecular weight in AGS-EPS interact with TC prior to which with smaller molecular weight. Significantly, TC exhibited the potential of binding with the divalent cation of AGS-EPS and caused the conformation changes of the protein. Therefore, AGS-EPS could resist the TC at a certain concentration range by trapping antibiotics, while over-loaded TC would cause the instability of AGS due to the limited interaction site of AGS-EPS and the destructive effect of antibiotics on AGS-EPS. This study provided a theoretical basis for understanding the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and AGS-EPS and offered a reference for AGS to maintain the stability of granules under the threat of antibiotics.

AB The activated persulfate degradation of piroxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to oxicams, was investigated. Persulfate was activated with thermal energy or (UV-A and simulated solar) irradiation. Using 250 mg/L sodium persulfate at 40 degrees C degraded almost completely 0.5 mg/L of piroxicam in 30 min. Increasing piroxicam concentration from 0.5 to 4.5 mg/L decreased its removal. The observed kinetic constant was increased almost ten times from 0.077 to 0.755 min(-1), when the temperature was increased from 40 to 60 degrees C, respectively. Process efficiency was enhanced at pH 5-7. At ambient conditions and 30 min of irradiation, 94.1% and 89.8% of 0.5 mg/L piroxicam was removed using UV-A LED or simulated solar radiation, respectively. Interestingly, the use of simulated sunlight was advantageous over UV-A light for both secondary effluent, and 20 mg/L of humic acid solution. Unlike other advanced oxidation processes, the presence of bicarbonate or chloride in the range 50-250 mg/L enhanced the degradation rate, while the presence of humic acid delayed the removal of piroxicam. The use of 0.5 and 10 g/L of methanol or tert-butanol as radical scavengers inhibited the reaction. The coupling of thermal and light activation methods in different aqueous matrices showed a high level of synergy. The synergy factor was calculated as 68.4% and 58.4% for thermal activation (40 degrees C) coupled with either solar light in 20 mg/L of humic acid or UV-A LED light in secondary effluent, respectively.

AB Multi-spheres adsorptive microextraction using powdered activated carbons (ACs) was studied as a novel enrichment approach, followed by liquid desorption and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (MSA mu E(AC)-LD/HPLC-DAD) to monitor caffeine (CAF) and acetaminophen (ACF) traces in environmental matrices. In this study, commercial activated carbons (N, N-OX, and R) were tested, with the latter showing a much better performance for the analysis of both anthropogenic drugs. The main parameters affecting the efficiency of the proposed methodology are fully discussed using commercial AC(R). Textural and surface chemistry properties of the ACs sample were correlated with the analytical results. Assays performed on 30 mL of water samples spiked at 10 mu g L-1 under optimized experimental conditions, yielding recoveries of 75.3% for ACF and 82.6% for CAF. The methodology also showed excellent linear dynamic ranges for both drugs with determination coefficients higher than 0.9976, limits of detection and quantification of 0.8-1.2 mu g L-1 and 2.8-4.0 mu g L-1, respectively, and suitable precision (RSD < 13.8%). By using the standard addition method, the application of the present method to environmental matrices, including superficial, sea, and wastewater samples, allowed very good performance at the trace level. The proposed methodology proved to be a feasible alternative for polar compound analysis, showing to be easy to implement, reliable, and sensitive, with the possibility to reuse and store the analytical devices loaded with the target compounds for later analysis.

AB Glucocorticoids are pharmaceutical contaminants of emerging concern due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment, increased presence in aquatic environment and their biological potency. The zebrafish is a popular model for aquatic toxicology and environmental risk assessment. This study aimed to determine if glucocorticoids at environmental concentrations would perturb expression of selected glucocorticoid-responsive genes in zebrafish and to investigate their potentials as an in vivo zebrafish assay in complementing in vitro glucocorticoid receptor bioassay. The relative expression of eleven glucocorticoid-responsive genes in zebrafish larvae and liver of adult male zebrafish exposed to three representative glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone and triamcinolone) was determined. The expression of pepck, baiap2 and pxr was up-regulated in zebrafish larvae and the expression of baiap2, pxr and mmp-2 was up-regulated in adult zebrafish exposed to glucocorticoids at concentrations equivalent to total glucocorticoids reported in environmental samples. The responsiveness of the specific genes were sufficiently robust in zebrafish larvae exposed to a complex environmental sample detected with in vitro glucocorticoid activity equivalent to 478 pM dexamethasone (DEX-EQ) and confirmed to contain low concentration (0.2 ng/L or less) of the targeted glucocorticoids, and possibly other glucocorticoid-active compounds. The findings provided in vivo relevance to the in vitro glucocorticoid activity and suggested that the environmental sample can perturb glucocorticoid-responsive genes in its original, or half the diluted, concentration as may be found in the environment. The study demonstrated the important complementary roles of in vivo zebrafish and in vitro bioassays coupled with analytical chemistry in monitoring environmental glucocorticoid contaminants.

AB Background: Sulfamethoxazole (SMX, sulfonamide antibiotic) biodegradation by activated sludge communities (ASC) is still only partly understood. The present work is focusing on nine different bacteria species capable of SMX biodegradation that were isolated from SMX-acclimated ASC.
   Results: Initially 110 pure cultures, isolated from activated sludge, were screened by UV-absorbance measurements (UV-AM) for their SMX biodegradation potential. Identification via almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed five Pseudomonas spp., one Brevundimonas sp., one Variovorax sp. and two Microbacterium spp.. Thus seven species belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria and two to Actinobacteria. These cultures were subsequently incubated in media containing 10 mg L-1 SMX and different concentrations of carbon (sodium-acetate) and nitrogen (ammonium-nitrate). Different biodegradation patterns were revealed with respect to media composition and bacterial species. Biodegradation, validated by LC-UV measurements to verify UV-AM, occurred very fast with 2.5 mg L-1 d(-1) SMX being biodegraded in all pure cultures in, for UV-AM modified, R2A-UV medium under aerobic conditions and room temperature. However, reduced and different biodegradation rates were observed for setups with SMX provided as co-substrate together with a carbon/nitrogen source at a ratio of DOC:N - 33:1 with rates ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 mg L-1 d(-1).
   Conclusions: Media containing only SMX as carbon and nitrogen source proved the organisms' ability to use SMX as sole nutrient source where biodegradation rates decreased to 1.0 - 1.7 mg L-1 d(-1). The different taxonomically identified species showed specific biodegradation rates and behaviours at various nutrient conditions. Readily degradable energy sources seem to be crucial for efficient SMX biodegradation.

AB The enantiospecific fate of three common pharmaceuticals was monitored in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The MBR was operated with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 8.6-10 g/L. Standard solutions of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen were dosed into the synthetic feed of the MBR. Influent and permeate samples were then collected for enantiospecific analysis. The individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the three pharmaceuticals were derivatised using a chiral derivatizing agent to form pairs of diastereomers, which could then be separated and analysed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Accurate quantitation of individual enantiomers was undertaken by an isotope dilution process. By comparing the total concentration (as the sum of the two enantiomers) in the MBR influent and permeate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen concentrations were observed to have been reduced as much as 99%, 43% and 68%, respectively. Furthermore, evidence of enantioselective biodegradation was observed for all three pharmaceuticals. (S)-Ibuprofen was shown to be preferentially degraded compared to (R)-ibuprofen with an average decrease in enantiomeric fraction (EF) from 0.52 to 0.39. In contrast, (R)-ketoprofen was preferentially degraded compared to (S)-ketoprofen with a relatively minor increase in EF from 0.52 to 0.63. The use of a relatively pure enantiomeric solution of (S)-naproxen resulted in a significant change in EF from 0.99 to 0.65. However, this experiment consistently revealed significantly increased concentrations of (R)-naproxen during MBR treatment. It is hypothesised that the source of this (R)-naproxen was the enantiomeric inversion of (S)-naproxen. Such enantiomeric inversion of chiral pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment processes has not previously been reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) antibiotic organic contamination wastewater poses a huge threat to environmental safety. An advanced oxidation technology (Fe-0/PDS/US) of using ultrasound (US) enhanced zero-valent iron/potassium persulfate (Fe-0/PDS) can remove CBZ effectively. The optimal reaction conditions were determined by exploring the effect of single-factor experimental conditions such as ultrasonic power, ultrasonic frequency, CBZ concentration, solution pH, PDS dosage, and Fe-0 dosage on the removal of CBZ. In addition, we also investigated into the effect of background ions (PO43-, HCO3-, Cl- and HA) on Fe-0/PDS/US and analyzed the related results. The mechanism of CBZ removal in Fe-0/PDS/US were explored by analyzing CBZ removal efficiency and reaction rates, the ion concentration of S2O82-, SO42-, Fe2+ and Fe3+, pH and the active radicals. The result indicates that US can improve the efficiency of activated PDS and expand the pH range of Fe-0/PDS. It has prominent performance in catalytically degrading CBZ when the pH is 10.0. SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(center dot-) all coexist in the Fe-0/PDS/US and make contribution to CBZ removal, whereas the SO4 center dot- plays a key role. US can greatly promotes the degradation of target pollutant CBZ by speeding up the dissolution of the outer portion of iron powder, producing sufficient amount of Fe2+ with a continuous and stable way, and better activating S2O82- to generate sufficient SO4 center dot- radicals. The degradation of CBZ may embrace three reaction processes, in which organic intermediate products with low molecular weight and biological toxicity is produced, boosting further mineralization and

AB In this study, we report an effective degradation method for trace level beta-blockers (propranolol and acebutolol) in hospital wastewater using a new droplet flow-assisted heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactor (DFEF) system. Biogenic iron-carbon nanocomposites (RHS/C-x% Fe) as eco-friendly and low-cost heterogeneous Fenton catalysts were synthesized from rice husk via hydrolytic sol-gel routes. Here, we demonstrate the use of natural air as a nebulizing agent for fast and continuous catholyte air saturation and Fenton catalyst transfer to the cathode electrode. The effects of key operational parameters were evaluated and optimized using central composite design. Results clearly indicated that enhanced beta-blocker degradation was mainly dependent on the interactive effects of electrolysis time, current density, and catalyst dosage. Fast degradation efficiencies (99.9%) was recorded at neutral pH conditions. The decay followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with degradation rates of up to 2.72x10(-2) and 2.54x10(-2)min(-1) for acebutolol and propranolol, respectively. The synergistic contribution of (OHbulk)-O-center dot attributable to DFEF process and (OHadsorbed)-O-center dot for anodic oxidation (AO) at the anode electrode significantly enhanced the degradation process. Compared to AO, the conventional flow-assisted electro-Fenton (FEF), and the batch electro-Fenton (BEF), DFEF degradation efficiency followed a decreasing order: DFEF ? FEF ? BEF? AO. This trend in performance was mainly due to the fast and continuous cathodic electro-generation of H2O2 and Fe2+ regeneration. Additionally, in order to elucidate degradation mechanism, we used a combination of DFEF approach with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This approach demonstrates a simple, cleaner, and highly efficient degradation approach for trace level recalcitrant pollutants in a complex aquatic matrix, without the need for external chemical addition and pH adjustment.

AB There is a growing interest in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater because pharmaceuticals have potential ecotoxicological effects. Among several removal mechanisms, the sorption of pharmaceuticals to sediment organic matter is an important mechanism related to the mobility of pharmaceuticals. This study investigated the sorption of pharmaceuticals to soil organic matter (SOM) by electrostatic interactions. SOM located on the surface of soil/sediment generally has a negative charge because of the functional groups present (i.e., carboxylic and phenolic groups). Thus, the electrical characteristics of SOM can induce electrical attraction with positively charged chemical compounds. In this study, SOM was extracted from soils under different aquatic plants (Acorus and Typha) in a constructed wetland in Korea. Experiments were carried out with the following three pharmaceuticals with different electrical characteristics at pH 7: atenolol (positive charge; pKa 9.5), carbamazepine (neutral; no pKa), and ibuprofen (negative charge; pKa 4.9). The SOM in the Acorus pond had a higher hydrophobicity and electrical charge density than that in the Typha pond. Regarding the sorption efficiency between SOM and charged pharmaceuticals, atenolol showed highest sorption efficiency (similar to 60%), followed by carbamazepine (similar to 40%) and ibuprofen (<similar to 30%). In addition, the removal efficiency of the targeted pharmaceuticals in the constructed wetland was estimated by comparing the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals at sampling points with flowing water. The results showed that the removal efficiency of atenolol and carbamazepine was almost 50%, whereas that of ibuprofen was only similar to 10%. A comparison of the results of lab-scale and field experiments showed that electrostatic interaction is one of the major pharmaceutical removal mechanisms in a constructed wetland.

AB Hydro-climatic changes and the increasing release of pollutants into rivers by human activities tend to affect the quality of watercourses, to alter aquatic ecosystems and to reduce the amount of useable water. The ecological and chemical states of rivers and their evolution is thus of growing concern. In Europe and Switzerland, water policies are progressively shifting towards a holistic approach of river systems. The European Commission notably established a framework to highlight rivers' ecological deficits and to enhance regional or local water management plans. In Switzerland, a similar framework is currently under development. In this paper, both procedures are compared and implemented in a Swiss catchment dominated by agricultural activities. The aim is to define the challenges that still need to be addressed to assess and sustain river health. The hydromorphological, ecological, and ecotoxicological quality of the river was evaluated. Both frameworks highlighted the fact that no section of the river can currently be classified as being in a good environmental state and that the state deteriorates as tributaries and wastewater discharge flow into the main riverbed. Chemical issues and water quality changes due to hydro-climatic variations and management strategies were also pinpointed. Both frameworks are thus useful tools to survey changes in rivers quality in space and over time. However, challenges remain regarding the appropriate strategies to monitor and analyze chemicals, the definition of target values and conditions, the evaluation and integration of human-induced pressures, and the overall evaluation of the state of a river. The development of integrated indicators or of ecosystem services approaches is considered as a potential solution to explore river health and to define efficient restoration measures by water managers.

AB The Fish Plasma Model (FPM) was applied to water exposure and tissue concentrations in fish collected from two wastewater treatment plant impacted estuarine sites. In this study we compared predicted fish plasma concentrations to Cmax values for humans, which represents the maximum plasma concentration for the minimum therapeutic dose. The results of this study show that predictions of plasma concentrations for a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from effluent concentrations resulted in 37 compounds (54%) exceeding the response ratio (RR = Fish [Plasma]/1% Cmax(total)) of 1 compared to 3 compounds (14%) detected with values generated with estuarine receiving water concentrations. When plasma concentrations were modeled from observed whole-body tissue residues, 16 compounds out of 24 detected for Chinook (67%) and 7 of 14 (50%) for sculpin resulted in an RRtissue value greater than 1, which highlights the importance of this dose metric over that using estuarine water. Because the tissue residue approach resulted in a high percentage of compounds with calculated response ratios exceeding a value of unity, we believe this is a more accurate representation for exposure in the field. Predicting plasma concentrations from tissue residues improves our ability to assess the potential for adverse effects in fish because exposure from all sources is captured. Tissue residues are also more likely to represent steady-state conditions compared to those from water exposure because of the inherent reduction in variability usually observed for field data and the time course for bioaccumulation. We also examined the RR in a toxic unit approach to highlight the importance of considering multiple compounds exhibiting a similar mechanism of action. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sulfonamide-based antibiotics are often detected in surface water and secondary wastewater effluent and pose an eminent threat for the development of antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes in aquatic environment. This paper presents the kinetics and stoichiometry of the oxidation of sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethazine, and sulfadimethoxine) by ferrate(VI) (FeO42-, Fe(VI)) in the acidic to basic pH range (2.0-9.6); apparent second-order rate constants (k(app), M s(-1)) decreased non-linearly with increase in pH. The specific rate constants for the individual Fe(VI) species (H3FeC4+, H2FeO4, HFeO4-, and FeO4-) were determined using acid-base equilibria of Fe(VI) and sulfonamides. The reactivity order of Fe(VI) species with the neutral sulfonamide was H3FeO4+>H2FeO4 > HFeO4-, which generally explained the pH dependence behavior of rate constants. Detailed studies regarding the resultant oxidized products (OPs) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry were performed for oxidation of SMX at different molar ratios of Fe(VI) to SMX (i.e., 1.0-15) and at different pH's (i.e., 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0); oxidative degradative products include 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, and hydroxyl-, hydroxylamine-, nitroso-, and nitro-derivatives of SMX. The possible reaction pathways comprise the S-N bond cleavage, ring-opening of isoxazole moiety, oxidation of aromatic amine, and the hydroxylation of the benzene ring; different OPs formed under acidic, neutral, and basic pH conditions are described. The value of k(app), 8.9 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7.0 suggests the oxidative transformation of SMX in seconds by 1 mg L-1 K2FeO4 and interestingly, the removal of SMX could be achieved at neutral pH by Fe(VI) in the presence of humic acid.

AB A study was carried out by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies to establish the efficiency of adsorption of fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLU), onto a crosslinked beta-cyclodextrin-carboxymethylcellulose (beta-CD-CMC) polymer. The adsorption was performed in mixtures containing aqueous FLU solution at 20 mg/L and 0.01-0.30 g of the beta-CD-CMC polymer, at 25 degrees C, and atmospheric pressure under stirring. The results have revealed that the adsorption is a rapid process and the polymer possesses a high affinity for FLU with an adsorption capacity of 5.076 mg of FLU/g of polymer. This adsorption may involve the formation of a stable inclusion compound beta-CD-CMC/FLU through the penetration of the FLU aromatic ring (A and/or B) into the beta-CD cavity, and a physical adsorption with the polymer network. The inclusion compound can be stabilized by the formation of H-bonds between the -CF3 group of FLU and the 6'-OH group of beta-CD, and van der Waals interactions between the FLU aromatic ring and beta-CD cavity. The data from a kinetic study have also indicated that the adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, in which the initial adsorption rate and constant were estimated at 1.938 mg/g min and 0.075 g/mg min, respectively. Moreover, the results of adsorption equilibrium fitted the Freundlich isotherm, indicating a multilayer coverage and heterogeneous surface. Together, these results suggest that the adsorption of FLU onto the crosslinked beta-CD-CMC polymer could constitute an advantageous technology for removing this commonly used antidepressant drug from wastewater due to the high adsorption capacity of the polymer and non-toxic character of beta-CD to humans and environment.

AB Apparent rate constants for the reactions of four selected pharmaceutical compounds (metoprolol, naproxen, amoxicillin, and phenacetin) with chlorine in ultra-pure (UP) water were determined as a function of the pH. It was found that amoxicillin (in the whole pH range 3-12), and naproxen (in the low pH range 2-4) presented high reaction rates, while naproxen (in the pH range 5-9), and phenacetin and metoprolol (in the pH range 2.5-12 for phenacetin, and 3-10 for metoprolol) followed intermediate and slow reaction rates. A mechanism is proposed for the chlorination reaction, which allowed the evaluation of the intrinsic rate constants for the elementary reactions of the ionized and un-ionized species of each selected pharmaceutical with chlorine. An excellent agreement is obtained between experimental and calculated rate constants by this mechanism.
   The elimination of these substances in several waters (a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and two effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants) was also investigated at neutral pH. The efficiency of the chlorination process with respect to the pharmaceuticals elimination and the formation THMs was also established. It is generally observed that the increasing presence of organic and inorganic matter in the water matrices demand more oxidant agent (chlorine), and therefore, less chlorine is available for the oxidation of these compounds. Finally, half-life times and oxidant exposures (CT) required for the removal of 99% of the four pharmaceuticals are also evaluated. These parameters are useful for the establishment of safety chlorine doses in oxidation or disinfection stages of pharmaceuticals in treatment plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The city of Puno in Peru is the largest producer of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using intensive floating cage systems installed in Lake Titicaca. As a result, the increase in diseases and the use of antibiotics to control them during the production cycle has been documented. We study the impact of antibiotics on drinking water, trout tissues and the lake's aquatic ecosystem. Nine antibiotics were monitored: tetracyclines, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones. The samples were collected randomly and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and the solid-phase extraction system. The sediment samples and surface water samples contain high concentrations of antibiotics. All sediments contain fluoroquinolones (3.74 mg kg(-1)) and tetracyclines (3.08 mg kg-1) and the surface water contains fluoroquinolones of up to 408.2 and 652.7 ng L-1 in the dry and rainy seasons respectively (P > 0.05). Drinking water samples from the city of Puno collected at sampling points with Lake Titicaca as a source of drinking water, reached an average of 188.1 and 222.2 ng L-1 of ciprofloxacin in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Complementarily, in trout tissues, it reached 7.8 lg kg(-1) in oxytetracycline 8.7 lg kg(-1) in sulfatizole, 4.2 lg kg(-1) in ciprofloxacin and 3.6 lg kg(-1) in sarafloxacin. The presence of these antibiotics in surface water is attributed to the aquaculture activity, in addition to runoff and wastewater, and their presence can have detrimental effects on the aquatic ecosystem, and even affect public health due to the consumption of aquaculture products and drinking water contaminated with antibiotic residues.

AB Antibiotics, such as sulfonamides (SAs), have recently raised concern as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) partly remove them, and thus, SAs continuously enter the aquifers. In this context, the aims of this work are to (1) investigate the temporal evolution of SAs and metabolites in an urban aquifer recharged by a polluted river; (2) identify the potential geochemical processes that might affect SAs in the river-groundwater interface and (3) evaluate the ecological and human health risk assessment of SAs. To this end, 14 SAs and 4 metabolites were analyzed in river and urban groundwater from the metropolitan area of Barcelona (NE, Spain) in three different sampling campaigns. These substances had a distinct behavior when river water, which is the main recharge source, infiltrates the aquifer. Mixing of the river water recharge into the aquifer drives several redox reactions such as aerobic respiration and denitrification. This reducing character of the aquifer seemed to favor the natural attenuation of some SAs as sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, and sulfamethizole. However, most of the SAs detected were not likely to undergo degradation and adsorption because their concentrations were constant along groundwater flow path. In fact, the intensity of SAs adsorption is low as the retardation factors are close to 1 at average groundwater pH of 7.2 for most SAs.
   Finally, risk quotients (RQs) are used to evaluate the ecological and human health risks posed by single and mixture of SAs in river water and groundwater, respectively. Life-stage RQs of the SAs detected in groundwater for the 8 age intervals were low, indicating that SAs and their mixture do not pose any risk to human beings. Concerning the environmental risk assessment, SAs do not pose any risk for algae, fish and crustaceans as the RQs evaluated are further lower than 0.1. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to multiple classes of contaminants, both legacy and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), were assessed in tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) tissue and diet samples from 6 sites along the Maumee River, Ohio, USA, to understand both exposure and possible effects of exposure to those CECs for which there are little avian data. The 6 sites represented a gradient from intensive agriculture upstream to highly urbanized and industrial landscapes downstream; 1 or 2 remote Wisconsin lakes were assessed for comparative purposes. Cytochrome P450 induction, DNA damage, and thyroid function were also assessed relative to contaminant exposure. Bioaccumulative CECs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated substances, did not follow any upstream to downstream gradient; but both had significantly greater concentrations along the Maumee River than at the remote lake sites. Greater exposure to PBDEs was apparent in swallows at or near wastewater-treatment facilities than at other sites. Total polychlorinated biphenyl and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were greater in swallows at downstream locations compared to upstream sites and were associated with higher ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity. Few herbicides or nonorganochlorine insecticides were detected in swallow tissues or their food, except for atrazine and its metabolite desethylatrazine. Few pharmaceuticals and personal care products were detected except for DEET and iopamidol. Both were detected in most liver samples but not in eggs, as well as detected at the remote lake sites. This is one of the most comprehensive assessments to date of exposure and effects of a wide variety of CECs in birds.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-17. (c) 2020 SETAC.

AB Pressure on groundwater resources has increased during the last decades due to the growing demand, especially in arid and semiarid regions, such as the Mediterranean basin, with frequent drought periods. In order to partially remediate this environmental problem of world concern, irrigation of agricultural lands with adequately treated wastewaters (TWW) is becoming a common management practice. The complex composition of these low-quality waters may influence the behavior of organic contaminants in soils. A calcareous soil with low organic carbon content was selected for the assessment of the adsorption and leaching of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid (THC). Different solutions were evaluated: TWW after a secondary treatment, a saline solution and solutions with a range of dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC, 3-300 mg L-1). The addition of an organic fertilizer (fertiormont) to the soilwas also assessed, in an attempt to reduce THC mobility. Sorption of thiacloprid, a relatively polar pesticide, was similar under all the conditions considered, though an adsorption decrease was observed when DOC concentration increased. The transport of THC through soil columns was retarded with all the treatments, with the lower effects corresponding to TWW and the saline solution. Addition of fertiormont and irrigation with DOC at 3 mg L-1 resulted in a reduction of pesticide leached (34% and 38%, respectively) in comparison with the control (66%), but surprisingly not for DOC at high concentration (55%), possibly due to co-elution of the pesticide with DOC. Therefore the transport of polar compounds, like THC, could be affected by the composition of the irrigation solutions, altering their impact to environmental water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biological effect directed in vivo tests with model organisms are useful in assessing potential health risks associated with chemical contaminations in surface waters. This study examined the applicability of two in vivo test systems viz. plant, Allium cepa root based tests and fish, Oreochromis niloticus erythrocyte based tests for screening cytogenotoxic potential of raw source water, water treatment waste (effluents) and treated water of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) using two DWTPs associated with a major river in Sri Lanka. Measured physico-chemical parameters of the raw water, effluents and treated water samples complied with the respective Sri Lankan standards. In the in vivo tests, raw water induced statistically significant root growth retardation, mitodepression and chromosomal abnormalities in the root meristem of the plant and micronuclei/nuclear buds evolution and genetic damage (as reflected by comet scores) in the erythrocytes of the fish compared to the aged tap water controls signifying greater genotoxicity of the source water especially in the dry period. The effluents provoked relatively high cytogenotoxic effects on both test systems but the toxicity in most cases was considerably reduced to the raw water level with the effluent dilution (1:8). In vivo tests indicated reduction of cytogenotoxic potential in the tested drinking water samples. The results support the potential applications of practically feasible in vivo biological test systems such as A. cepa root based tests and the fish erythrocyte based tests as complementary tools for screening cytogenotoxicity potential of the source water and water treatment waste reaching downstream of aquatic ecosystems and for evaluating cytogenotoxicity eliminating efficacy of the DWTPs in different seasons in view of human and ecological safety.

AB This study investigated organic micropollutant (OMP) biodegradation rates in laboratory-scale soil columns simulating river bank filtration (RBF) processes. The dosed OMP mixture consisted of 11 pharmaceuticals, 6 herbicides, 2 insecticides and 1 solvent. Columns were filled with soil from a RBF site and were fed with four different organic carbon fractions (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, transphilic and river water organic matter (RWOM)). Additionally, the effect of a short-term OMP/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) shock-load (e.g. quadrupling the OMP concentrations and doubling the DOC concentration) on OMP biodegradation rates was investigated to assess the resilience of RBF systems. The results obtained in this study imply that - in contrast to what is observed for managed aquifer recharge systems operating on wastewater effluent - OMP biodegradation rates are not affected by the type of organic carbon fraction fed to the soil column, in case of stable operation. No effect of a short-term DOC shock-load on OMP biodegradation rates between the different organic carbon fractions was observed. This means that the RBF site simulated in this study is resilient towards transient higher DOC concentrations in the river water. However, a temporary OMP shock-load affected OMP biodegradation rates observed for the columns fed with the river water organic matter (RWOM) and the hydrophilic fraction of the river water organic matter. These different biodegradation rates did not correlate with any of the parameters investigated in this study (cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), DOC removal, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), richness/evenness of the soil microbial population or OMP category (hydrophobicity/charge).

AB Carbamazepine an iminostilbene derivative compound with a tricyclic structure is one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of epilepsy. It is hardly or not degraded during the conventional technology used in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (up to 7%) and many studies have found it ubiquitous in various environmental matrices in concentrations typically ranging from mu g L-1 to ng L-1.
   Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 was previously studied for its ability in carbamazepine biodegradation (up to 14%) during cultivation in submerged system under aerobic conditions at an initial CBZ concentration of 0.2 mg L-1. The influence of some factors (independent variables) upon biodegradation potential was examined by Plackett-Burman analysis. Central composite design of experiments (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to get more information about the significant effects and their interactions of the five parameters selected upon their biodegradation potential in order to increase the elimination yield of this drug from a liquid medium. The investigated ranges of the independent variables were: 1.0-3.0 g L-1 yeast extract, 3.0-10.0 g L-1 glucose, 4.0-10.0% (v/v) inoculation level, pH 5.0-7.0 and 50-250 mL of medium at a constant initial concentration of carbamazepine (CBZ) of 0.2 mg L-1. The response surface analysis results showed that the capacity of the selected strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 to degrade carbamazepine was high in submerged cultivation system by cultivation in a liquid medium containing 6.5 g L-1 glucose and 2 g L-1 yeast extract, inoculated at 7% (v/v) and cultivated at pH 6.0, during 7 days of incubation at 25 degrees C and 150 rpm. Under these culture conditions the achieved experimental CBZ biotransformation yield was 30%.

AB The selective degradation of recalcitrant antibiotics into byproducts with low toxicity and high biodegradability has been increasingly popular using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this paper, two Fe-based heterogeneous catalysts, bentonite supported Fe-Ni composite (BNF) and biochar-supported Fe composite (Fe/C), were tailored and comprehensively characterized for distinctive physicochemical properties, crystalline structures, and interfacial behaviors. Two widely used antibiotics, sulfapyridine (SPY) and oxytetracycline (OTCs) at their common concentrations in pharmaceutical wastewaters (250 and 10 mg L-1) were tested for degradation in three PMS-based oxidation processes, i.e., PMS, PMS-BNF, and PMS-Fe/C, respectively. Results demonstrated that a large amount of PMS (10 and 1 mM) could effectively remove SPY (0.385 min(-1), 100% removal) and OTC (2.737 min(-1), 100% removal) via O-1(2) derived from PMS self-decomposition and non-radical pathway, respectively. Additional Fe-based catalysts (0.5 g L-1 Fe/C and BNF) significantly reduced the PMS consumption (1 and 0.25 mM) and accelerated the reaction rate (1.08 and 5.05 min(-1)) of SPY and OTC removal. Moreover, the supplementary catalysts shifted the degradation route. The biochar matrix in Fe/C composite contributed to predominant interaction with PMS forming O-1(2), which preferably attacked SPY via hydroxylation. In contrast, the redox-active Fe-Ni pairs induced SO4 center dot(-) formation, which could selectively degrade OTC through decarboxylation. Thus, these results are conducive to tailoring advanced yet low-cost heterogeneous catalysts for eco-friendly treatment of antibiotics-rich industrial wastewaters.

AB Despite the worldwide presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, a comprehensive picture of their aquatic risk (AR) at the global scale has not yet been produced. Here, we present a procedure to estimate ARs of human pharmaceuticals at a freshwater ecoregion level. First, we predicted country- and year-specific per capita consumption with a regression model. Second, we calculated spatially explicit freshwater concentrations via a combination of mass balance models, addressing the pharmaceutical's fate in respectively humans, wastewater treatment plants and the environment. Finally, we divided the freshwater concentrations at the level of individual freshwater ecoregions with the regulatory limit value derived from toxicity tests to come to an ecoregion-specific AR. We applied our procedure to model time-trends (1995-2015) of ARs of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin, two widely detected and regulatory relevant human use pharmaceuticals. Our analysis of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin showed that ARs, due to exposure to these human pharmaceuticals, typically increased 10-20 fold over the last 20 years. Risks due to carbamazepine exposure were still typically low for the time period assessed (AR < 0.1), although some more densely populated and/or arid ecoregions showed higher ARs (up to 1.1). Risks for ciprofloxacin were found to be much higher with ARs larger than 1 for 223 out of 449 freshwater ecoregions in 2015. Comparison with measured concentrations in ten river basins showed that carbamazepine concentrations were predicted well. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin, measured in four river basins, were, however, generally underestimated by our model with one to two orders of magnitude. We conclude that our procedure provides a good starting point to evaluate ARs of a wide range of human pharmaceuticals at the global scale.

AB In the past few years, anaerobic ammonium oxidation-based processes have attracted a lot of attention for their implementation at the mainstream line of wastewater treatment plants, due to the possibility of leading to energy autarky if combined with anaerobic digestion. However, little is known about the potential degradation of micropollutants by the microbial groups responsible of these processes and the few results available are inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the degradation capability of biomass withdrawn from a combined nitritation/anaerobic ammonium oxidation (combined N/A) pilot plant towards five pharmaceutically active compounds (ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, venlafaxine and carbamazepine). Batch experiments were performed under different conditions by selectively activating or inhibiting different microbial groups: i) regular combined N/A operation, ii) aerobic (optimal for nitrifying bacteria), aerobic with allylthiourea (an inhibitor of ammonia monooxygenase, enzyme of ammonia oxidizing bacteria), iv) anoxic (optimal for anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria), v) aerobic with acetate (optimal for heterotrophic bacteria) and vi) anoxic with acetate (optimal for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria). Ibuprofen was the most biodegradable compound being significantly degraded (49-100%) under any condition except heterotrophic denitrification. Sulfamethoxazole, exhibited the highest removal (70%) under optimal conditions for nitrifying bacteria but in the rest of the experiments anoxic conditions were found to be slightly more favorable (up to 58%). For metoprolol the highest performance was obtained under anoxic conditions favoring anammox bacteria (62%). Finally, carbamazepine and venlafaxine were hardly removed (<= 10% in the majority of cases). Taken together, these results suggest the specificity of different microbial groups that in combination with alternating operational parameters can lead to enhanced removal of some micropollutants.

AB This study investigated the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions supported on chemically treated fly ash. The coal fly ash was supplied by the electric power station in Krakow, Poland. There are plenty of studies showing the utilization of fly ash as a low-cost adsorbent for wastewater containing heavy metals or dyes. Adsorption and immobilization of pharmaceuticals and personal care products on fly ash is a relatively new method but it is a very promising one. In this study, the adsorptive removal of diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, bezafibrate, bisphenol A, 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol by HCl- and NaOH-treated fly ash was assessed. Chemical treatment of fly ash changed structures of particles and enhanced specific surface areas. HCl-treated fly ash was characterized by the highest BET specific surface area 47.9 m(2) g(-1) and unburned carbon content 8.1%. Isotherms for all compounds except for 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and estriol (E3) were linear. Higher linear regression coefficients (R (2)) obtained for isotherms of EE2 and E3 show that the Freundlich model better describes their sorption. Adsorption coefficients K (d) varied between 109.5 (L kg(-1)) for bisphenol A and 471.5 (L kg(-1)) for bezafibrate. Freundlich constants (K (F)) for EE2 and E3 were 62.3 and 119.9 (A mu g(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1)), respectively. Acid treatment of fly ash increased adsorption of diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, bezafibrate and bisphenol A. Comparison of the octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K (OW)) with the partitioning coefficients normalized on unburned carbon content (log K (UC)) revealed similarities but no strong correlation. The increasing of unburned carbon increased sorption of compounds to fly ash.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of numerous pharmaceuticals found in treated municipal wastewater discharged to the environment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term (96 h) waterborne FIX exposure (1 mu g/L or 100 mu g/L) on the expression of selected genes in brain, liver, and gonads of female Murray-Darling rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis), a small-bodied teleost of ecotoxicological relevance in the Australasia region. Plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels were also determined. In the brain, no significant changes in mRNA levels were observed for the selected genes. In ovaries, 100 mu g/L FLX caused a 10-fold downregulation of aromatase A (cyp19a1a) mRNA and a 4-fold upregulation of estrogen receptor alpha(esr1) mRNA levels. In liver, mRNA levels for vitellogenin A (vtga) and choriogenin L (chgl) were downregulated by 50-fold and 18-fold compared with controls, respectively, in response to 100 mu g/L FLX. Concentrations of E2 in plasma were significantly lower than controls in response to 100 mu g/L FLX. This could be attributable to a decrease in estrogen biosynthesis as a result of the observed downregulation of cyp19a1a mRNA. To establish whether the observed changes in gene expression could be explained by the modulation of selected nuclear receptors by FLX, we employed panel of reporter gene assays in agonistic and antagonistic modes. Apart from minor activation of ER alpha after exposure to high concentrations (5 mu M), FLX did not activate or inhibit the nuclear receptors tested. Further study is required to determine whether the observed downregulation of ovarian aromatase expression and liver estrogen regulated genes also occurs at environmentally relevant FLX concentrations over longer exposure periods.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) has been detected in significant amounts in municipal treated wastewater effluent. Diverse studies report that trace concentrations of DCF may induce toxic effects on different aquatic organisms as well as developmental, reproductive and renal damage. This study aimed to determine whether short and long-term exposure to DCF alter the oxidative stress (OS) status in blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver of common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of DCF at 96 h (96-h LC50) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed (short and long-term) to the latter value for different exposure times (4 and 24 days) and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxides content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Also, the DCF was determined by LC-MS/MS. Significant increases in HPC, LPX and PCC were observed respect to control (P<0.05) particularly in blood, muscle, gill, brain and liver. SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased in these organs, with respect to controls (P<0.05). DCF concentrations decreased and increased in water system and carp, respectively. Cyprinus carpio exposed to DCF was affected in OS status during the initial days of the study (at 4 days), exhibiting an increased response at 24 days in blood and liver. In contrast, a decrease was observed in muscle, gills and brain at 24 days with respect to 4 days. In conclusion, DCF induces OS on blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver in the carp C. carpio in short and long-term exposure. The biomarkers employed in this study are useful in the assessment of the environmental impact of this agent on aquatic species.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a worldwide-applied antibacterial drug, was recently found in surface waters and in secondary wastewater effluents, which may result in ecotoxical effects in the environment. Herein, removal of SMX by environmentally-friendly oxidant, potassium ferrate(VI) (K2FeO4), is sought by studying the kinetics of the reaction between Fe(VI) and SMX as a function of pH (6.93-9.50) and temperature (15-45 degrees C). The rate law for the oxidation of SMX by Fe(VI) is first-order with respect to each reactant. The observed second-order rate constant decreased non-linearly from 1.33 +/- 0.08 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) to 1.33 +/- 0.10 x 10(0) M-1 s(-1) with an increase of pH from 7.00 to 9.50. This is related to protonation of Fe(VI) (HFeO4- double left right arrow H+ + FeO42-; pK(a,HFeO4) = 7.23) and sulfamethoxazole (SH double left right arrow H+ + S-; pK(a,SH) = 5.7). The estimated rate constants were k(11) (HFeO4- + SH) = 3.0 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1), k(12) (HFeO4- + S-) = 1.7 x 10(2) M-1 (FeO42- + SH) = 1.2 x 10(0) M-1 s(-1). The energy of activation at pH 7.0 was found to be 1.86 +/- 0.04 kJ mol(-1). If excess potassium ferrate(VI) concentration (10 mu M) is used than the SMX in water, the half-life of the reaction using a rate constant obtained in our study would be approximately 2 min at pH 7. The reaction rates are pH dependent; thus, so are the half-lives of the reactions. The results suggest that K2FeO4 has the potential to serve as an oxidative treatment chemical for removing SMX in water. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) are even more important in bacterial resistance, even at low concentrations. The aim of this research was to synthesize CuFe2O4@methylcellulose (MC) as a new nano-photocatalyst for degradation of CIP from aqueous solution.
   Methods: The nano-photocatalyst (CuFe2O4@MC) was characterized by FESEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Powder XRD and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of pure-phase spinel ferrites. After CuFe2O4@MC characterization, the effective parameters in removal efficiency of CIP such as reaction time, initial antibiotic concentration, pH, photocatalyst loading, and degradation kinetic were investigated and conditions were optimized. Then, CIP degradation experiments were conducted on the real sample in the optimal conditions. The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined under optimum conditions.
   Results: The structural characterization of the magnetic nanobiocomposite showed that it is in nanoscale, ferromagnetic property, and thermal stability. The optimal conditions were obtained at pH = 7, irradiation time (90 minutes), photocatalyst loading (0.2 g), and initial concentration of CIP (3 mg/L). The removal efficiency of CIP in the optimal conditions was obtained as 80.74% and 72.87% from the synthetic and real samples, respectively. The removal of COD was obtained as 68.26% in this process. The evaluation of kinetic linear models showed that the photocatalytic degradation process was fitted by pseudo-first order kinetic model and Langmuir-Hinshelwood. CuFe2O4@MC photocatalyst had a good stability and reusability for the fourth runs.
   Conclusion: The photocatalytic degradation of CIP from aqueous media with CuFe2O4@MC photocatalyst has a high efficiency, which can be used in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters.

AB The removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by fouled nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has been extensively studied. Investigations on the effects of PhACs on organic fouling or biofouling in the NF/RO membrane application are still lacking. In this study, NF/RO membranes were fed with both synthetic (SRNOM solution and synthetic wastewater containing pure culture inoculum) and real (secondary effluent) water matrices spiked with three PhACs to elucidate the impact of PhACs on membrane fouling in comparison with control experiments in the absence of PhACs. Results showed that the PhACs mitigated flux decline during NF/RO filtration of SRNOM solution. The total organic foulants on both membrane surfaces decreased in the presence of PhACs due to the increased negative charges of the membranes and the enhanced size and charge effects of PhAC-macromolecule complexes in SRNOM solution. PhACs appeared to inhibit cell growth in the early stages of biofouling, causing a decline in total biomass, and then induced cell lysis, releasing EPS to protect from chemical stress in the later stages of biofouling, especially protein-like materials, causing more severe biofouling. The alleviation of declines in flux and salt rejection during the filtration of secondary effluent were found in the presence of PhACs. Therefore, we hypothesized that organic fouling or early-stage biofouling occurred during 100 h of filtration of secondary effluent. The decrease in PhAC retention was more obvious due to the higher ionic strength in the secondary effluent. This study may aid understanding of PhAC removal from various matrices and the effects of PhAC mixtures on membrane fouling by in practical NF/RO membranes applications.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a class of emerging environmental contaminants. They are manufactured to be biologically active and to be persistent against biodegradation. This makes them more risky for the environment, as they can have negative impact on living organisms. However, still there are many problems in reliable analysis of these compounds due to low amounts and complexity of the environmental samples. The technique widely used for this purpose is liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. One of the main drawbacks of this technique is the change in ionization efficiency-phenomenon known as the matrix effect. Matrix effects heavily influence both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Therefore, it also has impact on the quality of the obtained results. Thus the main aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of six different aqueous environmental matrices on the solid-phase extraction efficiency and the final determination of twelve selected sulfonamides by LC-MS/MS technique. The obtained results showed that both were strongly affected by the matrix composition. The more complicated the matrix was, the greater influence was observed (matrix effects in tap water were in the range from 8.77 to -16.49 % and in waste-water influents from -63.67 to -97.43 %). Extraction efficiency of selected drugs decreased from 94.9 to 41.5 % for tap water samples to from 31.6 to 0 % for wastewater influents. Thus, it is of high significance to use an approach to correct effects caused by matrix components. The proper calculation of the real concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the environment is required for determining the consequent risk to living organisms.

AB Quantification of organic and microbial pollutant loading is expensive and labor-intensive because collection and analysis of grab samples are needed. Instruments are available, however, for in situ analysis of basic water quality parameters at high temporal resolution. Throughout the late summer and fall of 2008 a two-node water quality monitoring network was deployed to measure turbidity, specific conductance, pH, depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate at high frequencies in two urban streams in the Minneapolis, MN metropolitan area. Grab samples also were collected at 2 h intervals for 22 h during two dry periods and five rain events and analyzed for organic and microbial pollutants. This study investigated the viability of using in situ near real-time sensors to predict fecal coliforms, prometon (a residential herbicide), atrazine (an agricultural herbicide), and caffeine (it wastewater indicator) concentrations. Such Pollutants can be used as indicators of sources that contribute to what is often termed "urban stream syndrome." At one stream, linear correlations were observed between nitrate and caffeine (R-2 = 0.66), turbidity and prometon (R-2 = 0.91), and discharge and prometon (R-2 = 0.92). At another location, caffeine linearly correlated with specific conductance (R-2 = 0.64). A lack of correlation with sensed water quality parameters was also observed with some of the pollutants. When one considers that error is estimated to be as high as 200% when using monthly grab samples to estimate pollutant loading in streams, even moderate correlations, such as the ones found in this study, can provide better loading estimates if frequently sensed parameters can be used for load estimation. Therefore, such site-specific relationships can be used to estimate the loading of specific pollutants in near real-time until robust low-cost technologies to analyze these pollutants in situ become available.

AB Eight samples were obtained to characterize the chemical loads in water recycled for reuse applications. The sources included stormwater, rooftop runoff, wastewater, mixed water, and drinking water as a comparison. The water was reused for irrigation, cleaning, toilet flushing, and cooling purposes. Large-volume injection (650 mu L) high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry were employed to separate and detect features by suspect and non-target screening. The instrumental method had the advantage that no sample extractions were required prior to analysis. Two chromatographic methods were developed to separate positive- and negativ-ionizing compounds and retention time models were developed for both. Retention time models provide an additional measure of confidence for probable and tentative identifications. The two models had predictive R-2-which indicates how well the models predicts new observations-of 0.87. After data-reduction, the number of features detected in the samples ranged from 304 to 1513. Feature metrics such as the average response-per-feature provided a simple method to characterize similarities and differences between samples. Additionally, a statistical comparison was performed by principal component analysis. Of the 97 suspect-screening compounds, 20 were positively identified. Benzotriazole/benzothiazole-derivatives and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances were the most frequently detectedcompounds during suspect screening. Other compounds detected included pharmaceuticals, drug metabolites, and sucralose. Features were prioritized for non-target analysis based on in-house library matches, magnitude of response, and frequency of occurrence. Fifty-five unique compounds were positively identified via non-target analysis. The identified compounds included 17 pharmaceuticals, 17 pesticides, 13 industrial compounds, four personal-use compounds, and four biological compounds. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants are a major pathway for pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment. Many pharmaceuticals, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are chiral chemicals and the biological activity of their enantiomers can differ. Few studies have assessed the effects of different NSAID enantiomers on non-target organisms. However, this information is important for environmental risk assessment to ensure that the effects of more potent enantiomers are not overlooked. In the current study, enantiomers of naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and flurbiprofen were evaluated in bioassays with bacteria, algae and fish cells. All enantiomers induced bacterial toxicity, with (R)-naproxen more toxic than (S)-naproxen (EC50 0.75 vs 0.93 mg/L) and (S)-flurbiprofen more toxic than (R)-flurbiprofen (EC50 1.22 vs 2.13 mg/L). Both (R)-flurbiprofen and (S)-flurbiprofen induced photosystem II inhibition in green algae, with (R)-flurbiprofen having a greater effect in the assay after 24 h (EC10 5.47 vs 9.07 mg/L). Only the (R)-enantiomers of flurbiprofen and ketoprofen induced ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in fish cells, while (S)-naproxen was 2.5 times more active than (R)-naproxen in the EROD assay. While enantiospecific differences were observed for all assays, the difference was less than an order of magnitude. This indicates that the risk of overlooking the effect of more potent NSAID enantiomers is minor for the studied test systems and supports the use of racemic (or single enantiomer) effect data for environmental risk assessment. However, further investigation of the (R)-enantiomer of commonly used NSAID ketoprofen is recommended as it was at least six times more potent in the EROD assay than the inactive (S)-ketoprofen.

AB The development of technologies capable of eliminating a wide spectrum of micropollutants of diverse nature from waters becomes essential. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) seem to be the most promising technologies but the most appropriate AOP to remove the micropollutants is still under debate. In this study, for the first time, the comparison of the efficiency of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis and iron-impregnated faujasite heterogeneous photo-Fenton process is conducted towards the removal of a mixture of 21 micropollutants from a real river at low concentrations. The sampling area is situated on the Meurthe River, downstream the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Nancy in the northeast of France. To assess the impact of the micropollutants concentration and the matrix composition, two sampling campaigns have been performed at different periods of the year. Among the targeted micropollutants, 14 pharmaceuticals, 1 personal care product, 4 endocrine disruptors and 2 perfluorinated molecules are specifically followed.Their concentrations range from few ng L-1 to hundreds ng L-1. The adsorption of all the micropollutants is higher onto the iron-impregnated faujasite compared to that onto TiO2 due to the larger surface area of the iron-impregnated faujasite. The iron-impregnated faujasite offers superior photo-Fenton oxidation efficiency towards the degradation of the micropollutants over the TiO2 photocatalysis system. For almost all the micropollutants, the contaminants are totally removed after 30 min by photo-Fenton while a longer period is necessary by photocatalysis. A relationship between the removal efficiencies and the octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of each micropollutant has been extracted from the data. A further economic evaluation confirms that the photo-Fenton process is also the better in terms of cost.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an eco-friendly and cost-effective technology to remove organic micro pollutants (OMPs) from wastewater. The support matrix is an important component in CWs as it has a primary role in the growth and development of plants and microbes. However, the roles of the support matrix in CWs in removing OMPs have not been systematically studied. Therefore, in this study, six common materials (sand, zeolite, blast iron slag, petcoke, polonite and crushed autoclaved aerated concrete (CAAC)) as support matrixes were firstly investigated by batch tests to explore their adsorption capacities to selected OMPs (ibuprofen, iohexol, tebuconazole and imazalil). Results showed that the adsorption capacities of the materials were low (at the level of mu g/g) compared to well-known sorbents (at the level of mg/g), such as activated carbon and carbon nanotubes. Columns packed with the six materials, respectively, were then built up to study the effects of different materials on microbial community. In the medium-term study (66 days), the removal of four OMP5 in all the columns increased by 2-58% from day 25 to day 66, and was mainly attributed to microbial degradation. Furthermore, Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis indicates that material presence shaped the microbial community metabolic function not only in the interstitial water but also in the biofilm. Overall, all the findings demonstrate that although the adsorption capacities of the common materials are low, they may be a driver to improve the removal of OMPs by altering microbial community function in CWs.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment has been considered an emerging concern. Diclofenac has the highest acute toxicity among the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and it has been frequently detected in surface waters and wastewater treatment plants. Adsorption has been widely used to remove emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds from water sources and wastewaters. In this work, diclofenac adsorption was studied using activated carbon as adsorbent in batch process and fixed-bed column. Adsorption isotherms were determined through batch adsorption experiments, while fixed-bed adsorption was evaluated through a full factorial two-level experimental design involving three variables: initial pollutant concentration (20 - 100 mg L-1), weight of adsorbent (0.5 - 1.0 g) and volumetric feed flow rate (3 - 5 mL min(-1)). Adsorption equilibrium was investigated in different temperatures revealed that the Freundlich equation is suitable to describe the isotherms behavior in 298, 308 and 318 K. Thermodynamic analysis revealed negative Delta G(0) and both positive Delta H-0 and Delta S-0, which indicated that diclofenac adsorption onto activated carbon is higher at higher temperatures and it is a spontaneous process. Breakthrough time, the time when 5% of initial concentration is detected in the effluent, was at higher initial concentration and lower flow rate. Fractional bed utilization increased with the increase of the initial concentration and flow rate, but decreased with higher amount of activated carbon. Breakthrough curves experimental data were fitted using Thomas, Bohart-Adams and Yan analytical models. Yan model showed the highest average of the determination coefficients (R-2 = 0.9842) of all experiments while the amounts adsorbed by the packed column were better predicted by Thomas equation.

AB In this study, the aim was to evaluate the adsorption capacity of a volcanic rock commonly used in Mexico as filter medium in constructed wetlands (locally named tezontle) for carbamazepine (CBZ) adsorption, as well as to analyze the change in its capacity with biofilm growth. Adsorption essays were carried out under batch conditions by evaluating two particle sizes of tezontle, two values of the solution pH, and two temperatures; from these essays, optimal conditions for carbamazepine adsorption were obtained. The optimal conditions (pH 8, 25 degrees C and 0.85-2.0 mm particle-size) were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity of tezontle with biofilm, which was promoted through tezontle exposition to wastewater in glass columns, for six months. The maximum adsorption capacity of clean tezontle was 3.48 mu g/g; while for the tezontle with biofilm, the minimum value was 1.75 mu g/g (after the second week) and the maximum, was 3.3 mu g/g (after six months) with a clear tendency of increasing over time. The adsorption kinetic was fitted to a pseudo-second model for both tezontle without biofilm and with biofilm, thus indicating a chemisorption process. On clean tezontle, both acid active sites (AAS) and basic active sites (BAS) were found in 0.087 and 0.147 meq/g, respectively. The increase in the adsorption capacity of tezontle with biofilm, along the time was correlated with a higher concentration of BAS, presumably from a greater development of biofilm. The presence of biofilm onto tezontle surface was confirmed through FTIR and FE-SEM. These results confirm the essential role of filter media for pharmaceutical removal in constructed wetlands (CWs).

AB Contamination of aquatic systems by synthetic organic contaminants and emerging pollutants poses significant public and environmental health risks in developing countries. These contaminants mainly originate from textile, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The removal of such contaminants is problematic in developing countries because advanced water treatment methods are still lacking in developing countries due to their high costs. The application of biosorption for removal of organic contaminants in developing countries is attractive for three reasons; (1) large quantities of biomaterials for use as biosorbents are readily available; (2) lack of advanced water and wastewater treatment systems for removal of organic contaminants; and (3) the technology is relatively cheap compared to advanced methods (e.g. membrane filtration) often used in developed countries. Overall, this has the potential to remove organic contaminants from aqueous systems while simultaneously reducing the public health and environmental impacts associated with the disposal of such biowastes. However, large-scale application of biosorption faces potential challenges including lack of funding, poor mechanical properties of biosorbants, complex adsorption mechanisms involved, and poor regeneration capacity. In addition, spent biosorbents present an environmental risk and their disposal is problematic due to the potential of contaminating surface and ground water. Possible disposal methods for spent biosorbent include use as a filler in road surfacing, as a soil amendment, and in phytoremediation cells where the organics are absorbed and broken down by plants. Overall, biosorption is a potentially viable alternative, but further research on its ability to remove pollutants from multi-component systems, its regeneration capacity, and plant design parameters is required before the benefits of the technology are realised in developing countries.

AB A new yeast strain isolated from the pharmaceutical wastewater was capable of utilizing cefdinir as a sole carbon source for their growth in mineral medium. The yeast was identified and named as Candida sp. SMN04 based on morphology and 18S-ITS-D1/D2/D3 rRNA sequence analysis. The interaction between factors pH (3.0-9.0), inoculum dosage (1-7%), time (1-11 day) and cefdinir concentration (50-450mg/L) was studied using a Box-Behnken design. The factors were studied as a result of their effect on cell dry weight (R1; g/L), extended spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) assay (R2; mm), P450 activity (R3; U/mL) and degradation (R4; %). Maximum values of R1, R2, R3 and R4 were obtained at central values of all the parameters. The isolated yeast strain efficiently degraded 84% of 250mgL(-1) of cefdinir within 6 days with a half-life of 2.97 days and degradation rate constant of 0.2335 per day. Pseudo-first-order model efficiently described the process. Among the various enzymes tested, the order of activity at the end of Day 4 was noted to be: cytochrome P450 (1.76 +/- 0.03)>NADPH reductase (1.51 +/- 0.20)>manganese peroxidase and amylase (0.66 +/- 0.15; 0.66 +/- 0.70). Intermediates were successfully characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The opening of the -lactam ring involving ESBL activity was considered as one of the major steps in the cefdinir degradation process. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis showed the absence of spectral vibrations between 1766 and 1519cm(-1) confirming the complete removal of lactam ring during cefdinir degradation. The results of the present study are promising for the use of isolated yeast Candida sp. SMN04 as a potential bioremediation agent.

The most significant classes include crude oil and its many derivatives, halogenated hydrocarbons, pesticides, and personal care and pharmaceutical products. Although some of these compounds are easily degradable, others require specific conditions for significant degradability; this is usually enhanced by microbes and other biota that can biodegrade them. Many of the compounds enter the aqueous environment via nonpoint sources (e.g., agricultural or urban storm water runoff), but a number of them are discharged from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants, which were not designed to deal with the ever-increasing diversity of organic compounds that pass through their treatment units. These discharges may be either directly to the estuaries or to coastal areas; but, in many cases, the discharge is into freshwater bodies (e.g., rivers and lakes) that then discharge into the ocean margins. The toxicity of some of these compounds has been known for decades; however, in other cases, it has taken considerable effort, both on the analytical side and on the toxicological assays, to determine that even at extremely low concentrations these compounds will cause harm. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the major classes of biodegradable organic compounds that may be discharged into estuaries and coastal water from a variety of sources. We then consider the key processes and compound properties that determine their mobility, bioavailability, persistence, and fate in the estuarine environment. We conclude with an assessment of the biotic and habitat impacts that can result from these biodegradable organic compounds.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are a group of anthropogenic organic pollutants known to have a host of adverse environmental and health implications. The removal of such pollutants from aqueous environments to ensure water is of a quality fit for reuse is therefore highly important and gaining considerable interest. Whilst there are multiple approaches used for EC remediation from water matrices, sorption using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has been reported as a suitable technique. LDHs are interesting clay-like materials with numerous properties which lend LDHs to being suitable sorbent materials. Such properties include low toxicity, anion exchange capacity and tuneable structures through possible variations in metals, anions and preparation techniques. To design a successful sorbent material, it is important to fully understand the materials structureproperty-function relationship. However, in the application of LDHs as sorbent materials for the removal of organic pollutants, this relationship is not well understood. Hence the ability to design bespoke high-performing LDH sorbent material is currently limited.
   This review considers the impact of structure and related physiochemical properties of LDHs on their sorption capacity for the removal of organic pollutants from water matrices. Methyl Orange (MO) is first considered as a model pollutant, with the importance of the characteristics of the metal layers, interlayer anions and resulting textual properties of LDHs on reported sorption capacity observed. A comparison is then made between the findings from the MO case study and for the sorption of other organic pollutants using LDHs, with a particular focus on pharmaceuticals. Finally, the role of environmental conditions and considerations linked to possible commercial applications are discussed, with recommendations made for future work.

AB Transition metal catalyzed sulfite auto-oxidation is a promising technology used in water and wastewater treatment for the elimination of contaminants. In the literature, this process has been reported to be efficient only in the presence of oxygen. However, in this study, we unexpectedly found that the degradation of diatrizoate (DTZ) by a system based on the combination of copper ion and sulfite (Cu(II)/S(IV)) reached over 95% under anaerobic conditions, but was considerably retarded under aerobic conditions at pH 7. Furthermore, it was found that Cu(I), generated from the cleavage of the CuSO3 complex, was the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of DTZ by the Cu(II)/S(IV) system under anaerobic conditions. In fact, the absence of oxygen promoted the accumulation of Cu(I). The concomitant release of the iodide ion with the degradation of DTZ indicated that the anaerobic degradation of DTZ by the Cu(II)/S(IV) system mainly proceeded through the deiodination pathway, which was also confirmed by the detection of deiodinated products. The anaerobic degradation of DTZ was favored at higher initial concentrations of Cu(II) or sulfite in this system. Since the CuSO3 complex, the precursor of Cu(I), was formed mainly at pH 7, the highest anaerobic degradation of DTZ was achieved at pH 7. An increase in reaction temperature considerably enhanced the degradation of DTZ by the Cu(II)/S(IV) system with an apparent activation energy of 119.4 kJ/mol. The presence of chloride, bicarbonate and humic acid slightly influenced the anaerobic degradation of DTZ. The experiments with real water samples also demonstrated the effectiveness of the degradation of DTZ by the Cu(II)/S(IV) system under anaerobic conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Assessment of ecological risks of chemicals in the field usually involves complex mixtures of known and unknown compounds. We describe the use of pathway-based chemical and biological approaches to assess the risk of chemical mixtures in the Maumee River (OH, USA), which receives a variety of agricultural and urban inputs. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were deployed in cages for 4 d at a gradient of sites along the river and adjoining tributaries in 2012 and during 2 periods (April and June) in 2016, in conjunction with an automated system to collect composite water samples. More than 100 industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides were detected in water at some of the study sites, with the greatest number typically found near domestic wastewater treatment plants. In 2016, there was an increase in concentrations of several herbicides from April to June at upstream agricultural sites. A comparison of chemical concentrations in site water with single chemical data from vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays suggested the potential for perturbation of multiple biological pathways, including several associated with induction or inhibition of different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. This was consistent with direct effects of water extracts in an HTS assay and induction of hepatic CYPs in caged fish. Targeted in vitro assays and measurements in the caged fish suggested minimal effects on endocrine function (e.g., estrogenicity). A nontargeted mass spectroscopy-based analysis suggested that hepatic endogenous metabolite profiles in caged fish covaried strongly with the occurrence of pesticides and pesticide degradates. These studies demonstrate the application of an integrated suite of measurements to help understand the effects of complex chemical mixtures in the field. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-25.

AB With enhanced stringent rules for effluent discharges, industries are under pressure and are continuously in search of effective treatment technologies. In this process, a lot of research and development followed by pilot-scale studies are in a continuous process to achieve the treatment of required standards by researchers around the world. These efforts have presented that integrating biological and advanced physical treatment processes provides a viable solution for many industries, among which the pharmaceutical industry in one. Membrane separation processes eliminate all these techniques through selectively permeable barriers retaining a wide range of particulate and dissolved compounds while allowing passage of water and reverse osmosis (RO) that has been run proved to be effective in removing most of the parameters. Further biological treatment techniques like sequencing batch reactor (SBR) as pre-treatment for RO have proved to be viable solutions. In these lines, any industries are nowadays oriented towards recycling of treated water in the premises under mandatory zero liquid discharge (ZLD) as per the regulations. The present chapter focusses on evaluating SBR and RO treatments with SBR as pre-treatment for RO on large-scale for 3 y. Results from the studies we found that SBR-RO to be a viable and proficient combination for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Hence, this combination was evaluated on a full scale for 3 y duration. The highest removal of total dissolved solids achieved was 98.74%, Maximum reduction of chemical oxygen demand obtained was 98.96, and Removal of ammonia was utmost with 89.57%. From the present study, it can be concluded that the treatment process has proved to be an effective treatment that has achieved ZLD.

AB BACKGROUND The pharmaceutical residues in water are considered globally to be typical hazardous pollutants. Many technologies have been reported to eliminate these residues, such as photocatalysis, which has usually been applied in a suspension system with powdery photocatalyst. The disadvantage of this system, hindering its practical application, is its low recyclability. Ferrite-based photocatalysts have been synthesized to resolve this problem. In this work, silver (Ag)-modified zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanoparticles were immobilized onto porous mineral diatomite. The physicochemical properties of this composite were studied systematically, and its photocatalytic efficiency was investigated via the degradation of antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) and disinfection of bacteria Escherichia coli under visible light. RESULTS The degradation rate increased after the catalyst was immobilized onto diatomite, due to the adsorption and degradation synergistic effect. The Ag cluster improved the visible-light-driven photoactivity of ZnFe2O4, and its optimal percentage was determined. The best catalyst dosage during the degradation process also was obtained. The optimal catalyst exhibited its removal rate of OTC (10 mg L-1 aqueous solution) as 90.5% in 2.5 h, and disinfection rate of E. coli as 87.2% in 2 h, under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the photocatalysis mechanism was illustrated. CONCLUSION This composite could be recovered simply from the water body via an external magnet, and indicated no obvious decrease of photoactivity after being recycled five times for photodegradation or photodisinfection tests. This nanocomposite showed good potential for application in wastewater remediation process, thanks to its high photocatalytic efficiency under visible light, as well as its good reusability and stability.

AB Infiltration of treated wastewater (IWW) to recharge depleted aquifers, often referred to as managed aquifer recharge, is a solution to replenish groundwater resources in regions facing water scarcity. We present a mass balance approach to infer the amounts of five pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen) degraded in column experiments based on concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous and solid (sorbed) phases. Column experiments were conducted under three different conditions: continuous infiltration, wetting and drying cycles, and wetting and drying cycles with elevated concentrations of antibiotics (which may reduce microbially aided degradation of other compounds). A mass balance comparing pharmaceutical mass in the water phase over the 16-month duration of the experiments to mass sorbed to the soil was used to infer the mass of pharmaceuticals degraded. Results show sorption as the main attenuation mechanism for carbamazepine. About half of the mass of didofenac was degraded with wetting and drying cycles, but no significant degradation was found for continuous infiltration, while 32% of infiltrated mass sorbed. Fenoprofen was degraded in the shallow and aerobic part of the soil, but degradation appeared to cease beyond 27 cm depth. Gemfibrozil attenuated through a combination of degradation and sorption, with slight increases in attenuation with depth from both mechanisms. Naproxen degraded progressively with depth, resulting in attenuation of >90% of the mass. In the column with elevated concentrations of antibiotics, the antibiotics attenuated to about 50% or less of inflow concentrations by 27 an depth and within this zone, less degradation of the other compounds was observed.

AB The incomplete elimination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) during wastewater treatment has resulted in their detection in the environment. PPCP biodegradation is a potential removal mechanism; however, the microorganisms and pathways involved in soils are generally unknown. Here, the biodegradation of diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ) and triclocarban (TCC) in four agricultural soils at concentrations typically detected in soils and biosolids (50 ng g(-1)) was examined. Rapid DCF removal (<7 days) was observed under aerobic conditions, but only limited biodegradation was noted under other redox conditions. CBZ and TCC degradation under aerobic conditions was slow (half-lives of 128-241 days and 165-190 days for CBZ and TCC). Phylotypes in the Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadales and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant during DCF biodegradation compared to the controls (no DCF). For CBZ, those in the Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were enriched compared to the controls. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were also enriched during TCC biodegradation. Such differences could indicate these microorganisms are associated with the biodegradation of these compounds, as they appear to be benefiting from their removal. The impact of these PPCPs on the KEGG pathways associated with metabolism was also examined. Four pathways were positively impacted during DCF biodegradation (propanoate, lysine, fatty acid & benzoate metabolism). These pathways are likely common in soils, explaining the rapid removal of DCF. There was limited impact of CBZ on the metabolic pathways. TCC removal was linked to genes associated with the degradation of simple and complex substrates. The results indicate even low concentrations of PPCPs significantly affect soil communities. The recalcitrant nature of TCC and CBZ suggests soils receiving biosolids could accumulate these chemicals, representing risks concerning crop uptake. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal wastewaters are recognized as a major source of pharmaceutical and personal care products to the aquatic environment, thereby exposing biota to unknown chronic effects. This study sought to examine the immunotoxic effects of pharmaceutical and urban waste products on the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Hemolymph samples were collected and treated in vitro with increasing concentrations of various drugs (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, morphine, naproxen, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazole, sulfapyridine and trimethoprim) and urban waste related chemicals (coprostanol, caffeine, cotinine) for 24 h at 15 degrees C. In a parallel experiment, mussels were caged and placed in two final aeration lagoons for the treatment of domestic wastewaters. At the end of the exposure period, hemolymphs were tested for phagocytic activity, intracellular esterase activity, cell adherence and lipid peroxidation (LPO). The products that most increased phagocytosis were bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and trimethoprim, while novobiocin and morphine reduced its activity. Intracellular esterase activity was reduced most strongly with sulfamethazole, novobiocin, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate and carbamazepine. Cell adherence was decreased by oxytetracycline, novobiocin and naproxen, and increased by gemfibrozil, bezafibrate and sulfapyridine. Exposure to these products also modulated LPO in hemocytes. Coprostanol and naproxen were more potent to reduce LPO while novobiocin and sulfapyridine were the most potent to induce LPO. The potential to induce LPO was positively correlated with the number of functional groups on the molecule (i.e., its nucleophilicity). Mussels exposed to domestic wastewater treatment plant aeration lagoons had decreased intracellular esterase and phagocytic activity as well, suggesting immunosuppression. PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) that are recognized to disrupt cytokine signalling network by the nitric oxide pathway and cell permeability were generally the most potent ones. The data suggest that PPCPs have the potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system of bivalves. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is an increased awareness that medicinal products for human use may cause negative effects in the environment. In Sweden a voluntary environmental classification system for drugs has been established in collaboration between producers, authorities and the public health care, and used for five years. The idea is to enhance the market demand for medicines with less environmental impact, which in turn will stimulate the producers to design future medicines to be more environmentally friendly. The system is open to the public and based on assessment of the active ingredient in the medicinal product into several classes of risk and hazard, respectively. It is closely related to the EMEA guidelines. Risk is expressed as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of the active ingredient (Al) and its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). The hazard is expressed in terms of the Al's persistence, potential to bioaccumulation, and eco-toxicity. Drug data for the classification are delivered by the respective producers.
   Hitherto more than 300 Al representing more than 50% of the Swedish volume of drug use, have been classified. Data for risk assessment were missing in 47% of Al. Among drugs with data 7% had a PEC/PNEC ratio >1, and another 7% had a ratio between 0.1 and 1. The Als with highest ratio (> 10) were two estrogens. Data for hazard assessment were lacking in 16% of the Al. Among drugs with environmental data 92% were not ready biodegradable, 23% had potential to bioaccumulation, and 61% were toxic to aquatic organisms at a concentration below 1 mg/l. These data are utilized by regional pharmaceutical expert groups when selecting substances to be recommended in public health care in Sweden. They may also be used by prescribing doctors who want to identify the environmentally most favourable substance among several with equivalent medical effect.
   We conclude that environmental data on human medicinal products are often missing, or reveal unfavourable environmental properties. A proper judgement of the environmental impact of an Al requires a joint evaluation of its risk and hazard. We suggest that the pharmaceutical producers should highlight environmental precaution when designing new Als, and that the environmental data should be transparent to the general public.

AB Parabens, the alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid such as methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), butylparaben (BuP) are used as a preservative in food, personal care products (PCPs), and pharmaceuticals, due to their antimicrobial properties. Parabens are continuously released into the environment, during washout of PCPs, disposal of industrial waste from the pharmaceutical and paper industries. Parabens have been detected in the indoor dust, wastewater stream, surface water of rivers, and the marine system. Recent eco-toxicological data and the environmental presence of parabens, has raised concerns regarding the safety and health of environment/humans. Thus, to further understand the toxicity of parabens, the present study was carried out in the soil nematode and well established biological model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study, LC50 of MeP, EtP, PrP and BuP for 72 h exposures from L1 larva to adult stage was found to be 278.1, 217.8,169.2, and 131.88 mu g/ml, respectively. Further exposure to 1/5th of LC50 of parabens yielded an internal concentration ranging from 1.67 to 2.83 mu g/g dry weight of the organism. The toxicity of parabens on the survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction of the C. elegans was found in the order of BuP > PrP > EtP > MeP. Worms exposed to parabens show significant down-regulation of vitellogenin genes, high levels of reactive oxygen species and anti-oxidant transcripts, the latter being concordant with nuclear localization of DAF- 16 and up-regulation of HSF-1 and SKN-1/Nrf. Hence, parabens caused endocrine disruption, oxidative stress and toxicity in C elegans at environment relevant internal concentration of parabens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although several studies confirmed a wide distribution of pharmaceuticals in rivers and streams, a limited knowledge is available about the partitioning of pharmaceuticals between the water phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM). To close this gap of knowledge, we developed and validated a sensitive and high throughput analytical method for the analysis of 57 pharmaceuticals, 42 metabolites and transformation products (TP) as well as the artificial sweetener acesulfame sorbed to SPM. The method was based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by a clean-up via solvent exchange and detection via direct injection-reversed phase LC-MS/MS and freeze-drying-HILIC-MS/MS. Freundlich isotherms were determined for 90 analytes. All showed a linear sorption behavior. Distribution coefficients (K-d) ranged from 0.64 L/kg to 9300 L/kg. For 18 pharmaceuticals, K-d values were found to be above 100 L/kg. SPM of annual composite samples were analyzed to determine the pharmaceutical concentrations between 2005 and 2015 at four sites of the river Rhine: Weil, Iffezheim, Koblenz and Bimmen as well as between 2006 and 2015 at one site of the river Saar, at Rehlingen. In these SPM samples, up to 61 of the 100 analytes were detected with concentrations up to 190 ng/g d.w. (dry weight) for guanylurea, a transformation product of the antidiabetic metformin. For most analytes, increasing concentrations were found along the length of the Rhine and higher concentrations were measured in Rehlingen/Saar. Normalization of the data with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine as an intrinsic tracer for municipal wastewater indicated possible industrial discharges for four analytes. For most pharmaceuticals, the annual concentrations exhibited a good correlation with the consumption volumes in Germany. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment and their removal by conventional wastewater treatment methods has proven to be ineffective. This research aimed to develop a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOA) for the removal of diclofenac in aqueous solution. The preparation of rGOA involved facile self-assembly of graphene oxide under a reductive environment of L-ascorbic acid. Characterisation of rGOA was performed by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The developed rGOA had a measured density of 20.39 +/- 5.28 mg/cm(3), specific surface area of 132.19 m(2)/g, cumulative pore volume of 0.5388 cm(3)/g and point of zero charge of 6.3. A study on the simultaneous interactions of independent factors by response surface methodology suggested dosage and initial concentration as the dominant parameters influencing the adsorption of diclofenac. The highest diclofenac adsorption capacity (596.71 mg/g) was achieved at the optimum conditions of 0.25 g/L dosage, 325 mg/L initial concentration, 200 rpm shaking speed and 30 degrees C temperature. The adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted to the Freundlich model with correlation coefficient (R-2) varying from 0.9500 to 0.9802. The adsorption kinetic data were best correlated to the pseudo-first-order model with R-2 ranging from 0.8467 to 0.9621. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the process was spontaneous (Delta G = - 7.19 to - 0.48 kJ/mol) and exothermic (Delta H = - 12.82 to - 2.17 kJ/mol). This research concluded that rGOA is a very promising adsorbent for the re mediation of water polluted by diclofenac.

AB The present manuscript describes for the first time the transformation and mineralization of cocaine (COC) in water (distilled water (DW) and synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SWeff)) by natural solar irradiation and two solar photocatalytic processes: heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton. The solar photocatalytic processes were run at equivalent pilot-plant scale by means of compound parabolic collectors, which allowed for comparison of solar transformation kinetics and compound mineralization. Direct photolysis resulted in almost complete and partial disappearance of COC in SWeff and DW, respectively, after 33 h of normalized irradiation time, and negligible mineralization. Solar transformation of COC by heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO(2) was completed after 28 and 50 min of illumination in DW and SWeff, respectively, whereas about half of the irradiation time was needed with photo-Fenton, which was also proved to be more effective in compound mineralization. Kinetics parameters were calculated for process comparison. Additionally, the phototransformation intermediates generated during each treatment were investigated and characterized by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqTOF-MS/MS). Identity confirmation was possible for some of them with the analysis of commercially available analytical standards. The main COC phototransformation pathways were observed to be ester bond cleavage, hydroxylation, and demethylation. Finally, the application of an acute toxicity test (Vibrio fischeri) to selected water samples resulted in inhibition percentages of bacterial bioluminescence in most cases below 20% after 30 min of sample contact, which indicates low acute toxicity of the photointermediates generated during the different treatments.

AB The photodegradation of three antibiotics, oxytetracycline (OTC), doxycycline (DTC), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in UV and UV/H2O2 process was investigated with a low-pressure UV lamp system. Experiments were performed in buffered ultrapure water (UW), local surface water (SW), and treated water from local municipal drinking water treatment plant (DW) and wastewater treatment plant (WW). The efficiency of UV/H2O2 process was affected by water quality. For all of the three selected antibiotics, the fastest degradation was observed in DW, and the slowest degradation occurred in WW. This phenomenon can be explained by R-OH,R-UV, defined as the experimentally determined (OH)-O-center dot radical exposure per UV fluence. The R-OH,R-UV values represent the background (OH)-O-center dot radical scavenging in water matrix, obtained by the degradation of para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), a probe compound. In natural water, the indirect degradation of CIP did not significantly increase with the addition of H2O2 due to its effective degradation by UV direct photolysis. Moreover, the formation of several photoproducts and oxidation products of antibiotics in UV/H2O2 process was identified using GC-MS. Toxicity assessed by vibrio fischer (V. fischer), was increased in UV photolysis, for the photoproducts still preserving the characteristic structure of the parent compounds. While in UV/H2O2 process, toxicity increased first, and then decreased; nontoxic products were formed by the oxidation of (OH)-O-center dot radical. In this process, detoxification was much easier than mineralization for the tested antibiotics, and the optimal time for the degradation of pollutants in UV/H2O2 process would be determined by parent compound degradation and toxicity changes.

AB This paper describes a facile approach for the surface modification of polypropylene non-woven fabric (NWF) by PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) to determine its filterability. The NWF surface modification involved the physical adsorption of PVA to immobilize PVA on the NWF surface. Chemical structures and morphological changes of the PVA-modified NWF sample surfaces were characterized in details by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron micrograph (SEM), and water contact angle measurements. Results reveal that PVA concentration has significant effects on the immobilization degree of PVA, and pure water contact angle on the NWF surface decreases with the increase in PVA concentration indicating an enhanced hydrophilicity for the modified NWF. Coomassie brilliant blue G250 method was utilized to quantify the static bovine serum albumin solution adsorption on the NWF surface. This adsorption was used to indicate the protein fouling property of the modified NWF with PVA. The results showed that after PVA modification, the polar groups such as C-O, C-O-C were introduced to the NWF surface, hydrophilicity was improved, and water static contact angles were decreased from 86 +/- 1 degrees to 43 +/- 3 degrees, the amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) static adsorption on modified NWF was decreased by 83.4%. Membrane bioreactor was used for the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater to determine the filterability of modified NWF. The results revealed that flux declination of modified NWF was only 12%, in comparison of the original NWF of 40%. The anti-fouling property for the modified NWF was enhanced greatly.

AB BACKCROUND: Detection of estrogens in the environment has raised concerns in recent years because of their potential to affect both wildlife and humans.
   OBJECTIVES: We compared exposures to prescribed and naturally occurring estrogens in drinking water to exposures to naturally occurring background levels of estrogens in the diet of chaildren and adults and to four independently derived acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) to determine whether drinking water intakes are larger or smaller than dietary intake or ADIs.
   METHODS: We used the Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation (PhATE) model to predict concentrations of estrogens potentially present in drinking water. Predicted drinking water concentrations were combined with default water intake rates to estimate drinking water exposures. Predicted drinking water intakes were compared to dietary intakes and also to ADIs. We present comparisons for individual estrogens as well as combined estrogens.
   RESULTS: In the analysis we estimated that a child's exposures to individual prescribed estrogens in drinking water are 730-480,000 times lower (depending upon estrogen type) than exposure to background levels of naturally occurring estrogens in milk. A child's exposure to total estrogens in drinking water (prescribed and naturally occurring) is about 150 times lower than exposure from milk. Adult margins of exposure (MOEs) based on total dietary exposure are about 2 times smaller than those for children. Margins of safety (MOSs) for an adult's exposure to total prescribed estrogens in drinking water vary from about 135 to > 17,000, depending on ADI. MOSs for exposure to total estrogens in drinking water are about 2 times lower than MOSs for prescribed estrogens. Depending on the ADI that is used, MOSs for young children range from 28 to 5,120 for total estrogens (including both prescribed and naturally occurring sources) in drinking water.
   CONCLUSIONS: The consistently large MOEs and MOSs strongly suggest that prescribed and total estrogens that may potentially be present in drinking water in the United States are not causing adverse effects in U.S. residents, including sensitive subpopulations.

AB Alterations occurring in the effluent organic matter (EfOM) during ozonation could be detrimental depending on the final application of the treated effluent. In this work, the fate of EfOM in different ozonized wastewaters was assessed through the monitoring of general water quality parameters and organic fractions determined through size-exclusion chromatography combined with organic carbon detection (SEC-OCD) analysis. These different components of EfOM were distinguished based on relative molecular weights and assigned to fractions named as biopolymers, humic substances, building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals and acids. The significant abatement (60-90%) of an ozone-refractory micropollutant (MP) was employed as reference to simulate potential scenarios in which also the presence of these species is wanted to be attenuated. Ultraviolet absorbance at 254 rim (UVA(254)) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions ranged from 40 to 80% and from 10 to 45%, respectively, for ozone doses between 0.6 and 1.0 mM, depending on the organic matter content (both dissolved and suspended) and alkalinity of the effluents. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis showed 21-27% reductions in Membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluents, whereas for conventional activated sludge (CAS) samples this value increased (6-35%) during the oxidative treatment. This was attributed to the continuous solubilization of humic substances, according to SEC-OCD results. Moreover, accumulation of lower molecular weight fractions such as building blocks or acids was observed in all the tested effluents, and attributed to the breakdown of largest EfOM fractions, mainly humic substances. Relationships proposed in this work between humic substances evolution, water quality (UVA(254)) and process parameters (immediate ozone demand (IOD), IOD-normalized hydroxyl radical exposure (integral[(OH)-O-center dot]dt/IOD) and transferred ozone dose (TOD)) might be useful for EfOM variations estimations along ozonation.

AB Metformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical product mostly biotransformed in the environment to a transformation product, guanylurea (GUA). In ready biodegradability tests (RBTs), however, contrasting results have been observed for metformin. The objective of this study was to measure the biodegradation of MET and GUA in RBTs, using activated sludge from the local wastewater treatment plant, either directly or after pre-exposure to MET, in a chemostat. The activated sludge community was cultivated in chemostats, in presence or absence of MET, for a period of nine months, and was used in RBT after one, three and nine months. The results of this study showed that the original activated sludge was able to completely remove MET (15 mg/l) and the newly produced GUA (50% of C-OMET) under the test conditions. Inoculation of the chemostat led to a rapid shift in the community composition and abundance. The community exposed to 1.5 mg/l of MET was still able to completely consume MET in the RBTs after one-month exposure, but three- and nine-months exposure resulted in reduced removal of MET in the RBTs. The ability of the activated sludge community to degrade MET and GUA is the result of environmental exposure to these chemicals as well as of conditions that could not be reproduced in the laboratory system. A MET-degrading strain belonging to the genus Aminobacter has been isolated from the chemostat community. This strain was able to completely consume 15 mg/l of MET within three days in the test. However, community analysis revealed that the fluctuation in relative abundance of this genus (< 1%) could not be correlated to the fluctuation in biodegradation capacity of the chemostat community.

AB BACKGROUND Nowadays, due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics, significant quantities have been detected in environmental samples. Therefore there is a need for a technology to eliminate the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in receiving water bodies. In recent years electrochemical oxidation showed superior efficiency for the purification of water from pharmaceuticals. RESULTS CONCLUSIONS boron doped diamond (BDD) showed better efficiency than platinum electrode and stainless steel for the degradation of 500 mu g L-1 tetracycline (TC) with 0.1 mol L-1 center dot Na2SO4. The presence of 200 mg L-1 bicarbonates decreased the apparent kinetic constant from 0.328 to 0212 min(-1). Instead, the addition of 200 mg L-1 NaCl increased the kinetic constant by almost four times, while the presence of 10 mg L-1 of humic acid decreased the kinetic constant by 18%. The process was favored in real environmental matrices like bottled water and wastewater in comparison with ultrapure water. The use of BDD as both anode and cathode enhanced the efficiency by almost 20%. The presence of UVA or solar radiation increased the decomposition of tetracycline by 14%. Changes in toxicity to Vibrio fisheri bacteria during treatment of TC in the secondary effluent are mainly attributed to the formation of intermediates of the water matrix itself and does not follow the TC removal. Electrochemical oxidation was favored for removal of TC in real water matrices due to the presence of chlorides. The use of BDD as both anode and cathode with simultaneous solar irradiation is a promising technology for water remediation from TC. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB dThe azole fungicide fluconazole (FLC) is persistent in conventional wastewater treatment plants, thus posing potential threats to human and ecosystem health. This study investigated the oxidation of FLC in aqueous solution by thermally activated persulfate (TAP) under different operation conditions. Higher temperature greatly improved the removal rate of FLC (0.057 h(-1) for 30 degrees C and 0.223 h(-1) for 60 degrees C) and the relationship between pseudo-first-order rate constant (k(obs)) and temperature fit the Arrhenius equation, with a comparatively low activation energy of 37.8 kJ mol(-1). The degradation rate constants were enhanced with the increase of PS concentration during FLC oxidation (0.072 h(-1) for 1.0 mM PS and 0.50 h(-1) for 20 mM PS). Solution pH influenced the k(obs) of FLC degradation and the highest and lowest degradation rates were obtained at pH 3 (0.51 h(-1)) and pH 5 (0.23 h(-1)), respectively. Increasing the level of natural water constituents (HCO3-, Cl-, and humic acid) significantly inhibited FLC degradation. Geometry optimization of FLC was performed using density functional theory (DFT) and the data indicated that the C3 atom in the benzene ring was the most reactive site. SPE-HPLC/MS/ MS analysis showed that intermediate products could form during FLC oxidation by PS and the total organic carbon (TOC) results indicated that FLC could be mineralized into CO2 and H2O. Accordingly, a plausible pathway for the degradation of FLC by the thermally activated PS could be proposed. The results of this study suggested that TAP is an applicable approach for the removal of azole fungicides in water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Methadone Contributes to N-Nitrosodimethylamine Formation in Surface

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen that forms in drinking water as a disinfection byproduct. Several specific precursor chemicals present during chloramination are known but cannot account for the total observed NDMA formation potential (FP) in drinking waters. We discovered a pharmaceutical precursor of NDMA with high FP using a liquid chromatography/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/QTOF-MS) screening procedure. The pharmaceutical methadone, which is used to mitigate heroin withdrawal symptoms and is also prescribed for chronic pain, contains a dimethylisopropylamine functional group that reacts to form large amounts of NDMA upon chloramination. In this study, methadone had a molar NDMA yield ranging from 23 to 70% depending on chloramine dose (1-150 mg of Cl-2/L) and was responsible for between 1 and 10% of NDMA FP in most raw surface waters in which it was detected and up to 62% of NDMA FP in wastewater. Samples with higher methadone concentrations had greater NDMA FP. We measured a median methadone concentration of 23 ng/L with a range of 1-2256 ng/L among detections, which was consistent with high occurrence rates and environmental persistence for methadone in the published literature for surface waters and wastewaters. A literature review of methadone use, metabolism, and fate in the United States resulted in a prediction of low nanogram per liter levels of methadone-associated NDMA FP at drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) downstream of communities using methadone. Medicinal use of methadone potentially displaces and transforms the health risks associated with heroin use by individuals to possible cancer risk for populations served by downstream DWTPs. This work is among the first to contrast known public health benefits of pharmaceutical-taking patients against the potential exposure of millions of people to physiologically relevant levels of carcinogenic NDMA in chloraminated drinking water.

AB Sulfonamide antimicrobials are used in both human therapy and animal husbandry. Sulfonamides are not readily biodegradable and have been detected in surface water and in secondary wastewater effluents. The chemical oxidation of sulfonamides by an environmentally friendly oxidant, ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)), was conducted. The sulfonamides used in the oxidation studies were sulfisoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethizole, sulfadimethoxine, and sulfamethoxazole. Kinetics of the reactions were determined as a function of pH (7.0-9.7) and temperature (15-45 degrees C) by a stopped-flow technique. The rate law for the oxidation of sulfonamides by Fe(VI) is first-order with respect to each reactant. The observed second-order rate constants decreased nonlinearly with an increase in pH and are possibly related to the protonation of Fe(VI) (HFeO4- <-> H+ + FeO42-; pK(a),(HFeO4) = 7.23) and sulfonamides (SH <-> H+ + S-; pK(a),(SH) = 5.0-7.4). The activation parameters of the reactions vary with pH due to temperature dependence on the protonation of Fe(VI) and sulfonamides. These results were used to obtain enthalpy of dissociation of sulfonamides. Stoichiometry and products of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) reactions with Fe(VI) were studied in detail using various analytical techniques to evaluate the effect of the oxidation process on the fate of sulfonamides in water. At a stoichiometric ratio of 4: 1 (Fe(VI): SMX), complete removal of SMX was achieved. Analyses of oxidation products of the reaction as well as kinetic measurements of substructural models of SMX suggest that the attack of Fe(VI) occurs at the isoxazole moiety as well as at the aniline moiety with minimal preference. The results of the studies reported suggest that Fe(VI) has the potential to serve as a chemical oxidant for removing sulfonamides and converting them to relatively less toxic byproducts in water.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) for controlling and preventing the COVID-19 would have sharply increased during the pandemic. To evaluate their post-pandemic environmental impacts, five categories of drugs were detected in lakes and WWTP-river-estuary system near hospitals of Jinyintan, Huoshenshan and Leishenshan in the three regions (J, H and L) (Regions J, H and L) in Wuhan, China. The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river estuary system in Wuhan City. However, the increased occurrence of certain drugs and their potential ecological risks need further attention. A strict source control policy and an advanced monitoring and risk warning system for emergency response and long-term risk control of PPCPs is urgent. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macrolide antibiotics azithromycin (AZI), erythromycin (ERY) and clarithromycin (CLA) have been recently included in the EU Watch List of contaminants of emerging concern in the aquatic environment. However, their comprehensive assessment in different environmental compartments, by including synthesis intermediates, by-products and transformation products, is still missing. In this work, a novel method, based on pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatographyetandem mass spectrometry, was developed and validated for the determination of such an extended range of macrolide residues in sediment and soil samples at low ng/g levels. The method was applied to determine distribution of 13 macrolides in surface and alluvial aquifer sediments collected in a small stream with a history of chronic exposure to wastewater discharges from AZI production. The total concentrations of the target macrolide compounds in surface sediments were up to 29 mg/g and the most prominent individual macrolides were parent AZI, its synthesis intermediate N-demethyl AZI and transformation products decladinosyl AZI and N0-demethyl AZI. Some ERY-related compounds, originating from AZI synthesis, were also frequently detected, though at lower concentration levels (up to 0.31 ng/g in total). The distribution of macrolide residues in surface sediments indicated their active longitudinal transport by resuspension and redeposition of the contaminated sediment particles. The vertical concentration profiles in stream sediments and the underlying alluvial aquifer revealed that macrolide residues reached deeper alluvial sediments (up to 5 m). Moreover, significant levels of macrolides were found in groundwater samples below the streambed, with the total concentrations reaching up to 1.7 mg/L. This study highlights the importance of comprehensive chemical characterization of the macrolide residues, which were shown to persist in surface and alluvial aquifer sediment more than ten years after their discharge into the aquatic environment.

AB The bio-char prepared from pine cones was used to remove cefixime (CFX) from aqueous solutions. The influence of some parameters including pH (2-12), contact time (0 to 120 min), initial concentration of CFX (10, 50, and 100 mg L-1), adsorbent dose (0.1 to 2.5 g L-1), temperature (10 degrees C to 50 degrees C) was evaluated. The pine cones pieces were washed with the distilled water, dried, crushed, and sieved to provide a particle size of 100-250 nm. For carbonization, the dried raw material was put into a stainless steel reactor and heated in an electrical furnace at 20 degrees C per min and maintained at 460 degrees C for 2 h. After carbonization, the samples were washed with distilled water and then dried at 105 degrees C for 12 h, and were used as adsorbent. The specific surface area, total pore volume, and mean pore diameter of the biosorbent were determined to be 789 m(2) g(-1), 0.373 cm(3) g(-1), and 1.89 nm, respectively. In the optimum conditions (pH = 6.3, initial concentration of CFX = 50 mg L-1, contact time = 90 min, and adsorbent dose = 2 g L-1), the removal efficiency was 92%. The adsorption isotherm of CFX follows the Langmuir model. The kinetic study confirmed that the adsorption process fits with the pseudo-second-order reaction. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption of CFX by the bio-char is feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic. This study represents that the biosorbent prepared from the pine cones can be used as an appropriate and cost-effective adsorbent for the removal of CFX from aqueous solutions and hospital wastewater.

The number of compounds detected, Hong Kong (12), Tokyo (9), Bangkok (9), New York (8), Los Angeles (8), Arctic (6), Shantou (5) and Chaozhou (5), generally increased with population density. Median concentrations of all detectable UV filters were <250 ng/L. The presence of these compounds in the Arctic is likely due to a combination of inadequate wastewater treatment and long-range oceanic transport. Principal component analysis (PCA) and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to explore spatiotemporal patterns and difference in organic UV filter levels in Hong Kong. In general, spatial patterns varied with sampling month and all compounds showed higher concentrations in the wet season except benzophenone-4 (BP-4). Probabilistic risk assessment showed that 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) posed greater risk to algae, while benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) were more likely to pose a risk to fishes and also posed high risk of bleaching in hard corals in aquatic recreational areas in Hong Kong. This study is the first to report the occurrence of organic UV filters in the Arctic and provides a wider assessment of their potential negative impacts in the marine environment.

AB One significant disadvantage of using reverse osmosis (RO) for reclamation purposes is the need to dispose of the RO retentates. These retentates contain a high concentration of micropollutants, effluent organic matter (EfOM) and other inorganic constituents, which are recalcitrant to biological treatment and may impact the environment. The occurrence of 11 pharmaceuticals (concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 mu g L-1) and their mitigation in RO retentates by a UV/H2O2 process and ozonation was studied using a wide range of oxidant dosages. Eleven pharmaceuticals were identified at. Initial observed kinetic constants (kits) were calculated for the different pharmaceuticals. Other typical wastewater parameters were also monitored during the UV/H2O2 and ozonation reactions.
   The range for k(obs) was found to be 0.8-12.8 L mmol O-3(-1) and 9.7-29.9 L mmol H2O2-1 for the ozonation and UV/H2O2 process, respectively. For ozonation, Atenolol, Carbamazepine, Codeine, Trimethoprim and Diclofenac showed the lowest initial k(obs) (in the order mentioned). Atenolol and Carbamazepine appeared as the most ozone resistant pharmaceuticals, exhibiting the lowest percentage of elimination at low ozone doses. On the other hand, despite the non-selectivity of HO center dot, differences in the initial kobs were also observed during the UV/H2O2 process. Trimethoprim, Paroxetine and Sulfamethoxazole exhibited the lowest initial k(obs) values (in the order mentioned). Trimethoprim and Paroxetine also exhibited the lowest percentage removal when low H2O2 doses were assayed. The compounds that were identified as problematic during ozonation were more efficiently removed by the UV/H2O2 process. UV/H2O2 generally appeared to be a more efficient technology for removing pharmaceuticals from RO brines compared to ozonation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to synthesise indigenously the hybrid materials and their efficient use to treat the wastewater contaminated with one of important micro-pollutant diclofenac. The hybrid materials are obtained modifying the commercial bentonite (B) and locally collected clay (LC) with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) as to obtain the organo-modified clay samples (BH and LCH). Moreover, the B and LC clay samples are pillared with aluminium and modified with the HDTMA as to obtain inorgano-organo-modified clay hybrid materials (viz, BAH and LCAH solids). The hybrid materials are characterised by the XRD (X-ray diffraction) and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red) analytical methods and the surface morphology is obtained by the FE-SEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) images of these solids. pH(pzc) (Point of Zero Charge) of these solids is obtained by acid base titrations. Further, these materials are assessed in the efficient and effective treatment of aquatic environment contaminated with diclofenac sodium under the batch and fixed-bed column reactor operations. Batch data is obtained for various physico-chemical parametric studies viz., the effect of solution pH (3.8-10.0), sorptive concentrations (1.0-20.0 mg/L), and background electrolyte concentrations (0.0001-0.1 mol/L NaCl). The kinetics of the uptake of diclofenac by these solids is conducted using the pseudo-first, pseudo-second and fractal-like-pseudo-second order non-linear rate equations. The rate constants along with the removal capacity are, therefore, estimated. Further, the fixed-bed column reactor operations are performed to obtain the loading capacity of column for diclofenac under the dynamic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is proposed that wastewater treatment facilities meet legislated discharge limits for a range of micropollutants. However, the heterogeneity of these micropollutants in wastewaters make removal difficult to predict since their chemistry is so diverse. In this study, a range of organic and inorganic micropollutants known to be preferentially removed via different mechanisms were selected to challenge the activated sludge process (ASP) and determine its potential to achieve simultaneous micropollutant removal. At a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the influence of an increase in solids retention time (SRT) on removal was evaluated. Maximum achievable micropollutant removal was recorded for all chemicals (estrogens, nonylphenolics and metals) at the highest SRT studied (27 days). Also, optimisation of HRT by extension to 24 h further augmented organic biodegradation. Most notable was the enhancement in removal of the considerably recalcitrant synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol which increased to 65 +/- 19%. Regression analysis indicates that this enhanced micropollutant behaviour is ostensibly related to the concomitant reduction in food: microorganism ratio. Interestingly, extended HRT also initiated nonylphenol biodegradation which has not been consistently observed previously in real wastewaters. However, extending HRT increased the solubilisation of particulate bound metals, increasing effluent aqueous metals concentrations (i.e., 0.45 mu m filtered) by >100%. This is significant as only the aqueous metal phase is to be considered for environmental compliance. Consequently, identification of an optimum process condition for generic micropollutant removal is expected to favour a more integrated approach where upstream process unit optimisation (i.e., primary sedimentation) is demanded to reduce loading of the particle bound metal phase onto the ASP, thereby enabling longer HRT in the ASP to be considered for optimum removal of organic micropollutants.

AB The presence of acetaminophen (APAP) in water and wastewater indicates its low susceptibility to conventional treatment. The application of new TiO2 nanocomposites containing pristine carbon nanotubes (MWCNT, 0.15-8.78 wt%) prepared by solgel method in acetaminophen removal from water was tested. The studied nanocomposites possessed a high surface area (348-421 m(2).g(-1)) with uniform framework-confined mesopores (primary mesopores) with an average pore width of about 3 nm. TiO2 was present as anatase with crystal size similar to 5-6 nm. The nanocomposites had an exposed more graphitized MWCNT surface with a lower content of C-O and O=C-O- surface groups.
   The addition of MWCNT reduced the band gap of TiO2 from 3.2 eV to 2.82 eV. Dark adsorption resulted in insignificant changes in APAP concentration. The greatest changes in APAP concentration during Vis irradiation over the tested nanocomposites were observed using CNT10 (Fig. 108). The highest efficiency was exhibited by the nanocomposite containing 1.72 wt% of MWCNT that enabled 81.6 +/- 0.6% removal of APAP from water. Generally, an increase of MWCNT concentration up to 1.72 wt% in the nanocomposites induced APAP removal. The nanocomposites possessing higher MWCNT addition were, however, not so efficient (63.2 +/- 2.4% and 62.2 +/- 4.2% removal). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of different nanocomposites is observed only in the narrow range. The obtained results confirmed that photogenerated holes and, to a lower extent, O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot radicals played the key role in photocatalytic APAP removal over MWCNT-TiO2-SiO2. The studies using Vibrio fischeri have confirmed that photocatalytic oxidation is an effective method for reducing water toxicity.

AB TAML activators enable unprecedented, rapid, ultradilute oxidation catalysis where substrate inhibitions might seem improbable. Nevertheless, while TAML/H2O2 rapidly degrades the drug propranolol, a micropollutant (MP) of broad concern, propranolol is shown to inhibit its own destruction under concentration conditions amenable to kinetics studies ([propranolol] = 50 mu M). Substrate inhibition manifests as a decrease in the second-order rate constant k(I) for H2O2 oxidation of the resting Fe-III-TAML (RC) to the activated catalyst (AC), while the second-order rate constant k(II) for attack of AC on propranolol is unaffected. This kinetics signature has been utilized to develop a general approach for quantifying substrate inhibitions. Fragile adducts [propranolol, TAML] have been isolated and subjected to ESI-MS, florescence, UV-vis, FTIR, H-1 NMR, and IC examination and DFT calculations. Propranolol binds to Fe-III-TAMLs via combinations of noncovalent hydrophobic, coordinative, hydrogen bonding, and Coulombic interactions. Across four studied TAMLs under like conditions, propranolol reduced k(I) 4-32-fold (pH 7, 25 degrees C) indicating that substrate inhibition is controllable by TAML design. However, based on the measured k(I) and calculated equilibrium constant K for propranolol-TAML binding, it is possible to project the impact on k(I) of reducing [propranolol] from 50 mu M to the ultradilute regime typical of MP contaminated waters (<= 2 ppb, <= 7 nM for propranolol) where inhibition nearly vanishes. Projecting from 50 mu M to higher concentrations, propranolol completely inhibits its own oxidation before reaching mM concentrations. This study is consistent with prior experimental findings that substrate inhibition does not impede TAML/H2O2 destruction of propranolol in London wastewater while giving a substrate inhibition assessment tool for use in the new field of ultradilute oxidation catalysis.

We present a framework to prepare a short list of TOrCs for detailed risk assessment and evaluation in terms of bioaccumulation. The framework was modified from Lipinski's method to predict drug permeability based on four critical properties: (i) molecular weight (MW); (ii) lipophilicity (expressed as logKow, the octanol-water partition coefficient); (iii) H-bond acceptors; and (iv) H-bond donors. The literature shows that the compounds with MW ranging from 200 to 500 can readily diffuse through mammalian membranes, the uptake of compounds with logKow >5 is hindered, and an excessive number of H-bond donors and H-bond acceptors reduces the permeability across a mammalian membrane bilayer. In general, mammalian and plant membranes are similar in structure and functions. Based on these four properties, we developed the "Rule of 3," which states that greater absorption and higher permeability of a TOrC is likely when its logK(ow) is <3, its MW is <300, H-bond donors are <3, and H-bond acceptors are <6. Applicability of the framework was tested with published data, which showed that uptake and bioaccumulation of TOrCs in plants decreased in the order: Rule of 3 >Rule of 3 to 5 (logK(ow) between 3 and 5, MW between 300 and 500, H-bond acceptors between 3 and 6, and H-bond donors between 3 and 5) >Rule of 5 (logK(ow) >5, MW >500, H-bond acceptors >10, and H-bond donors <5). We conclude that TOrCs following the "Rule of 3" could be prioritized for detailed risk assessment involving dietary exposure.

AB Previous studies showed the presence of multiple emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in urban surface waters of Singapore even though there are no obvious direct wastewater discharges. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of 17 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disruptive compounds (EDCs) in a tropical urban catchment of Singapore. Monthly samples were collected from a reservoir and its 5 upstream tributaries during a 16-month period. Analysis of samples showed all sites had measurable PPCP and EDC concentrations, with caffeine (33.9-2980 ng/L), salicylic acid (5-838 ng/L), acetaminophen (<4-485.5 ng/L), BPA (<2- 919.5 ng/L) and DEET (13-270 ng/L) being the most abundant. Marked differences in concentrations of target analytes between the reservoir and upstream tributaries were observed, and were tentatively attributed to the spatial differences in source inputs, water dilution capacity as well as natural attenuation of EOCs. Significant correlations between EOCs and conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, turbidity, nutrients and cumulative precipitationwere observed. These factors appeared to affect the distribution and attenuation of EOCs, depending on their physicochemical properties. Rainfall also influenced the temporal distribution of caffeine, BPA, triclosan, fipronil and DEET in the reservoir. Ecological risk assessment showed that caffeine, acetaminophen, estrone, BPA, triclosan and fipronil may warrant further survey. In particular, BPA levels exceeded the literature-based Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) value, highlighting the need for source control and/or water remediation in this urban catchment.

AB In spite of the quantities and species of chemicals dramatically increased with rapid economic growth in China in the last decade, the focus of environmental research was mainly on limited number of priority pollutants. Therefore, to elucidate environmental pollution by organic micro-pollutants, this work was conducted as the first systematic survey on the occurrence of 1300 substances in 20 surface water samples of Tianjin, North China, selected as a representative area of China. The results showed the presence of 227 chemicals. The most relevant compounds in terms of frequency of detection and median concentration were bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (100%; 0.26 mu g L-1), siduron (100%; 0.20 mu g L-1), lidocaine (100%; 96 ng L-1), antipyrine (100%; 76 ng L-1), caffeine (95%; 0.28 mu g L-1), cotinine (95%; 0.201 mu g L-1), phenanthrene (95%; 0.17 mu g L-1), metformin (90%; 0.61 mu g L-1), diethyl phthalate (90%; 0.19 mu g L-1), quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (90%; 0.14 mu g L-1), 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole (85%; 0.11 mu g L-1) and anthraquinone (85%; 54 ng L-1). Cluster analysis discriminated three highly polluted sites from others based on data similarity. Principle component analysis identified four factors, corresponding to industrial wastewater, domestic discharge, tire production and atmospheric deposition, accounting for 78% of the total variance in the water monitoring data set. This work provides a wide reconnaissance on broad spectrum of organic micro-contaminants in surface waters in China, which indicates that the aquatic environment in China has been polluted by a large number of chemicals.

AB Biosolids generally contain the microbiocidal agents triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) that are persistent during wastewater treatment and sorp to organic material. The present study investigated the concentration of TCS in tissues of radish, carrot, and soybean grown in potted soil amended with biosolids. Highest mean concentrations of TCS in radish, carrot, and soybean root tissue midway through the life cycle were 24.8ng/g, 49.8ng/g, and 48.1ng/g dry weight, respectively; by the conclusion of the test, however, concentrations had declined to 2.1ng/g, 5.5ng/g, and 8.4ng/g dry weight, respectively. Highest mean concentrations of TCS in radish and carrot shoot tissue were 33.7 and 18.3ng/g dry weight at days 19 and 45, respectively, but had declined to 13.7ng/g and 5.5ng/g dry weight at days 34 and 69, respectively. Concentration of TCS in all samples of soybean seeds was below method detection limit (i.e., 2.8ng/g dry wt). The present study also examined the concentration of TCS and TCC in edible portions of green pepper, carrot, cucumber, tomato, radish, and lettuce plants grown in a field amended with biosolids. Triclosan was detected only in cucumber and radish up to 5.2ng/g dry weight. Triclocarban was detected in carrot, green pepper, tomato, and cucumber up to 5.7ng/g dry weight. On the basis of the present study and other studies, we estimate that vegetable consumption represents less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of TCS and TCC. These results demonstrate that, if best management practices for land application of biosolids in Ontario are followed, the concentration of TCS and TCC in edible portions of plants represents a negligible exposure pathway to humans.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. However, they are emerging as a significant contaminant in aquatic environments through wastewater. Due to the persistent and accumulated properties of pharmaceuticals via the food web, their potential harmful effects on aquatic animals are a great concern. In this study, we investigated the effects of six pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, ATP; atenolol, ATN; carbamazepine, CBZ; oxytetracycline, OTC; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; and trimethoprim, TMP on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) activity and its transcript expression with chlorpyrifos (as a positive control) in the monogonont rotifer, Brachionus koreanus. ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure also remarkably inhibited Bk-AChE activity at 100 mu g/L (24 h) and 1000 mu g/L (12 hand 24 h). ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure showed a significant decrease in the Bk-AChE mRNA level in a concentration-dependent manner. However, in the case of OTC and SMX, a slight decrease in Bk-AChE mRNA expression was found but only at the highest concentration. The time-course experiments showed that ATP positively induced Bk-AChE mRNA 12 h after exposure at both 100 and 1000 mu g/L, while the Bk-AChE mRNA expression was significantly downregulated over 6 to 24 h after exposure to 1000 mu g/L of CBZ, OTC, SMX, and TMP. Our findings suggest that Bk-AChE would be a useful biomarker for risk assessment of pharmaceutical compounds as an early signal of their toxicity in aquatic environments. Particularly, ATP, CBZ, and TMP may have a toxic cholinergic effect on rotifer B. koreanus by inhibiting AChE activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Biochars produced from cotton gin waste (CG) and guayule bagasse (GB) were characterized and explored as potential adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals (sulfapyridine-SPY, docusate-DCT and erythromycin-ETM) from aqueous solution. An increase in biochar pyrolysis temperature from 350 C-omicron to 700 C-omicron led to an increase in pH, specific surface area, and surface hydrophobicity. The electronegative surface of all tested biochars indicated that non-Coulombic mechanisms were involved in adsorption of the anionic or uncharged pharmaceuticals under experimental conditions. The adsorption capacities of Sulfapyridine (SPY), Docusate (DCT) and Erythromycin (ETM) on biochar were influenced by the contact time and solution pH, as well as biochar specific surface area and functional groups. Adsorption of these pharmaceutical compounds was dominated by a complex interplay of three mechanisms: hydrophobic partitioning, hydrogen bonding and - electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions. Despite weaker pi-pi EDA interactions, reduced hydrophobicity of SPY- and increased electrostatic repulsion between anionic SPY- and the electronegative CG biochar surface at higher pH, the adsorption of SPY unexpectedly increased from 40% to 70% with an increase in pH from 7 to 10. Under alkaline conditions, adsorption was dominated by the formation of strong negative charge-assisted H-bonding between the sulfonamide moiety of SPY and surface carboxylic groups. There seemed to be no appreciable and consistent differences in the extent of DCT and ETM adsorption as the pH changed. Results suggest the CG and GB biochars could act as effective adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals from reclaimed water prior to irrigation. High surface area biochars with physico-chemical properties (e.g., presence of functional groups, high cation and anion exchange capacities) conducive to strong interactions with polar-nonpolar functionality of pharmaceuticals could be used to achieve significant contaminant removal from water.

AB Since bacterial consortia involved in conventional wastewater treatment processes are not efficient in removing diclofenac (DCF), an emerging pollutant frequently detected in water bodies, the identification of microorganisms able to metabolise this pharmaceutical compound is relevant. Thus, DCF removal was investigated using bacteria isolated from aqueous stock solutions of this micropollutant and identified as Bacillus and Brevibacillus species using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A 100% DCF removal was achieved after 17 hours of experiment at 20 degrees C in a nutrient medium; the biodegradation kinetic followed a pseudo-first order (k(biol) = 11 L center dot g(SS)(-1)center dot d(-1)). Quantitative assessment of DCF removal showed that its main route was biotic degradation. The main degradation product of DCF, 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac (4 '-OH-DCF), was identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry. Since the ecotoxicological impact of 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac was not reported in the literature, the ecotoxicity of DCF and its metabolite were tentatively evaluated using Vibrio fischeri bioassays. Results from these tests showed that this metabolite is not more toxic than its parent compound and may hopefully be an intermediate product in the DCF transformation. Indeed, no significant difference in ecotoxicity was observed after 30 min between DCF (50 should be writtten in subscript all along the manuscript in EC50 = 23 +/- 4 mg center dot L-1) and 4 '-hydroxy-diclofenac (EC50 = 19 +/- 2 mg center dot L-1). Besides, the study highlighted a limit of the Microtox (R) bioassay, which is largely used to assess ecotoxicity. The bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri was impacted due to the production of microbial activity and the occurrence of some carbon source in the studied medium.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) has attracted increasing attention for seawater and brackish water desalination, wastewater treatment, and concentration of juices and pharmaceutical solutions due to its feasibility of using low-grade energy and achieving high solute rejection. However, the successful implementation of MD technology is still impeded by membrane wetting resulted from membrane scaling by inorganic crystals and membrane fouling by organic matters in the feed solutions, especially when dealing with challenging wastewaters. Herein, this study describes a novel strategy to develop a robust and superhydrophobic membrane via electrospinning followed by electrospray to enhance membrane anti-wetting properties caused by scaling and fouling. The robust superhydmphobic membrane PDMS-3 comprised a superhydrophobic surface layer fabricated by electrospraying a PVDF/PDMS/silica fume blended solution and an electrospun nanofibrous PVDF support. The newly developed membrane PDMS-3 not only exhibited an outstanding superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 170 degrees +/- 1 degrees, but also showed a unique anti-abrasive feature, which still possessed a slippery superhydmphobic property after 40 abrasion cycles. Moreover, the DCMD tests revealed that this rigid superhydrophobic surface rendered PDMS-3 with the best anti-scaling and anti-fouling properties compared to the nanofibmus and commercial PVDF membranes. It could achieve a superior MD flux of 28 kg M-2 h(-1) and a stable salt rejection above 99.99% during a continuous 160-h DCMD operation when the feed and permeation solutions were 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at 333K and distillate water at 293 K, respectively. These results underline the importance of anti-abrasive superhydmphobic membrane development to deal with wastewaters containing diverse inorganic and organic matters via MD.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and environment estrogens, as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), have been widely detected in aquatic environments around the world. However, surveys of seasonal freeze-thaw rivers with special hydrological features are limited. To address this, in this study the occurrence, distribution, ecological risk, and mass flux of 22 CECs in the Jilin Songhua River in northeast China, a famously seasonal freeze thaw river at mid - and high-latitude regions, were investigated during its spring flood period. The results indicate that estriol had a maximum concentration of 27.4 ng.L(-1)in the mainstream river water. Doxy-cycline had a maximum concentration of 204.4 ng.L-1 in the tributary river water and 103.0 ng.L-1 in the riverine wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The mean concentrations of the targeted CECs in the spring flood were 1.4 times higher than those found in our previous investigation during the summer flood. A risk assessment showed that estrone posed a high risk in the mainstream, doxycycine posed a high risk in the tributaries, and ofloxadn posed a high risk in the riverine WWTP effluents. In addition, erythromycin and lincomycin posed a medium to high risk in the river water and WWTP effluents. The major contribution of the CECs in the mainstream came from its tributaries, which contributed a total of >50% in the spring flood period. The results suggest that some appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the contribution of the CECs from the tributaries to the seasonal freeze-thaw river in its spring flood period.

AB The performances of an equilibrium and a kinetic passive sampler for monitoring a range of organic contaminants (Log K-OW from -0.03 to 6.26) were evaluated in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant, the receiving river Saar as well as the river Mosel in Germany. The polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and a new mixed polymer sampler (MPS) were selected as kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers, respectively. Concentrations were described in terms of a time-weighted average concentration (C-TWA) from the POCIS measurements and as an equilibrium concentration from the MPS (CEquil-MPS) and POCIS membrane (CEquil-PES) analyses. Twenty-seven compounds could be detected, includig eight priority substances of the EU Water Framework Directive. Both sampler types detected a similar range of compounds in the low ng/L to mu g/L range, with a high proportion of pharmaceuticals being detected at all sampling sites. To account for uncertainty in the POCIS sampling rates, a range in C-TWA was estimated by applying low and high sampling rates. For the compounds that were detected in the POCIS this range was within a factor of 3.5. Interestingly, the MPS extracts showed lower ionisation artefacts than the POCIS extracts during the LC-MS/MS analysis. Finally, total water concentrations (G(Total)) were estimated from the dissolved concentrations, literature organic carbon partition coefficients (K-OC) and the total organic carbon levels measured in the rivers. For the compounds in this study, negligible differences between C-Total and the passive sampler-derived dissolved concentrations were found with a maximum difference of 15% for diclofenac. Overall, this study demonstrated that the parallel application of kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers can improve the description of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The elimination of five selected emerging contaminants (1-H-benzotriazole, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), chlorophene, 3-methylindole, and nortriptyline HCl) dissolved in different water matrices (surface water and secondary effluents) was carried out by sequential membrane filtration and chemical oxidation processes. First, a membrane filtration (ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration(NF)) pre-treatment was conducted, and both permeate and retentate were afterwards treated by chemical oxidation, using ozone or chlorine. The application of UF and especially of NF provided a large volume of permeate, whose quality can be improved by a chemical treatment to completely remove residual contaminants except 1-H-benzotriazole. Chlorination and especially ozonation have demonstrated to be effective for the reduction of emerging contaminants in the concentrated stream, thus generating an effluent that might be recycled to the activated sludge treatment in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In a second group of experiments, a chemical oxidation pre-treatment (by using ozone, chlorine, O-3/H2O2, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or UV/H2O2) was applied followed by a nanofiltration process. Results of removals and rejection coefficients for the emerging contaminants showed that the chemical pre-treatment exerted a positive influence on the subsequent NF process, not only in terms of ECs removal but also of dissolved organic carbon content (DOC) reduction. While global removals higher than 97% were reached for DEET, chlorophene, 3-methylindole, and nortriptyline HCl, lower values were obtained for 1-H-benzotriazole, especially for chlorine pre-treatment and in those water matrices with high content of natural organic matter. Therefore, both sequential treatments are promising to remove the selected micropollutants while reducing the chlorine doses needed to achieve final water disinfection.

AB The beta-blocker atenolol (ATEN), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine (VEN) are found in municipal wastewater effluents, but little is known about the effect of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic animals. We tested the hypothesis that VEN and ATEN disrupt acute stress mediated glucose production in fish liver. To this end, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes were exposed in vitro to different concentrations (0, 0.1, 10,1000 nM) of VEN or ATEN and glucose production in response to either cortisol or epinephrine (two key stress hormones) was ascertained. Both VEN and ATEN did not affect either the unstimulated or cortisol (100 ng/mL)-stimulated glucose release over a 24 h period. The acute (3 h) unstimulated glucose production by isolated hepatocytes in suspension was also not modified by ATEN, while VEN (100 and 1000 nM) reduced basal glucose release. However, ATEN, even at concentration as low as 0.01 nM completely abolished epinephrine (1 mu M)-induced glucose production in trout hepatocytes. Interestingly, VEN also suppressed epinephrine-induced glucose production but only at higher concentrations (100 and 1000 nM). Neither VEN nor ATEN significantly impacted the glucose production in response to either 8-bromo-cAMP (cAMP analogue) or glucagon (a metabolic hormone that increases glucose production) stimulation. ATEN but not VEN attenuated the epinephrine-induced increase in glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) mRNA abundance in trout hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the impact of ATEN and VEN on glucose production involves inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor signaling in trout hepatocytes. Overall, VEN and ATEN are beta-blockers and may disrupt the adaptive acute glucose response to a secondary stressor in rainbow trout. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are often not fully removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and are thus being detected at trace levels in water bodies all over the world posing a risk to numerous organisms. These organic micropollutants (OMPs) reach WWTPs at concentrations sometimes too low to serve as growth substrate for microorganisms; thus, co-metabolism is thought to be the main conversion mechanism. In this study, the microbial removal of six pharmaceuticals was investigated in a membrane bioreactor at increasing concentrations (4-800 nM) of the compounds and using three different hydraulic retention times (HRT; 1, 3.5 and 5 days). The bioreactor was inoculated with activated sludge from a municipal WWTP and fed with ammonium, acetate and methanol as main growth substrates to mimic co-metabolism. Each pharmaceutical had a different average removal efficiency: acetaminophen (100%) > fluoxetine (50%) > metoprolol (25%) > diclofenac (20%) > metformin (15%) > carbamazepine (10%). Higher pharmaceutical influent concentrations proportionally increased the removal rate of each compound, but surprisingly not the removal percentage. Furthermore, only metformin removal improved to 80-100% when HRT or biomass concentration was increased. Microbial community changes were followed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in response to the increment of pharmaceutical concentration: Nitrospirae and Planctomycetes 16S rRNA relative gene abundance decreased, whereas Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased. Remarkably, the Dokdonella genus, previously implicated in acetaminophen metabolism, showed a 30-fold increase in abundance at the highest concentration of pharmaceuticals applied. Taken together, these results suggest that the incomplete removal of most pharmaceutical compounds in WWTPs is dependent on neither concentration nor reaction time. Accordingly, we propose a chemical equilibrium or a growth substrate limitation as the responsible mechanisms of the incomplete removal. Finally, Dokdonella could be the main acetaminophen degrader under activated sludge conditions, and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals might still be toxic to relevant WWTP bacteria.

AB This work aims at the preparation of AC from chemical activation (H3PO4, KOH, and HCl) and physical activation (thermal treatment under N-2 atmosphere at 500 and 700 degrees C) of Astragalus Mongholicus (AM) (a low-cost bio-adsorbent and agro-industrial waste), used as carbon precursor. The obtained materials were further applied in the adsorption of diclofenac (DCF) from water/wastewater. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared ACs and commercial activated carbons (CAC) were evaluated by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, and BET analyses, revealing the high surface area and mesoporous proportion of AC when compared to CAC. Adsorption results showed that the efficiency of AC-700 degrees C (774 m(2) g(-1)) for DCF removal (92.29%) was greater than that of AC-500 degrees C (648 m(2)g(-1), 83.5%), AC-H3PO4 (596 m(2)g(-1), 80.8%), AC-KOH (450 m(2)g(-1), 59.3%), AC-HCl (156 m(2)g(-1), 29.8%) and CAC (455 m(2)g(-1), 67.8%). The optimization of effective parameters in adsorption was examined at a laboratory-scale using the selected AC-700 degrees C. The Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order model fitted well the experimental data. The regeneration efficiency was maintained at 96% (DI-water) and 97% (heating) after three cycles. Besides, genetic programming (GP) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to predict the adsorption behavior of DCF from aqueous phase as well as in the ACs structure. It was found that the adsorption mechanisms involved were electrostatic interaction, cation-pi interaction, and pi-pi electron interaction. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals are continuously released to aquatic environments posing a rising threat to marine ecosystems. Yet, monitoring routines and ecotoxicity data on biota worldwide for these substances are lacking. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most prescribed and found pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The toxicity effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of ibuprofen on primary productivity, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum were assessed. Diatom cultures were exposed to 0, 0.8, 3, 40, 100 and 300 mu g L-1 ibuprofen concentrations, usually found in the vicinity of wastewater treatment plants and coastal environments. Higher concentrations (100 and 300 mu g L-1) had a negative impact in P. triconutum growth, inhibiting the chloroplastic energy transduction in the electron transport chain resulting in lower energy reaching the PS I (r(2) = -0.55, p < 0.05). In contrast, the mitochondrial electron transport and available energy increased (r(2) = 0.68 and r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.05 respectively), mostly due to enhancements in lipid and protein contents as opposed to reduction of carbohydrates. A general up-regulation of the antioxidant enzymes could contributed to alleviate oxidative stress resulting in the decrease of lipid peroxidation products (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.05). Canonical analysis of principal components was performed and successfully discriminated exposure groups, with optical data excelling in classifying samples to different ibuprofen concentrations, being potentially used as environmental indicators. Finally, the identified mild to severe effects of ibuprofen on diatoms are likely to be exacerbated by the sustained use of this drug worldwide, underpinning the urgency of evaluating the impacts of this pharmaceutical on coastal and marine trophic webs.

AB Sulfate radical (SO4(center dot-))-induced oxidation is an important technology in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of pollutants. To date, few studies have assessed the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the SO4 center dot(-)induced oxidation of organic micro-pollutants. In the present work, a quantum chemical calculation was used to investigate the influence of the external oxygen molecule on the Gibbs free energy (G(pollutant)) and HOMO-LUMO gap (Delta E) of 15 organic micro-pollutants representing four chemical categories. Several thermodynamic and statistical models were combined with the data from the quantum chemical calculation to illustrate the impact of DO on the oxidation of organic micropollutants by SO4(center dot-). Results indicated that the external oxygen molecule increased G(pollutant) of all studied chemicals, which implies DO has the potential to decrease the energy barrier of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation and shift the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products. From the perspective of kinetics, DO can accelerate the oxidation by decreasing Delta E of organic micro-pollutants. In addition, changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation were both significantly different between open-chain and aromatic chemicals, and these differences were partially attributed to the difference of polarizability of these two types of chemicals. Furthermore, we revealed that all changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E induced by DO were dependent on the DO content. Our study emphasizes the significance of DO on the oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by SO4(center dot-), and also provides a theoretical method to study the effect of components in wastewater on removal of organic pollutants in AOPs.

AB Pharmaceuticals are heavily used to improve human and animal health, resulting in the frequent contamination of aquatic environments with pharmaceutical residues, which has raised considerable concern in recent years. When inadequately removed from drinking water in water treatment plants, pharmaceuticals can have potential toxic effects on human health. This study investigated the spatial distributions and seasonal variations of five pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprofen (KEP), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA), in the Huangpu River system (a drinking water source for Shanghai) over a period of almost two years as well as the associated risk to human health for different age groups. All of the targets were ubiquitous in the river water, with levels decreasing in the following order: KEP (mean: 28.6 ng/L) approximate to IBP (23.3 ng/L) > DFC (13.6 ng/L) approximate to NPX (12.3 ng/L) > CA (1.6 ng/L). The concentrations of all of the investigated compounds were at the low or medium end of the global range. The upstream tributaries contained lower IBP but higher NPX than did the mainstream and downstream tributaries. However, no significant variations were found in the levels of KEP, DFC, or CA at the different sampling sites. Except for CA in the mainstream, significantly higher pharmaceutical levels were observed in the dry season than in the wet season. Overall, a very low risk of the selected pharmaceuticals for human health via drinking water was observed, but future studies are needed to examine the fate and chronic effects of all pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the human health risk of pharmaceuticals in raw drinking water in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The exposure and uptake of environmental estrogenic compounds have been reported in previous studies of demersal flatfish species in the central Southern California Bight (SCB), USA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic or feminizing activity of marine sediments from the SCB by using in vivo vitellogenin (VTG) assays in male or juvenile fish. In 2003, sediments were collected near wastewater outfalls serving the counties of Los Angeles (LACSD) and Orange (OCSD), and the city of San Diego (SD), California, USA. Cultured male California halibut (CH; Paralichthys californicus) were either directly exposed to sediments for 7 d or treated with two intraperitoneal injections of sediment extract over 7 d. The 17 beta-estradiol (E2) equivalent values ranged from 1 to 90 mu g/kg with LACSD > SD > OCSD. Measurable concentrations of E2 were observed in all sediment extracts and ranged from 0.16 to 0.45 ng/g. Estrone (El) was only observed in sediments near the LACSD outfall (0.6 ng/g). Alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates were observed in all sediment samples, but were highest near the OCSD outfall, where concentrations of nonylphenol were 3,200 ng/g. Fractionation studies of the LACSD sediment extract collected in 2004 failed to demonstrate relationships between VTG expression and 62 analytes, including E2, which was observed in the whole extract (2.9 ng/g). Oxybenzone (1.6 ng/g) was identified in bioactive fractions as well as unknown compounds of relatively high polarity. These results indicate that estrogen receptor-based assays may underestimate environmental estrogenic activity and estrogenic compounds other than classic natural and xenoestrogens may contribute to estrogenic activity of sediments from the SCB.

AB This work describes the development, optimisation and validation of an analytical method for the rapid determination of 17 priority pharmaceutical compounds and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Rather than studying compounds from the same therapeutic class, the analyses aimed to determine target compounds with the highest risk potential (with particular regard to Scotland), providing a tool for further monitoring in different water matrices. Prioritisation was based on a systematic environmental risk assessment approach, using consumption data; wastewater treatment removal efficiency; environmental occurrence; toxicological effects; and pre-existing regulatory indicators. This process highlighted 17 compounds across various therapeutic classes, which were then quantified, at environmentally relevant concentrations, by a single analytical methodology. Analytical determination was achieved using a single-step solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The fully optimised method performed well for the majority of target compounds, with recoveries >71% for 15 of 17 analytes. The limits of quantification for most target analytes (14 of 17) ranged from 0.07 ng/L to 1.88 ng/L in river waters. The utility of this method was then demonstrated using real water samples associated with a rural hospital/setting. Eight compounds were targeted and detected, with the highest levels found for the analgesic, paracetamol (at up to 105,910 ng/L in the hospital discharge). This method offers a robust tool to monitor high priority pharmaceutical and EDC levels in various aqueous sample matrices.

AB It can be stated that in the fine chemical industries, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, large amounts of liquid waste and industrial waste solvents are generated during the production technology. Addressing these is a key issue because their disposal often accounts for the largest proportion of the cost of the entire technology. There is need to develop regeneration processes that are financially beneficial to the plant and, if possible, reuse the liquid waste in the spirit of a circular economy, in a particular technology, or possibly elsewhere. The distillation technique proves to be a good solution in many cases, but in the case of mixtures with high water content and few volatile components, this process is often not cost-effective due to its high steam consumption, and in the case of azeotropic mixtures there are separation constraints. In the present work, the membrane process considered as an alternative; pervaporation is demonstrated through the treatment of low alcohol (methanol and ethanol) aqueous mixtures. Alcohol-containing process wastewaters were investigated in professional process simulator environment with user-added pervaporation modules. Eight different methods were built up in ChemCAD flowsheet simulator: organophilic pervaporation (OPV), hydrophilic pervaporation (HPV), hydrophilic pervaporation with recirculation (R-HPV), dynamic organophilic pervaporation (Dyn-OPV), dynamic hydronophilic pervaporation (Dyn-HPV), hybrid distillation-organophilic pervaporation (D + OPV), hybrid distillation-hydrophilic pervaporation (D + HPV), and finally hybrid distillation-hydrophilic pervaporation with recirculation (R-D + HPV). It can be stated the last solution in line was the most suitable in the terms of composition, however distillation of mixture with high water content has significant heat consumption. Furthermore, the pervaporation supplemented with dynamic tanks is not favourable due to the high recirculation rate in the case of tested mixtures and compositions.

AB Several studies have been conducted worldwide to develop effective and affordable methods to degrade pharmaceuticals and their metabolites/intermediates/oxidation products found in surface water, wastewater and drinking water. In this work, acetaminophen and its transformation products were successfully degraded in surface water by electrochemical oxidation using stainless steel electrodes. The effect of pH and current density on the oxidation process was assessed and the oxidation kinetics and mechanisms involved were described. Additionally, the results were compared with those obtained in acetaminophen synthetic solutions. It was found that conducting the electrochemical oxidation at 16.3 mA/cm(2) and pH 5, good performance of the process was achieved and not only acetaminophen, but also its transformation products were totally degraded in only 7.5 min; furthermore, small number of transformation products were generated. On the other hand, degradation rates of acetaminophen and its transformation products in surface water were much faster (more than 2.5 times) and the reaction times much shorter (more than 4.0 times) than in synthetic solutions at all current densities and pH values evaluated. At pH 3 and pH 5, greater soluble chlorine formation due to the higher HCl amount used to acidify the surface water solutions could enhance the degradation rates of acetaminophen and its transformation products. However, constituents of surface water (ions and solids) could also have an important role on the oxidation process because at pH 9 (non-acidified solutions) the degradation rates were also much greater and the reaction times were much shorter in surface water than in acetaminophen synthetic solutions.

AB As increasing attention is paid to surface water protection, there has been demand for improvements of domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This has led to the application of many different advanced treatment processes (ATPs). In this study, the treatability of trace organic pollutants in secondary effluent (SE) and associated biotoxicity reduction by four types of ATPs, including coagulation, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and photocatalysis, and ozonation, were investigated at the bench-scale. The ATPs showed different removal capacity for the 48 chemicals, which were classified into seven categories. EDCs, herbicides, bactericides and pharmaceuticals were readily degraded, and insecticides, flame retardants, and UV filters were relatively resistant to removal. During these processes, the efficiency of the ATPs in reducing four biological effects were investigated. Of the four biological effects, the estrogenic activity from SE was not detected using the yeast estrogen screen. In contrast with genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition, bacterial cytotoxicity posed by SE was the most difficult biological effect to reduce with these ATPs. GAC adsorption and ozonation were the most robust treatment processes for reducing the three detected biotoxicities. UV photolysis and photocatalysis showed comparable efficiencies for the reduction of genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition. However, coagulation only performed well in genotoxicity reduction. The effect-based trigger values for the four bioassays, that were derived from the existing environmental quality standards and from HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of aquatic organisms), were all used to select and optimize these ATPs for ecological safety. Conducting ATPs in more appropriate ways could eliminate the negative effects of WWTP effluent on receiving water bodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems. The quantitative models of contaminant removal described in this study can be used to design natural treatment systems that balance the needs for local water quality requirements, available land and site-specific requirements.

AB The present work highlights the novel approach of combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. The initial part of the work concentrates on the critical analysis of the literature related to the combined approaches based on hydrodynamic cavitation followed by a case study of triazophos degradation using different approaches. The analysis of different combinations based on hydrodynamic cavitation with the Fenton chemistry, advanced Fenton chemistry, ozonation, photocatalytic oxidation, and use of hydrogen peroxide has been highlighted with recommendations for important design parameters. Subsequently degradation of triazophos pesticide in aqueous solution (20 ppm solution of commercially available triazophos pesticide) has been investigated using hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation operated individually and in combination for the first time. Effect of different operating parameters like inlet pressure (1-8 bar) and initial pH (2.5-8) have been investigated initially. The effect of addition of Fenton's reagent at different loadings on the extent of degradation has also been investigated. The combined method of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozone has been studied using two approaches of injecting ozone in the solution tank and at the orifice (at the flow rate of 0.576 g/h and 1.95 g/h). About 50% degradation of triazophos was achieved by hydrodynamic cavitation alone under optimized operating parameters. About 80% degradation of triazophos was achieved by combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and Fenton's reagent whereas complete degradation was achieved using combination of hydrodynamic cavitation and zonation. TOC removal of 96% was also obtained for the combination of ozone and hydrodynamic cavitation making it the best treatment strategy for removal of triazophos. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Constructed wetlands are a potential method for the removal of two pharmaceutical and personal care products from wastewater effluent. Triclosan (TCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]phenol) and triclocarban (TCC; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanillide) are antimicrobial agents added to a variety of consumer products whose accumulation patterns in constructed wetlands are poorly understood. Here, we report the accumulation of TCS, its metabolite methyl-triclosan (MTCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]), and TCC in wet-land plant tissues and sediments. Three wetland macrophytes: Typha latifolia, Pontederia cordata, and Sagittaria graminea were sampled from a constructed wetland in Denton, Texas, USA. MTCS concentrations were below the method detection limit (MDL) for all species. TCS root tissue concentrations in T. latifolia were significantly greater than root concentrations in P. cordata (mean SE in ng g(-1): 40.3 +/- 11.3 vs. 15.0 +/- 1.9, respectively), while for TCC, shoot tissue concentrations in S. graminea were significantly greater than in T. latifolia (22.8 +/- 9.3 vs. 9.0 (MDL), respectively). For both TCS and TCC, T. latifolia root tissue concentrations were significantly greater than shoot concentrations (TCS: 40.3 +/- 11.3 vs. 17.2 +/- 0.2, TCC: 26.0 +/- 3.6 vs. 9.0, (MDL)). TCC concentrations in P. cordata roots were significantly greater than in shoots (34.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 15.4 +/- 2.8, respectively). TCS concentrations in T. latifolia roots and sediments and TCC concentrations in sediments generally decreased from wetland inflow to outflow. To our knowledge, this is the first study documenting species and tissue specific differences in the accumulation of TCS and TCC in plants from an operational constructed wetland. The species specific differences in bioaccumulation suggest TCS and TCC removal from constructed wetlands could be enhanced through targeted plantings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) processes are becoming more popular for both secondary and sidestream treatment in wastewater facilities. These processes are a combination of biofilm reactors and activated sludge processes, achieved by introducing and retaining biofilm carrier media in activated sludge reactors. A full-scale train of three IFAS reactors equipped with AnoxKaldnes media and coarse-bubble aeration was tested using off-gas analysis. This was operated independently in parallel to an existing full-scale activated sludge process. Both processes achieved the same percent removal of COD and ammonia, despite the double oxygen demand on the IFAS reactors. In order to prevent kinetic limitations associated with DO diffusional gradients through the IFAS biofilm, this systems was operated at an elevated dissolved oxygen concentration, in line with the manufacturer's recommendation. Also, to avoid media coalescence on the reactor surface and promote biofilm contact with the substrate, high mixing requirements are specified. Therefore, the air flux in the IFAS reactors was much higher than that of the parallel activated sludge reactors. However, the standardized oxygen transfer efficiency in process water was almost same for both processes. In theory, when the oxygen transfer efficiency is the same, the air used per unit load removed should be the same. However, due to the high DO and mixing requirements, the IFAS reactors were characterized by elevated air flux and air use per unit load treated. This directly reflected in the relative energy footprint for aeration, which in this case was much higher for the IFAS system than activated sludge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heavy metals and microbiological contamination were investigated in groundwater in the industrial and coastal city of Thoothukudi. The main sources of drinking water in this area are water bores which are dug up to the depth of 10-50 m in almost every house. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. The study consists of the determination of physico-chemical properties, trace metals, heavy metals and microbiological quality of drinking water. Heavy metals were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and compared with the (WHO in Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) standards. The organic contamination was detected in terms of most probable number (MPN) test in order to find out faecal coliforms that were identified through biochemical tests. A comparison of the results of groundwater samples with WHO guidelines reveals that most of the groundwater samples are heavily contaminated with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium, lead, boron, aluminium, iron and vanadium. The selenium level was higher than 0.01 mg/l in 82 % of the study area and the arsenic concentration exceeded 0.01 mg/l in 42 % of the area. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to the discharge of effluents from copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant and sea food industries. The results showed that there are pollutions for the groundwater, and the total Coliform means values ranged from 0.6-145 MPN ml(-1), faecal Coliform ranged from 2.2-143 MPN ml(-1), Escherichia coli ranged from 0.9 to 40 MPN ml(-1) and faecal streptococci ranged from 10-9.20 x 10(2) CFU ml(-1). The coastal regions are highly contaminated with total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.

AB The solid-waste treatment plant of RECIPLASA is located in the municipality of Onda (Castellon province), which is an important agricultural area of Spain, with predominance of citrus crops. In this plant, all urban solid wastes from the town of Castellon (around 200,000 inhabitants) and other smaller towns as Almassora, Benicassim, Betxi, Borriana, L'Alcora, Onda and Vila-Real are treated. In order to evaluate the potential impact of this plant on the surrounding water, both surface and groundwater, a comprehensive monitoring of organic pollutants has been carried out along 2011, 2012 and 2013. To this aim, an advanced analytical strategy was applied for wide-scope screening, consisting on the complementary use of liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) with quadrupole (Q)-time of flight analyser (TOF). A generic solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges was applied prior to the chromatographic analysis. The screening included more than 1500 organic pollutants as target compounds, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, veterinary drugs, drugs of abuse, UV-filters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), among others. Pesticides, mainly herbicides, were the compounds more frequently detected. Other compounds as antioxidants, cosmetics, drugs of abuse, PAHs, pharmaceuticals and UV filters, were also identified in the screening though at much lower frequency. Once the screening was made, quantitative analysis focused on the compounds more frequently detected was subsequently applied using LC coupled to tandem MS with triple quadrupole analyser. In this way, up to 24 pesticides and transformation products (TPs), 7 pharmaceuticals, one drug of abuse and its metabolite could be quantified at sub-ppb concentrations. Along the three years of study, ten compounds were found at concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g/L. Most of them were pesticides and TPs, a fact that illustrates that the main source of pollution seems to be the agricultural activities in this area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB UV filters in Sunscreens and cosmetics protect the skin from damage through UV radiation. Many tonnes per year of UV filters are being used in Europe and will be present, at least seasonally, in detectable concentrations in surface waters similar to common pharmaceutically active substances. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC; CAS 5466-77-3) were extrapolated for Switzerland, taking into consideration substance-specific environmental fate data and marketing estimates, by crude worst-case reckoning and by applying two environmental models (Mackay Level III; USES 3.0), both configured for Swiss hydrological and area data. By worst-case reckoning the summer PEC is 70.8-81.3 ng/l while for the remaining 8 months of the year the PEC is 13.1-15.1 ng/l. The Level III model results in concentrations of 2.4 ng/l during the summer and 0.44 ng/l during the rest of the year, while the USES 3.0 model gives an average PEC for the whole year of 7.6 ng/l. Pooling summer monitoring data (90 single analyses) from the River Rhine below Basel in the year 1997 (Water Protection Board of Basel) and From Lakes Zurich and Huttner in 1998 (Poiger et al., in preparation) allowed a derivation of a probabilistic median concentration of 4.6 ng/l, a 95th-percentile concentration of 18.6 ng/l and a 99th-percentile concentration of 33.5 ng/l. The 6-fold range from the median value to the maximum calls for caution in interpreting published monitoring concentrations. Comparison of modelled PECs with realistic median concentrations shows that crude reckoning overestimates actual concentrations by a factor of about 10, probably through insufficient consideration of (further) degradation of EHMC in sewage works, surface waters, sediments or river batiks. Both computer models, in contrast, are within the same order of magnitude as the actual summer concentrations. Based on the available data, both these environmental fate and distribution models give realistic PECs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In some Brazilian coastal cities, it is common to observe 'black tongues' in beaches, i.e. a mixture of urban runoff and untreated domestic sewage containing pollutants of emerging concern, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), flowing into the South Atlantic Ocean. Such diffuse loads of pollutants might expose nontarget aquatic organisms to harmful compounds. In this work, the occurrence and preliminary ecological risk of 27 PPCPs of various therapeutic classes (including cocaine and its primary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) were investigated, for the first time, in seven urban drainage channels whose diffuse loads flow continuously to the beaches of Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of these, 21 compounds were detected using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and nine of them were consistently quantified in all urban channels of Santos, suggesting that those pollutants are ubiquitous in this region: caffeine (143.4-516.0 ng/L), losartan (4.2-21.8 ng/L), atenolol (1.1-18.2 ng/L), acetaminophen (1.5-13.8 ng/L), benzoylecgonine (1.0-4.8 ng/L), carbamazepine (1.1-4.0 ng/L), diclofenac (1.9-3.5 ng/L), cocaine (0.5-1.7 ng/L), and orphenadrine (0.1-0.8 ng/L). Moreover, twelve compounds were found below the limit of quantification ( <LOQ): citalopram, propranolol, diazepam, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, midazolam, ranitidine, chlortalidone, clopidogrel, chlorpheniramine, enalapril and valsartan. According to our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of midazolam, ranitidine and chlorpheniramine in surface waters in Latin America and, therefore, these compounds should be considered environmental warning signs. A preliminary ecological risk assessment revealed that caffeine, acetaminophen and losartan presented a moderate risk, and carbamazepine a low risk to sensitive aquatic organisms at maximum measured concentrations. This study provides valuable information to reinforce the importance of a continuous monitoring of the diffuse loads (containing PPCPs and illicit drugs) flowing to the coastal zones in developing countries.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Sweden has prohibited the deposition of organic waste since January, 2005. Since 1 million tons of sludge is produced every year in Sweden and the capacity for incineration does not fill the demands, other methods of sludge management have to be introduced to a larger degree. One common method in the USA and parts of Europe is the use of wetlands to treat wastewater and sewage sludge. The capacity of reed beds to affect the toxicity of a complex mixture of nitroaromatics in sludge, however, is not fully elucidated. In this study, an industrial sludge containing explosives and pharmaceutical residues was therefore treated in artificial reed beds and the change in toxicity was studied. Nitroaromatic compounds, which are the main ingredients of many pharmaceuticals and explosives, are well known to cause cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Recently performed studies have also showed that embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are sensitive to nitroaromatic compounds. Therefore, we tested the sludge passing through constructed wetlands in order to detect any changes in levels of embryotoxicity, genotoxicity and dioxin-like activity (AhR-agonists). We also compared implanted and planted systems in order to examine the impact of the root system on the fate of the toxicants.
   Methods. An industrial sludge containing a complex mixture of nitroaromatics was added daily to small-scale constructed wetlands (vertical flow), both implanted and planted with Phragmites australis. Sludge with an average dry weight of 1.25%, was added with an average hydraulic loading rate of 1.2 L/day. Outgoing water was collected daily and stored at -20 degrees C. The artificial wetland sediment was Soxhlet extracted, followed by clean-up with multi-layer silica, or extracted by ultrasonic treatment, yielding one organic extract and one water extract of the same sample. Genotoxicity of the extracts was measured according to the ISO protocol for the umu-C genotoxicity assay (ISO/TC 147/SC 5/ WG9 N8), using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 as test organism. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were studied using the fish egg assay with zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the dioxin-like activity was measured using the DR-CALUX assay. Chemical analyses of nitroaromatic compounds were performed using Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) and GC-MS.
   Results. Organic extracts of the bed material showed toxic potential in all three toxicity tests after two years of sludge loading. There was a difference between the planted and the unplanted beds, where the toxicity of organic extracts overall was higher in the bed material from the planted beds. The higher toxicity of the planted beds could have been caused by the higher levels of total carbon in the planted beds, which binds organic toxicants, and by enrichment caused by lower volumes of outgoing water from the planted beds.
   Discussion. Developmental disorders were observed in zebrafish exposed directly in contact to bed material from implanted beds, but not in fish exposed to bed material from planted beds. Hatching rates were slightly lower in zebrafish exposed to outgoing water from implanted beds than in embryos exposed to outgoing water from planted beds. Genotoxicity in the outgoing water was below detection limit for both planted and implanted beds. Most of the added toxicants via the sludge were unaccounted for in the outgoing water, suggesting that the beds had toxicant removal potential, although the mechanisms behind this remain unknown.
   Conclusions. During the experimental period, the beds received a sludge volume (dry weight) of around three times their own volume. In spite of this, the toxicity in the bed material was lower than in the sludge. Thus, the beds were probably able to actually decrease the toxicity of the added, sludge-associated toxicants. When testing the acetone extracts of the bed material, the planted bed showed a higher toxicity than the unplanted beds in all three toxicity tests. The toxicity of water extracts from the unplanted beds, detected by the fish egg assay, were higher than the water extracts from the planted beds. No genotoxicity was detected in outgoing water from either planted or implanted beds. All this together indicates that the planted reed beds retained semi-lipophilic acetone-soluble toxic compounds from the sludge better than the unplanted beds, which tended to leak out more of the water soluble toxic compounds in the outgoing water. The compounds identified by SPME/GC in the outgoing water were not in sufficient concentrations to have caused induction in the genotoxicity test.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. This study has pointed out the benefits of using constructed wetlands receiving an industrial sludge containing a complex mixture of nitroaromatics to reduce toxicity in the outgoing water. The water from planted, constructed wetlands could therefore be directed to a recipient without further cleaning. The bed material should be investigated over a longer period of time in order to evaluate potential accumulation and leakage prior to proper usage or storage. The plants should be investigated in order to examine uptake and possible release when the plant biomass is degraded.

AB This study reports on the propranolol (PRO) degradation performance and product toxicity of an ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED)/chlorine process. The effects of experimental parameters including solution pH, chlorine dosage, and water matrix constituents on PRO removal were evaluated. Up to 94.5% of PRO could be eliminated within 15 min at a PRO-to-chlorine molar ratio of 1:4. The overall removal efficiency of PRO was non-pH dependent in the range of 5-9, while the initial rate was accelerated under alkaline conditions. The presence of Cl-/HCO3- had little influence on the PRO degradation, whereas either humic acid or NO3- had an obvious inhibitory effect. Radical scavenger experiments showed that both HO center dot and Cl center dot primarily contributed to the PRO degradation, and electron paramagnetic resonance data demonstrated the generation of O-1(2). The transformation of PRO during this process led to five detected products, which exhibited a higher acute toxicity than the parent compound according to the bright luminescent bacillus T3 method. It is worth mentioning that under the same ultraviolet illumination intensity, the degradation of PRO under UV-LED/chlorine gave a better performance than UV254/chlorine, but the EEO of the former is obviously higher than the latter. So further research is required on improving the electric current to photon conversion efficiency for UV-LED. Additionally, the UV-LED/chlorine system was effective in the degradation of other drugs including sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and gatifloxacin, suggesting the possible application of the UV-LED/chlorine process for the removal of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment.

AB Regulatory ecotoxicology testing rarely accounts for the influence of natural water chemistry on the bioavailability and toxicity of a chemical. Therefore, this study identifies whether key omissions in relation to Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and pH have an impact on measured effect concentrations (EC). Laboratory ecotoxicology tests were undertaken for the widely used antimicrobial compound triclosan, using adult Gammarus pulex (L.), a wild-type amphipod using synthetic fresh water, humic acid solutions and wastewater treatment works effluent. The toxicity of triclosan was tested at two different pHs of 7.3 and 8.4, with and without the addition of DOC and 24 and 48 hour EC values with calculated 95% confidence intervals calculated. Toxicity tests undertaken at a pH above triclosan's pKa and in the presents of humic acid and effluent, containing 11 and 16 mg L-1 mean DOC concentrations respectively, resulted in significantly decreased triclosan toxicity. This was most likely a result of varying triclosan speciation and complexation due to triclosan's pKa and high hydrophobicity controlling its bioavailability. The mean 48 hour EC50 values varied between 0.75 +/- 0.45 and 1.93 +/- 0.12 mg L-1 depending on conditions. These results suggest that standard ecotoxicology tests can cause inaccurate estimations of triclosan's bioavailability and subsequent toxicity in natural aquatic environments. These results highlight the need for further consideration regarding the role that water chemistry has on the toxicity of organic contaminants and how ambient environmental conditions are incorporated into the standard setting and consenting processes in the future.

AB This study examined the tissues distribution of selected serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in brook trout exposed for 3 months to continuous flow-through primary-treated effluent before and after ozone treatment. A reliable analytical method was developed for the quantification of trace amounts of antidepressants in small tissue homogenate extracts. Levels of six antidepressants and four of their N-desmethyl metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant amounts of the SSRIs were found in fish tissue-in decreasing order: liver > brain > muscle. Sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline were the predominant substances observed in most tissues (0.04-10.3 ng g(-1)). However, less SSRIs (0.08-1.17 ng g(-1)) were bioaccumulated in the ozonated effluent. The early molecular effects of these SSRIs on the Na/K-dependent ATPase pump activity in brain synaptosomes where also investigated in vitro and in fish exposed to the municipal effluents. With respect to their potential biological effects, in vitro exposure to selected SSRIs induced a reduction of the brain Na/K-ATPase activity in synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner. Results showed that Na/K-ATPase activity was readily inhibited by exposure to municipal effluent before and, to a lesser extent, after ozone treatment. Moreover, the Na/K-ATPase activity was significantly and negatively correlated with brain tissue concentrations of fluoxetine (r = -0.57; p < 0.03), desmethylsertraline (r = -0.84; p < 0.001), and sertraline (r = -0.82; p < 0.001). The present study reveals that SSRIs are readily available in fish, biologically active and corroborates previous findings on the serotonergic properties of municipal effluents to aquatic organisms.

AB Background: Hyaluronic acid is one of the biopolymers most commonly used by the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, there is an increasing number of recent works that deal with the production of microbial hyaluronic acid. Different properties and characteristics of the fermentation process have been extensively optimised; however, new carbon and protein sources obtained from by-products or cheap substrates have not yet been studied.
   Results: Mussel processing wastewater (MPW) was used as a sugar source and tuna peptone (TP) from viscera residue as a protein substrate for the production of hyaluronic acid (HA), biomass and lactic acid (LA) by Streptococcus zooepidemicus in batch fermentation. Commercial medium formulated with glucose and tryptone was used as the control. The parametric estimations obtained from logistic equations and maintenance energy model utilized for modelling experimental data were compared in commercial and low-cost media. Complete residual media achieved high production (3.67, 2.46 and 30.83 g l(-1) of biomass, HA and LA respectively) and a high molecular weight of HA (approximately 2500 kDa). A simple economic analysis highlighted the potential viability of this marine media for reducing the production costs by more than 50%.
   Conclusions: The experimental data and mathematical descriptions reported in this article demonstrate the potential of media formulated with MPW and TP to be used as substrates for HA production by S. zooepidemicus. Furthermore, the proposed equations accurately simulated the experimental profiles and generated a set of interesting parameters that can be used to compare the different bacterial cultures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which a culture media formed by marine by-products has been successfully used for microbial HA production.

AB Hospital effluent and connected waste water treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent were sampled daily to determine the levels and inter-day variations of three naturally occurring steroid estrogens: estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and synthetic 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. After solid phase extraction, interferences were removed with a silica gel clean-up step and the samples analysed using gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MSD). The determined inter-day concentrations in hospital effluent were between 8.6 to 31.3 ng L(-1) for estrone, <LOD (limit of detection) to 4.2 ng L(-1) for 17 beta-estradiol and 6.4 to 385.5 ng L(-1) for estriol. In the WWTP influent concentrations were 18.9 to 49.7 ng L(-1) for estrone, 2.4 to 12.7 ng L(-1), for 17 beta-estradiol and <LOQ (limit of quantitation) to 63.9 ng L(-1) for estriol. Reduced levels were found in the WWTP effluent: <7.1 ng L(-1) for estrone, <LOQ for 17 beta-estradiol and <5.2 ng L(-1) for estriol. 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was detected in only one influent sample. Calculated estradiol equivalents (EEQ) were 33.4, 22.4, 1.7 ng (EEQ) L(-1) in the hospital effluent, WWTP influent and WWTP effluent, respectively. Interestingly, the estrone : 17 beta-estradiol : estriol ratio in the hospital effluent (1 : 0.1 : 9.4) is comparable to that found in the urine of pregnant women (1 : 0.3 : 20) indicating the most likely source of steroid estrogens. In WWTP influent the ratio was similar to that found in the non-pregnant population. Our result recognise estriol as being one of the most important steroid estrogens, accounting for up to 92% of the total EEQ present in hospital samples and 37% and 46% in WWTP influent and effluent samples, respectively. The study reveals how concentrations of steroid estrogens vary on a daily basis and concludes that careful sampling strategies must be adopted when making a risk assessment. In addition, the low potency steroid estrogens that contribute towards overall estrogenicity of the sample, e.g. estriol, should be incorporated into environmental monitoring programs.

AB Integrated hybrid systems coupling microfiltration (MF) with UVA photolysis (UVA-MF) or TiO2-P25 photocatalysis (UVA/TiO2-MF) were investigated for the removal of oxytetracycline (OTC) from synthetic (ultrapure water-UPW) and real (secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant-UWW) matrices, both spiked with 5 mg L-1 of OTC. The photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) was tested both using the TiO2-P25 nanoparticles in suspension or immobilized on the external surface of the membrane - nano-engineered membrane (NEM). In all cases, reaction occurs only inside the membrane module. The effect of transmembrane pressure (TMP) (1.0-2.0 bar) and of TiO2-P25 loading (0.1-0.4 g L-1) in slurry conditions, on the efficiency of the photocatalytic UVA/TiO2-MF system was investigated. Additionally, OTC oxidation efficiency was evaluated as a function of the amount of TiO2-P25 deposited on the external surface of the ceramic MF membrane. The membrane ensured the retention of TiO2-P25 particles, when using the PMR catalyst slurry system. The higher OTC removal efficiency (> 90% of antibiotic removal after 30 min) as well as the higher permeate flux decline (66% after 5 h) were observed when using the highest TiO2-P25 loading. The NEM contributed to the in-situ OTC and by-products oxidation, improving its antifouling properties, and, consequently, leading to a low permeate flux decline (8% after 5 h) when using UPW as solution matrix. However, a permeate flux decline of 66% was observed for UWW-NEM after the same reaction time. Despite the advantages of NEM, the OTC removal efficiency was higher when using TiO2-P25 slurry due to the higher photocatalyst surface area. Nevertheless, the NEM showed a good stability of the catalyst thin film during 3 consecutive reaction cycles.

AB Aqueous-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) has been scarcely explored in the literature for the removal of chlorinated micropollutants. The aim of this work is to prove the feasibility of this technology for the fast and environmentally-friendly degradation of such kind of compounds. Diclofenac (DCF), a highly consumed anti-inflammatory drug, has been selected as the target pollutant given its toxicity and low biodegradability. The commercial Pd/Al2O3 (1% wt.) catalyst has been used due to its prominent role on this field. Complete degradation of DCF was achieved in a short reaction time (20 min) under ambient conditions (25 degrees C, 1 atm) at [DCF](0) = 68 mu M; [Pd/Al2O3](0) = 0.5 g L-1 and H-2 flow rate of 50 N mL min(-1). Remarkably, the chlorinated intermediate (2-(2-chloroanilino)-phenylacetate (CI-APA)) generated along reaction was completely removed at the same time, being the chlorine-free compound 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA) the only final product. A reaction scheme based on this consecutive pathway and a pseudo-first-order kinetic model have been proposed. An apparent activation energy of 43 kJ mol(-1) was obtained, a comparable value to those previously reported for conventional organo-chlorinated pollutants. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited a reasonable stability upon three successive uses, achieving the complete degradation of the drug and obtaining APA as the final product in 30 min. The evolution of ecotoxicity was intimately related to the disappearance of the chlorinated organic compounds and thus, the final HDC effluents were non-toxic. The versatility of the system was finally demonstrated in different environmentally-relevant matrices (wastewater treatment plant effluent and surface water). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To optimize removal of organic micropollutants from the water cycle, understanding the processes during activated sludge treatment is essential. In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa, but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for accumulation of ammonium.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are the environmental pollutants of growing concern. The aim of this study was to indicate the effects of typical PPCPs on the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus. We treated male frogs with waterborne ibuprofen (IBU, 250 ng.L-1), triclosan (TCS, 500 ng.L-1 1), or estrone (E1, 100 ng.L-1) for 14 days. Common vulnerability of the frogs was detected from dramatic decrease of Zn, total and metalated metallothionein (MT) concentrations, Zn/Cu ratio, the elevation of activity of glutathione-S-transferase, cathepsin D and DNA instability in the liver, the depletion of cholinesterase in the brain and cortisol in the blood plasma in all exposures. Nevertheless, lipofuscin concentration in the liver was always decreased. The groups were best distinguished by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity determined by ELISA. The exposure to IBU caused lesser damage, but elevated the levels of oxyradicals and glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and lysosomal membrane instability. Exposures to TCS and El provoked the endocrine disturbance (increased levels of vitellogenin and thyrotropin in blood plasma), decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and increased level of pyruvate in the liver. TCS caused the increase of GSSG by 7.3 times and lactate levels. Only El lead to decrease of deiodinase activity in the liver, activation of CYP450 and caspase-3 and efflux of cathepsin D from lysosomes. Spectrophotometric and ELISA assays of MTs and CYP450 gave distinct results in E1-group. Broad disruption of the hormonal pathways caused by E1 could be of concern for the health status of frogs in their habitats.

AB Propranolol is a human pharmaceutical beta-blocker that has been detected in municipal wastewater effluents at ng/L to low mg/L. To assess the potential of this compound to affect fish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for a life cycle in a flow-through system to nominal propranolol concentrations of 0.87 ng/L, 8.7 ng/L, 87 ng/L, 870 ng/L, and 8700 ng/L. Measured propranolol concentrations were below detection for the 2 lowest exposure concentrations, and were 76 ng/L, 580 ng/L, and 7800 ng/L for the 3 highest exposure concentrations. During the 162-d to 165-d exposure, no significant changes in weights or lengths were seen in fathead minnows, although the highest concentration of propranolol did cause a 15% decrease in survival of larval and juvenile stage fish compared with controls. At maturity, there were no significant changes in condition factor, liver-somatic index, or secondary sex characteristics in propranolol-exposed male or female fish. Female gonadosomatic index was significantly decreased in fish exposed to the highest concentrations of propranolol, probably because of increased egg-laying. Fathead minnows from all propranolol exposures produced more eggs than control fish, with fish exposed to 7800 ng/L propranolol producing 70% more eggs per female (p = 0.060), and having significantly increased clutch size (p = 0.008). Egg quality, % fertilization, % hatching, and % deformities in F1 fry were unaffected by propranolol exposure of fish. Propranolol exposure caused no effects in fathead minnows, except at the highest exposure concentration (7800 ng/L), where there were slight decreases in survival of juvenile minnows, and indications of increased reproduction. The present study is important because it is the first to assess the potential for effects in fish exposed to propranolol for a life cycle. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB An urban net-zero water treatment system, designed for energy-positive water management, 100% recycle of comingled black/grey water to drinking water standards, and mineralization of hormones and other organics, without production of concentrate, was constructed and operated for two years, serving an occupied four-bedroom, four-bath university residence hall apartment. The system comprised septic tank, denitrifying membrane bioreactor (MBR), iron-mediated aeration (IMA) reactor, vacuum ultrafilter, and peroxone or UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation, with 14% rainwater make-up and concomitant discharge of 14% of treated water (ultimately for reuse in irrigation). Chemical oxygen demand was reduced to 12.9 +/- 3.7 mg/L by MBR and further decreased to below the detection limit (<0.7 mg/L) by IMA and advanced oxidation treatment. The process produced a mineral water meeting 115 of 115 Florida drinking water standards that, after 10 months of recycle operation with similar to 14% rainwater make-up, had a total dissolved solids of similar to 500 mg/L, pH 7.8 +/- 0.4, turbidity 0.12 +/- 0.06 NTU, and NO3-N concentration 3.0 +/- 1.0 mg/L None of 97 hormones, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals analyzed were detected in the product water. For a typical single-home system with full occupancy, sludge pumping is projected on a 12-24 month cycle. Operational aspects, including disinfection requirements, pH evolution through the process, mineral control, advanced oxidation by-products, and applicability of point of -use filters, are discussed. A distributed, peroxone-based NZW management system is projected to save more energy than is consumed in treatment, due largely to retention of wastewater thermal energy. Recommendations regarding design and operation are offered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is an effective technology for micropollutants retention for production of high quality reclaimed water. However, limited information is available about the effects of temperature on the performance of NF on micropollutants rejections. In this paper, the behaviors and mechanisms of micropollutants rejections by two commercial NF membranes (VNF1 and VNF2) were studied under different temperatures. Based on the Donnan Steric Pore Model with Dielectric Exclusion (DSPM-DE) model, the mathematical functions were firstly established to describe the relationship between pore size (r(p)) and temperature (T) as well as the relationship of water permeability (A) with temperature (T). The DSPM-DE model incorporated with temperature functions were used to predict micropollutants rejections by NF membranes at given temperature values. The results showed that the increase of temperature could lead to the increase of NF membranes' pore sizes, water fluxes as well as the micropollutants' diffusivities. The rejection rates of positively and neutrally charged micropollutants decreased with temperature increased, which was mainly due to the attenuation of steric hindrance effect. For the negatively charged micropollutants, temperature had negligible effect on them, which was possibly facilitated by the co-function of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance effect. Our study also showed that the predicted rejection values of neutrally and positively charged micropollutants decreased with temperature increased, in agreement with those of the experimental data. Compared with the real experimental rejections, the average relative errors of predicted values were 6.20% and 9.03% for VNF1 and VNF2, respectively. But for benzotriazole, the average relative error was as higher as 20.44%, possibly due to its adsorption onto VNF membranes. This work provides valuable insights for NF engineering applications and designs at different temperatures.

AB A detailed understanding of the fate of xenobiotics introduced into the environment and the mechanisms involved in their biotransformation, biodegradation, and biosorption is essential to improve the efficiency of remediation techniques. Mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation technique that has become increasingly popular in recent years as fungi are known to produce various effective extracellular enzymes that have the potential to neutralize a wide variety of xenobiotics released into the environment. Hence, mycoremediation appears to be a promising technique for the removal of a wide array of toxins and pharmaceutical residues from a damaged environment and wastewater. This study primarily aimed to investigate whether white-rot fungus (Lentinula edodes) can be utilized for the bioremediation of common antifungal agent terbinafine, which is mainly available in the market as powder or cream. The cultures of L. edodes were cultivated in the medium containing terbinafine powder or terbinafine 1% cream, each at a final concentration of 0.1 mg mL(-1). The addition of terbinafine in powder form have a negative effect on biomass growth (p < 0.05). The total amount of terbinafine in the dry weight of mycelium after culture was estimated to be 7.63 +/- 0.45 mg and 12.52 +/- 2.46 mg for powder and cream samples, respectively. In addition, there were no traces of terbinafine in any of the samples of medium used for culturing L. edodes after the experimental duration period. The biodegradation products of terbinafine were identified for the first time using UPLC/MS/MS. The biodegradation of terbinafine resulted in the loss of 1-naphthylmethanol, which occurred via oxidative deamination, N-demethylation, or tert-butyl group hydroxylation. The results of the study demonstrate that L. edodes mycelium can be effectively used for the remediation of terbinafine.

AB The removal and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water treatment systems is of interest given the widespread occurrence of CECs in water supplies and increase in direct potable reuse of wastewater. In this study, CEC removal was investigated in pilot-scale biologically-active granular activated carbon (GAC)-sand and anthracite-sand filters under different hydraulic loading rates and influent CEC concentrations over a 15-month period. Eight of the most commonly detected compounds in a survey of CEC occurrence in drinking water were selected for this study: atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, metolachlor, sulfamethoxazole and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). GAC-sand biofilters provided superior CEC removal for all compounds (mean removal efficiencies: 49.1-94.4%) compared to anthracite-sand biofilters (mean removal efficiencies: 0-66.1%) due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation. Adsorption was determined to be the dominant removal mechanism for most selected CECs, except fluoxetine, which had the greatest biodegradation rate constant (0.93 0.15 min(-1) at 20-28 degrees C). The mean removal efficiency decreased by 16.5% when the loading rate increased from 2 to 4 gpm/ft(2) (4.88-9.76 m/h). A significant reduction in CEC removal was observed after 100,000 bed volumes when the influent CEC concentration was low (100-200 ng/L), whereas no significant reduction was observed during spike dosing (1000-3000 ng/L). A regression analysis suggested that biodegradation rate, hydraulic loading rate, influent CEC concentration, throughput, influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and CEC charge are important parameters for predicting CEC removal performance in GAC-sand biofilters.

AB Paracetamol and its toxic transformation products have been found in surface water, wastewater, and drinking water. Effective methods to degrade these products must be found to reduce their detrimental effects on microorganisms in aquatic systems and minimize the concern on human health. Thus, this study looked into the electrochemical oxidation of paracetamol and its oxidation products on surface water, and results were compared with those of paracetamol synthetic solution oxidation. Degradation of paracetamol was conducted using a stainless steel electrode cell, a pH of 3, and direct current densities of 5.7mA/cm(2) (6V) and 7.6mA/cm(2) (12V). For both current densities applied, the pharmaceutical and its oxidation products observed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) at 254nm were totally degraded. Faster degradation of paracetamol was observed at a higher current density. Indeed, 95% of paracetamol was oxidized in only 15min at the 7.6mA/cm(2) current density. In comparison to the paracetamol synthetic solution's oxidation, degradation of paracetamol was faster in the surface water than the synthetic solution, at 5.7mA/cm(2). Nevertheless, at 7.6mA/cm(2), total degradation of paracetamol in surface water was delayed up to 40min, versus 7.5min in the synthetic solution. Three oxidation products, observed by HPLC-DAD at 254nm, were fully oxidized. In comparison with the paracetamol synthetic solution, degradation of the oxidation products in surface water was faster than in synthetic solutions for both current densities. Furthermore, the 7.6mA/cm(2) current density resulted in faster degradation of oxidation products. Results obtained from this work are promising for practical applications because short reaction times and low current densities are needed for degradation of paracetamol and its oxidation products. These densities can be potentially supplied by photovoltaic cells.

AB The pharmaceutical products are emerging pollutants continuously released into the environment, because they cannot be effectively removed by the wastewater treatment plants. In recent years, questions have been raised concerning the environmental risks related to these pollutants. The goal of this research was to evaluate the responses in Lemna minor after 7 days and in Corbicula fluminea after differing durations (1, 3, 7, and 19 days) of exposure to the psychoactive drug mixture (valproic acid, citalopram, carbamazepine, cyamemazine, hydroxyzine, oxazepam, norfluoxetine, lorazepam, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in different concentrations (0, 0 + ethanol, drug concentration (DC) 1 = river water concentration, DC2 = effluent concentration, and DC3 = 10x effluent concentration). In this aim, growth parameters of L. minor, gluthathione S-transferase (GSTs), catalase (CAT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and/or gene expressions (pi-gst, cat, cytochrome P450 4 (cyp4), multidrug resistant 1 (mdr1), and superoxide dismutase (sod)) were measured. GST activities increased significantly in L. minor exposed to DC3, but no changes were found in CAT activity. In C. fluminea, EROD activity was induced significantly in both gill and digestive gland tissues after 3 days' exposure to DC3, while a GST increase was observed only in digestive gland tissues, suggesting that these pharmaceuticals induced an oxidative effect. Gene expression analysis revealed transient transcriptomic responses of cyp4, sod, and mdr1 under drug concentrations 2 or 3 and no change of expression for the other genes (cat and pi-gst) or condition (environmental drug concentration) tested. Finally, the data reported in this study represent important ecotoxicological information, confirming that this enzyme family (cyp4, sod, and mdr1) may be considered as a sensible and early indicator of exposure to drugs and emphasizing the involvement of selected genes in detoxification pathways.

AB Benzotriazole (BT) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5-MeBT) are broadly used in industrial applications, such as anti-icing fluids and dishwashing detergent, and act as the primary building blocks for UV absorbers and photostabilizers. This study examined the occurrence of these two compounds in the environment and their unique photochemical behavior affecting photosensitizers and other micro-organic pollutants in aqueous environments. BT and 5-MeBT were detected in all river water samples from the major rivers in Taipei City in the concentration ranges of 147 to 1560 ng/L and 22 to 235 ng/L, respectively, and both compounds persisted through a conventional wastewater treatment plant. The direct photolysis half-lives of BT and 5-MeBT were 56.9 and 14.0 h, respectively. The half-life of photolysis in river water for BT was 44.2 h, whereas the half-life of 5-MeBT was 24.7 h. The long half-lives in real-water matrices resulted in their prevalence in water bodies, and these compounds were also found to minimize the photosensitizing ability of nitrate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) and increase the persistence of other micro-organic pollutant. With BT present, the production of center dot OH in nitrate photolysis was reduced, the degradation of DOM under sunlight was hindered, and the photodegradation of pharmaceutical residues in surface water, such as methotrexate, was completely impeded. This study suggests that in cases in which BT and 5-MeBT are highly concentrated, the effectiveness of natural attenuation process, i.e., photodegradation, in the aqueous environment is diminished, which increases the persistence of the pollutants as well as the risk of exposure.

AB The elimination of organic carbon, nitrogen, five emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and fluorescence signature was evaluated in two treatment lines comprising different constructed wetland (CW) configurations: (i) partially saturated vertical subsurface flow (SVF) wetland (treatment line 1) and (ii) unsaturated vertical subsurface flow (UVF), horizontal subsurface flow (HF) and free water surface (FWS) wetlands in series (treatment line 2). Results showed important differences between the different CW configurations. The highest removal of BOD5 (81%), COD (67%), TOC (72%) and fluorescing organic matter were observed in the UVF wetland, whereas the HF and FWS wetlands were the most efficient units for total nitrogen removal (60 and 69%, respectively). The SVF wetland showed a greater performance in the reduction of total nitrogen than the UVF bed (52 vs. 35%). In addition, the SVF wetland exhibited a higher removal of the EOCs caffeine (95 vs. 90%), trimethoprim (99 vs. 87%) and sulfamethoxazole (64 vs. 4%), as opposed to DEET (34 vs. 63%), whose removal was superior in the UVF unit. Sucralose was negligibly removed in all the CWs. PARAFAC analysis of fluorescence measurements revealed that the proteinaceous tryptophan-like fluorescent component was the most highly removed one in all the investigated CWs (> 28%) and, particularly, in the UVF wetland (66%), whereas humic and fulvic-like components resulted recalcitrant to decomposition. Increases of fluorescence intensities were often observed for fulvic-like substances in CWs operating with saturation of the bed, and these were particularly relevant in the SVF unit. Finally, important correlations (r > 0.7) between the tryptophan-like fluorescent component and the wastewater quality parameters COD and BOD5 suggest fluorescence spectroscopy as an useful monitoring tool for water treatment efficiency in CW systems.

AB The present work aims at evaluating the ability of the River Tiber natural microbial community to degrade naproxen in water samples collected downstream from a wastewater treatment plant. For this purpose, different water microcosms were set up (microbiologically active vs sterile ones) and treated with naproxen (100 mu g/L) alone or in the co-presence of gemfibrozil in order to evaluate if the co-presence of the latter had an influence on naproxen degradation. The experiment was performed in the autumn and was compared with the same experimental set performed in spring of the same year to highlight if seasonal differences in the river water influenced the naproxen degradation. Pharmaceutical concentrations and microbial analysis (total cell number, viability, and microbial community composition) were performed at different times in the degradation experiments. The overall results show that the natural microbial community in the river water had a key role in the naproxen degradation. In fact, although there was a transient negative effect on the natural microbial community in all the experiments (3 h after adding the pharmaceutical), the latter was able to degrade naproxen within about 40 days. On the contrary, no decrease in the pharmaceutical concentration was observed in the sterile river water. Moreover, the co-presence of the two drugs lengthened the naproxen lag phase. As regards the natural microbial community composition detected by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization, Alpha and Gamma-Proteobacteria increased when the pharmaceutical halved, suggesting their role in the degradation. This study shows that with the concentration studied, naproxen was degraded by the natural microbial populations collected from a river chronically contaminated by this pharmaceutical.

AB In this study, pH-sensitive polysulfone (PSf)/polyactylic acid (PAA) nanofiltration membranes were synthesized for separation of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, amoxicillin separation was enhanced by pH of filtration environment. In order to do so, a flat sheet ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with different pore sizes was prepared by the phase inversion process. A further layer of polyacrylic acid which is sensitive to filtration media pH was grafted onto this fabricated PSf UF membrane surface by UV-initiated graft. Efficiency of amoxicillin separation improved as a result of pH-sensitive nature of amoxicillin as well as surface activity and pH-sensitivity of developed nanofiltration membranes. The results confirmed that increase in molecular weight of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the pore forming agent in the phase inversion stage, increased the pore size, the amount of acrylic acid deposition on the membrane walls and pH-sensitivity. Also, an increase in grafting intensity decreased the pore sizes and increased their surface charges as well as amoxicillin separation. AFM analysis showed that surface roughness decreases which reflect the reduction in deposition of acrylic acid onto membrane surface valleys. Since the membrane pores are electrically charged, which was confirmed by zeta potential measurement, when the pH of solution increases, the amoxicillin separation by these pH-sensitive membranes increases. Finally, the amoxicillin separation of synthesized nanofiltration membranes at pH = 10 successfully reached relatively high amount of 91%, while acceptable flux of 108.31 h(-1) m(2) was maintained. The SEM images also confirmed increase in membrane pore sizes due to increase of PEG molecular weight. The FUR analysis revealed that the amount of amoxicillin fouled on the membrane surface declined at higher pH due to high repulsion of amoxicillin by membrane. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Small organic molecules, and specifically micropollutants, pose known hazards to human health, but their removal is particularly challenging in water treatment. Our work demonstrates promising single-layer nanoporous graphene (NPG) membranes with high water permeability and varying degrees of selectivity against common organic contaminants, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seven target organic molecules are considered-including methanol, urea, ethanol, 2-propanol, n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), pyrrole, and phenol-to understand the molecular parameters that govern organic removal. We systematically study molecular transport dynamics and energetics through membranes having varying sizes of pores with hydrophobic (hydrogenated) and hydrophilic (hydroxylated) functionalizations. We find that NPG membranes with smaller, hydroxylated pores offer higher water/organic permselectivity compared to those with larger, hydrogenated pores, as they impede the transport of organics while facilitating the transport of water. Molecular size is the primary organic parameter that controls transport. Larger organic molecules have a greater affinity for the membrane and pore groups (interfacial-affinity sieving), but they are more hindered from entering the pore (pore-size sieving). There is a net decrease in transport with increased molecular size, which suggests that poresize sieving is the governing mechanism for most of the molecular separations. We further find that traditional measures of organic hydrophobicity are not strong predictors of transport, as they correlate poorly with interfacial affinity, and the contribution of dehydration to the energy barrier of permeation is limited, though nonnegligible. Finally, our simulations show that organic-pore interactions are not pressure independent: as flow rate is decreased, the effects of interfacial-affinity sieving become more pronounced. In short, this study establishes a comprehensive understanding of membrane and molecular parameters to guide the design of effective NPG membranes for organic contaminant removal, particularly in desalination and wastewater reuse.

AB A systematic monitoring campaign of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (PPCPs) was performed in the Taige Canal basin, which is located in a rural area of the Yangtze River Delta. A total of 55 out of 61 monitored PPCPs were detected, with concentrations up to 647 ng/L. The maximum concentrations of 75% of monitored antibiotics and 80% of non-antibiotics were above the median values of previously reported maximum concentrations in China, indicating that the basin is heavily contaminated. It is estimated that the PPCP mass flow of the Taige Canal (0.06-0.58 kg/day) entering into Lake Taihu is similar to that of the influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Analysis of the seasonal variation shows that, during the wet season, the average total concentration of sulfonamides was 8 and 11 times that of the normal season and dry season, respectively. The concentration of sulfachlorpyridazine accounted for 40.37% of total antibiotics, suggesting heavy pollution from the animal-breeding industry in this area. The PPCP mass flow rates observed in 2019 were lower than those of 2015 in the same season, and this interannual variation is mainly attributable to water pollution controls in the watershed. Combined analysis of ordination and clustering indicates that the distribution of PPCPs in the Taige Canal is affected by the confluence with Yong'an River and human activities such as water pollution control. Water-sediment distribution analysis demonstrates that the sediment-water distribution coefficients of quinolone and macrolide were higher than those of sulfonamide, lincosamide and chloramphenicol.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is a known problem worldwide. Paracetamol is widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic. Its high consumption implies a continuous discharge in aqueous environments through industrial and domestic wastewater that requires mitigation and remediation strategies.
   The aim of the present study was to analyse the removal of the paracetamol from aqueous solutions using the adsorption technique. For this, three commercial adsorbents with different textural properties were used: two activated carbons (CAT and CARBOPAL) and silica gel. A series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted at different values of pH (3.0, 7.0 and 10.5) and ionic strength (0.01, 0.5 and 1 M) to investigate the effects on the removal of paracetamol from the aqueous solution. In addition, we investigated the adsorption mechanism using the density functional theory.
   Adsorption was found to be higher in the acidic pH range, as varying pH showed significant influence on the surface charge of the adsorbents and degree of ionization of the paracetamol. Adsorption capacity of the adsorbents increased with an increase in the ionic strength of solution. At 25 degrees C, pH 3, ionic strength 1 M, 167 mg L-1 of adsorbent and initial concentrations of paracetamol between 25 and 150 mg L-1, the maximum adsorption capacity was 560 mg g(-1), 450 mg g(-1) and 95 mg g(-1), for CAT, CARBOPAL and silica respectively. The experimental kinetic data fitted well the pseudo-second order model and the equilibrium isotherm data the Langmuir model. The functional density theory methods provided atomistic details about paracetamol adsorbed on the surface of carbon and silica through molecular modeling.

AB We studied for the first time three ionophore anticoccidial drugs: monensin (MON), lasalocid (LAS), and salinomycin (SAL) as emerging pollutants originating from animal and plant husbandry in surface waters (n=89) in one of the most extensive hydrological basins in South America (Del Plata basin). The soluble fraction of ionophores was pretreated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS/MS at a limit of detection of 1.7 ng.L-1. A statistical approach noted the need to report parameters calculated by methods based on the number of observations and the censorship percentage over substitution methods for more precise estimations of environmental data with a high percentage of left-censored data. Water collectors adjacent to intensive-husbandry facilities, placed in direct runoffs from animal excreta, or in wastewater emissions contained median concentrations of MON and SAL approximately 70 times higher than those found in regional tributaries and main courses of 5 sub-basins of the pampas and mesopotamic regions, thus exhibiting a relevance to other similar agricultural pollutants widely reported as pesticides. Chemical speciation of these compounds in surface water was characterized especially for MON and SAL, where the pH and chemical oxygen demand of the natural water body was associated with the concentration of the soluble fraction. The concentrations in abundant rivers such as the Gualeguay deliver a contribution to a natural wetland such as the Parana-River delta, which registered only one sample with a [MON] <= the limit of quantification. Since wetlands possess a limited removal capability, these affluent contributions recorded strongly indicate that attention must be paid to the development of guidelines involving quality criteria for assessing the impact of ionophore antibiotics on such ecosystems.

In this study, the zeta potential behaviors of eight different 0.01 M salts (NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaCl2, Na2CO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4) for 0.9 nm tubular ceramic titanium dioxide NF membrane were measured for the first time using a filtration potential technique by conducting in-situ two electrodes made from a composite material that consisted of pure silver and 4% gauge 21 gold. The measurements were conducted under pH 3-9 at an applied transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 0.25-1.5 bar. Experimental results showed that the membranes of the salts were negatively charged at neutral pH and had an isoelectric point (IEP) of pH 3.4-3.8. Membrane zeta potential results were compared and justified using the electrophoresis method for the same membrane. The powder dispersions of the pulverized membrane in this measuring technique were a suspension at a certain salt concentration. Experimental results from the electrophoresis method agreed with those of the filtration potential method, whose IEP was at pH 3.3-3.5. The rejection experiments of the reference solutions (0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl) were conducted at a constant applied TMP of 12 bar. Rejections results showed that both NaCl concentrations were a function of pH. The low rejections were 17% and 21% at pH 3.8 for 0.01 and 0.001 M NaCl, respectively, and the high rejections were 34.2% and 38% at pH 9. This work also investigated the effects of the measured membrane zeta potential on the ion rejection of the standard solution of NaCl (0.01 and 0.001 M) using a similar pH range.

AB This study aims to demonstrate that an up-flow microbial fuel cell-coupled constructed wetland (UCW-MFC) can effectively treat synthetic wastewater that contains a high concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs, 10 mg L-1 level), such as ibuprofen (IBP) and bisphenol A (BPA). A significant decline in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal was observed when BPA was added, which indicated that BPA was more toxic to bacteria. The closed circuit operation of UCW-MFC performed better than the open circuit mode for COD and NH4+-N removal. Similarly, the removal rates of IBP and BPA were increased by 9.3% and 18%, respectively, compared with the open circuit mode. The majority of PPCPs were removed from the bottom and anode layer, which accounted for 63.2-78.7% of the total removal. The main degradation products were identified. The removal rates of IBP and BPA decreased by 14.6% and 23.7% due to a reduction in the hydraulic detention times (HRTs) from 16 h to 4 h, respectively. Electricity generation performance, including voltage and maximum power density, initially increased and then declined with a decrease in the HRT. Additionally, both the current circuit operation mode and the HRT have an impact on the bacterial community diversity of the anode according to the results of high-throughput sequencing. The possible bacterial groups involved in PPCP degradation were identified. In summary, UCW-MFC is suitable for enabling the simultaneous removal of IBP and BPA and successful electricity production.

AB Nitroaromatic Compounds are widely used in agricultural pesticides, pharmaceuticals, military explosives, and other applications. They enter the environment via manufacturing and municipal wastewater discharges and releases from agricultural and military operations. Because of their ubiquity and toxicity, they are considered an important class of environmental contaminants. Nitroaromatics are known to undergo reductive transformation to aromatic amines, and under aerobic conditions they are susceptible to coupling reactions which may lead to their irreversible incorporation into soil organic matter. However, there is also evidence of coupling reactions in the absence of oxygen between reduced intermediates of the insensitive munitions compound 2,4-dinitroanisole, leading to the formation of azo dimers. The formation of such products is a concern since they may be more toxic than the original nitroaromatic compounds. The objective of this research is to provide evidence of the anaerobic formation of azo coupling products. 4-Nitroanisole was used as a model compound and was spiked into incubations containing anaerobic granular sludge with H-2 as the electron donor. Using liquid chromatography, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, the formation of the azo dimer 4,4'-dimethoxyazobenzene was confirmed. However, due to the instability of the azo bond under the reducing conditions of our incubations, the azo dimer did not accumulate. Consequently, 4-aminoanisole was the major product formed in our experiment. Other minor suspected coupling products were also detected in our incubations. The results provide clear evidence for the temporal formation of at least one azo dimer in the anaerobic reduction of a model nitroaromatic compound. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate and transport of estrogen compounds in the environment is of increasing concern due to their potential impact on freshwater organisms, ecosystems and human health. The behavior of these compounds in batch experiments suggests low mobility, while field studies indicate the persistence of estrogen compounds in the soil with the possibility of migration to surface water as well as groundwater. To better understand the movement of these chemicals through soils, we examined their transport in three different Hawaiian soils and two aqueous matrices. The three different soils used were an Oxisol, a Mollisol and a cinder, characterized by different mineralogical properties and collected at depths of 60-90 cm and 210-240 cm. Two liquid matrices were used; deionized (DI) water containing calcium chloride (CaCl2), and recycled water collected from a wastewater treatment facility. The experiments were conducted in packed and structured columns. Non-equilibrium conditions were observed during the study, especially in the structured soil. This is believed to be primarily related to the presence of macropores in the soil. The presence of macropores resulted in reduced contact time between soil and estrogens, which facilitated their transport. We found that the organic carbon content and mineralogical composition of the soils had a profound effect on the transport of the estrogens. The mobility of estrone (El) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was greater in cinder than in the other soils. In column experiments with recycled water, earlier breakthrough peaks and longer tails of estrogens were produced compared to those observed using DI water. The use of recycled water for agricultural purposes and the siting of septic tanks and cesspools should be critically reviewed in light of these findings, especially in areas where groundwater is the primary source of potable water, such as Hawaii.

AB The ubiquitous use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in a continuous discharge into wastewater and pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are found in the environment. Due to their design towards specific drug targets, pharmaceuticals may be therapeutically active already at low environmental concentrations. Several human drug targets are evolutionary conserved in aquatic organisms, raising concerns about effects of these pharmaceuticals in non-target organisms. In this study, we hypothesized that the toxicity of a pharmaceutical towards a non-target invertebrate depends on the presence of the human drug target orthologs in this species. This was tested by assessing toxicity of pharmaceuticals with (miconazole and promethazine) and without (levonorgestrel) identified drug target orthologs in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The toxicity was evaluated using general toxicity endpoints at individual (immobility, reproduction and development), biochemical (RNA and DNA content) and molecular (gene expression) levels. The results provide evidence for higher toxicity of miconazole and promethazine, i.e. the drugs with identified drug target orthologs. At the individual level, miconazole had the lowest effect concentrations for immobility and reproduction (0.3 and 0.022 mg L-1, respectively) followed by promethazine (1.6 and 0.18 mg L-1, respectively). At the biochemical level, individual RNA content was affected by miconazole and promethazine already at 0.0023 and 0.059 mg L-1, respectively. At the molecular level, gene expression for cuticle protein was significantly suppressed by exposure to both miconazole and promethazine; moreover, daphnids exposed to miconazole had significantly lower vitellogenin expression. Levonorgestrel did not have any effects on any endpoints in the concentrations tested. These results highlight the importance of considering drug target conservation in environmental risk assessments of pharmaceuticals.

   January 2001
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE pharmaceuticals; environmental risk assessment; European Union; tiered
   assessment; Draft Guideline 2001
AB Since 1993, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for a new drug application has been Stipulated by EU Directive 93/39/EEC amending Directive 65/65/EEC. In early 2001, after several unpublished draft versions for an ERA guideline, a draft guideline/discussion paper for an ERA for non-GMO-containing drugs was published by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The draft guideline describes a step-wise. tiered procedure for the ERA. The first tier consists of deriving a crude predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in the aquatic compartment for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or its major metabolites, based on predicted amounts used and specific removal rates in sewage treatment or surface waters. If this crude PEC is <0.01 mug/l and no environmental concerns are apparent, no further assessment is deemed necessary. Else, in the second tier, a crude predicted no-effect level (PNEC) for the aquatic compartment is to be extrapolated by dividing the lowest 50%-effect concentration from acute ecotoxicity tests with algae, daphnia or fish (EC50, LC50) by an assessment factor (usually 1000). If the ratio PEC/PNEC is < 1, no further assessment is deemed necessary. Lastly, in the third tier, further considerations on a case-by-case basis are needed. This may encompass refining the environmental fate information and thereby the PEC, considering further environmental compartments and their respective PECs (up to and including field studies), but also refining the PNEC. While the ERA addresses mainly the API, excipients of the formulated drug should be considered as well. In the case of medicinal products, the benefit for patients has relative precedence over environmental risks, meaning that even in the case of an unacceptable residual risk for new drugs after third-tier considerations, prohibition of a new API is not taken into consideration. Instead, possible mitigating or precautionary safety measures may consist of specific product labelling (i.e. package leaflets for the patients regarding returning and proper disposal of unused medicines), restricted use through in-hospital or in-surgery administration under supervision only, or the recommendation of environmental analytical monitoring up to ecological field studies.

AB A tube-in-tube membrane reactor, with radial addition of hydrogen peroxide, was used for the oxidation of four pharmaceuticals, paracetamol (PCT), furosemide (FRS), nimesulide (NMD), and diazepam (DZP), in a continuous-mode operation, using photochemical and photocatalytic processes, driven by UVA or UVC photons. This reactor allows a controlled titration of small H2O2 doses (inside-out mode) to the catalyst particles immobilized in the membrane shell side and to the annular space between the membrane inner tubing and the concentric outer quartz tubing, where water to be treated flows. Tests were performed using synthetic (SWW) and real (urban wastewater after secondary treatment) (UWW) matrices, both spiked with the pharmaceutical mix solution (200 mu g L(-1 )of each). The photochemical and photocatalytic oxidation efficiency was evaluated as a function of H2O2 dose (5-20 mg L-1), oxidant injection mode (radial permeation vs injection upstream from the reactor inlet), light source (UVA vs UVC lamps) and aqueous matrix (synthetic vs real matrix). At steadystate regime, the UVC/H2O2/TiO2 system, with radial H2O2 addition (20 mg L-1), showed the highest pharmaceuticals removal percentage, PCT (27.4%), FRS (35.0%), NMD (24.2%) and DZP (30.0%) in SWW. A substantial decrease in pharmaceuticals elimination was observed for UWW (PCT - 11.5%, FRS - 20.3%, NMD - 8.2% and DZP - 12.6%), in comparison with the SWW matrix. Finally, twelve transformation products (TPs) were identified; most of them showed in their structures hydroxylation in aromatic moiety; all TPs chemical structures were evaluated by BIOWIN software indicating that the TPs arc non-biodegradables.

AB Multi-drug resistant microbes, pathogenic viruses, metals, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water has become the crux of urban sustainability issues. However, vulnerability due to pollutant concurrences, source apportionment, and identification of better faecal indicators needs to be better understood. The present study focuses on the vulnerability of urban Guwahati, the largest city in Northeastern India, through analyzing the concurrence of PPCPs, enteric viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, metal, and faecal contamination in water. The study strives to identify a relevant marker of anthropogenic pollution for the Indian scenario. Samples from the Brahmaputra River (n = 4), tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain; n = 3), and Ramsar recognized Lake (Dipor Bil; n = 1) indicate caffeine > acetaminophen > theophylline > carbamazepine > crotamiton for PPCPs and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) > aichi > hepatitis A > norovirus GII > norovirus GI for enteric viruses. PMMoV was the better indicator of faecal pollution due to its prevalence, specificity and ease of detection. Antibiotic resistance was neither correlated with the prevalence of PPCPs nor E. coli. As, Co and Mn appear to be inducing antibiotic resistance in E. coli. While the risk quotient of the urban drain (Bharalu River) indicates one order higher magnitude than reported for other Indian rivers, the Lake exhibited the least pollution and better resilience. The concurrence of pollutants and multi-drug resistant E. coli, owing to the complete absence of wastewater treatment, puts the city in a highly vulnerable state. Pollution is being regulated only by the dilution capability of the Brahmaputra River, which needs to be further researched for seasonal variation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study focuses on the intensification of heterogeneous TiO2 photocatalysis for the removal of a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC), oxytetracycline (OTC), as a polishing step of urban wastewaters, using an innovative NETmix mili-photoreactor under UVA-LEDs illumination. The effect of catalyst coated surface per reactor volume and the illumination mechanism, back-side (BSI) or front-side (FSI) irradiation, on arc oxidation were evaluated. For that, a thin film of photocatalyst was uniformly deposited on the front borosilicate slab (BS) (BSI mechanism; 333 m(catalyst)(2)m(reactor)(-3)) or on the network of channels and chambers imprinted in the back stainless-steel slab (SSS) (FSI mechanism; 989 m(catalyst)(2)m(reactor)(-3)) using a spray system. OTC removal was also assessed as a function of TiO2 film thickness immobilized on both slabs. The photocatalyst reactivity in combination with photoreactor was significantly enhanced (3.4 times) from 0.64 to 2.19 mmol(OTC) m(illuminated reactor volume)(-3) s(-1), when considering the BSI and FSI mechanisms, respectively. In addition, the influence of UVA-LEDs intensity on OTC oxidation rate was investigated. UVA-LEDs plates were placed on the top of the NETmix borosilicate window. Moreover, the effect of water matrix was assessed using a secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant fortified with OTC. OTC oxidation rate was only inhibited in about 1.3 times in the presence of the real matrix, showing the ability of the NETrnix to overcome matrix effects due to its unique characteristics. Catalyst film stability over four consecutive reaction cycles was evaluated using synthetic and real matrices fortified with OTC. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Metformin (MET), CAS 1115-70-4 (Metformin hydrochloride), is an antidiabetic drug with high usage in North America and Europe and has become the subject of regulatory interest. A pharmaceutical industry working group investigated environmental risks of MET. Environmental fate and chronic effects data were collated across the industry for the present risk assessment. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for MET were modeled for the USA and Europe using the PhATE and GREAT-ER models, respectively. PECs were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) for the USA and Europe. A predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 1 mg/L for MET was derived by deterministic procedures, applying an assessment factor of 10 to the lowest no observed effect concentration (i.e., 10 mg/L) from multiple chronic studies with algae, daphnids and fish. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios were <1, indicating no significant risk for MET with high Margins of Safety (MOS) of >868. MET is known to degrade during wastewater treatment to guanylurea (GUU, CAS 141-83-3), which we have shown to further degrade. There are no GUU toxicity data in the literature; hence, chronic studies for GUU were conducted to derive a PNEC of 0.16 mg/L. PECs were derived for GUU as for MET, plus MECs were retrieved from the literature. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios for GUU were also <1, with an MOS of >6.5. Based on standard risk assessment procedures for both MET and its transformation product GUU, there is no significant risk to aquatic life. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals entering aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluents are of increasing concern for wild animals. Because some pharmaceuticals are designed to modulate human behaviour, measuring the impacts of exposure to pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour has become a valuable endpoint. While laboratory studies have shown that pharmaceuticals can affect fish behaviour, there is a lack of understanding if behaviour is similarly affected in natural environments. Here, we exposed sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts to two concentrations of two pharmaceutical pollutants often detected in surface waters: temazepam (a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic) or irbesartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker, anti-hypertensive). We tested the hypothesis that changes to behavioural traits (anxiety and activity) measured in laboratory trials following exposure are predictive of behaviour in the natural environment (downstream migration). Measures of anxiety and activity in the laboratory assay did not vary with temazepam treatment, but temazepam-exposed fish began migrating faster in the field. Activity in the laboratory assay did predict overall migration speed in the field. In contrast to temazepam, we found that irbesartan exposure did not affect behaviour in the laboratory, field, or the relationship between the two end-points. However, irbesartan was also not readily taken up into fish tissue (i.e. below detection levels in the muscle tissue), while temazepam bioconcentrated (bioconcentration factor 7.68) rapidly (t(1/2) < 24 h). Our findings add to a growing literature showing that benzodiazepine pollutants can modulate fish behaviour and that laboratory assays may be less sensitive at detecting the effects of pollutants compared to measuring effects in natural settings. Therefore, we underscore the importance of measuring behavioural effects in the natural environment.

AB Personal care products (PCPs) are used globally wherever there is human activity, and are typically emitted to the environment in wastewater under normal use. Regulators and scientists have thus begun focusing on PCPs as a potential water quality concern. PCP manufacturers are increasingly motivated to leverage available data on potential exposure and hazards to the natural environment to guide sustainable decision making and minimize the potential for products to cause adverse environmental effects. We describe a novel algorithm to: select data on environmental exposure and hazard potential relevant to PCP ingredients after use, evaluate and interpret those data, and translate the information to a single numeric score usable by non-specialists to incorporate environmental protection goals into PCP sustainability decision making. The algorithm has been implemented as the Global Aquatic Ingredient Assessment (GAIA) database tool, incorporating information on environmental persistence, bio-accumulation potential, aquatic toxicity of the parent compound and degradants, excess toxicity from ecological endocrine disruption effects, and the potential for producing photochemical smog. GAIA quantifies environmental hazard potential using an algorithm allowing it to be used as a risk surrogate for PCP product use. GAIA data are also used in environmental risk assessments with product-specific exposure data as a final check during product reformulation or as a post hoc measure of progress toward corporate sustainability goals. Scoring results are demonstrated for eight representative substances: benzophenone-4, ethylene diamine tetraacetate salts, ethylhexylglycerin, menthol, methyl salicylate, musk xylene, phenoxyethanol, and zinc oxide. Case studies show how GAIA scores, used as a front-line decision tool, led to environmental risk reductions in two cases: a newly developed surfactant and a reformulated cleansing product.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a biorecalcitrant pharmaceutical compound frequently detected in wastewater and water bodies which has numerous negative effects on living organisms. In this investigation the effect of electrocatalytically generated active chlorine on CBZ degradation was studied using Nb/BDD or Ti/IrO2 anodes. Subsequently, a response surface methodology based on a factorial plan and central composite design was carried out to determine the contribution of individual factors and to obtain the optimal experimental parameters for CBZ abatement. Electric current and treatment time were found to be the pivotal parameters influencing the degradation efficiency with respective contributions of 45.19% and 35.44%. The anode material had lower influence on the response, however, using an Nb/BDD anode, the oxidation was more effective due to the increased production of center dot OH radicals as well as HClO, Cl center dot and ClO- species. Considering CBZ degradation and energetic consumption, the percentage of degraded CBZ was 88.70 +/- 0.35% consuming 1.07 kWh m(-3) (at 1.0 A, NaCl concentration of 14 mM after 12.45 min, using Nb/BDD anode). First order kinetic constant (k) value of 0.189 min(-1) was obtained at optimal conditions when demineralized water was used for the NaCl supporting electrolyte, while k was lower when tap water or treated wastewaters were used for this purpose. Oxidation of CBZ yielded six aromatic intermediates, identified by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry technique and degradation pathways were proposed. The performed acute toxicity tests indicated an increase during the treatment, which was demonstrated to be mainly attributed to the remnant active chlorine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We developed a multiresidue method for the target and suspect screening of more than 180 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, biocides, additives, corrosion inhibitors, musk fragrances, UV light stabilizers, and industrial chemicals in sediments. Sediment samples were freeze-dried, extracted by pressurized liquid extraction, and cleaned up by liquid liquid partitioning. The quantification and identification of target compounds with a broad range of physicochemical properties (log K-ow 0-12) was carried out by liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) coupled to high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). The overall method average recoveries and precision are 103% and 9% (RSD), respectively. The method detection limits range from 0.010 to 4 ng/g(dw), while limits of quantification range from 0.030 to 14 ng/g(dw). The use of APPI as an alternative ionization source helped to distinguish two isomeric musk fragrances by means of different ionization behavior. The method was demonstrated on sediment cores from Lake Greifensee located in northeastern Switzerland. The results show that biocides, musk fragrances, and other personal care products were the most frequently detected compounds with concentrations ranging from pg/g(dw) to ng/g(dw), whereas none of the targeted pharmaceuticals were found. The concentrations of many urban contaminants originating from wastewater correlate with the highest phosphorus input into the lake as a proxy for treatment efficiency. HAMS enabled a retrospective analysis of the full-scan data acquisition allowing the detection of suspected compounds like quaternary ammonium surfactants, the biocide triclocarban, and the tentative identification of further compounds without reference standards, among others transformation products of triclosan and triclocarban.

AB The aim of our research was to develop a chromatographic method for simultaneous determination of five substances used as disinfectant agents.
   Biphenyl-2-ol (BPh), chloramine T (ChT), 4-chloro-3-methylphenol (4C3M-Ph), triclosan (TCS), and triclocarban (TCC) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Chromatographic analyses were carried out on a Develosil RP Aqueous AR-5 RP-30 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5.0 mu m particles) with gradient elution of mobile phase including methanol and water, and with a DAD detector. Satisfactory resolution of the determined substances was obtained in 10 minutes. The linearity ranges of the calibration curves (in matrix) of examined disinfectants ranged from 0.10 to 10.00 mu g.mL(-1) for ChT, 4C3MPh and TCC, and from 0.25 to 10.00 mu g.mL(-1) for BPh and TCS. The developed method was applied to determine of mentioned compounds in water samples.
   Water samples were prepared for chromatography analyses by using C18 solid phase extraction discs. The recoveries of analyzed substances ranged from 82 to 101% (except for Chloramine T, which is unstable in water medium). Analyses were operated after extraction of analytes from 3 L of real water samples. The method detection limits in samples of water were: 1.6 ng.mL(-1) for BPh, 0.6 ng.mL(-1) for ChT, 1.4 ng.mL(-1) for 4C3MPh, 1.9 ng.mL(-1) for TCS, and 1.0 ng.mL(-1) for TCC.
   This method was successfully applied to analyze examined disinfectants in surface water samples collected from rivers and wastewater in Poland. Four of five compounds were detected in the tested samples in the concentration ranging from 5.05 to 30.36 mu g.L-1.

AB Electro-Fenton (EF) and peroxyelectrocoagulation (PEC) processes were investigated to mineralize 10 mg L-1 erythromycin from ultrapure water, evaluating the influence of the anode material (BDD and Fe), current density (j(anode)) (5 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2)), oxygen flowrate injected to the cathode (0.8 L min(-1) O-2 and 2.0 L min(-1) O-2) and pH (2.8, 5.0 and 7.0) on the process efficiency and the electricity costs. 70% mineralization was reached after applying 0.32 A h L-1 under the best operational conditions: PEC treatment at 5 mA cm(-2), 2.0 L min(-1) O-2 and pH 2.8. The electricity consumption of the electrochemical cell under these conditions was approximately 0.3 kWh m(-3). Early-stage intermediates produced from erythromycin degradation were identified and quantified throughout the treatment and a potential erythromycin degradation pathway was proposed. The most appropriate operational conditions tested with synthetic solutions were applied to treat a real effluent from the tertiary treatment of an urban wastewater treatment plant. All emerging compounds listed in the EU Decision 2018/840 (Watch List 2018) were determined before and after the PEC treatment. All listed pollutants were degraded below their quantification limit, except estrone and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol which were 99% removed from water. Electricity consumption of the electrochemical cell was 0.4 kWh m(-3). Whilst awaiting future results that demonstrate the innocuity of the generated byproducts, the results of this investigation (high removal yields for emerging pollutants together with the low electricity consumption of the cell) indicate the promising high potential of PEC treatment as a water treatment/remediation/regeneration technology.

AB In the present study, comparison of activation efficiencies of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate (PS, Na2S2O8) induced by Fe(III)-Ethylenediamine-NN-disuccinic acid (EDDS) under polychromatic irradiation UVA and visible region at same conditions was studied for the first time. The effects of pH, Fe(III)-EDDS concentration, H2O2 and PS concentrations were investigated. p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPA) was taken as a model pharmaceutical intermediate pollutant to estimate the oxidative process efficiency. In these two systems, the degradation rate of p-HPA increased (not linearly) using higher concentrated solution of H2O2 and Na2S2O8. However, when Fe(III)-EDDS concentration exceeding 250 RIVI, the degradation efficiency of p-HPA began to decrease. Surprisingly, results of pH effects showed that Fe(III)-EDDS/H2O2/UV system presents much higher degradation efficiency than Fe(II)-EDDS/PS/UV whatever the solution pH's, especially in neutral and alkaline solutions. In the Fe(III)-EDDS/H2O2/UV reaction, p-HPA degradation rate (12,A) increased fast from pH 2.5 to 7.5, then it began to decrease when pH increased to 9.0. While ItpHpA started to decrease with pH increase to 3.9 in Fe(III)-EDDS/PS/UV system. To explain this phenomenon, the second order constant of p-HPA (for both molecular and mono-anionic forms) with HO' and SO4- radicals were determined by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments for the first time. Results showed that iCp_HpA jie was higher than kp_HpA,soi for both anionic and molecular forms of pollutant. These results demonstrated that iron-complex induced photo-Fenton process is more efficient than activation of persulfate process, particularly at environmentally closed pH values and sun simulated wavelengths (X > 300 nm).

AB This paper deals with the photochemical fate of two representative carbapenem antibiotics, namely imipenem and meropenem, in aqueous solutions under solar radiation. The analytical method employed for the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices, such as ultrapure water, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, and river water, at environmentally relevant concentrations, was liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry. The absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at pH values from 6 to 8, and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm, while their molar absorption coefficient was in the order from 9 x 10(3)-10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1). The kinetics of the photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors. It was found that the photochemical degradation of both compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10(-3) mol einsten(-1). Several parameters were studied, such as solution pH, the presence of nitrate ions and humic acids, and the effect of water matrix. In all cases, it was found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly, either positively or negatively, to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation. In a final set of photolysis experiments, the effect of the level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 W m(-2).

AB Our previous study demonstrated that high levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Haihe River were directly attributed to the excessive use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. The antibiotic residues of the Xiangjiang River determined in this study were much lower than those of the Haihe River, but the relative abundance of 16 detected ARGs (sul1, sul2 and sul3, qepA, qnrA, qnrB, qnrD and qnrS, tetA, tetB, tetW, tetM, tetQ and tetO, ermB and ermC), were as high as the Haihe River particularly in the downstream of the Xiangjiang River which is close to the extensive metal mining. The ARGs discharged from the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant (PWWTP) are a major source of ARGs in the upstream of the Xiangjiang River. In the downstream, selective stress of heavy metals rather than source release had a significant influence on the distinct distribution pattern of ARGs. Some heavy metals showed a positive correlation with certain ARG subtypes. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between individual ARG subtypes and heavy metal resistance genes, suggesting that heavy metals may co select the ARGs on the same plasmid of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The co-selection mechanism between specific metal and antibiotic resistance was further confirmed by these isolations encoding the resistance genotypes to antibiotics and metals. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the fate and distribution of ARGs under the selective pressure exerted by heavy metals in the catchment scale. These results are beneficial to understand the fate, and to discern the contributors of ARGs from either the source release or the selective pressure by sub-lethal levels of environmental stressors during their transport on a river catchment scale.

AB We collaborated with 26 groups from universities across the United States to sample 42 sites for 33 trace organic compounds (TOCs) in water and sediments of lotic ecosystems. Our goals were 1) to further develop a national database of TOC abundance in United States lotic ecosystems that can be a foundation for future research and management, and 2) to identify factors related to compound abundance. Trace organic compounds were found in 93% of water samples and 56% of sediment samples. Dissolved concentrations were 10-1000x higher relative to sediment concentrations. The ten most common compounds in water samples with detection frequency and maximum concentration were sucralose (87.5%, 12,000 ng/L), caffeine (77.5%, 420 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (70%, 340 ng/L), cotinine (65%, 130 ng/L), venlafaxine (65%, 1800 ng/L), carbamazepine (62.5%, 320 ng/L), triclosan (55%, 6800 ng/L), azithromycin (15%, 970 ng/L), diphenylhydramine (40%, 350 ng/L), and desvenlafaxine (35%, 4600 ng/L). In sediment, the most common compounds were venlafaxine (32.5%, 19 ng/g), diphenhydramine (25%, 41 ng/g), azithromycin (15%, 11 ng/g), fluoxetine (12.5%, 29 ng/g) and sucralose (12.5%, 16 ng/g). Refractory compounds such as sucralose may be good indicators of TOC contamination in lotic ecosystems, as there was a correlation between dissolved sucralose concentrations and with the total number of compounds detected in water. Discharge and human demographic (population size) characteristics were not good predictors of compound abundance in water samples. This study further confirms the ubiquity of TOCs in lotic ecosystems. Although concentrations measured rarely approached acute aquatic-life criteria, the chronic effects, bioaccumulative potential, or potential mixture effects of multiple compounds are relatively unknown.

AB This study evaluated the effects of halide ions (chloride and bromide) on the degradation of acetaminophen, a widely used drug, with the UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation treatment. Chloride showed minimal effects on the acetaminophen degradation, whereas increasing bromide concentration reduced the degradation rate because bromide promoted the formation of Br-2(center dot-) which had a lower reaction rate than OH. Interestingly, acetaminophen degradation was enhanced when both chloride and bromide were present in the solution. This was probably attributed to the high yield of ClBr center dot- radicals predicted by using the Kintecus model. Additional tests using five model compounds (4-chlorophenol, 4-methoxyphenol, 4-hydroxylbenzoic acid, 17 beta-estradiol, and bisphenol A) suggested that CIBr center dot- radicals selectively reacted with electron-rich moieties of the organic pollutants. In the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), increasing concentration of chloride or bromide reduced the degradation rate of acetaminophen. In contrast, with a constant concentration of co-existing chloride, the acetaminophen degradation was promoted by increasing bromide concentration. The product analysis showed that the HO center dot and halide radicals resulted in different pathways of acetaminophen degradation. The HO center dot radicals favored electrophilic aromatic substitution at the ortho and para positions, forming the -OH substituted acetaminophen, whereas halide radicals preferentially led to one-electron oxidation and formation of phenoxyl radicals as intermediates. These results highlight the multiple roles of salinity in water and wastewater treatment. In addition to acting as HO center dot scavengers, halogen radicals may significantly contribute to the organics degradation via their high selectivity towards electron-rich moieties. The resultant intermediate products require further toxicity assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of a full-scale riverbank filtration facility in Colorado was evaluated from initial start-up over a period of seven years including the impact of seasonal variations to determine whether sustainable attenuation of various chemical constituents could be achieved. Both, annual and seasonal average concentrations were determined for several wastewater-derived constituents including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, nitrate, phosphate for the years 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, and trace organic chemicals (TOrC) for years 2009, 2010, and 2012. ANOVA analyses and Student's t-tests were performed to evaluate the consistency of contaminant attenuation at the site. Findings revealed no significant statistical differences for any of the bulk parameters with the exception of phosphate suggesting a highly reliable attenuation of DOC and nitrate from start-up to full-scale performance. Phosphate attenuation, however, exhibited a steady decline, which was likely attributed to exhaustion of sorption sites in the subsurface porous media. The river's flow regime influenced both occurrence levels and attenuation of TOrC during riverbank filtration, i.e. less river discharge resulted in higher TOrC concentrations and lower proportion of river water in the recovered groundwater. Differences in removal performance between annual data sets for caffeine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine were caused by variations in the source; concentrations in riverbank filtrate remained similar over several years. The seasonal assessment for TOrC revealed steady or improving removal between winter and summer seasons based on the statistical analysis with atenolol being the only exception likely due to an increased microbial activity at elevated temperatures.

AB The occurrence, partitioning and risk of eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), nine new brominated (NBFRs) and ten organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) were evaluated in three Spanish rivers suffering different anthropogenic pressures (Nalon, Arga and Besos). OPERs were ubiquitous contaminants in water (Sigma PFRs ranging from 0.0076 to 7.2 mu g L-1) and sediments (Sigma OPERs ranging 3.8 to 824 mu g kg(-1)). Brominated flame retardants were not detected in waters, whereas Sigma PBDEs ranged from 88 to 812 mu g kg(-1) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) reached 435 mu g kg(-1) in sediments from the River Besos, the most impacted river. The occurrence of flame retardants in river water and sediment was clearly associated with human activities, since the highest levels occurred near urban and industrial zones and after wastewater treatment plants discharge. Daphnia magna toxicity was carried out for OPERs, the most ubiquitous flame retardants, considering individual compounds and mixtures. Toxicity of nine tested OPERs differed largely among compounds, with EC50 values ranging over three magnitude orders (031-381 mg L-1). Results evidenced that these compounds act by non-polar narcosis, since their toxicity was proportional to their lipophilicity (K-ow). Furthermore, their joint toxicity was additive, which means that single and joint toxicity can be predicted knowing their concentration levels in water using quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) and predictive mixture models. Based on these results, a risk assessment considering joint effect was performed calculating and summing risk quotients (RQs) for the water and sediment samples. No significant risk to D. magna (Sigma RQs <1) was observed for any of the monitored rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anti-tumour agents and their metabolites are largely excreted into effluent, along with other pharmaceuticals. In the past, investigations have focused on the input and analysis of pharmaceuticals in surface and ground water. The two oxazaphosphorine compounds, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are important cytostatic drugs used in the chemotherapy of cancer and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Their mechanism of action, involving metabolic activation and unspecific alkylation of nucleophilic compounds, accounts for genotoxic and carcinogenic effects described in the literature and is reason for environmental concern. The anti-tumour agents cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) were not biodegraded in biodegradation tests. They were not eliminated in municipal sewage treatment plants. Degradation by photochemically formed HO radicals may be of some relevance only in shallow, clear, and nitrate-rich water bodies but could be further exploited for elimination of these compounds by advanced oxidation processes, i.e. in a treatment of hospital waste water. Therefore, CP and IF are assumed to persist in the aquatic environment and to enter drinking water via surface water. The risk to humans from input of CP and IF into surface water is not known.
   The local and regional, i.e. nationwide predicted environmental concentration (PEC(local), PEC(regional)) of CP and IF was calculated for German surface water. Both compounds were measured in hospital effluents, and in the influent and effluent of a municipal treatment plant. Additionally, published concentrations in the effluent of sewage treatment plants and surface water were used for risk assessment. Excretion rates were taken into account. For a worst-case scenario, maximum possible ingestion of CP or IF by drinking 2 L a day of unprocessed surface water over a life span of 70 years was calculated for adults. Elimination in drinking water processing was neglected, as no data is available. This intake was compared with intake during anti-cancer treatment.
   Intake of CP and IF for anti-cancer treatment is typically 10 g within a few months. Under such conditions, a relative risk of 1.5 for the carcinogenic compounds CP and IF is reported in the literature. In the worst case, the maximum possible intake by drinking water is less than 10(-3) (IF) and 10(-5) (CP) of this amount, based on highest measured local concentrations. On a nationwide average, the factor is approx. 10(-6) or less.
   The additional intake of CP and IF due to their emission into surface water and its use without further treatment as drinking water is low compared to intake within a therapy. This approach has shortcomings. It illustrates the current lack of methodology and knowledge for the specific risk assessment of carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. IF and CP are directly reacting with the DNA. Therefore, with respect to health effects a safe threshold concentration for these compounds cannot be given. The resulting risk is higher for newborns and children than for adults. Due to the lack of data the risk for newborns and children cannot be assessed fully. The data presented here show that according to present knowledge the additional risk of cancer cannot be fully excluded, especially with respect to children. Due to the shortage of data for effects of CP and IF in low doses during a whole lifespan, possible effects were assessed using data of high doses of CP and IF within short-term ingestion, i.e. therapy. This remains an unresolved issue. Anyway, the risk assessment performed here could give a rough measure of the risks on the one hand and the methodological shortcomings on the other hand which are connected to the assessment of the input of genotoxic and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals such as CP and IF into the aquatic environment. Therefore, we recommend to take measures to reduce the input of CP and IF and other carcinogenic pharmaceuticals. We hope that our manuscript further stimulates the discussion about the human risk assessment for carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.
   CP and IF are carcinogens. With respect to newborn and children, reduction of the emission of CP and IF into effluent and surface water is recommended at least as a precautionary measure. The collection of unused and outdated drugs is a suitable measure. Collection of patients' excreta as a measure of input reduction is not recommended. Data suitable for the assessment of the risk for newborn and children should be collected in order to perform a risk assessment for these groups. This can stimulate discussion and give new insights into risk assessment for pharmaceuticals in the environment. Our study showed that in the long term, effective risk management for the reduction of the input of CP and IF are recommendable.

AB Dye removal over the surface of activated carbon is a well-established approach for the treatment of wastewater effluents from pharmaceutical, food, and textile industries. Tuning the surface chemistry of the adsorbent plays a vital role in improving the dye adsorption performance. Herein, we report the mechanistic insights from first-principles calculations on the removal of common anionic dyes using nitrogen-enriched carbon sheets. The adsorption characteristics and chemical reactivity patterns of methyl blue, methyl orange, and methyl red were thoroughly accounted for based on their computed reactivity descriptors, adsorption energies, and structural and electronic properties. Nitrogen enrichment of the carbon sheet resulted in the significant decrease in the energy gap and global hardness values, suggesting an improvement in charge transfer efficacy and dye adsorption capacity. Among the three dyes investigated, methyl blue exhibited the lowest energy gap of 0.960 and 1.064 eV and the global hardness of 0.480 and 0.532 eV at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) and the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory, respectively, displaying a higher electrostatic attraction toward nitrogen-enriched carbon sheets in accordance with the hard-soft acid-base principle. Predicted adsorption energies of 28.69, 13.18, and 16.90 kcal/mol at 6-31G(d); and 28.91, 12.08, and 16.88 kcal/mol at 6-311G(d,p) basis sets were obtained for methyl blue, methyl orange, and methyl red, respectively, suggesting the selectivity of the nitrogen-enriched carbon sheet to the methyl blue dye. Further, the protonation of the nitrogen-enriched carbon sheets would tune the selectivity of the adsorbent resulting in a significant enhancement of the electrostatic attraction, in line with the experimental findings.

AB Exploring the specific characteristics of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) via adsorption and degradation are scientific and practical significance to control their release to water matrix. In this work, a good adsorbent and ion-exchange material, i.e., titanate nanotubes (TNTs), was employed for adsorption of ciprofloxacin (CIP, a model PPCPs). The adsorption behaviors and mecha-nisms of CIP with different dissociated species by TNTs were studied through both experimental and theoretical calculations. The multilayered TNTs with high BET surface area (272.3 m(2)/g) and large pore volume (1.26 cm(3)/g) exhibited good adsorption property for CIP. The CIP species (i.e., CIP+, CIP +/-, CIP-) at various pH exhibited significantly different adsorption favorability. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms data revealed that TNTs offered the high uptake for CIP+ (Q(max)= 464.47 mmol/g or 153.90 mg/g at pH 5) than CIP +/- and CIP-. Characterizations indicated the formation of Ti-O-N linkage between CIP molecules and TNTs after adsorption, suggesting the chemical interaction between CIP and TNTs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal variation on pH affects the protonation/deprotonation state of CIP, and then changes the distribution of molecular orbitals and the electrostatic potential (ESP) energy of CIP. ESP follows the trend as: CIP+ (180.57 kcal/mol) > CIP +/- (146.78 kcal/mol) > CIP- (12.30 kcal/mol), indicating the side of piperazine ring in CIP oriented to TNTs dominates the CIP adsorption. The integrated experimental and theoretical results, for the first time, suggest that ESP energy can serve as the indicator and predictor of adsorption ability for the PPCPs molecules with various speciation, and can help to deeply describe the adsorption mechanism of PPCPs. In addition, TNTs have great application for the removal of PPCPs through adsorption in practical wastewater treatment area. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Industrialization and urban expansion can result in the contamination of shallow groundwater by micro-organics (MO) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. This study provides a regional scale assessment of MO contaminants in shallow groundwater in the PRD, investigating the occurrence and distribution of different compound groups, highlighting the relationship between MOs and aquifers, and between MOs and land-use. The main influence of the vadose zone and regional socioeconomic development on each relationship is also analyzed. Twenty-one compounds were detected, with naphthalene, acetophenone, 2-methylnaphthalene and chloroform recording the highest frequencies (1.4-3.1%), 2-methylphenol (328 mu g/L), 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (59 mu g/L) and 2,4-dimethylphenol (53.4 mu g/L) recorded the highest concentrations. Due to differences in lithology and thickness of the vadose zone over different aquifer groups, notable differences in MOs were recorded between aquifer groups. Twenty-one compounds were also detected with the highest concentrations in Granular aquifers; Karst aquifers recorded the lowest concentration and fewest number of compounds. Different land-use types have also resulted in notable differences in MO contamination, particularly for natural land-use types and urban-industrial types. Natural land recorded both the smallest number of compounds and the lowest concentrations; urban and industrial land-use type had 14 compounds not recorded in other land-use types. Principal component analysis results indicated that urbanization and industrialization in the PRD region were the main driving mechanisms of groundwater MO contamination (via discharges of untreated wastewater). This finding was also verified by the strong positive relationships between waste water levels, discharge volume and, chloride concentrations and MO of the shallow groundwater in the PRD.

AB Agricultural and urban activities result in the release of a large number of organic compounds that are suspected of impacting human health and ecosystems, herbicides, insecticides, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic hormones, personal care products, surfactants, plasticizers, fire retardants, and others Sorbed reservoirs of these compounds in soil represent a potentially chronic source of water contamination. This article is an introduction to a series of technical papers stemming from a symposium at the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Sod Science Society of America 2008 Annual Meeting, which was held jointly with The Geological Society of America, The Gulf Coast Association of Geological Scientists, and the Houston Geological Society, tinder one of the Joint Meeting's overarching themes Emerging Time Contaminants in Surface and Ground Water Generated from Mute Water and Solid Waste Application. The symposium emphasized the role of soils as sources, sinks, and reaction catalysts for these contaminants and the occurrence and fine of these contaminants in surface and underground water supplies Topics covered included novel advances in analytical techniques, transport of infectious agents, occurrence and fate of veterinary pharmaceuticals, characterization of sorption mechanism, biotic and abiotic transformation reactions, the role of soil components, occurrence and fate in wastewater treatment systems, transport of engineered nanoparticles, groundwater contamination resulting from urban runoff, and Issues in water reuse. Overviews of the reports, trends, gaps in our knowledge, and topics for further research are presented in this special series of papers The technical papers in this special series reflect current gains in knowledge and simultaneously underscore how poorly we arc able to predict the fate and, hence, the associated risk to ecological and human receptors of these contaminants

AB Two USEPA Regional Laboratories developed direct-injection LC/MS/MS methods to measure Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) in water matrices. Combined, the laboratories were prepared to analyze 185 PPCPs (with 74 overlapping) belonging to more than 20 therapeutical categories with reporting limits at low part-per-trillion. In partnership with Suffolk County in NY, the laboratories conducted PPCP analysis on 72 samples belonging to 4 Water Systems (WS). Samples were collected at different stages of the WS (hospital effluents, WWTP influents/effluents) to assess PPCP relevance in hospital discharges, impact on WWTP performance and potential ecological risk posed by analytes not eliminated during treatment. Major findings include: a) acceptable accuracy between the two laboratories for most overlapping PPCPs with better agreement for higher concentrations; b) the measurement of PPCPs throughout all investigated WSwith total PPCP concentrations ranging between 324 and 965 mu g L-1 for hospital effluent, 259 and 573 mu g L-1 forWWTP influent and 19 and 118 mu g L-1 for WWTP effluent; c) the variable contribution of hospital effluents to the PPCP loads into the WWTP influents (contribution ranging between 1% (WS-2) and 59% (WS-3); d) the PPCP load reduction after treatment for all WS reaching more than 95% for WS using activated sludge processes (WS-2 and WS-4), with inflow above 6500m(3) d(-1), and having a lower percentage of hospital effluent in theWWTP influent; e) the relevance of four therapeutical categories for the PPCP load inWWTP effluents (analgesics, antidiabetics, antiepileptics and psychoanaleptics); and f) the risk quotients calculated using screening-level Predicted Non Effect Concentration indicate thatWWTP effluents contain 33 PPCPs with potential medium to high ecological risk. To our knowledge no other monitoring investigation published in the scientific literature uses direct-injection methods to cover as many PPCPs and therapeutical categories in different types of WS.

AB Land application of biosolids (treated sewage sludge) can be an important route for introducing xenobiotic compounds into terrestrial environments. There is a paucity of available information on the effects of biosolids amendment on terrestrial organisms. In this study, the influence of biosolids and biosolids aging on earthworm (Eisenia fetida) reproduction and survival and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seedling emergence was investigated. Earthworms were exposed to soils amended with varying quantities of biosolids (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4% dry mass). To investigate the influence of biosolids aging, the biosolids used in the study were aged for differing lengths of time (2 or 8 weeks) prior to exposure. All of the adult earthworms survived in the biosolids-amended soils at all concentrations that were aged for 2 weeks; however, only 20% of the adults survived in the soil amended with the highest concentration of biosolids and aged for 8 weeks. Reproduction as measured by mean number of juveniles and unhatched cocoons produced per treatment correlated inversely with biosolids concentration, although the effects were generally more pronounced in the 8-week aged biosolids-soil samples. latent seedling emergence and reduced seedling fitness correlated inversely with biosolids concentration, but these effects were tempered in the 8-week aged versus the 2-week aged soil-biosolids mixtures. Anthropogenic waste indicator compounds (AWIs) were measured in the biosolids, biosolids-soil mixtures, and earthworm samples. Where possible. bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated or estimated. A wide variety of AWIs were detected in the biosolids (51 AWIs) and earthworm samples (<= 19 AWI). The earthworms exposed to the 8-week aged biosolids-soil mixtures tended to accumulate greater quantities of AWIs compared to the 2-week aged mixture, suggesting that the bioavailability of some AWIs was enhanced with aging. The BAFs for a given AWI varied with treatment. Notably large BAFs were determined for some AWIs. For example, the maximum BAF determined for para-cresol, methyl salicylate, bisphenol-A. and cholesterol was greater than 100 in some treatments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ofloxacin (OFL), a broad-spectrum and widespread-used photolabile fluoroquinolone, is frequently found in treated wastewaters, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems leading to increasing concern during the past decades regarding its effects to the environment and human health. The elimination of OFL and other xenobiotics by the application of advanced oxidation processes using photolytic (PL) and photocatalytic (PC) treatments seems promising. However, an integrated assessment scheme is needed, in which, not only the removal of the parent compound, but also the effects of the photo-transformation products (PTPs) are investigated. For this purpose, in the present study, a chronic ecotoxic assessment using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and a cytostatic and genotoxic evaluation using hepatoma cell line were performed. PL and PC treatments of OFL were applied using UV radiation. The photo-transformation of OFL during the treatments was monitored by DOC measurements and UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The chronic ecotoxicity of OFL and treated samples was evaluated using Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio fischeri; whereas the cytostasis and genotoxicity were estimated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). The main results suggest that photo-transformation of OFL took place during these treatments since the concentration of OFL decreased when the irradiation time increased, as quantified by UPLC-MS/MS analysis, and this was not coupled with an analogous DOC removal. Furthermore, nine compounds were identified as probable PTPs formed through piperazinyl dealkylation and decarboxylation. The ecotoxicity of treated solutions to the bacteria studied decreased while the cytostasis to the hepatoma cell line remained at low levels during both treatments. However, the genotoxicity to the hepatoma cell line demonstrated a different pattern in which treated samples induced a greater number of MNi for the 4-16 min of irradiation (p < 0.05) during both treatments. After 64 min of irradiation, the effects decreased to non genotoxic levels (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that UV radiation for various treatment processes (catalytic or not), such as disinfection, may create genotoxic by-products. Therefore, in relevant technical applications, the residence time during treatment should receive special attention. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A magnetic TiO2/Fe3O4/activated carbon composite was used as a photocatalyst for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and effluent organic matter (EfOM) of real and simulated effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs). While the catalyst showed limited activity under simulated solar irradiation in the absence of ozone, the CECs were completely eliminated and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiencies reached up to more than 75% by simulated solar photocatalytic ozonation. The effects of EfOM (0-30 mg.L-1 DOC), carbonate/bicarbonate (0-60 mg.L-1 IC) and PO4-P (0-3.5 mg.L-1) concentrations of the secondary effluent on the photocatalytic activity was studied. Both EfOM and carbonate/bicarbonate concentration accelerated the DOC removal in single ozonation experiments (i.e., absence of catalyst and radiation) due to the presence of initiators of the hydroxyl radical chain, the formation of secondary oxidants (i.e., hydrogen peroxide and carbonate radical) and the buffering capacity of the effluent. However, the interaction of EfOM and carbonate/bicarbonate with the catalyst brought about a decrease of its photocatalytic activity. Phosphates, in the concentration range studied, did not influence appreciably the catalytic activity. The reusability of the catalyst was evaluated through eight consecutive simulated solar phototacalytic ozonation runs. Samples of fresh and reused catalysts were examined by bulk composition analysis, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, XPS, SQUID magnetometry and the pH(PZC). Despite some changes in the porous structure and the fixation of some oxygen groups on the carbon surface as a result of ozonation, the catalyst showed good stability and the oxidation efficiency was maintained through runs.

AB Research activities at the plant protection chemistry group of the Federal Research Station in Wadenswil, Switzerland, are primarily focused on the environmental behavior of pesticides and, in some cases, other organic micropollutants. Many old and modern pesticides are chiral and there is growing interest from registration authorities and companies in the different biological activity and environmental behavior and impact of individual stereoisomers. The environmental behavior of chiral pesticides is thus one of our main areas of research. We use monitoring data (e.g. surface waters, wastewater) to establish regional mass balances of a chemical (e.g. in the catchment area of a lake). Mass balances often indicate possible sources and presence of elimination processes such as (bio)degradation, sorption/sedimentation, and volatilization. Elimination processes are further investigated in model systems in the laboratory, including batch incubations in soil and water under different regimes (light/dark, sterile/non-sterile), to distinguish between biotic and abiotic (photolysis, hydrolysis) processes. Environmental models are then used to rationalize the chemodynamics of micropollutants in natural systems, integrating data from monitoring and model systems. In some cases, it is possible to use the data for source apportioning of pollutants in the environment, and for monitoring (or prediction) of the effectiveness of pollution prevention measures. In the following report, three examples will be presented which illustrate the general approach outlined above to study the environmental occurrence and behavior of organic micropollutants. These examples include the chiral herbicide mecoprop and the chiral pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen, as well as the ubiquitous natural compound caffeine.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants is a growing concern in the environmental scenario due to their potential risks to ecosystems. The technologies employed in the treatment of sewage in Brazil are not efficient in removing micropollutants, especially persistent ones. Antidepressants (a class of drugs belonging to emerging contaminants) can reach the environment through the disposal of domestic and industrial effluents. These substances were detected in studies with surface waters, being able to cause changes and accumulate in aquatic organisms. The occurrence and impacts of this class of pollutant are still poorly studied in the country. Thus, there is a need to carry out environmental monitoring. To meet such a goal, scientific advances must be developed, especially those related to the development of analytical skills, equipment, and methods with the necessary sensitivity to research in the different sources of contamination. Accordingly, with the development of analytical techniques, it is possible to determine antidepressant drugs in environmental and / or biological matrices in increasingly small concentrations. Consequently, optimization of current techniques and proposing new ones are crucial before any other actions. The aim of this study was to validate a rapid methodology for determining the presence of four antidepressants - fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline - in fresh water through high performance liquid chromatography. The method involved solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridge and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector with C8 column. No chromatographic interference was observed in the retention time of the antidepressants in this study at the selected wavelength of 235 nm. The study matrix did not interfere in the analyses. Linearity was adequate for the range from 0.5 to 10 mu g mL(-1), with limits of detection and quantification of 0.03 to 0.09 mu g mL(-1) and 0.10 to 0.27 mu g mL(-1) respectively. Accuracy was assessed by testing sample fortification at three concentration levels and estimated by relative standard deviation (RSD). RSD values below 15% were obtained. The recovery interval ranged from 49 to 102%. The analytical method was validated and considered satisfactory for the simultaneous determination of antidepressants in freshwater samples using a C8 column.

AB Several environmental stressors have been identified as key and/or emerging drivers of habitat change that could significantly influence marine near-shore ecosystems. These include increasing discharges of pharmaceutical contaminants into the aquatic coastal systems. Pharmaceutical drugs are often detected in aquatic environments but still information on their toxicity impacts on inhabiting species is scarce, especially when acting in combination. Furthermore, almost no information is available on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in polychaetes, often the most abundant taxon in benthic communities and commonly used as indicator species of environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biochemical alterations induced in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, from a low contaminated area at the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal), by the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (0.0 -control, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 mu g/L) and the stimulant caffeine (0.0 -control, 0.5, 3.0, and 18.0 mu g/L), acting alone and in combination (0.3 CBZ + 0.5 CAF and 6.0 CBZ + 3.0 CAF). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities was determined in Hediste diversicolor from each condition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reduced and oxidized (GSH and GSSG), glycogen and electron transport system (ETS) were also measured. The results obtained clearly revealed that both drugs induced oxidative stress in H. diversicolor, shown by the increase on LPO levels and decrease on total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio with the increase of exposure concentrations. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that polychaetes biotransformation capacity as well as antioxidant defense mechanisms were not sufficiently efficient to fight against the excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to LPO when organisms were exposed to both drugs. Our results also demonstrated that polychaetes tended to decrease the activity of ETS when exposed to drugs, avoiding energy expenditure which may prevent them from greater damages. The present study further revealed that the impacts induced by the combination of both drugs were similar to those obtained at the highest drugs concentrations acting alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Advanced oxidation processes can potentially eliminate organic contaminants from industrial waste streams as well as persistent pharmaceutical components in drinking water. We explore for the first time the utilization of Cavitation Intensifying Bags (CIB) in combination with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst as possible advanced oxidation technology for wastewater streams, oxidizing terephthalic acid (TA) to 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA). The detailed characterization of this novel reaction system reveals that, during sonication, the presence of surface pits of the CIB improves the reproducibility and thus the control of the sonication process, when compared to oxidation in non-pitted bags. Detailed reaction kinetics shows that in the CIB reactor the reaction order to TA is zero, which is attributed to the large excess of TA in the system. The rate of HTA formation increased ten-fold from similar to 0.01 mu M*min(-1) during sonication in the CIB, to similar to 0.10 mu M*min-1 for CIB in the presence of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. This enhancement was ascribed to a combination of improved mass transport, the creation of thermal gradients, and Pd/Al2O3 catalyst near the cavitating bubbles. Further analysis of the kinetics of HTA formation on Pd/Al2O3 indicated that initially the reaction underwent through an induction period of 20 min, where the HTA concentration was similar to 0.3 mu M. After this, the reaction rate increased reaching HTA concentrations similar to 6 mu M after 40 min. This behavior resembled that observed during oxidation of hydrocarbons on metal catalysts, where the slow rate formation of hydroperoxides on the metal surface is followed by rapid product formation upon reaching a critical concentration. Finally, a global analysis using the Intensification Factor (IF) reveals that CIB in combination with the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is a desirable option for the oxidation of TA when considering increased oxidation rates and costs.

AB Aquatic ecosystems represent one of the largest reservoirs of phytoplankton accounting for most of the primary production of the Earth. The Lake Massaciuccoli located in Tuscany (Italy) is one of the largest swamps that in ancient times entirely covered the Versilia coastal plain. Despite its peculiar features, especially the eutrophic characteristics, its native microalgal consortia have never been explored up to now. In this work, we isolated and described four autochthonous microalgal strains from different sites in the lake (FB, Idr, CL_Sc, and CL_Ch); the four microalgal strains were identified within the Chlorella sorokiniana clade. We exposed them to ten of the most common or emerging environmental contaminants in order to describe their preliminary response to the tested substances: five metals (As, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn), two herbicides (Metolachlor and Sethoxydim), two antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Benzylpenicillin) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ibuprofen). Physiological response of the strains highlighted intraspecific differences; strain CL_Sc was the most tolerant in presence of metals while strain Idr was the most sensitive. All strains were sensitive to sethoxydim and tolerant to metolachlor at all the tested concentrations. Strains FB and Idr were the most sensitive in presence of Ibuprofen while strain CL_Ch was the most sensitive to the highest Benzylpenicillin concentration. Resistance pattern of strain Idr somehow reflects both the phylogenetic and the geographic "isolation" from all other three strains. Finally, optical microscope observation confirmed some differences also in the microalgae morphological aspect. Overall, all the strains showed interesting responses in presence of high concentrations of the tested substances, representing putative interesting candidates for water remediation in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Boron nitride Nanosheets (BNNSs) was fabricated with a method of heating the mixture of boric acid and urea in N-2 atmosphere and used to remove estrone (E-1) from water. The obtained BNNSs exhibited a higher surface area of 896 m(2)/g, a large pore volume of 0.76 cm(3)/g, and only few layers (0.398 nm) with the boric acid and urea ratio of 1:80. The layer number of BNNSs decreased from 15 to 4 with the mole ratio of boric acid and urea decreasing from 1:20 to 1:80, which was identified by SEM, TEM, AFM and BET measurements. More importantly, BNNSs presented an outstanding adsorption performance for estrone with the adsorption capacity of 249.15 mg E-1/g BNNSs. The adsorption process could be best fitted by pseudo second-order kinetic model and the equilibrium data at different temperatures were well fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The thermodynamics analysis revealed that E-1 adsorption on BNNSs was spontaneous (Delta G = -29.33 kJ mol(-1)), enthalpy-retarded (Delta H = 29.75 kJ mol(-1)), entropy-driven (Delta S = 198.26 J mol(-1) K-1), and mostly chemical adsorption. The adsorption rates of E-1 in water were sharply enhanced with thinner BNNSs as absorbents and removal efficiency by BN-60 regenerated after 6 times was above 95%, it was shown that the surface areas, mesopores and remarkable structure played important roles in the adsorption process. The firmness of E-1 onto BNNSs and the stability of adsorption efficiency made BNNSs as a potential absorbent for efficient removal of E-1 from wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals of different therapeutic classes are found in the environment. Captopril is used worldwide as an antihypertensive drug, and it has been found in the influent, effluent and secondary sludge of wastewater treatment plants. Advanced oxidation processes, such as direct photolysis (UV-C) and heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO2/UV-C), are alternatives to enhance mineralisation of pharmaceuticals and their removal during water treatment. In this article, it was evaluated the degradation of captopril in aqueous solution induced by UV-C and TiO2/UV-C systems. The process focused on the identification and monitoring of the by-products formed under these conditions by applying direct-infusion electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode (ESI(-)-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC/HRMS). To evaluate the by-products toxicity, acute ecotoxicity tests were performed with the crustacean Artemia salina, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated with (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using HepG2 cells. It was observed by ESI(-)-HRMS that after 120 min of light exposure, there was almost complete removal of captopril, with 93.5% removal efficiency during photolysis and 99.9% during photocatalysis. At these conditions, the rate of mineralisation, by total organic carbon (TOC), was only 2.92% for photolysis and 9.09% for photocatalysis, evidencing the formation of degradation by-products. Nine by-products of captopril photodegradation were identified, and their respective chemical structure elucidations were proposed. The treated samples were nontoxic to A. salina and HepG2 cells, indicating that both oxidative treatments (photocatalytic or photolytic processes) can be conveniently employed to remove captopril from aqueous media.

AB This study aimed to quantify the environmental fate of antimicrobials applied in Fenneropenaeus chinensis aquaculture production in China and to assess their potential risks for surrounding aquatic ecosystems, for the promotion of antimicrobial resistance in target and non-target bacteria and for consumers eating shrimp products that contain antimicrobial residues. For this, we first used the results of an environmental monitoring study performed with the antimicrobial sulfamethazine to parameterize and calibrate the ERA-AQUA model, a mass balance model suited to perform risk assessments of veterinary medicines applied in aquaculture ponds. Next, a scenario representing F. chinensis production in China was built and used to perform risk assessments for 21 antimicrobials which are regulated for aquaculture in China. Results of the model calibration showed a good correspondence between the predicted and the measured sulfamethazine concentrations, with differences within an order of magnitude. Results of the ecological risk assessment showed that four antimicrobials (levofloxacin, sarafloxacin, ampicillin, sulfadiazine) are expected to have adverse effects on primary producers, while no short-term risks were predicted for invertebrates and fish exposed to farm wastewater effluents containing antimicrobial residues. Half of the evaluated antimicrobials showed potential to contribute to antimicrobial resistance in bacteria exposed to pond water and farm effluents. A withdrawal period of three weeks is recommended for antimicrobials applied via oral administration to F. chinensis in order to comply with the current national and international toxicological food safety standards. The results of this study indicate the need to improve the current regulatory framework for the registration of aquaculture antimicrobials in China and suggest compounds that should be targeted in future aquaculture risk assessments and environmental monitoring studies.

AB Preventive measures for the control of environmental pollution and its remediation has received much interest in recent years due to the world-wide increase in the contamination of water bodies. Contributions of these harmful effluents are caused by the leather processing, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, textile, agricultural and other chemical industries. Nowadays, advanced oxidation processes considered to be better option for the complete destruction of organic contaminants in water and wastewater. Acid Blue 113 is a most widely used di-azo compound in leather, textile, dying and food industry as a color rending compound. In the present study, we have reported the photo catalytic degradation of Acid Blue 113 using a nanocrystalline semiconductor doped rare earth oxide as a photo catalyst under UV light irradiation. The photocatalyst was prepared by a simple precipitation technique and were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRS and FE-SEM analysis. The experimental results proved that the prepared photo catalyst was nanocrystalline and highly active in the UV region. The UV-DRS results showed the band gap energy was 3.15 eV for the prepared photo catalyst. The photodegradation efficiency was analyzed by various experimental parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage, variation of substrate concentration and effect of electrolyte addition. The photo degradation process followed a pseudo first order kinetics and was continuously monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometer. The experimental results proved the efficacy of the nanocrystalline zinc oxide doped dysprosium oxide which are highly active under UV light irradiations. It is also suggested that the prepared material would find wider applications in environmental remediation technologies to remove the carcinogenic and toxic moieties present in the industrial effluents.

AB The World Health Organization has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the top three threats to global health. There is concern that the use of antibiotics as growth promoting agents in livestock production contributes to the increasingly problematic development of antibiotic resistance. Many antibiotics are excreted at high rates, and the land application of animal manures represents a significant source of environmental exposure to these agents. To evaluate the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure on soil microbial populations, a series of field plots were established in 1999 that have since received annual applications of a mixture of sulfamethazine (SMZ), tylosin (TYL), and chlortetracycline (CTC). During the first 6 yr (1999-2004) soils were treated at concentrations of 0, 0.01 0.1, and 1.0 mg kg(-1) soil, in subsequent years at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg kg(-1) soil. The lower end of this concentration range is within that which would result from an annual application of manure from medicated swine. Following ten annual applications, the fate of the drugs in the soil was evaluated. Residues of SMZ and TYL, but not CTC were removed much more rapidly in soil with a history of exposure to 10 mg/kg drugs than in untreated control soil. Residues of C-14-SMZ were rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 in the historically treated soils, but not in the untreated soil. A SMZ-degrading Microbacterium sp. was isolated from the treated soil. Overall, these results indicate that soil bacteria adapt to long-term exposure to some veterinary antibiotics resulting in sharply reduced persistence. Accelerated biodegradation of antibiotics in matrices exposed to agricultural, wastewater, or pharmaceutical manufacturing effluents would attenuate environmental exposure to antibiotics, and merits investigation in the context of assessing potential risks of antibiotic resistance development in environmental matrices.

AB Pharmaceuticals have recently emerged as novel pollutants of potential concern in the aquatic environment where they are commonly introduced as complex mixtures via municipal effluent. In the present experiment, the freshwater cnidarian Hydra attenuata was exposed to a mixture of 11 phannaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and caffeine) up to 10000 times (x) the concentration found in municipal effluent. Hydra regeneration and teratogenicity was measured, having an IC(50) of 781x and was found to be non teratogenic with an A/D value of similar to 1. Toxicity was investigated using both lethal (based an morphology) and sublethal (based on morphology, feeding behaviour, hydranth number and attachment) endpoints. The pharmaceutical mixture incurred a significant decrease in morphology at 0.1, 10 and 100x but a significant increase at 1000x. All parameters were significantly reduced at 10000x. An EC(50) of 425x and 65x based on morphology and feeding respectively and a toxicity threshold (TT) of 3.2x were calculated. When compared to the toxicity of each pharmaceutical exposed individually as previously reported [Quinn B, Gagne F, Blaise C. An investigation into the acute and chronic toxicity of eleven pharmaceuticals found in wastewater effluent on the cnidarian, H. attenuata. Sci Total Environ 2008a; 389: 306-314], the compounds in the mixture were present at concentrations 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower for the equivalent toxicity (EC(50) and TT). These results indicate that pharmaceuticals act additively in a mixture, having sub-lethal effects at environmentally relevant (mu g/L-ng/L) concentrations and that their combined concentrations could potentially prove significantly ecotoxic to Hydra and possibly to other aquatic taxa.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (E0C5) are frequently detected in urban surface water and the adjacent groundwater and are therefore an increasing problem for potable water quality. River bank filtration (RBF) is a beneficial pretreatment step to improve surface water quality for potable use. Removal is mainly caused by microbial degradation of micropollutants, while sorption retards the transport. The quantification of biodegradation and adsorption parameters for E0Cs at field scale is still scarce. In this study, the fate and behavior of a range of organic compounds during RBF were investigated using a two dimensional numerical flowand transport model. The data base used emanated from a project conducted in Berlin, Germany (NASRI: Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration). Oxygen isotope signatures and hydraulic head data were used for model calibration. Afterwards, twelve organic micropollutants were simulated with a reactive transport model. Three compounds (primidone, EDTA, and AMDOPH) showed conservative behavior (no biodegradation or sorption). For the nine remaining compounds (1.5 NDSA, AOX, AO', MTBE, carbamazepine, clindamycin, phenazone, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole), degradation and/or sorption was observed. 1.5 NDSA and AOX were not sorbed, but slightly degraded with model results for X = 2.25e-3 1/d and 2.4e-3 1/d. For AOI a X = 0.0106 1/d and R = 1 were identified. MTBE could be characterized well assuming R = 1 and a low 1st order degradation rate constant (X = 0.0085 1/d). Carbamazepine degraded with a half life time of about 66 days after a threshold value of 0.2-0.3 iig/L was exceeded and retarded slightly (R = 1.7). Breakthrough curves of clindamycin, phenazone, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole could be fitted less well, probably due to the dependency of degradation on temperature and redox conditions, which are highly transient at the RBF site. Conditions range from oxic to anoxic (up to iron-reducing), with the oxic and denitrifying zones moving spatially back and forth over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. In the past few years, there was an increasing awareness of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water and drinking water resources, and measurements in surface water, sediment or waste water were done for a number of PPCPs. In the regulatory context, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has become essential for new PPCPs. Reliably predicted or measured environmental concentrations (PECs or MECs) of chemicals are essential for the exposure assessment, which is one of the two main pillars of environmental risk assessment (ERA). This paper reports on measured data of selected PPCPs in surface waters and compares the measured values with predicted environmental concentrations from exposure models. Such models have been proposed by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and the Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for New Notified and Existing Chemical Substances (TGD).
   Methods. Four pharmaceuticals and one personal care product were in the scope of the investigation reported here: 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide as well as tonalide. Measured environmental concentrations in surface waters for these PPCPs were reviewed in the scientific literature. The appropriateness of these data was evaluated according to criteria for monitoring data recommended by the TGD. A total of 38 references were evaluated with emphasis on the adequacy of chemical analysis and the representativeness of sampling. Measurements of concentrations in surface water (MECsw), which were found to be adequate for use in exposure assessment according to the monitoring quality criteria, were averaged and compared with respective PECs in surface water (PECsw) derived from exposure modelling (cf. EMEA and TGD).
   Results and Discussion. Measured environmental concentrations adequate for use in exposure assessment were found in 20 out of 38 references. Several of the measurements from Germany could be used for a comparison with calculated PECs. Average MECssw in Germany were < 0.58 ng/L for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 454 ng/L for carbamazepine, 126 ng/L for sulfamethoxazole, 1105 ng/L for iopromide and 311 ng/L for tonalide. In comparison to the measured concentrations, PECs calculated with the model proposed by the EMEA in 2001 were in the same range, but slightly higher than the MECs. The EMEA model from 2001 is based on a production/use volume of the PPCPs. The more recent EMEA model (2003/2005) overestimated the PECs by more than one order of magnitude for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, but underestimated the concentration of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol by a factor of almost 5 compared to the MECs. This model is based on maximum daily doses and the assumption that 1% of the population is consuming the pharmaceutical (default value). Calculations with the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), which is part of the TGD describing the risk assessment of chemicals and biocides, resulted for the investigated pharmaceuticals in almost the same PECs as derived by the older EMEA model (2001). For the PCP tonalide, to which the recent EMEA model (2003/ 2005) cannot be applied, the PEC was overestimated by a factor of 3 with the older EMEA model (2001), but underestimated with EUSES by a factor of 5 compared to the averaged MECsw in Germany.
   Conclusions. It was shown that PEC calculations with exposure models provided by EMEA and the TGD, resulted in PECs very close to the corresponding MECs in most cases. However, environmental concentrations can be underestimated by models in cases, where, e.g. due to high lipophilicity, sorption to sewage sludge is assumed which does not occur to that extent under real conditions. Thus, it appears that the exposure models do not come up to the complexity of the real environment. However, the main factor with the highest impact on predicted environmental concentrations and a high degree of uncertainty is the production volume.
   Recommendations and Outlook. References and their data evaluated as not adequate for use in exposure assessment were mainly rejected due to missing or insufficient specifications related to the sampling procedure and/or representativeness of the samples. Several of the evaluated studies aimed at the introduction and establishment of a new analytical methodology. A detailed description of sampling frequency and pattern, for example, was therefore neglected. Often, a more accurate description of analytical procedure, sampling pattern and statistical analysis of data would be sufficient to provide an adequate basis for exposure assessment and hence establish confidence in environmental risk assessment procedures.
   For new substances, an exposure assessment is solely based on estimations using environmental fate models. To avoid unacceptable risks for the environment, PECs should not underestimate actual environmental concentrations. Since it was shown that under specific conditions the models applied in this study underestimated measured environmental concentrations, further development of the calculation models appears to be necessary.

AB The province of Jaen counts with four natural parks, numerous rivers, reservoirs and wetlands; moreover, it is probably the region with higher olive oil production in the world, which makes this zone a proper target to be studied based on the European Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE. The aim of this survey is to monitor a total number of 373 compounds belonging to different families (pesticides, PAHs, nitrosamines, drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals and life-style compounds) in surface waters located at different points of the province of Jaen. Among these compounds some priority organic substances (regulated by the EU Directive 2008/105/EC) and pollutants of emerging concern (not regulated yet) can be found. A liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) method covering 340 compounds was developed and applied, together with a gas chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method which enabled the analysis of 63 organic contaminants (30 of these compounds are analyzed by LC-TOFMS as well). From April 2009 to November 2010 a total of 83 surface water samples were collected (rivers, reservoirs and wetlands). In this period numerous organic contaminants were detected, most of them at the ng L-1 level. The most frequently priority substances found were chlorpyrifos ethyl, diuron and hexachlorobenzene. Within the other groups, the most frequently detected compounds were: terbuthylazine, oxyfluorfen, desethyl terbuthylazine, diphenylamine (pesticide family); fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene (PAHs group), codeine, paracetamol (pharmaceuticals compounds) and caffeine, nicotine (life-style compounds). As is could be expected, the total concentration of emerging contaminants is distinctly larger than that of priority pollutants, highlighting the importance of continuing with the study of their presence, fate and effects in aquatic environments. However, concentration levels (at the ng per liter level) are low in general for both kinds of contaminants which minimizes the possible harmful effect on the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Filtration phenomena of the hydrophobic ionogenic compound triclosan by three commercially available nanofiltration (NF)/reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were investigated in this study. The separation behaviour of triclosan was systematically related to the compound physicochemical properties and the membranes as well as the solution pH. The influence of membrane fouling on the rejection of triclosan by the three selected NF/RO membranes were also examined using three model organic foulants and one model colloidal foulants. Having a unique hydrophobic ionogenic profile, even when triclosan was fully deprotonated at pH 10, considerable adsorption of the compound to the membrane could still be observed. The adsorption of triclosan to the membrane surface was a precursor for the diffusion of this compound through the membrane. In fact, under clean (virgin) membrane condition, considerable diffusive transport of triclosan through the loose nanofiltration NF-270 as well as the tight nanofiltration NF-90 membrane was clearly evident, leading to a lower rejection of triclosan by these membranes than expected based on their molecular weight cut-off or the size exclusion mechanism. This diffusive transport appears to be dependent on the thickness of the active layer and its porosity. As a result, no triclosan was detected in the permeate samples from the reverse osmosis BW-30 membrane which has a thicker and more dense active skin layer. Results reported in this study also indicate that the formation of a hydrophobic fouling layer on the membrane surface could interfere with the solute-membrane interaction, and thus, reduce the diffusive transport of triclosan across the membrane. Consequently, significant enhancement in rejection of triclosan was observed when the membranes were pre-fouled with the three model organic foulants namely bovine serum albumin (BSA), alginate and humic acid used in this study. In contrast, no discernible variation in rejection was observed when the membranes were pre-fouled with hydrophilic silica colloids as compared to the clean membrane condition.

AB Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the largest littoral lagoon on the Iberian Peninsula, has been affected by eutrophication processes since the 1970s due to the direct dumping of sewage waters of industrial, agricultural and urban origin. Consequently, the submerged vegetation that covered the bottom of the lagoon has been lost (charophytes and Potamogeton spp., Myriophyllum spp. and Ceratophyllum spp.). Despite efforts to improve water quality, this vegetation has not recovered. No information about the potential of the recent sediments to host charophyte development is available. In this study, we analysed several sediment cores taken from different areas of the lagoon to determine the spatial distribution of past charophyte communities (based on the fructifications, i.e., oospores and gyrogonites, found in the sediments), to ascertain whether propagules remain in the upper sediments and to determine the potential of the surface sediments (containing pollutants, e.g., organochlorinated pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) to host the growth and germination of charophytes if clear water is restored to the lagoon. The study was based on laboratory experiments. Generally, the same species of charophytes were found in all studied areas of the lagoon. The oospores and gyrogonites were located immediately surficially (in the first 5 cm) in certain areas, and these might be capable of germinating in this sediment stratum. The more recent sediment strata (the upper 14 cm), corresponding to the eutrophication period, can support the vegetative growth of Chara hispida and Chara vulgaris and promote the germination of Chara aspera and Chara baltica. We conclude that if the underwater light conditions are improved and nutrient concentrations are reduced in Albufera de Valencia Lagoon, the reestablishment of charophytes might be possible both naturally and through specific management measures (namely, programmes involving seeds as planting stock or large-scale planting activity). This approach necessarily requires an improvement in the water quality of the inputs to the lagoon and an increase in the amount of water discharge to reduce the water residence time. These measures would restore the highly desirable positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cereals are staple foods for human consumption in both developed and developing countries. In order to improve agricultural outputs, resources like reclaimed water for irrigation and biosolids and manure as fertilizers are frequently used, although they may increase the input of contaminants that can potentially be absorbed by crops and enter the food chain. Emerging contaminants (human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, plasticizers, and industrial additives, among others) are continuously introduced in the environment from a variety sources and these contaminants may enter the food chain through plant uptake. In this study, an analytical method, based on ultrasound-assisted extraction and dispersive solid-phase cleanup, was developed for the determination of emerging contaminants from different classes in four highly consumed cereal grains (wheat, oat, barley, and rice). These analytes were selected considering the results of our previous studies carried out in soil and vegetables and those frequently detected in real samples were chosen. The target compounds selected were bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), methyl paraben, propyl paraben, linear chain nonylphenol in position 4 (4-n-NP), mixture of ring and chain isomers of NP and six pharmaceutical compounds (allopurinol, mefenamic acid, carbamazepine, paracetamol, diclofenac and ibuprofen). Recoveries ranging from 68 to 119% with relative standard deviations (RSD) <18% were obtained for all the compounds except for allopurinol, with recoveries that ranged from 30 to 66% with RSD <= 12% and the limits of detection achieved ranged from 0.03 to 4.9 ng/g. The method was applied to the analysis of 16 cereal samples, ten were purchased in local supermarkets and the rest were collected directly from agricultural fields, five of which were fertilized with organic amendments. Bisphenol A (BPA) was detected in all samples at levels that ranged from 1.6 to 1,742 ng/g. Bisphenol F, a substitute for BPA, was also found in six samples (up to 22 ng/g). Linear 4-n-NP was found in a reduced number of samples but the mixture of NP isomers was found in all the samples, being the mean concentrations in wheat, barley, oat and rice 49, 90, 142, and 184 ng/g, respectively.

AB The guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) recommend the use of standard ecotoxicity assays and the assessment of endpoints at the individual level to evaluate potential effects of PPCP on biota. However, effects at the sub-individual level can also affect the ecological fitness of marine organisms chronically exposed to PPCP. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the environmental risk of two PPCP in marine sediments: triclosan (TCS) and ibuprofen (IBU), using sub-individual and developmental endpoints. The environmental levels of TCS and IBU were quantified in marine sediments from the vicinities of the Santos submarine sewage outfall (Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at 15.14 and 49.0 ng g(-1), respectively. A battery (n = 3) of chronic bioassays (embryo-larval development) with a sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus) and a bivalve (Perna perna) were performed using two exposure conditions: sediment-water interface and elutriates. Moreover, physiological stress through the Neutral Red Retention Time Assay (NRRT) was assessed in the estuarine bivalve Mytella charruana exposed to TCS and IBU spiked sediments. These compounds affected the development of L. variegatus and P. perna (75 ng g(-1) for TCS and 15 ng g(-1) for IBU), and caused a significant decrease in M. charruana lysosomal membrane stability at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.08 ng g(-1) for TCS and 0.15 ng g(-1) for IBU). Chemical and ecotoxicological data were integrated and the risk quotient estimated for TCS and IBU were higher than 1.0, indicating a high environmental risk of these compounds in sediments. These are the first data of sediment risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products of Latin America. In addition, the results suggest that the ERA based only on individual-level and standard toxicity tests may overlook other biological effects that can affect the health of marine organisms exposed to PPCP.

AB Pharmaceuticals are widely used for the treatment of various physical and psychological ailments. Due to incomplete removal during sewage treatment many pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in aquatic waterways at trace concentrations. The diversity of pharmaceutical contaminants and potential for complex mixtures to occur makes it very difficult to predict the toxicity of these compounds on wildlife, and robust methods are therefore needed to explore sub-lethal effects. Metabolic syndrome is one of the most widespread health concerns currently facing the human population, and various drugs, including anti-diabetic medications and lipid- and cholesterol-lowering fibrates and statins, are widely prescribed as treatment. In this study, we exposed striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) tadpoles to a mixture of the drugs metformin, atorvastatin and bezafibrate at 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 mu g/L to explore possible effects on growth and development, energy reserves (triglycerides and cholesterol), and profiles of small polar metabolites extracted from hepatic tissues. It was hypothesised that exposure would result in a general reduction in energy reserves, and that this would subsequently correspond with reduced growth and development. Responses differed from expected outcomes based on the known mechanisms of these compounds in humans, with no changes to hepatic triglycerides or cholesterol and a general increase in mass and condition with increasing exposure concentration. Deviation from the expected response patterns may be explained by differences in the receptivity or uptake of the compounds in non-mammalian species. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy revealed evidence of broad metabolic dysregulation in exposed animals, and possible interaction between the solvent and mixture. Specifically, increased lactic acid and branched-chain amino acids were observed, with responses tending to follow a non-monotonic pattern. Overall, results demonstrate that a mixture of drugs commonly prescribed to treat human metabolic syndrome is capable of eliciting physiological and developmental effects on larval amphibians. Importantly, outcomes further suggest that it may not be possible to predict toxicological effects in non-target wildlife based on our knowledge of how these compounds act in humans.

AB Since the inception of global industrialization, the growth of steroid estrogens becomes a matter of emerging serious concern for the rapid population. Steroidal estrogens are potent endocrine-upsetting chemicals that are excreted naturally by vertebrates (e.g., humans and fish) and can enter natural waters through the discharge of treated and raw sewage. Steroidal estrogens in plants may enter the food web and become a serious threat to human health. We evaluated the uptake and accumulation of ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17-estradiol (17-E2) in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) grown under controlled environmental condition over 21days growth period. An effective analytical method based on ultrasonic liquid extraction (ULE) for solid samples and solid phase extraction (SPE) for liquid samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been developed to determine the steroid estrogens in lettuce plants. The extent of uptake and accumulation was observed in a dose-dependent manner and roots were major organs for estrogen deposition. Unlike the 17-E2, EE2 was less accumulated and translocated from root to leaves. For 17-E2, the distribution in lettuce was primarily to roots after the second week (13%), whereas in leaves it was (10%) over the entire study period. The distribution of EE2 at 2000gL(-1) in roots and leaves was very low (3.07% and 0.54%) during the first week and then was highest (12% in roots and 8% in leaves) in last week. Bioaccumulation factor values of 17-E2 and EE2 in roots were 0.33 and 0.29 at 50gL(-1) concentration as maximum values were found at 50gL(-1) rather than 500 and 2000 in all observed plant tissues. Similar trend was noticed in roots than leaves for bioconcentration factor as the highest bioconcentration values were observed at 50gL(-1) concentration instead of 500 and 2000gL(-1) spiked concentration. These findings mainly indicate the potential for uptake and bioaccumulation of estrogens in lettuce plants. Overall, the estrogen contents in lettuce were compared to the FAO/WHO recommended toxic level and were found to be higher than the toxic level which is of serious concern to the public health. This analytical procedure may aid in future studies on risks associated with uptake of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in lettuce plants.

AB Like hardly any other issue in ecotoxicology, endocrine disruption has given rise to public concern. Reproductive, behavioral, and immunological effects in wildlife were publicly not only understood as possible threats to wildlife populations, but also as early warning signals that human health could be at risk. Above all, the public has been concerned about negative outcomes in reproductive health, and effects like feminization in fish were regarded as evidence for the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that environmental levels of hormonally active chemicals are high enough to affect human reproductive health.
   Public concern has been mirrored by several parliamentary and governmental decisions emphasizing the need for extensive research and rapid measures to reduce the risk associated with endocrine-disrupting substances.
   Endocrine disruption in wildlife is clearly a priority issue. At least in densely populated areas like Europe, symptoms of endocrine disruption in wildlife cannot only be detected in areas with abnormally high levels of pollution, but have also occurred in main river systems, estuaries, and even in the open sea. Imposex in mollusks and feminization in fish that were clearly related to disturbances in the hormonal system of these organisms by exogenous substances have been used as markers in monitoring programs. Though symptoms of endocrine disruption can be clearly identified, it is much more difficult to link these outcomes to causative chemicals or mixtures of substances. Natural and pharmaceutical hormones, phytoestrogens, pesticides, and industrial chemicals may all play a role to a different degree depending on the site under study. This means that several different risk-reduction strategies have to be applied, including bans of substances, use restrictions, and installation and optimization of sewage treatment works embedded in a strategy for the overall reduction of chemical input into the environment.
   It should be noted that, in addition to national and international regulatory actions taken by state authorities, a considerable reduction of the environmental input could be achieved in several countries by voluntary actions taken by industry.
   Regulatory bodies are still facing major problems in the field of risk assessment and risk reduction. Association between effects and causative agents or mixtures are in many cases weak. Important tools for risk assessment such as dose-response relationships or the existence of thresholds are not yet agreed on. These uncertainties are the reason that many national governments and the European Commission have identified precaution as the main element in chemicals policy for the management of endocrine disruptors.

AB The spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and other emerging contaminants (ECs) such as plasticisers, perflourinated compounds (PFCs) and illicit drug metabolites in water and bound to suspended particulate material (SPM) is not well-understood. Here, we quantify levels of thirteen selected contaminants in water (n = 88) and their partition to suspended particulate material (SPM, n = 16) in three previously-unstudied rivers of Greater London and Southern England during a key reproduction/spawning period. Analysis was conducted using an in-house validated method for Solid Phase Extraction followed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass-Spectrometry. Analytes were extracted from SPM using an optimised method for ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction. Detection frequencies of contaminants dissolved in water ranged from 3% (ethinylestradiol) to 100% (bisphenol-A). Overall mean concentrations in the aqueous-phase ranged from 14.7 ng/L (benzoylecgonine) to 159 ng/L (bisphenol-A). Sewage treatment works (STW) effluent was the predominant source of pharmaceuticals, while plasticisers/perfluorinated compounds may additionally enter rivers via other sources. In SPM, detection frequencies ranged from 44% (PFOA) to 94% (hydroxyacetophenone). Mean quantifiable levels of analytes bound to SPM ranged from 13.5 ng/g dry SPM (0.33 ng bound/L water) perfluorononanoic acid to 2830 ng/g dry SPM (14.3 ng bound/L water) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. Long chain (>C7) amphipathic and acidic PFCs were found to more preferentially bind to SPM than short chain PFCs and other contaminants (Kd = 34.1-75.5 vs <5 respectively). Per capita daily contributions of studied contaminants entering rivers ranged from 0.157 mu g/person/day of benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) to 58.6 mu g/person/day of bisphenol-A. The large sample size of this work (n = 104) enabled ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc tests to establish significant trends in PPCP/EC spatial distribution from headwaters through downstream stretches of studied rivers. Novel findings include environmental Kd calculations, the occurrence of contaminants in river headwaters, increases in contaminant metabolite concentrations downstream of STW effluents revealing possible in-river degradation or de-conjugation, the influence of polarity and acidity in the partition of contaminants to particulate-material, among others.

AB The present paper deals with major and trace elements geochemistry of the groundwater from Nalgonda district, Telangana. The study area is very important in terms of anthropogenic activity like rapid industrial, urban development, pesticides, pharmaceutical, granite polishing and agro based industries. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) was employed to determine the concentration of trace elements in collected groundwater samples (bore well). These probe elements were further categorized as toxic elements (Pb, As, Cd, and V), alkaline earths (Sr and Ba), alkali metals (Li, Rb), transition metals (Cr, Mo and Ni), metallic elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Co), and other non-metallic elements (Se and Si). The groundwater quality was examined in perspective of Indian as well as World Health Organization drinking water standards. Based on the analytical results, groundwater in the study area is found to be slightly alkaline in nature and very hard, the average abundance of the major cations and anions is in the order of Ca+< Na+< Mg+< K+ and Cl-< HCO3 (-)< CO3 (-)< SO4 (-)< NO3 (-)< F- respectively. The dominant hydro chemical facies of groundwater is Na+ - HCO (3) (-) - Cl- and Na+ - Cl- - HCO- (3) types.
   The results of trace elements shows that concentration of Pb, As, Cd, V in collected samples exceeding the desirable limits, and in the case of alkaline, alkali, transition, non-metallic elements, seventy per cent of the samples crossed the desirable limits, but all metallic elements viz. Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Co is within the limits as per Indian as well as World Health Organizations drinking water standards. Factor analysis results shows that seven factors emerged as a significant contributor to the groundwater contamination is about 65.32 per cent. The spatial variation maps decipher trace elemental concentrations both geogenic and anthropogenic origin, by three zones i.e. 'low', 'moderate' and 'high' of the study area based on environment using Arc-GIS. High concentrations of trace elements are indicative of phenomenal rise in chemical composition and likely to have its origin from silicate weathering reactions and dissolution/precipitation processes supported by rainfall and anthropogenic activities, indiscriminate use of fertilizers/pesticides, and disposal of waste and sewage, release of reactive pollutants into the atmosphere by industries. Hence, this work is of immense societal benefit in terms of prevailing human health hazards in the study area with a direct relevance to such industrially populated regions elsewhere.

AB Simvastatin is one of themost commonly cholesterol-lowering prescribed drugs all over the world. With the increase of consumption of these pharmaceuticals and subsequent their discharge into the aquatic environment in recent years, they are present at detectable levels in most sewage effluents. Unfortunately, limited information is provided about their potential impacts on aquatic organisms, especially on the detoxification-related metabolism in fish. In the present study, one local native benthic fish (Mugilogobius abei) in southern China was employed as test species and exposed to SV (0.5 mu g L-1, 5 mu g L-1, 50 mu g L-1 and 500 mu g L-1) for 72 h. The transcriptional expression of nucleus transcriptional factor pregnane X receptor (PXR) and its downstream targeted genes including multixenobiotics resistance protein or permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), cytochrome 1A (CYP1A), cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the expression of associated microRNA such as miR-27, miR-34 and miR-148 in Mugilogobius abei were investigated. Result showed that the expressions of P-gp, CYP 1A, CYP 3A, GST and PXR were induced to some extend under simvastatin exposure for 72 h. A positive correlation was observed between PXR and CYP1A, CYP3A and P-gp. While for microRNA, a negative relationship was found between miR-34a and CYP3A, CYP1A. The expression of miR-148a was significantly induced under the exposure of SV (50 mu g L-1), which was positive related to the transcriptional expression of PXR. For enzyme activity, erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) significantly increased at 24 h and the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) exhibited different trends. CAT was slightly inhibited at 24 h exposure but SOD was significantly induced in high concentration. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was significant inhibited after 72 h exposure. The reductive smallmolecule glutathione (GSH) content showed obvious decrease, while the quantity of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly in high concentrations of SV exposure. GSH and MDA showed a typical negative correlation to some degree. Moreover, simvastatin caused histological changes in the liver tissues of M. abei, especially the size of adipocyte significantly decreased. The present study indicated that environmentally relevant concentration SV may affect the PXR signaling pathway in M. abei and pose potential ecological risks to non-target organisms like fish.

AB Waterborne contaminants were monitored in 69 tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes in 2010 and 2014 using semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). A risk-based screening approach was used to prioritize chemicals and chemical mixtures, identify sites at greatest risk for biological impacts, and identify potential hazards to monitor at those sites. Analyses included 185 chemicals (143 detected) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), legacy and current-use pesticides, fire retardants, pharmaceuticals, and fragrances. Hazard quotients were calculated by dividing detected concentrations by biological effect concentrations reported in the ECOTOX Knowledgebase (toxicity quotients) or ToxCast database (exposure-activity ratios [EARs]). Mixture effects were estimated by summation of EAR values for chemicals that influence ToxCast assays with common gene targets. Nineteen chemicals-atrazine, N,N-diethyltoluamide, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, dl-menthol, galaxolide, p-tert-octylphenol, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 3 PAHs, 4 pharmaceuticals, and 3 phosphate flame retardants-had toxicity quotients >0.1 or EARs for individual chemicals >10(-3) at 10% or more of the sites monitored. An additional 4 chemicals (tributyl phosphate, triethyl citrate, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene) were present in mixtures with EARs >10(-3). To evaluate potential apical effects and biological endpoints to monitor in exposed wildlife, in vitro bioactivity data were compared to adverse outcome pathway gene ontology information. Endpoints and effects associated with endocrine disruption, alterations in xenobiotic metabolism, and potentially neuronal development would be relevant to monitor at the priority sites. The EAR threshold exceedance for many chemical classes was correlated with urban land cover and wastewater effluent influence, whereas herbicides and fire retardants were also correlated to agricultural land cover.

AB beta-Blockers (BB) are one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals used for treating cardio-vascular and acute anxiety-related disorders. This class of drugs inhibit beta-adrenoceptor signalling and given their growing, widespread use, BB are routinely detected in surface waters at nM concentrations. This is concerning as trace levels of BB impart developmental and reproductive dysfunction in non-target aquatic organisms, with potential for ecological risks. To date, environmental pharmaceutical risks to non-target animals are not part of the monitoring framework due to the lack of bioassays for assessing their biological effects. Behavioral endpoints have the advantage of a systems-level integration of multiple sensory signals and motor responses for toxicity screening; however, they are not currently used for risk assessment of environmental contaminants. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo photomotor response (zfPMR) has been used in high-throughput behavioral screenings for neuroactive drug effects at high, therapeutic concentrations. Our objective here was to examine if we could utilize the zfPMR for screening environmental levels of BB. Embryos were placed into 96-well plates, exposed to chemicals and/or municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE), and their zfPMRs were measured with video-analysis. To specifically target BB, embryos were co-treated with isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist that stimulates the zfPMR, and the inhibition of isoproterenol-induced response was used as a biomarker of BB exposure. Our results reveal that the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated zfPMRs can be used as a biosensor capable of detecting BB in the parts-per-billion to parts-per-trillion in water samples, including diluted MWWE. The method developed detects BB in spite of the presence of other neuroactive compounds in water samples. This systems level approach of rapid screening for BB effects provides the most promising evidence to date that behavioral neuromodulation can be potentially applied for environmental effects monitoring of pharmaceuticals.

AB In recent times, trace levels of pharmaceuticals detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters have raised the level of attention around the ultimate fate and the potential persistence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. We have seen the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines (EMEA) recently include more rigorous environmental fate testing in European Union (EU) Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) guidance to assess the ultimate fate in water/sediment systems. Yet to date, there is little data available that covers the fate of pharmaceuticals in the water/sediment compartment, and little that assess whether current aerobic and anaerobic methods are appropriate for pharmaceuticals. In this study, the biodegradation profiles of 3 Pfizer products were investigated following the latest ERA guidance and its recommendation for OECD 308 water/sediment biodegradation testing. Experiments included C-14-labeled exemestane, azithromycin, and varenicline representing neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals with average K-oc values of 3704, 49 400, and 10 483 respectively. Specific HPLC/radioactive monitoring (RAM) methods were used to profile water and sediment samples for biotransformation products. Binding to sediment, as "non -extractables", was considerable for all three pharmaceuticals, though most notable for the cationic pharmaceuticals varenicline and azithromycin ranging from 52% to 94% at study termination, respectively. In general, for all 3 pharmaceuticals studied, the anaerobic conditions demonstrated less biotransformation and mineralization than the aerobic; though their biotransformation profile (number of metabolites) and amount bound to sediment were similar. Based on these findings and our current understanding of anaerobic biodegradation, we would recommend a tiered approach to the OECD 308 water/sedimenttest: with default testing just for aerobic conditions; and then if needed, anaerobic testing only for those compounds potentially amenable to typical anaerobic processes. We suggest that as a simulation test would be better suited in later tier testing under EU ERA guidance. Inherent biodegradation or die-away tests seem better suited to derive biodegradation rate constants for subsequent environmental modeling of water and sediment compartments.

AB BackgroundDue to the rising number of type 2 diabetes patients, the antidiabetic drug, metformin is currently among those pharmaceuticals with the highest consumption rates worldwide. Via sewage-treatment plants, metformin enters surface waters where it is frequently detected in low concentrations (mu g/L). Since possible adverse effects of this substance in aquatic organisms have been insufficiently explored to date, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of metformin on health and development in brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and its microbiome.ResultsBrown trout embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 mu g/L metformin over a period from 48days post fertilisation (dpf) until 8weeks post-yolksac consumption at 7 degrees C (156dpf) and 11 degrees C (143dpf). Chemical analyses in tissues of exposed fish showed the concentration-dependent presence of metformin in the larvae. Mortality, embryonic development, body length, liver tissue integrity, stress protein levels and swimming behaviour were not influenced. However, compared to the controls, the amount of hepatic glycogen was higher in larvae exposed to metformin, especially in fish exposed to the lowest metformin concentration of 1 mu g/L, which is environmentally relevant. At higher metformin concentrations, the glycogen content in the liver showed a high variability, especially for larvae exposed to 1000 mu g/L metformin. Furthermore, the body weight of fish exposed to 10 and 100 mu g/L metformin at 7 degrees C and to 1 mu g/L metformin at 11 degrees C was decreased compared with the respective controls. The results of the microbiome analyses indicated a shift in the bacteria distribution in fish exposed to 1 and 10 mu g/L metformin at 7 degrees C and to 100 mu g/L metformin at 11 degrees C, leading to an increase of Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.ConclusionsOverall, weight reduction and the increased glycogen content belong to the described pharmaceutical effects of the drug in humans, but this study showed that they also occur in brown trout larvae. The impact of a shift in the intestinal microbiome caused by metformin on the immune system and vitality of the host organism should be the subject of further research before assessing the environmental relevance of the pharmaceutical.

AB The United States (US) National Park Service (NPS) manages protected public lands to preserve biodiversity. Exposure to and effects of bioactive organic contaminants in NPS streams are challenges for resource managers. Recent assessment of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in protected-streams within the urbanized NPS Southeast Region (SER) indicated the importance of fluvial inflows from external sources as drivers of aquatic contaminant-mixture exposures. Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), lies within SER, has the highest biodiversity and annual visitation of NPS parks, but, in contrast to the previously studied systems, straddles a high-elevation hydrologic divide; this setting limits fluvial-inflows of contaminants but potentially increases visitation-driven contaminant deliveries. We leveraged the unique characteristics of GRSM to test further the importance of fluvial contaminant inflows as drivers of protected-stream exposures and to inform the relative importance of potential additional contaminant transport mechanisms, by comparing the estimated risks of 328 pesticides and pharmaceuticals in water at 16 GRSM stream locations to those estimated previously in SER streams. Extensive mixtures (31 compounds) were only observed in an atypical reach on the boundary of GRSM downstream of a wastewater discharge, while limited mixtures (2-5 compounds) were observed in one stream with elevated visitation pressure (recreational "tube floating"). The insecticide, imidacloprid, used to eradicate hemlock woolly adelgid, was detected in 8 (50%) streams. Infrequent exceedances of a cumulative ToxCast-based, exposure-activity ratio (Sigma(EAR)) 0.001 screening-level of concern suggested limited risk to nontarget, aquatic vertebrates, whereas exceedances of a cumulative benchmark-based, invertebrate toxicity quotient (Sigma(TQ)) 0.1 screening level at 8 locations indicated generally high risk to invertebrates. The results are consistent with the importance of fluvial transport from extra-park sources as a driver of bioactive-contaminant mixture exposures in protected streams and illustrate the potential additional risks from visitation-driven and tactical-use-pesticides.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), such as the commonly prescribed antibiotic ciprofloxacin, are present and persistent in freshwaters, yet their effects on aquatic ecosystem functions at environmentally-relevant concentrations are rarely explored. Stream biofilms provide multiple functions in stream ecosystems, but their functional response to PPCP contaminants such as ciprofloxacin is unclear. To establish the effect of ciprofloxacin on aquatic biofilms, we colonized biofilms in situ on tiles (n = 80) at four sites along an urban stream in Gainesville, Florida, including two sites above and two sites below a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We then incubated the tiles and associated biofilms in the laboratory for 6 d exposing biofilms to either 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mu g/L (target concentrations) of ciprofloxacin. At the end of the 6 d laboratory exposure, we quantified gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and biomass (as chlorophyll a) of biofilms, and calculated response ratios for each response. All response metrics were significantly differed across sites (p < 0.01). Ciprofloxacin significantly decreased GPP (p < 0.05) regardless of treatment concentration, most notably at the site immediately below the WWTP, where there was no measurable GPP on any ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms. In contrast, respiration (R) was not significantly affected by ciprofloxacin, despite an apparent increase in R at the WWTP site. However, the WWTP site R was significantly different from the most upstream and downstream sites (p < (moo but was not significantly different from a nearby site upstream of the WWTP (p > 0.05). These results indicate that chronic exposure to ciprofloxacin through WWTP effluent can alter ecosystem functions performed by biofilms, which can have consequences for higher trophic levels and stream processes. By quantifying biofilm metabolic responses to ciprofloxacin exposure, this study supports the concept that pharmaceuticals and personal care products can induce sub-lethal effects on ecological processes at environmentally-relevant concentrations.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), as an emerging contaminant in aquatic environments, has sparked increasing concerns about its impact on the environment. Nitrification in wastewater treatment processing has removed DCF to a large extent. However, the removal characteristics and mechanisms of DCF in the nitrification process are still poorly understood. In this study, enriched nitrifying sludge was used to investigate the transformation of DCF during the nitrification process. Elimination of DCF caused by volatilization, hydrolyzation and adsorption was limited. Abiotic nitration removal was confirmed as significant in enriched nitrifying sludge at a low pH and high nitrite concentration. Free nitrite acid was proposed as the reaction species participating in the DCF transformation process, and a regression equation was developed to predict the contribution of abiotic nitration on DCF removal in enriched nitrifying sludge. By slowly and continuously adding an ammonia stock solution and controlling the pH, we avoided the effect of abiotic nitration removal, and DCF biodegradation was positively correlated to specific ammonium oxidation rates (SAORs). The removal of DCF fit the first order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.8285, p < 0.05) with an SAOR of 0.25 mg NH4+-N/(gMLSS.min). The high removal rate constant of k (0.1286 L/(gMLSS.h)) and short half-life (2.48 h) revealed the strong capability of nitrifying bacteria to transform DCF. Nine DCF transformation products were identified and three of them were quantified in the transformation process. The formation of kinetic profile 4-OH-DCF, 5-OH-DCF and DCF-Benzoic acid (DCF-BA) implied that hydroxylation may be the first reaction of DCF and DCF-BA may be a terminal product that resists further degradation. The postulated reactions concerning the transformation of DCF were hydroxylation, lactam formation and oxidation. Accordingly, a detailed degradation pathway was presented.

AB Pharmaceutical residues impose a new and emerging threat to the marine environment and its biota. In most countries, ecotoxicity tests are not required for all pharmaceutical residues classes and, even when mandatory, these tests are not performed using marine primary producers such as diatoms. These microalgae are among the most abundant class of primary producers in the marine realm and key players in the marine trophic web. Blood-lipid-lowering agents such as bezafibrate and its derivatives are among the most prescribed drugs and most frequently found human pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The present study aims to investigate the bezafibrate ecotoxicity and its effects on primary productivity and lipid metabolism, at environmentally relevant concentrations, using the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Under controlled conditions, diatom cultures were exposed to bezafibrate at 0, 3, 6, 30 and 60 mu g L-1, representing concentrations that can be found in the vicinity of discharges of wastewater treatment plants. High bezafibrate concentrations increased cell density and are suggested to promote a shift from autotrophic to mixotrophic metabolism, with diatoms using light energy generated redox potential to breakdown bezafibrate as carbon source. This was supported by an evident increase in cell density coupled with an impairment of the thylakoid electron transport and consequent photosynthetic activity reduction. In agreement, the concentrations of plastidial marker fatty acids showed negative correlations and Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates of the relative abundances of fatty acid and photochemical data allowed the separation of controls and cells exposed to bezafibrate with high classification efficiency, namely for photochemical traits, suggesting their validity as suitable biomarkers of bezafibrate exposure. Further evaluations of the occurrence of a metabolic shift in diatoms due to exposure to bezafibrate is paramount, as ultimately it may reduce O-2 generation and CO2 fixation in aquatic ecosystems with ensuing consequences for neighboring heterotrophic organisms.

AB This study evaluates the treatment of the antibiotic cloxacillin (CLX) in water by means of electrochemical oxidation, TiO2 photocatalysis, and the photo-Fenton system. The three treatments completely removed cloxacillin and eliminated the residual antimicrobial activity from synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic, commercial excipients, and inorganic ions. However, significant differences in the degradation routes were found. In the photo-Fenton process, the hydroxyl radical was involved in the antibiotic removal, while in the TiO2 photocatalysis process, the action of both the holes and the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals degraded the pollutant. In the electrochemical treatment (using a Ti/IrO2 anode in sodium chloride as supporting electrolyte), oxidation via HClO played the main role in the removal of CLX. The analysis of initial by-products showed five different mechanistic pathways: oxidation of the thioether group, opening of the central beta-lactam ring, breakdown of the secondary amide, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, and decarboxylation. All the oxidation processes exhibited the three first pathways. Moreover, the aromatic ring hydroxylation was found in both photochemical treatments, while the decarboxylation of the pollutant was only observed in the TiO2 photocatalysis process. As a consequence of the degradation routes and mechanistic pathways, the elimination of organic carbon was different. After 480 and 240 min, the TiO2 photocatalysis and photo-Fenton processes achieved similar to 45 and similar to 15 % of mineralization, respectively. During the electrochemical treatment, 100 % of the organic carbon remained even after the antibiotic was treated four times the time needed to degrade it. In contrast, in all processes, a natural matrix (mineral water) did not considerably inhibit pollutant elimination. However, the presence of glucose in the water significantly affected the degradation of CLX by means of TiO2 photocatalysis.

AB In the twenty-first century, energy is considered as the most important issue for human sustainability. The world's dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater effluents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of biofuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i.e., high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of biofuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable. The integration of genomics, metabolic engineering, nanotechnology, and other areas to the aforementioned issues shall lead to a wide range of benefits for the tasks demanded by the forthcoming bioenergy industries.

AB In this paper, the photocatalytic activity of plasma-functionalized Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and the oxidization process of atmospheric pressure plasma jet were combined for the degradation of reactive red-198 (RR-198) in aqueous solution. The first part of the study was thus devoted to subject Cu-TiO2 NPs synthetized by the sol-gel method to various plasma treatments operating in air, argon, oxygen and nitrogen to improve their degradation efficiency. The physicochemical properties of the NPs were then assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. XRD results indicated the predominant presence of the anatase phase which is the most photoactive form of TiO2. The XPS analysis revealed that the different plasma treatments triggered the formation of oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ oxidation state and Cu2+ oxidation state on the surface of Cu-TiO2 NPs. These changes, known to prevent the recombination of electron-hole pair, have led to a reduction in the bandgap that was more pronounced for the N-2 plasma-treated NPs. The second part of the paper explored the actual degradation of RR-198 in aqueous solution by an Ar plasma treatment alone or combined with the plasma pre-treated Cu-TiO2 NPs. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and spectrophotometric analyses showed that the synergetic effect of Ar plasma and N-2 plasma-treated NPs produced the highest concentration of OH center dot radicals and H2O2 species which led to the highest RR-198 degradation efficiency. This was further confirmed by pH, electrical conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) removal measurements. The degradation of RR-198 was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Overall, it can be concluded that plasma-assisted processes illustrated by a combination of a direct plasma treatment with plasma-functionalized Cu-TiO2 NPs can be used in various textile and pharmaceutical industries as a highly effective treatment of their effluents before discharging.

AB The conversion of major ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides attracts a lot of interest because of their biological and pharmaceutical activities. Therefore, for the conversion of ginsenosides, finding a novel competent glycoside hydrolase-producing bacterial strain is useful for future research studies and the mass production of minor ginsenosides. Wastewater samples were collected and screened for novel glycoside hydrolase bacterial strains using Reasoner's 2A+aesculin agar medium. As a result, a novel glycoside hydrolase positive bacterial strain (SB-02(T)) was identified and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Based on genome analysis, strain SB-02(T) was found to be affiliated with the family Chitinophagaceae and have less than 92.8 % sequence similarity to other members of the same family. Functional analysis indicated that SB-02(T) was able to hydrolyse the ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd to F2 and C-K. Due to the conversion of ginsenosides, the strain's genome was sequenced and the genes were annotated by the NCBI. The average amino acid identity and average nucleotide identity values between SB-02(T) and the available reference genomes were 65.7 and 65.9%, respectively. The novel isolate contained MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone, the major polyamine putrescine, and iso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:1 G and iso-C-17:0 3-OH as major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Thus, based on the data presented here, strain SB-02(T) represents a novel species within a new genus in the family Chitinophagaceae, for which the name Phnomibacter ginsenosidimutans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Phnomibacter ginsenosidimutans is SB-02(T) (=KACC 21266(T)=LMG 31707(T)). The genome annotation of SB-02(T) shows many glycoside hydrolase genes, which may be responsible for the efficient production of many kinds of minor ginsenosides and will be very helpful for future research (target gene cloning) and mass production of either F2 or C-K.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is an extensively produced and consumed chemical in the world. Due to its widespread use, contamination by this pollutant has increased in recent years, reaching a critical environmental point. This work investigates the feasibility of bisphenol A adsorption from industrial wastewater solutions, testing the reduction of bisphenol A in synthetic solutions by a commercial activated carbon, AC-40, in batch mode. Besides, mixtures of bisphenol A and different heavy metal cations were also studied. So far, no works have reported a complete study about bisphenol A removal by this activated carbon including the use of this material to remove BPA in the presence of metal cations. First, adsorption experiments were performed in batch changing pH, dose of adsorbent, initial bisphenol A concentration and contact time. Results showed greater retention of bisphenol A by increasing the acidity of the medium. Further, the percentage of bisphenol A adsorbed increased with increasing contact time. The selected conditions for the rest of the experiments were pH 5 and a contact time of 48 h. In addition, an increase in retention of bisphenol A when the dose of adsorbent increased was observed. Then, specific experiments were carried out to define the kinetics and the adsorption isotherm. Equilibrium data were adequately fitted to a Langmuir isotherm and the kinetics data fitted well to the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity provided by Langmuir model was 94.34 mg/g. Finally, the effect of the presence of other heavy metals in water solution on the adsorption of bisphenol A was analyzed. Binary tests revealed competition between the adsorbates and a significant selectivity toward bisphenol A. Finally, the study of the adsorption performance in three consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles showed efficiencies higher than 90% in all cycles, indicating that the activated carbon has good reusability.

AB Extensive and intense human activity has altered the balance of ecosystems to the detriment of the natural environment. Human migration has occurred throughout history. The movement of people, capital, goods, and services has caused different ecosystem changes, including deforestation. Coastal urbanization is a challenge for conservation, as people moving away from rural and protected areas has increased per capita demand for energy, goods, and services. Nowadays, most people migrate either temporarily or permanently to tropical coastal tourist areas. In the Yucatan Peninsula, migration has been taking place since the 1970s, with differing environmental impacts. The tourists are increasing every year, which demanding ecotourism facilities and industrial development increases to support population and business activities. Coastal water quality is also affected by increasing tourism development. Environmental awareness is lagging as efficient waste treatment systems are lacking. The water quality of the aquifer and the coast are threatened. This area has no rivers because of its karst geomorphology, the coastal freshwater comes from springs or seeps, and aquifers are the only freshwater source. Domestic garbage and wastewater are the main sources of pollution. The Yucatan Peninsula coast is undoubtedly an important economic resource for Mexico, which requires the implementation of integrated coastal management, keeping in mind that continental human activities have a direct impact into coastal environment. It is unquestionable that successful coastal management of ecotourism must be implemented on the basis of efficient waste treatment, which requires more in-depth knowledge of the area. There should be permanent water quality monitoring programs, as well as long-term studies on the oceanographic and biogeochemical processes that control water quality dynamics, which are probably driven by stochastic events and by probable climate change. These factors will also complicate both conservation and migration flows. Also, this will involve fostering agreements among people, industrialists, and government to execute preventive and corrective actions. Water quality conservation is important for two reasons: first, for the preservation of coastal water quality and the beautiful scenery for ecotourism; and second, for freshwater quality protection. Taking action will contribute to the sustainable development of this region of Mexico.

AB The photoelectro-Fenton (PEF)-like process based on the replacement of H2O2 by HClO remains quite unexplored. Its ability to mineralize solutions containing 0.208 mM of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX), either in 25 mM Na2SO4 + 35 mM NaCl or 45 mM Na2SO4 + 15 mM NaCl media, has been evaluated. The assays were performed in a 3 L pre-pilot flow plant composed of a filter-press FM01-LC reactor, which was equipped with an Ir-Sn-Ru oxide anode and a stainless steel cathode, coupled to an annular photoreactor containing a 160 W UVA lamp. A higher amount of active chlorine (HClO) was produced as the electrolysis was prolonged and the current density was increased. The accumulated HClO concentration dropped down more rapidly at a greater Fe2+ content due to the enhanced oxidant decomposition that yielded center dot OH in the bulk. A continuous production of this radical was ensured from the effective Fe2+ regeneration, being favored by cathodic reduction and photoreduction of dissolved Fe(III) species. The SMX degradation was faster in 25 mM Na2SO4 + 35 mM NaCl mM because of the quicker HClO generation, although the larger proportion of recalcitrant chloro-derivatives and iron-chlorocomplexes decelerated the mineralization process. In 45 mM Na2SO4 + 15 mM NaCl, the best PEF-like treatment was attained at 0.4 mM Fe2+ and 15 mA cm(-2), achieving the complete antibiotic disappearance at 60 min and 59.7% mineralization after 420 min, with an energy consumption of 0.776 kWh (g TOC)(-1). Sixteen intermediates were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, ten of which were chlorinated, allowing the proposal of a reaction route for SMX. Since the final solutions did not contain chloro-organics, the partial mineralization was mainly related to the accumulation of refractory non-chlorinated carboxylic acids that could not form photoactive Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes because of the presence of iron-chlorocomplexes.

AB Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a water-soluble anticancer drug widely used to treat several types of cancer.
   Even if the metabolites of CPT-11 are well-known and investigated, only limited information is available in the literature about the formation of photo-degradation products that can naturally originate from sunlight irradiation when the drug is released in aqueous systems.
   CTP-11 solutions at 10.0 mg L-1 were irradiated by simulated sunlight. The intensity of the drug decreased by 90% after 7.5 days of irradiation and no significant reduction of absorbance values was observed after 13 days.
   A sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed employing a hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer, that is able to work in data-dependent acquisition mode and to obtain information about the compounds formed during the photoirradiation. Moreover, a selected reaction monitoring method was built using the MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the compounds previously investigated. The method was validated considering LOD, LOQ, linearity, precision, selectivity, recovery and matrix effect. LOD and LOQ values were 0.02 and 0.05 ng mL(-1), respectively, whereas MDL and MQL values in real water samples (river water, groundwater, well water, and wastewater) were lower than 0.05 and 0.2 ng mL(-1), respectively.
   Eight photodegradation products were identified, among which five for the first time. Based on the MS and MS/MS fragmentation, the chemical structures of the degradation products were proposed. Hydrolysis experiments were carried out on the same solutions preserved in the dark, but no formation of other species was highlighted.
   The method was applied to several real samples: CPT-11 was detected and quantified only in a hospital effluent sample at the concentration of 0.41 +/- 0.2 ng mL(-1) together with the occurrence of PDP3.
   The outcomes of this study may be useful for updating the pollutant screening in water samples. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Abundantly available chitin/chitosan and their derivatives are full of useful bioactivities. They have numerous applications in industries like food, wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, cosmetics etc. However, their insolubility in water plays spoilsport in way of their use as cost-effective biomolecules for various sectors. Breakage of chitosan to smaller oligosaccharides solves this problem to larger extent preferably using highly specific enzymes. It is well known that that bioactivities of oligosaccharides improve upon hydrolysis to lower molecular weight chitosan i.e. chitooligosaccharides. Availability and production of anti-oxidant chitooligosaccharides by non-chemical approach is desirable for consumer satisfaction. Bioprocessing of chitin/chitosan generated from marine waste to be used as bioactive chitooligosaccharides, can reduce both environmental and human health hazards to a great extent.
   Here we review (1) biocatalytic approaches for chitooligosaccharides production, (2) bioprocess strategies for large scale production, (3) functionalization and (4) antioxidant activity of chitooligosaccharides. Specific and non-specific biocatalysts are used for chitooligomer preparation either by hydrolysis and transglycosylation approaches. Cellulase enzymes have been found to be most frequently used non-specific enzymes for chitosan hydrolysis but microbial chitosanases show excellent performance for chitooligosaccharides production both in terms of yield and specificity. Transglycosylation also have been found to be promising for chitooligosaccharides production especially at small scale. Combination reactors have been found to be most suitable for upscaling of chitooligomer production. Immobilized packed column with ultrafiltration membrane reactors are used for simultaneous hydrolysis and separation of chitooligomers. Chemically synthesized derivatives of chitooligomers have been reported in many studies by introducing carboxyl, quaternized amino, amino ethyl, sulfate, gallyl and many more groups. Amino ethyl, Gallyl, sulphated, phenolic acid conjugated and carboxylated derivatized chitooligomers have shown anti-oxidant activity. Anti-oxidant activity of chitooligomers and relation with their structure and polymerisation has been well established. Chitooligomers longer than trimer show good activity while best activity has been reported in degree of polymerisation from 10 to 12.

AB A proof-of-concept experiment was devised to determine if pharmaceuticals and other organic waste water compounds (OWCs), as well as pathogens, found in treated effluent could be transported through a 2.4 m soil column and, thus, potentially reach ground water under recharge conditions similar to those in and or semiarid climates. Treated effluent was applied at the top of the 2.4 m long, 32.5 cm diameter soil column over 23 days. Samples of the column inflow were collected from the effluent storage tank at the beginning (T-begin) and end (T-end) of the experiment, and a sample of the soil column drainage at the base of the column (Bend) was collected at the end of the experiment. Samples were analyzed for 131 OWCs including veterinary and human antibiotics, other prescription and nonprescription drugs, widely used household and industrial chemicals, and steroids and reproductive hormones, as well as the pathogens Salmonella and Legionella. Analytical results for the two effluent samples taken at the beginning (Tbegin) and end (Tend) of the experiment indicate that the number of OWCs detected in the column inflow decreased by 25% (eight compounds) and the total concentration of OWCs decreased by 46% while the effluent was in the storage tank during the 23-day experiment. After percolating through the soil column, an additional 18 compounds detected in Tend (67% of OWCs) were no longer detected in the effluent (Bend) and the total concentration of OWCs decreased by more than 70%. These compounds may have been subject to transformation (biotic and abiotic), adsorption, and (or) volatilization in the storage tank and during travel through the soil column. Eight compounds-carbamazapine; sulfamethoxazole; benzophenone; 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole; N, N-diethyltoluamide; tributylphosphate; tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate; and cholesterol-were detected in all three samples indicating they have the potential to reach ground water under recharge conditions similar to those in and and semiarid climates. Results from real-time polymerase chain reactions demonstrated the presence of Legionella in all three samples. Salmonella was detected only in Tbegin, suggesting that the bacteria died off in the effluent storage tank over the period of the experiment. This proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that, under recharge conditions similar to those in and or semiarid climates, some pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and other OWCs can persist in treated effluent after soil-aquifer treatment.

AB In this laboratory experiment, students explore the aquatic photochemical fate of ranitidine and cimetidine, two common pharmaceutical pollutants found in wastewater. It provides an engaging environmental context for students to develop knowledge of reaction kinetics and photochemistry as well as skill in using analytical instrumentation. This versatile experiment consists of two basic modules, three optional advanced modules, and additional add-ons that may be performed in various combinations to meet the unique learning objectives of general analytical, physical, and environmental chemistry courses and science outreach activities. It may be performed as a traditional lab experiment or as an entirely remote exercise with an increased focus on data analysis and interpretation using provided example data sets. All of the photolysis experiments are carried out by preparing solutions of ranitidine or cimetidine in various matrices, irradiating the samples, and periodically removing subsamples for HPLC analysis of the compound of interest. Pseudo-first order kinetic plots are then generated to determine rate constants that are used to draw conclusions about photolysis pathways or to calculate additional kinetic parameters. In the two basic modules, cimetidine is found to degrade appreciably only when irradiated in the presence natural organic matter (NOM), indicating an indirect, photosensitized degradation pathway. In contrast, ranitidine degrades in pure buffer and in the presence of NOM with comparable rate constants, highlighting the predominant role of direct photolysis. In the advanced modules, students calculate ranitidine direct photolysis quantum yields and examine the significance of singlet oxygen as a photochemically produced reactive intermediate. The two basic modules may be completed in two 3 hour lab periods, while the advanced modules require additional time. This experiment requires only an HPLC instrument, inexpensive chemicals, and common glassware and lab equipment if performed in person and a personal computer if performed remotely.

AB In recent years, the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has been of growing interest. These new contaminants are important because many of them are not degraded under the typical biological treatments applied in the wastewater treatment plants and represent a continuous input into the environment. Thus, compounds such as diclofenac are resent in surface waters in all Europe and a crucial need for more enhanced technologies that can reduce its presence in the environment has become evident. In this sense, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) represent a good choice for the treatment of hazardous nonbiodegradable pollutants. This work deals with the solar photodegradation of diclofenac, an antiinflammatory drug, in aqueous solutions by photo-Fenton reaction. A pilot-scale facility using a compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor was used for this study. Results obtained show rapid and complete oxidation of diclofenac after 60 min, and total mineralization (disappearance of dissolved organic carbon, DOC) after 100 min of exposure to sunlight. Although diclofenac precipitates during the process at low pH, its degradation takes place in the homogeneous phase governed by a precipitation-redissolution-degradation process. Establishment of the reaction pathway was made possible by a thorough analysis of the reaction mixture identifying the main intermediate products generated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) were used to identify 18 intermediates, in two tentative degradation routes. The main one was based on the initial hydroxylation of the phenylacetic acid moiety in the C-4 position and subsequent formation of a quinone imine derivative that was the starting point for further multistep degradation involving hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and oxidation reactions. An alternative route was based on the transient preservation of the biphenyl amino moiety that underwent a similar oxidative process of C-N bond cleavage. The proposed degradation route differs from those previously reported involving alternative degradation processes (ozonization, UV/H2O2, or photolysis), indicating that diclofenac degradation follows different pathways, depending on the treatment applied.

AB Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Consequently, these compounds are frequently identified in global waterways where they may pose a hazard to aquatic biota. Evidence demonstrates these compounds to be capable of influencing the behaviour of fish, but the relevance of many reported behavioural endpoints is unclear and the value of some findings has been questioned. Since these compounds act on neuroendocrine-mediated pathways in vertebrates, the present study explored how exposure to two representative SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and an SNRI (venlafaxine) affect circadian rhythms in fish. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L concentrations of these compounds individually and when present as a full mixture, for a period of one week. Neither fluoxetine nor sertraline had an impact on diurnal activity patterns when fish were exposed to these compounds alone at any concentration, whereas venlafaxine significantly disrupted normal circadian rhythmicity but only at 100 mu g/L. When fish were exposed to the full mixture, significantly altered diurnal activity patterns were rapidly observed at nominal concentrations of 1 and 100 mu g/L, but there was no effect at 10 mu g/L. This sort of non-monotonic dose relationship is not altogether unusual for fish exposed to antidepressants, but it poses a problem when attempting to evaluate potential risks to the aquatic environment. To evaluate the possibility for misinterpretation when collecting behavioural data over short temporal scales, the data for each day of the experiment was analysed separately. The outcomes demonstrate the importance of longer periods of data collection, which may be necessary to capture the full range of natural behavioural variability that exists both amongst and within individual fish. More importantly, these findings may help reveal why discrepancies are commonly being reported in the literature with regards behavioural effects in fish exposed to antidepressants. It is thus suggested that research be aimed at documenting behavioural variability in fish species used in toxicity testing, to establish guidelines for quality control and where possible inform the development of standardised methodologies so that behavioural analysis can be more appropriately applied to the broad field of aquatic toxicology.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are now considered as emerging contaminants of environmental concern. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the uptake and translocation of clofibric acid (CA) by the macrophyte Scirpus validus growing hydroponically. A set of the three replicates was established for each exposure time and for each CA concentration. Plants were grown in 4 L vessels (four plants per vessel corresponding to the three exposure period studies, i.e., 7, 14, 18, and 21 days) which contained an aerated modified Hoagland nutrient solution that was spiked with CA at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1. At each exposure period, CA concentration was measured in the nutrient solutions. A sea sand disruption method was employed for the extraction of CA from plant tissues. The determination of the pharmaceutical concentration was carried out using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by chromatographic analysis. The quantification of CA concentrations in both nutrient solutions (after SPE) and plant tissues (after extraction) was conducted by chromatographic analysis. CA concentrations of 5.4-26.8 mu g g(-1) (fresh weight) were detected in the roots and 7.2-34.6 mu g g(-1) (fresh weight) in the shoots after 21 days. Mass balance calculations showed that S. validus uptake alone accounted for a significant contribution (6-13 % for the roots and 22-49 % for the shoots) of the total loss of CA. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) based on fresh weight for the roots ranged from 6.6 to 23.2, while values for the shoots ranged from 9.5 to 32.1. All the BAFs for the shoots were greater than those in the roots, implying that CA has greater tendency to be translocated to the shoots, rather than the roots of S. validus. All the shoot-to-root concentration ratios were more than 1, denoting that the shoots of S. validus do preferentially accumulate CA. We demonstrated that CA can be actively taken up, subsequently translocated and accumulated by aboveground tissues of S. validus. Since S. validus could account for the removal of 28-62 % of the total mass loss of CA from the system, such phytoremediation technology has great potential for the removal of pharmaceuticals such as CA from inflowing waters.

AB Background The successful application of Fish plasma model (FPM) will greatly simplify the risk assessment of drugs. At present, the FPM has been applied to the risk assessment of several human drugs with high hydrophobicity. However, its applicability to a wide variety of compounds needs to be tested. Field work about distribution characteristics of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in water and in fish plasma plays a key role in promoting the successful application of FPM. However, there are few reports on the distribution of EDCs in fish, especially in wild fish plasma. Results The distribution of 31 EDCs, including seven estrogens, eight androgens, six progesterones, five glucocorticoids, and five industrial compounds, in water and plasma of five categories of wild fishes in Taihu Lake was studied and the typical FPM was tested by the field data. The detected concentration of most compounds is relatively low (< 10 ng/L), and the industrial compounds are the predominant pollutants with the highest concentration up to 291.7 ng/L (Bisphenol A) in water. In general, glucocorticoids were detected at the highest concentrations in plasma of all kinds of fishes, followed by industrial compounds and estrogens. Except for glucocorticoids (up to 43.61 for Cortisone), the average concentrations of the other four categories of EDCs in fish plasma were generally low (< 10 mu g/L). The available measured bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of 20 kinds of EDCs were in the range of 0 to 5626. The bioaccumulation of EDCs in fish plasma is not only hydrophobicity-dependent, but is also both fish species-specific and compound-dependent. The classical FPM was tested and the results indicated that the good coincides of measured log BAFs and the theoretical log BCFs were only observed for limited EDCs (7 out of 20). The present available FPM generally underestimated the Log BAFs of most hydrophilic EDCs (log Kow < 3.87, 11 out of 20) whereas overestimated the Log BAFs of several high hydrophobic EDCs (Log Kow > 3.87) in fish plasma. Conclusion Although the present FPM is barely satisfactory, it is still promising for predicting the accumulation of EDCs in fish plasma and for further environmental risk assessment.

AB Today, environmental pollution with pharmaceutical drugs and their metabolites poses a major threat to the aquatic ecosystems. Active substances such as fenofibrate, are processed to pharmaceutical drug formulations before they are degraded by the human body and released into the wastewater. Compared to the conventional product Lipidil (R) 200, the pharmaceutical product Lipidil 145 One (R) and Ecocaps take advantage of nanotechnology to improve uptake and bioavailability of the drug in humans. In the present approach, a combination of in vitro drug release studies and physiologically-based biopharmaceutics modeling was applied to calculate the emission of three formulations of fenofibrate (Lipidil (R) 200, Lipidil 145 One (R), Ecocaps) into the environment. Special attention was paid to the metabolized and non-metabolized fractions and their individual toxicity, as well as to the emission of nanomaterials. The fish embryo toxicity test revealed a lower aquatic toxicity for the metabolite fenofibric acid and therefore an improved toxicity profile. When using the microparticle formulation Lipidil (R) 200, an amount of 126 mg of non-metabolized fenofibrate was emitted to the environment. Less than 0.05% of the particles were in the lower nanosize range. For the nanotechnology-related product Lipidil 145 One (R), the total drug emission was reduced by 27.5% with a nanomaterial fraction of approximately 0.5%. In comparison, the formulation prototype Ecocaps reduced the emission of fenofibrate by 42.5% without any nanomaterials entering the environment. In a streamlined life cycle assessment, the lowered dose in combination with a lowered drug-to-metabolite ratio observed for Ecocaps led to a reduction of the full life cycle impacts of fenofibrate with a reduction of 18% reduction in the global warming potential, 61% in ecotoxicity, and 15% in human toxicity. The integrated environmental assessment framework highlights the outstanding potential of advanced modeling technologies to determine environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals during early drug development using preclinical in vitro data.

AB Investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters at a catchment scale can be daunting. These investments are highly sensitive to the selection of environmental quality standards (EQSs) for the target micro-contaminants. Our hypothesis is that there is a balance between EQS selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision-making. We used a customized microcontaminant fate and transport model coupled to an optimization algorithm to validate this hypothesis in the Llobregat river basin and for the pharmaceutical compound diclofenac. The algorithm optimizes the number of WWTPs in this catchment requiring an upgrade to minimize the total amount of diclofenac that exceeds the EQS in every river section and the total cost. We simulated and optimized 40 scenarios representing a combination of 4 potential EQSs (10, 30, 50 and 100 ng L-1), 5 levels of uncertainty bounds in the predictions of river concentrations and 2 hydrological scenarios (average flows, flows annually exceeding 30% of the days; and environmental flows, flows annually exceeding 99% of the days). The results showthat there is a nonlinear relationship between the EQS and the required investment. The investment increases by 100% from an EQS of 100 ng L-1 to 10 ng L-1, significantly increasing (by 60%) from 30 to 10 ng L-1. Thus, establishing an EQS of 30 ng L-1 would balance environmental protection and costs. The selection of the hydrological conditions also plays a key role in the upgrade analysis because the costs for environmental flows are 50% higher than for average flows. Finally, we highlight that the investment in research would allow the reduction of uncertainties, hence allowing more qualified decisions to be made and a reduction in the WWTP upgrade costs (up to 4 (sic) household(-1) "year(-1)).

AB Omeprazole is one of the world-wide most frequently prescribed and administered pharmaceuticals in humans for the relief of gastro-intestinal disorders. Despite its high worldwide consumption, omeprazole is rarely detected in urban wastewaters and environmental waters. On the other hand, its human urinary metabolites and transformation products formed through abiotic processes in the environment have been recently documented. Despite these available data, however, there is still a lack of information on the extent of environmental fate and occurrence, on elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in waste water treatment plants. In this study, the relevance of photodegradation processes on the environmental persistence of omeprazole under simulated and solar irradiation was investigated. Photodegradation experiments were performed in distilled water, lake, river and seawater, and revealed that the different matrix in natural waters significantly affect the photolytic behavior of the investigated compound. Overall, the results highlight that photodegradation process by solar irradiation significantly contributes to omeprazole degradation and elimination from the aquatic environment. TPs formed through the process were identified and elucidated by using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry. In total seven TPs were identified, among of which four were also detected as hydrolysis TPs. The Microtox bioassay showed that solar photolysis is efficient to detoxify omeprazole and its TPs in aqueous solutions. Finally, a systematic investigation was conducted in order to provide information on removal efficiency and occurrence of omeprazole and its metabolites/TPs in 8 WWTPs in North West Greece by performing target and suspect screening analysis. The findings revealed the presence of both parent compound and metabolites/TPs in wastewaters. Given, however, the scarce detection of omeprazole at fairly low concentration levels, from analytical and environmental point of view, further attention should be given to metabolites/fPs instead of the parent compound.

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) are important drugs used in human and veterinary medicine. Their detection in natural waters and waste water treatment plants, along with increased resistance to FQs among some bacteria, have generated an increased interest in the fate of these drugs in the environment. Partitioning of FQs between an aqueous solution and attendant substrates depends, in part, on the surface reactivity of the adsorbent, commonly a function of particle size, surface charge, and functional groups. This study investigated the surface interactions between the FQ drug ofloxacin (OFL) and titanium oxide (TiO2), a common catalyst and widely-observed constituent in many consumer products. Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, as well as LC/MS, were used to determine the OFL moieties present on TiO2 surfaces and in attendant solutions. Raman spectra indicate that the C=O (ketone) group of the quinolone core, the NH+ of the piperazinyl ring, and CH3 of benzoxazine core are the most active in sorption onto the TiO2 surface. Raman spectra also show that the sorbed benzoxazine-quinolone core and piperazinyl moieties are readily desorbed from the surface by re-suspending samples in water. Importantly, we found that OFL could be degraded by reacting with TiO2 even in the dark. Complementary LC/MS analysis of the attendant supernatants indicates the presence of de-piperazinylated and de-carboxylated OFL breakdown products in supernatant solutions. Together, both Raman and LC/MS analyses indicate that TiO2 breaks the compound into piperazinyl and carboxylate groups which attach to the surface, whereas decarboxylated and hydroxylated quinolone moieties remain in solution. The present study thus identifies the sorption mechanisms and breakdown products of OFL during dark reactions with TiO2, which is critically important for understanding the fate and transport of OFL as it enters the soil and aquatic environment.

AB A continuous active sampling method was compared to continuous passive and discrete sampling methods for the sampling of trace organic compounds (TOCs) in water. Results from each method are compared and contrasted in order to provide information for future investigators to use while selecting appropriate sampling methods for their research. The continuous low-level aquatic monitoring (CLAM) sampler (C.I.Agent (R) Storm-Water Solutions) is a submersible, low flow-rate sampler, that continuously draws water through solid-phase extraction media. CLAM samplers were deployed at two wastewater-dominated stream field sites in conjunction with the deployment of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and the collection of discrete (grab) water samples. All samples were analyzed for a suite of 69 TOCs. The CLAM and POCIS samples represent time-integrated samples that accumulate the TOCs present in the water over the deployment period (19-23 h for CLAM and 29 days for POCIS); the discrete samples represent only the TOCs present in the water at the time and place of sampling. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to examine patterns in both TOC detections and relative concentrations between the three sampling methods. A greater number of TOCs were detected in the CLAM samples than in corresponding discrete and POCIS samples, but TOC concentrations in the CLAM samples were significantly lower than in the discrete and (or) POCIS samples. Thirteen TOCs of varying polarity were detected by all of the three methods. TOC detections and concentrations obtained by the three sampling methods, however, are dependent on multiple factors. This study found that stream discharge, constituent loading, and compound type all affected TOC concentrations detected by each method. In addition, TOC detections and concentrations were affected by the reporting limits, bias, recovery, and performance of each method. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Monitoring pharmaceuticals throughout the water cycle is becoming increasingly important for the aquatic environment and eventually for human health. Targeted and non-targeted analysis are today's means of choice. Although targeted analysis usually conducted with the help of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer may be more sensitive, only compounds previously selected can be identified. The most powerful non-targeted analysis is performed through time of flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) extended by a quadrupole mass analyzer (Q), as used in this study. Preceded by solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the non-targeted approach allows to detect all ionizable substances with high sensitivity and selectivity. Taking full advantage of the Q-TOF-MS instrument, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments accelerate and facilitate the identification while a targeted MS method enhances the sensitivity but relies on reference standards for identification purposes. The identification of four pharmaceuticals from Rhine river water is demonstrated. The Rhine river originates in Tomasee, Graubunden, Switzerland and flows into the North Sea, near Southern Bight, The Netherlands. Its length amounts to 1232.7 km. Since it is of prime interest to effectively eliminate pharmaceuticals from the water cycle, the effect UV-C irradiation is demonstrated on a laboratory scale. This method allows fast degradation of pharmaceuticals, which is exemplarily shown for the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin. Using the above HPLC-Q-TOF-MS method, concentration-time diagrams are obtained for the parent drug and their photodegradation products. After establishing the equations for first-order sequential reactions, computational fitting allows the determination of kinetic parameters, which might help to predict irradiation times and conditions when potentially considered as fourth stage within wastewater treatment.

AB Complex mixtures of contaminants from multiple sources, including agriculture, industry or wastewater enter aquatic environments and might pose hazards or risks to humans or wildlife. Targeted analyses of a few priority substances provide limited information about water quality. In this study, a combined chemical and effect screening of water quality in the River Bosna, in Bosnia and Herzegovina was carried out, with focus on occurrence and effects of contaminants of emerging concern. Chemicals in water were sampled at 10 sites along the Bosna River by use of passive sampling. The combination of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) enabled sampling of a broad range of contaminants from hydrophobic (PAHs, PCBs, OCPs) to hydrophilic compounds (pesticides, pharmaceuticals and hormones), which were determined by use of GC-MS and LC-MS (MS). In vitro, cell-based bioassays were applied to assess (anti) androgenic, estrogenic and dioxin-like potencies of extracts of the samplers. Of a total of 168 targeted compounds, 107 were detected at least once. Cumulative pollutant concentrations decreased downstream from the city of Sarajevo, which was identified as the major source of organic pollutants in the area. Responses in all bioassays were observed for samples from all sites. In general, estrogenicity could be well explained by analysis of target estrogens, while the drivers of the other observed effects remained largely unknown. Profiling of hazard quotients identified two sites downstream of Sarajevo as hotspots of biological potency. Risk assessment of detected compounds revealed, that 7 compounds (diazinon, diclofenac, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, benzo[k] fluoranthene, fluoranthene and benzo[k] fluoranthene) might pose risks to aquatic biota in the Bosna River. The study brings unique results of a complex water quality assessment in a region with an insufficient water treatment infrastructure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water resources in many arid to semi-arid regions are stressed by population growth and drought. Growing populations and climatic changes are influencing contaminant and water chemistry dynamics in urban inland waters, where flows can be dominated by, or even dependent on, wastewater effluent discharge. In these watersheds, interacting stressors such as dissolved oxygen and environmental contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals) have the potential to affect fish physiology and populations. Recent field observations from our group identified the calcium channel blocker (CCB) diltiazem in fish plasma exceeding human therapeutic doses (e.g., C-min) in aquatic systems impaired because of nonattainment of dissolved oxygen water quality standards. Therefore our study objectives examined: 1) standard acute and chronic effects of dissolved oxygen and diltiazem to fish, 2) influences of dissolved oxygen at criteria levels deemed protective of aquatic life on diltiazem toxicity to fish, and 3) whether sublethal effects occur at diltiazem water concentrations predicted to cause a human therapeutic level (therapeutic hazard value [THV]) in fish plasma. Dissolved oxygenxdiltiazem co-exposures significantly decreased survival at typical stream, lake, and reservoir water quality standards of 5.0 and 3.0mg dissolved oxygen/L. Dissolved oxygen and diltiazem growth effects were observed at 2 times and 10 times lower than median lethal concentration (LC50) values (1.7 and 28.2mg/L, respectively). Larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) swimming behavior following low dissolved oxygen and diltiazem exposure generally decreased and was significantly reduced in light-to-dark bursting distance traveled, number of movements, and duration at concentrations as low as the THV. Individual and population level consequences of such responses are not yet understood, particularly in older organisms or other species; however, these findings suggest that assessments with pharmaceuticals and other cardioactive contaminants may underestimate adverse outcomes in fish across dissolved oxygen levels considered protective of aquatic life.

AB The two artificial sweeteners cyclamate (CYC) and acesulfame (ACE) have been detected in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants. As in both facilities ozonation might be applied, it is important to find out if undesired oxidation products (OPs) are formed.
   For the separation and detection of the OPs, several analytical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, were applied. In order to distinguish between direct ozone reaction and a radical mechanism, experiments were carried out at different pH values with and without scavenging OH radicals. Kinetic experiments were used for confirmation that the OPs are formed during short ozone contact time applied in waterworks. Samples from a waterworks using bank filtrate as raw water were analyzed in order to prove that the identified OPs are formed in real and full-scale ozone applications.
   In the case of CYC, oxidation mainly occurs at the carbon atom, where the sulfonamide moiety is bound to the cyclohexyl ring. Consequently, amidosulfonic acid and cyclohexanone are formed as main OPs of CYC. When ozone reacts at another carbon atom of the ring a keto moiety is introduced into the CYC molecule. Acetic acid and the product ACE OP170, an anionic compound with m/z=170 and an aldehyde hydrate moiety, were identified as the main OPs for ACE. The observed reaction products suggest an ozone reaction according to the Criegee mechanism due to the presence of a C=C double bond. ACE OP170 was also detected after the ozonation unit of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant which uses surface water-influenced bank filtrate as raw water.
   Acesulfame can be expected to be found in anthropogenic-influenced raw water used for drinking water production. However, when ACE OP170 is formed during ozonation, it is not expected to cause any problem for drinking water suppliers, because the primary findings suggest its removal in subsequent treatment steps, such as activated carbon filters.

AB The continuous increase of the human population worldwide has led to an increase of pharmaceuticals' consumption, such as diclofenac (DCF), a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), that is not removed by wastewater treatment processes. Although there is some research regarding the effects of DCF on animals and aquatic invertebrates, information concerning its influence on plants' metabolism is still scarce. Through an integrated approach, using combined biochemical and molecular biology techniques, this work aimed to evaluate the phytotoxicity of DCF in Solanum lycopersicum L., focusing on the primary plant processes: nitrogen (N) assimilation and photosynthesis. The exposure of tomato plants to increasing concentrations of DCF (0, 0.5, and 5 mg L-1) revealed that glutamine synthetase (GS) was differentially affected, in an organ-dependent manner, by this contaminant at the gene expression, protein, and activity levels, with an increased activity of 0.2-fold in shoots of plants treated with the lowest concentration of DCF although a general decrease was registered for the SlGS gene family expression, revealing that post-translational regulation was in order, since GS2 polypeptide content did not change. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity was generally enhanced, accompanied by increases of 0.4- to 1.9-fold in proline levels, revealing GDH as an important compensatory route for both N assimilation and proline production under stressful conditions. No alterations in most photosynthetic endpoints were noticed after DCF treatments, but small decreases of 0.1- to 0.8-fold in the accumulation of RuBisCO-encoding transcripts were observed, along with a reduction in starch content. Some alterations in the soluble polypeptide profile were also detected in response to DCF, evidencing the participation of some stress-related proteins in the plant's response to DCF.

AB The degradation of 230 mL of a 0.6-mM sulfanilamide solution in 0.05 M Na2SO4 of pH 3.0 has been studied by electro-Fenton process. The electrolytic cell contained either a Pt or boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon-felt cathode. Under these conditions, organics are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals formed at the anode surface from water oxidation and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction between initially added (and then electrochemically regenerated) Fe2+ and cathodically generated H2O2. From the decay of sulfanilamide concentration determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, an optimum Fe2+ concentration of 0.20 mM in both cells was found. The drug disappeared more rapidly using BDD than Pt, and, in both cases, it was more quickly removed with raising applied current. Almost total mineralization was achieved using the BDD/carbon-felt cell, whereas the alternative use of Pt anode led to a slightly lower mineralization degree. In both cells, the degradation rate was accelerated at higher current but with the concomitant fall of mineralization current efficiency due to the greater increase in rate of the parasitic reactions of hydroxyl radicals. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography allowed the identification of catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene as aromatic intermediates, whereas ion exclusion chromatography revealed the formation of malic, maleic, fumaric, acetic, oxalic, formic, and oxamic acids. NH4 (+), NO3 (-), and SO4 (2-) ions were released during the electro-Fenton process. A plausible reaction sequence for sulfanilamide mineralization involving all detected intermediates has been proposed. The toxicity of the solution was assessed from the Vibrio fischeri bacteria luminescence inhibition. Although it acquired its maximum value at short electrolysis time, the solution was completely detoxified at the end of the electro-Fenton treatment, regardless of the anode used.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is used in water and wastewater treatment as well as water recycling applications, treating micropollutants such as hormones. Due to their potential health risk it is critical to develop effective treatment processes. Polymeric NF membranes should be effective in removing such micropollutants based on molecular size. However, the occurrence of adsorption onto the membranes results in unpredictable performance. It is hence important to understand NF retention mechanisms.
   The focus of this study was to understand how estrone and estradiol adsorption and retention are affected by membrane operational parameters such as pressure. Reynolds numbers (based on channel height Re(h)) and feed concentration for the NF270 membrane. These variables are known to contribute to concentration polarisation, and therefore affect sorption and retention by NF membranes.
   The total mass adsorbed of both hormones was found to be governed by the initial concentration at the membrane surface. For example, for estradiol the increase of Re(h) number (427-1450) and pressure (3-17 bar) caused the total mass adsorbed to decrease (0.7-0.5 ng cm(-2)) and increase (0.4-0.8 ng cm(-2)), respectively. The same trends were obtained for estrone.
   Steady-state retention however was found to be dependent on the initial polarisation modulus, given by the ratio between the initial concentration at the membrane surface and the initial feed concentration. For estradiol at the same pressure conditions as above, the polarisation modulus increased from 1.1 to 1.9, causing a decrease of retention from 80% to 51%, whilst for the above Re(h) conditions, the polarisation modulus decreased from 1.5 to 1.0 causing an increase in retention from 69% to 83%.
   Following on from these results, a model based on a first order sorption kinetics was developed for this membrane allowing the prediction of the transient feed and permeate concentrations for the two hormones estrone and estradiol and a wide range of filtration parameters.

AB In this study, the contamination by polar organic pollutants was investigated along the Rhine River, an important source of drinking water for 22 million people in central Europe. Following the flow of the river, a traveling water mass was sampled using weekly flow-proportional composite samples at ten different downstream sites, including main tributaries. Using a broad analytical method based on solid phase extraction and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the water was analyzed for more than 300 target substances. While the water in Lake Constance contained only 83 substances in often low concentrations, the number of detects found in the water phase increased to 143 substances and a weekly load of more than 7 tons at the last sampling site, the Dutch-German border. Mostly present were chemicals originating from wastewater treatment plants, especially the artificial sweetener Acesulfam and two pharmaceuticals, Metformin and Gabapentin, which dominate the weekly load up to 58%. Although the sample campaign was performed in a dry period in early spring, a large variety of pesticides and biocides were detected. Several industrial point sources were identified along the waterway's 900 km journey, resulting in high concentrations in the tributaries and loads of up to 160 kg. Additionally, an unbiased non-target analysis was performed following two different strategies for the prioritization of hundreds of potentially relevant unknown masses. While for the first prioritization strategy, only chlorinated compounds were extracted from the mass spectrometer datasets, the second prioritization strategy was performed using a systematic reduction approach between the different sampling sites. Among others, two substances that never had been detected before in this river, namely, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine and the solvent 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), were identified and confirmed, and their loads were roughly estimated along the river.

AB Microbial degradation is an important pathway during the removal of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the effects of CW design, plant presence, and different plant species on the microbial community in CWs have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of L-arginine, L-phenyl-oalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations. These results provide useful information for optimizing the operational parameters of CWs to improve ibuprofen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing use of pharmaceuticals has led to their subsequent input into and release from wastewater treatment plants, with corresponding discharge into surface waters that may subsequently exert adverse effects upon aquatic organisms. Although the distribution of pharmaceuticals in surface water has been extensively studied, the details of uptake, internal distribution, and kinetic processing of pharmaceuticals in exposed fish have received less attention. For this research, we investigated the uptake, disposition, and toxicokinetics of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, methocarbamol, rosuvastatin, sulfamethoxazole, and temazepam) in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (1000-4000 ng L-1) in a flow-through exposure system. Temazepam and methocarbamol were consistently detected in bluegill biological samples with the highest concentrations in bile of 4, 940, and 180 ng g(-1), respectively, While sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, and rosuvastatin were only infrequently detected. Over 30-day exposures, the relative magnitude of mean concentrations of temazepam and methocarbamol in biological samples generally followed the order: bile >> gut > liver and brain > muscle, plasma, and gill. Ranges of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in different biological samples were 0.71-3960 and 0.13-48.6 for temazepam and methocarbamol, respectively. Log BCFs were statistically positively correlated to pH adjusted log K-ow (that is, log D-ow), with the strongest relations for liver and brain (r(2) = 0.92 and 0.99, respectively), implying that bioconcentration patterns of ionizable pharmaceuticals depend on molecular status, that is, whether a pharmaceutical is unionized or ionized at ambient-tissue pH. Methocarbamol and temazepam underwent rapid uptake and elimination in bluegill biological compartments with uptake rate constants (K-u) and elimination rate constants (K-e) at 0.0066-0:0330 h(-1) and 0.0075-0.0384 h(-1), respectively, and half-lives at 18.1-92.4 h. Exposure to mixtures of diclofenac, methocarbamol, sulfamethoxazole, and temazepam had little or no influence on the uptake and elimination rates, suggesting independent multiple uptake and disposition behaviors of pharmaceuticals by fish would occur when exposed to effluent-influenced surface waters.

AB As of 2008, approximately 48% of Americans use prescription drugs within any given 30-day period. Many pharmaceutical compounds are not fully metabolized by the human body, nor fully removed by wastewater treatment systems, before release into the environment. As a result, a vast array of pharmaceuticals has been detected in marine and freshwater organisms, sediments, and waters, with unintended effects on non -target organisms, and limited studies of environmental effects. The antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TRI), often presctibed together to treat bacterial infections, have been detected worldwide in marine and estuarine environments at concentrations up to 765-870 ng/L each. Little research has examined sub-lethal effects of antibiotic mixtures at environmentally-relevant concentrations on marine organisms. We examined the effects of mixtures of these two antibiotics on three marine microalgal species with wide geographic ranges: Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros neogracile, and Nannochloropsis oculata. In separate simulations using a temperature/light-controlled set-up, we measured the growth response for each species to environmentally-relevant levels of SMX and TRI. N. oculata growth was significantly reduced by mixture treatments of both drugs (p <0.05), by TRI (p <0.001), and by SMX (p <0.001), whereas only aggregated SMX levels significantly reduced growth for the other two species (p <0.005). The exposure time at which growth rates were affected varied across species, with significant reduction in growth focused in the latter half of the experimental Period for C. neogracile and N. oculata (Days 15 and 6 respectively), and midway through the experimental period for I. galbana (by Day 3). This study finds that important marine primary producers respond to the presence of SMX and TRI in the water, offering an understanding of environmental Consequences of anthropogenic pharmaceuticals contaminants, and specifically the suite of antibiotics, that are released into marine ecosystems at an ever-growing rate, and highlighting potential cascading effects through trophic levels.

AB Considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals are used in human and veterinary medicine, which are not efficiently removed during wastewater and slurries treatment and subsequently entering continuously into freshwater systems. The intrinsic biological activity of these non-regulated pollutants turns their presence in the aquatic environment into an ecological matter of concern. We present the first quantitative study relating the presence of pharmaceuticals and their predicted ecotoxicological effects with human population and livestock units. Four representative Iberian River basins (Spain) were studied: Llobregat, Ebro, Jucar and Guadalquivir. The levels of pharmaceuticals were determined in surface water and sediment samples collected from 77 locations along their stream networks. Predicted total toxic units to algae, Daphnia and fish were estimated for pharmaceuticals detected in surface waters. The use of chemometrics enabled the study of pharmaceuticals for: their spatial distribution along the rivers in two consecutive years; their potential ecotoxicological risk to aquatic organisms; and the relationships among their occurrence and predicted ecotoxicity with human population and animal farming pressure. The Llobregat and the Ebro River basins were characterized as the most polluted and at highest ecotoxicological risk, followed by Jucar and Guadalquivir. No significant acute risks of pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms were observed. However potential chronic ecotoxicological effects on algae could be expected at two hot spots of pharmaceuticals pollution identified in the Llobregat and Ebro basins. Analgesics/antiinflammatories, antibiotics and diuretics were the most relevant therapeutic groups across the four river basins. Among them, hydrochlorothiazide and gemfibrozil, as well as azithromycin and ibuprofen were widely spread and concentrated pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments, respectively. Regarding their predicted ecotoxicity, sertraline, gemfibrozil and loratidine were identified as the more concerning compounds. Significantly positive relationships were found among levels of pharmaceuticals and toxic units and population density and livestock units in both surface water and sediment matrices.

AB The ultraviolet/chlorine (UV/Cl-2) process is an emerging advanced oxidation technology for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment. However, the application of the conventional UV/Cl-2 process in decentralized systems is limited by the transport and management of liquid chlorine. To overcome this limitation, this study evaluated an electrochemically driven UV/Cl-2 (E-UV/Cl-2) process for micropollutant abatement under conditions simulating decentralized water treatment. The E-UV/Cl-2 process combines UV irradiation with in situ electrochemical Cl-2 production from anodic oxidation of chloride (Cl-) in source waters. The results show that with typical Cl- concentrations present in water sources for decentralized systems (30-300 mg/L Cl-), sufficient amounts of chlorine could be quickly electrochemically produced at the anode to enable E-UV/Cl-2 process for water treatment. Due to its multiple mechanisms for micropollutant abatement (direct photolysis, direct electrolysis, Cl-2-mediated oxidation, as well as hydroxyl radical and reactive chlorine species oxidation), the E-UV/Cl-2 process effectively eliminated all micropollutants (trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, metoprolol, and carbamazepine) spiked in a surface water in 5 min. In contrast, at least one micropollutant with similar to 20 -80% residual concentrations could still be detected in the water treated by 10 min of UV irradiation, chlorination, electrolysis, and the conventional UV/Cl-2 process under similar experimental conditions. The electrical energy per order (E-EO) for micropollutant abatement ranged from 0.15 to 1.8 kWh/m(3) for the E-UV/Cl-2 process, which is generally comparable to that for the conventional UV/Cl-2 process (0.14-2.7 kWh/m(3)). These results suggest that by in-situ generating Cl-2 from anodic oxidation of Cl- , the E-UV/Cl-2 process can overcome the barrier of the conventional UV/Cl-2 process and thus provide a promising technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized water treatment systems.

AB Densely populated countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh, arc considered to be major contributors to the increased occurrence of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Several factors make low-and middle-income countries vulnerable to increased emergence and spread of AMR in the environment including, limited regulations on antimicrobial drug use, high volume of antimicrobials used in human medicine and agricultural production, and poor wastewater management. Previous monitoring campaigns to investigate the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment have employed targeted analysis in which selected antibiotics are measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). However, this approach can miss several important contaminants that can contribute to the selective pressure that promotes maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Nontarget analysis by suspect screening and reanalysis of stored digital data of previously ran samples can provide information on analytes that were formerly uncharacterized and may be chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). In this study, surface waters in both urban and rural sites in Bangladesh were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibiotic residues and other pharmaceuticals. Utilizing targeted analysis, the antibiotics with the highest concentrations detected were ciprofloxacin (1407 ng/L) and clarithromycin (909 ng/L). In addition, using high-resolution LC/MS/MS in the first ever application of retrospective analysis in samples from Bangladesh, additional antibiotics clindamycin, lincomycin, linezolid, metroniclazole, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, and sulfapyridine were detected. Prevalence of amoxicillin transformation products in surface waters was also confirmed. In addition, medicinal and agricultural antifungal compounds were frequently found in Bangladeshi surface waters. This later finding - the near ubiquity of antifungal agents in environmental samples - is of particular concern, as it may be contributing to the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant fungal (e.g. Candida auris) disease recently seen in humans throughout the world.

AB Human presence in the Antarctic is increasing due to research activities and the rise in tourism. These activities contribute a number of potentially hazardous substances. The aim of this study is to conduct the first characterisation of the pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs present in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, and to assess the potential environmental risk they pose to the environment. The study consisted of a single sampling of ten water samples from different sources, including streams, ponds, glacier drains, and a wastewater discharge into the sea. Twenty-five selected pharmaceuticals and 21 recreational drugs were analysed. The highest concentrations were found for the analgesics acetaminophen (48.74 mu g L-1), diclofenac (15.09 mu g L-1) and ibuprofen (10.05 mu g L-1), and for the stimulant caffeine (71.33 mu g L-1). All these substances were detected in waters that were discharged directly into the ocean without any prior purification processes. The hazard quotient (HQ) values for ibuprofen, diclofenac and acetaminophen were far in excess of 10 at several sampling points. The concentrations of each substance measured and used as measured environmental concentration values for the HQ calculations are based on a one-time sampling. The Toxic Unit values indicate that analgesics and anti-inflammatories are the therapeutic group responsible for the highest toxic burden.
   This study is the first to analyse a wide range of substances and to determine the presence of pharmaceuticals and psychotropic drugs in the Antarctic Peninsula region. We believe it can serve as a starting point to focus attention on the need for continued environmental monitoring of these substances in the water cycle, especially in protected regions such as the Antarctic. This will determine whether pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs are hazardous to the environment and, if so, can be used as the basis for risk-assessment studies to prioritise the exposure to risk.

AB Organisms in the environment are exposed to a number of pollutants from different compound groups. In addition to the classic pollutants like the polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols, biocides, etc. other compound groups of concern are constantly emerging. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) can be expected to co-occur with other organic contaminants like biocides, PAHs and alkylphenols in areas affected by wastewater, industrial effluents And intensive recreational activity. In this study, representatives from these four different compound groups were tested individually and in mixtures in a growth inhibition assay with the marine algae Skeletonema pseudocostatum (formerly Skeletonema costatum) to determine whether the combined effects could be predicted by models for additive effects; the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) prediction model. The eleven tested compounds reduced the growth of S. pseudocostatum in the microplate test in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of toxicity of these chemicals were irgarol > fluoxetine > diuron > benzo(a)pyrene > thioguanine > triclosan>propranolol > benzophenone 3 > cetrimonium bromide > 4-tert-octylphenol > endosulfan. Several binary mixtures and a mixture of eight compounds from the four different compound groups were tested. All tested mixtures were additive as model deviation ratios, the deviation between experimental and predicted effect concentrations, were within a factor of 2 from one or both prediction models (e.g. CA and IA). Interestingly, a concentration dependent shift from IA to CA, potentially due to activation of similar toxicity pathways at higher concentrations, was observed for the mixture of eight compounds. The combined effects of the multi-compound mixture were clearly additive and it should therefore be expected that PPCPs, biocides, PAHs and alkylphenols will collectively contribute to the risk in areas contaminated by such complex mixtures.

AB The immunotoxic potential of a primary-treated municipal effluent following enhanced disinfection by ozonation was studied in the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations (0%, 1%, 3%, 10%, and 20% v/v) of the effluent before and after ozone treatment (similar to 10mg/L of purged 03) in a continuous flow-through laboratory for 7 weeks. Immunocompetence was appraised by measuring phagocytosis, cell viability (fluorescein retention), cell adherence to polystyrene microwells, cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and total nitrite levels in peripheral hemocytes from the hemolymphs. The results showed that phagocytosis was significantly inhibited by the primary-treated effluent at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v. Cell viability was also significantly reduced three-fold compared to controls at the same effluent threshold concentration, but hemocyte adherence was unchanged. COX activity was increased 1.3-fold at a threshold concentration of 14% v/v. Total nitrite levels were significantly increased 2.2-fold at a threshold concentration of 5.5% v/v. Ozone treatment of the effluent was not successful in removing phagocytic inhibition, but did completely remove cytotoxicity from hemocytes. Ozonation also reduced cell adherence at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v. The inflammatory properties of the effluent appeared to be accentuated by the ozone, as evidenced by an increase in COX activity, which reached 2.6-fold activity compared to controls, as compared to the 1.3-fold increase witnessed in the primary-treated effluent. Furthermore, total nitrite levels reached a two-fold induction at a threshold concentration of 1.7% v/v in the ozone-enhanced effluent compared to 5.5% v/v in the primary-treated effluent. In conclusion, ozonation of a primary-treated effluent successfully reduced microbial loading and completely removed cytotoxicity, but increased the inflammatory properties of the effluent. Investigations aimed at examining the impacts of sustained inflammation on the host's capacity to remove potentially pathogenic bacteria are recommended.

AB Fe3O4-coated pretreated biochars (Fe3O4@PBC) were prepared for the first time by a Fe(III)-ethanol solution impregnation-calcination method. When photo-Fenton catalysts were used, their effectiveness in removing metronidazole (MNZ) from aqueous media was evaluated. Fe3O4@PBC samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, vibrating sample magnetometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods. The results showed that Fe3O4 coating was successfully formed on the surface of HNO3- pretreated biochar, and Fe3O4@PBC can be separated by applying an external magnetic field. The coating of Fe3O4 did not change the pore structure and maintained a high surface area of the biochar. Fe loading significantly affected the photo-Fenton degradation and adsorption ability of MNZ. The highest MNZ removal rate and the greatest catalytic ability were found in the PBC-6.6Fe sample containing 6.6% Fe by mass. Various operating parameters, such as solution pH, H2O2 concentration, and MNZ concentration, were tested during MNZ's photo-Fenton catalytic degradation. The results indicate that the highest MNZ degradation efficiency can be derived from a moderate acidic solution, and the optimal pH is 3. Using PBC-6.6Fe, the increase of H2O2 concentration from 30 to 60mmol center dot L-1 promotes the degradation of photo-Fenton, and both an excessive H2O2 and an increase in MNZ concentration suppressed the process. Under the conditions of 0.4g center dot L-1 PBC-6.6Fe, 300mg center dot L(-1)MNZ, 60mmol center dot L-1H2O2, and initial pH of 3, 95.1% of MNZ was degraded. The PBC-6.6Fe had good stability, and its removal efficiency was still over 92% after five repeated uses. This study confirmed that center dot OH played a dominant role, while O-2(center dot-) and h(+) played a weaker role in the photo-Fenton system. The results indicated that Fe3O4@PBC served as a prospective visible-light-driven catalyst similar to Fenton for the treatment of wastewater containing MNZ.

AB Cyclophosphamide (CP) and Ifosfamide (IF) are two nitrogen mustard drugs widely prescribed in cancer therapy. They are continuously released via excreta into hospital and urban wastewaters reaching wastewater treatment plants. Although CP and IF, their metabolites and transformation products (TPs) residues have been found in the aquatic environment from few ng L-1 to tens of mu g L-1, their environmental toxic effects are still not well known. The present study aimed to investigate the acute and chronic ecotoxicity of CP and IF and their commercially available human metabolites/TPs, i.e. carboxy-CP, Keto-CP and N-dechloroethyl-CP on different organisms of the aquatic trophic chain. The experiments were performed using the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the crustaceans Thamnocephalus platyurus and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Moreover, to assess the treatment conditions in regards to parent compound removal and formation of new TPs, CP and IF were UV-irradiated for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h, followed by toxicity evaluation of treated samples by algae, rotifers and crustaceans. Between the parent compounds, IF resulted as more toxic drug under tested conditions, exerting both acute and chronic effects especially on C. dubia (LC50:196.4 mg L-1, EC50:15.84 mg L-1). Among the tested metabolites/TPs, only carboxy-CP inhibited the reproduction in the rotifer. However, LOEC and NOEC values were calculated for CP and IF for all organisms. In addition, despite a low degradation of CP (28%) and IF (36%) after 48 h UV-irradiation, statistically significant effect differences (p < 0.05) from not-irradiated and irradiated samples were observed in both acute and chronic assays, starting from 6 h UV-irradiation. Our results suggest that the toxic effects found in the aquatic organisms may be attributable to interactions between the parent compounds and their metabolites/TPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In countries like Spain, where water is a limited resource, reusing effluents from wastewater treatment plants may imply the introduction of incompletely eliminated pollutants into the environment. Therefore, this work identified the role of sorption and biodegradation in attenuating pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, caffeine, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole) in natural soil. It also determined which sorption and removal ("sorption + biodegradation") kinetics models describe the behaviour of these substances in the water-soil system. Presence of potential transformation products (TPs) as a result of pharmaceuticals biodegradation was also studied. To this end, serial batch-type experiments were performed with a soil: water ratio of 1:4 and an initial pharmaceutical concentration of 100 mu g L-1. Despite results are dependent on soil characteristics, they revealed that, for those substances with a higher affinity to the soil used (loamy sand), sorption seems to play a key role during the first 48 h of contactwith soil, and gives way to biodegradation afterwards. The sorption of the pharmaceuticals studied follows a pseudo second-order kinetics. Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole displayed the fastest initial sorption velocities (h = 2055 and h = 228 mu g kg(-1) h(-1), respectively). The removal kinetics experiments, satisfactorily simulated by the first-order kinetics model, indicated the presence of potential microbial adaptation to degradation. Indeed, half-lives decreased from 1.6- to 11.7-fold with respect to initial values. The microbial capacity to degrade sulfamethoxazole could be a matter of concern if bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic. Caffeine, acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole were mitigated to a greater extent, whereas the removal of naproxen and carbamazepine was more limited. The appearance of epoxy-carbamazepine and N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole as possible TPs of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, indicated that biodegradation was incomplete and showed the capacity of soil microbes to transform these substances.

AB The occurrence of sixty pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), twenty metabolites and eight personal care products (PCPs) in the aquatic environment in Spain and their predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated and compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) obtained from relevant published research. The occurrence in the aquatic environment was calculated through a mass balance approach considering the following: the number of pharmaceutical prescriptions issued, the amount of pharmaceutical discharged without consumption, consumption, self-medication, pharmacokinetics, treatment in wastewater facilities and discharged to aquatic environment. The estimation of consumption of active compounds of pharmaceuticals was conducted by at least one of the following methodologies: number of commercial packages sold, data for the number of defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD), and pattern of treatment Comparison of these methodologies for some compounds showed similar estimated consumption ranges. The highest pharmaceutical occurrence in the aquatic environment was for acetaminophen glucuronide, Galaxolide (R), Iso-E-super (R), acetaminophen, valsartan, amoxicillin, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, iopromide, omeprazole, carbamazepine 10, 11-epoxide, iopamidol, salicylic beta-D-O-glucuronide acid, Tonalide (R), acetylsalicylic add (ASA), clarithromycin and iohexol, with releases between 5 and 600 t y(-1). The relation of PEC/MEC was calculated for 58% of the compounds under study, and 64.7% of them had PEC/MEC ratios between 05 and 2. PEC values were mostly overestimated (57.4%). The predicted concentrations for pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) that had a high occurrence in the aquatic environment were very close to the measured concentrations. This research provides information that had not been calculated and analyzed previously, at least for Spain. Estimation of the PECs for pharmaceutical, personal care products and metabolites is a useful tool for identifying compounds that should be considered for environmental concern, and such estimations could be used to improve environmental risk assessment studies.

AB Little is known about the environmental fate or impact of pesticides used to control companion animal parasites. Using data from the Environment Agency, we examined the occurrence of fipronil, fipronil metabolites and imidacloprid in 20 English rivers from 2016 to 2018, as indicators of the potential contamination of waterways from their use as ectoparasiticides on pets. Water samples were collected by the Environment Agency as part of their chemical surveillance programme and analysed using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry / Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF- MS) methods. A total of 3861 chemical analyses were examined, and the significance and potential sources of this contaminationwere assessed. Fipronil, fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide (collectively known as fiproles) and imidacloprid were detected in 98.6%, 96.5%, 68.7% and 65.9% of samples, respectively. Across the river sites sampled, the mean concentrations of fipronil (17 ng/l, range <0.3-980 ng/l), and fipronil sulfone (6.5 ng/l, range <0.2-39 ng/l) were 5.3 and 38.1 times their chronic toxicity limits of 3.2 and 0.17 ng/l, respectively. Imidacloprid had a mean concentration of 31.7 ng/l (range <1-360 ng/l), which was below its chronic toxicity limit of 35 ng/l, however seven out of 20 sites exceeded that limit. Chronic risk quotients indicate a high environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems from fiproles, and a moderate risk fromimidacloprid. Sites immediately downstreamofwastewater treatmentworks had the highest levels of fipronil and imidacloprid, supporting the hypothesis that potentially significant quantities of pesticides from veterinary flea products may be entering waterways via household drains. These findings suggest the need for a reevaluation of the environmental risks associated with the use of companion animal parasiticide products, and the risk assessments that these products undergo prior to regulatory approval.

AB Concentrations of widely used antibiotics were predicted to be the highest in the Haihe River Catchment across China previously, potentially resulting in high ecotoxicological risks in this region. As a result of growing usage and regulation of antibiotic use in animals, the pattern of use may have altered temporally for different antibiotics. It is important to monitor the occurrence of antibiotics within different categories for understanding their mass loading to the catchment and the potential ecotoxicological risks involved. This study investigated the seasonal occurrence and spatial variation of 15 antibiotics in the Haihe River Catchment during 2016-2017. The investigated compounds included veterinary antibiotics, human-use antibiotics, and those intended for both human and animal use. Measurements reported from previous studies were compared with the results of this study and indicated that the use of veterinary antibiotics is probably increasing around the catchment. The antibiotics concentration (i.e. the summed concentration of the 15 target antibiotics) ranged from 414 to 1951 ng/L, with an average of 821 ng/L. Discharges from wastewater treatment plants were the main sources of these compounds. The mass loading of antibiotics to the river waters was higher during we seasons than during dry seasons. The mass fluxes of the antibiotics continuously increased towards the lower reaches of the rivers. The total annual input of the antibiotics from the Haihe River and Yongdingxin River into the Bohai Bay was 5008 kg/yr. Ofloxacin, trimethoprim, leucomycin, anhydro erythromycin and florfenicol were the predominant antibiotics, whilst amoxicillin, anhydro erythromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and enrofloxacin may pose high ecotoxicological risks to the investigated aquatic ecosystem. Several antibiotics selected in this study were reported for the first time in this catchment. This study provides important information for chemical management and indicates that further monitoring is needed on the more harmful and veterinary antibiotics in the catchment.

AB Chemical contaminants can be introduced into estuarine and marine ecosystems from a variety of sources including wastewater, agriculture and forestry practices, point and non-point discharges, runoff from industrial, municipal, and urban lands, accidental spills, and atmospheric deposition. The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time.

AB Aerobic treatment of wastewater under thermophilic conditions has received growing interest in recent years. Because of the high discharge temperature (75 to 85 degrees C) of palm oil mill effluent (POME), it would be more economical if POME were treated thermophilically, as then cooling facilities prior to biological treatment can be eliminated. In the present investigation, the feasibility of thermophilic aerobic biological treatment as a suitable post-treatment system for anaerobically treated POME was examined. Also, the effects of temperature on the treated effluent quality were investigated by using sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) under mesophilic (28 degrees C) and thermophilic (45, 50, and 55 degrees C) conditions. The average total COD (TCOD) removal efficiencies varied from 55 to 98% at organic loading rates (OLR) of 2.6 to 4.5 kg COD/m(3)center dot day, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 2.9-4.5 mg/L, and mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations of 22500-24200 mg/L. The results show that the thermophilic aerobic treatment was capable of achieving promising treatment efficiencies in terms of TCOD and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removals, which exceeded 72% and 76%, respectively, at an OLR of 2.8 0.3 kg COD/m(3)center dot day. The thermophilic sludge also showed good settling characteristics, as reflected by the low sludge volume index (SW) values (<100). Nevertheless, aerobic treatment at mesophilic conditions produced better results as compared to the treatment at thermophilic conditions. The highest effluent quality was obtained under mesophilic conditions (28 degrees C), while the SBR operated at 55 degrees C produced the poorest effluent quality. The effluents treated under the thermophilic conditions were more turbid with the presence of higher total suspended solids (TSS), due to a lower capability to effectively retain the influent particles by the sludge. In the practice of minimum capital and operating costs, the encouraging results from this study propose that the thermophilic aerobic system can be integrated with a thermophilic anaerobic system for the treatment of POME.

AB Drug residues in water represent one of the most serious environmental problems because of their high toxicity to the biological system. Thus, this study reports a low-cost strategy for fast and precise analysis of beta- blocker timolol maleate (TM) using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DP ASV) at a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE). At the optimised solution pH 7.2 and other analytical parameters (accumulation time, deposition potential, scan rate, and pulse amplitude), a well-defined oxidation peak was observed at 0.85 V vs Ag/AgCl electrode. The linear calibration range for TM at 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode was found to be 5.0 x 10(-7) - 1.3 x 10(-4) mol L-1 (0.21-56.2 mu g mL(-1)) (R-2 = 0.9947) with lower limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of 2.7 x 10(-7) (0.12) and 8.99 x 10(-7) mol L-1 (0.39 mu g mL(-1)), respectively. The developed assay was satisfactorily applied for trace determination of TM residues in biological fluids (urine), environmental water samples and eye drop with good recoveries (90.5 +/- 0.66-106 +/- 0.66%), demonstrating good accuracy and applicability of the proposed method as an effective and reliable electrochemical sensor for analysis of TM in complex matrices. Common organic and inorganic compounds did not interfere with TM in its determination. The established strategy was validated using the official HPLC method. Analysis results obtained by the present method were comparable to those obtained using the official method; indicating that the proposed method could be used as an alternative method for the routine quality control of the drug in complex matrices. Chromatographic methods are still more precise, while electrochemical sensors are promising for the analyte determination as they have reduced analytical time, low cost and reproducible. The proposed sensor also demonstrated excellent precision, selectivity, and reproducibility for TM determination.

AB As salicylic acid is one of widely used pharmaceuticals, its residue has been found in various environmental water systems e.g. wastewater, surface water, treated water and drinking water. It has been reported that salicylic acid can be efficiently removed by advanced oxidation processes, but there are few studies on its transformation products and ozonation mechanisms during ozonation process. The objective of this study is to characterize the transformation products, investigate the degradation mechanisms at different pH, and propose the ozonation pathways of salicylic acid. The results showed that the rate of degradation was about 10 times higher at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition in the first 1 min when 1 mg L-1 of ozone solution was added into 1 mg L-1 of salicylic acid solution. It was proposed that ozone direct oxidation mechanism dominates at acidic condition, while indirect center dot OH radical mechanism dominates at alkaline condition. A two stages pseudo-first order reaction was proposed at different pH conditions. Various hydroxylation products, carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids, such as 2,5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxylbenzoic acid, catechol, formaldehyde, glyoxal, acetaldehyde, maleic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid etc. were identified as ozonation transformation products. In addition, acrylic acid was identified, for the first time, as ozonation transformation products through high resolution liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometer. The information demonstrated in this study will help us to better understand the possible effects of ozonation products on the water quality. The degradation pathways of salicylic acid by ozonation in water sample were proposed. As both 03 and center dot OH radical were important in the reactions, the degradation pathways of salicylic acid by ozonation in water sample were proposed at acidic and basic conditions. To our knowledge, there was no integrated study reported on the ozonation of salicylic acid in water, in terms of transformation products, kinetic, mechanism, as well as degradation pathways.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (PPCPs) in aquatic environments is of concern. Although measured concentrations of individual substances are low, little consideration has been given to the likely chronic nature of the exposures or to the potential for mixture effects. The purpose of the present study was to use the RTG-2 rainbow trout cell line to analyse sub-lethal and cytotoxic effects of PPCPs present in a wastewater-treatment-plant (WWTP) effluents and their mixtures. Interactions with cytochrome P450 1A enzyme, oxidative stress, cellular senescence and cell viability were assessed using 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), ss-galactosidase (ss-gal) and neutral red (NR) uptake assays, respectively. Not all of the compounds that were tested exhibited significant effects. The lowest-observed-effect concentrations and half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were within the range 0.15 to 784.47 mu g l(-1). Clear dose-response curves were found for cells exposed to different mixtures of PPCPs. The lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing EC50 were within the range 0.05 to 54.61 mu g l(-1). Four out the seven tested mixtures induced EROD activity. ROS production was detected in two mixtures. The ss-gal inhibition response was observed in six out the seven tested mixtures and occurred at a higher concentration than was observed for EROD induction activity or ROS generation. The present study clearly shows that the stress response through which cells mount a homeostatic response to toxicants can be potentially used for an initial, rapid and cost-effective assessment of the complex mixtures of PPCP that present in WWTP effluents are difficult and expensive to analyse chemically.

AB The presence of iodinated X-ray contrast media compounds (ICM) in surface and ground waters has been reported. This is likely due to their biological inertness and incomplete removal in wastewater treatment processes. The present study reports partial degradation mechanisms based on elucidating the structures of major reaction by-products using gamma-irradiation and LC-MS. Studies conducted at concentrations higher than observed in natural waters is necessary to elucidate the reaction by-product structures and to develop destruction mechanisms. To support these mechanistic studies, the bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot and e(aq)(-) with one ionic ICM (diatrizoate), four non-ionic ICM (iohexol, iopromide, iopamidol, and iomeprol), and the several analogues of diatrizoate were determined. The absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants for diatrizoate, iohexol, iopromide, iopamidol, and iomeprol with (OH)-O-center dot were (9.58 +/- 0.23)x10(8), (3.20 +/- 0.13)x10(9), (3.34 +/- 0.14)x10(9), (3.42 +/- 0.28)x10(9), and (2.03 +/- 0.13)x10(9) M-1 s(-1), and with e(aq)(-) were (2.13 +/- 0.03)x10(10), (3.35 +/- 0.03)x10(10), (3.25 +/- 0.05)x10(10), (3.37 +/- 0.05)x10(10), and (3.47 +/- 0.02) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Transient spectra for the intermediates formed by the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot were also measured over the time period of 1-100 mu s to better understand the stability of the radicals and for evaluation of reaction rate constants. Degradation efficiencies for the (OH)-O-center dot and e(aq)(-) reactions with the five ICM were determined using steady-state gamma-radiolysis. Collectively, these data will form the basis of kinetic models for application of advanced oxidation/reduction processes for treating water containing these compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in soils resulting from application of municipal wastewater or biosolids may migrate through soils intact or be transformed and reach groundwater. In the present study, the leaching potential of four NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium) in three U.S. cropland soils was evaluated, and the effect of CaCl2 solution (as an index of salinity), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and polyacrylamide (PAM) amendment was investigated. The soils were spiked with selected NSAIDs, incubated for 24h followed by 7-d storage in glass flasks, and then packed into stainless steel columns and leached with deionized water (DIW), 10 mM CaCl2, DOM (DOC 34 mg/L), and PAM solution (1.0 mg/L) by gravity. Initial concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen; ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium in the three packed soils were 1.93 to 2.07. 1.74 to 2.27, 1.79 to 2.16, and 1.99 to 2.13 mg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations of the above NSAIDs in column effluents were 1.23, 0.92, 0.69, and 1.12 mg/L. respectively, when the soil was leached with 10 pore volumes of water, which occupied 17.4, 11.1, 9.6, and 15.2% of the total chemicals in each soil column. Dissolved organic matter or PAM solution did not facilitate the NSAIDs release from soils. The CaCl2 solution, however, reduced the amounts of NSAIDs leached from all three soils. Leaching of NSAIDs differed among the three tested soils. The results suggest that the leaching of NSAIDs through soil to water is significant, and the mobility of NSAIDs in soil is related to their chemicals' characteristics (such as pK(a) values) and soil properties (such as soil organic matter and clay content). Amending soil with DOM or PAM does not significantly affect the leaching behavior of NSAIDs in soil, whereas increasing the salinity of the irrigation water may decrease the extent of contamination of groundwater posed by NSAIDs.

AB Parabens are common antimicrobial agents found in thousands of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Parabens are introduced into aquatic ecosystems from wastewater treatment plant effluents and have been detected in surface waters in the low microgram per liter range. Although these compounds display low toxicity in mammals, paraben toxicity to aquatic organisms has not been investigated. Standardized acute and subchronic endpoints in larval fish (Pimephales promelas) and cladoceran (Daphnia magna) models were examined for seven different parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, propyl-, isobutyl-, butyl-, benzylparaben), which encompassed a range of log P values. Paraben 48 h median lethal concentration values (LC50) ranged from 4.0 to 24.6 mg/L in D. magna and 3.3 to > 160.0 mg/L in fathead minnow. Growth and reproduction in D. magna had lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOECs) ranging from 0.12 to 9.0 mg/L and 1.5 to 6.0 mg/L, respectively. Fathead minnow growth was adversely affected at levels ranging from 1.0 to 25.0 mg/L. Aquatic toxicity of the parabens was inversely related to lipophilicity, suggesting that responses using standardized endpoints resulted from narcosis. Utilizing toxicity benchmark concentrations (e.g., LC50s, LOECs) for each compound, chemical toxicity distributions, a probabilistic hazard assessment technique, were developed to assess the probabilities of detecting parabens that elicit a response at or below a given concentration. For the responses assessed in the present study, the 5th centile values (the concentration at which 5% of parabens elicit a response) ranged from 15 mu g/L to 2.43 mg/L, with D. magna growth eliciting the lowest 5th centile value and acute D. magna mortality eliciting the highest. The distributions demonstrated that at environmentally relevant concentrations in developed countries there is limited acute or subchronic aquatic hazard of parabens to the organisms and responses examined.

AB The treatment of pharmaceutical industrial wastewaters, containing the antibiotic amoxicillin (218.29 mg L<SUP>-1</SUP>), via some advanced oxidation processes (POA), was studied. The H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF>photolysis process presented the highest percentage of mineralization (97%), after the total reaction time (180 min). However, the photo-Fenton process showed the highest organic carbon removal rate, mineralizing 65% of the initial concentration, in 30 min. Because of this fact, this process was studied in more detail. The initial concentration of ferrous ions (0.03-1.00 mmol L<SUP>-1</SUP>) did not affect the performance of the photo-Fenton process, possibly operating using concentrations of below 15 mg L<SUP>-1</SUP>(0.27 mmol L<SUP>-1</SUP>), that is the iron content limit for discharging wastewaters established in the Brazilian environmental legislation. Furthermore, experiments were performed according to the composite experimental design technique (Doehlert matrix), analyzing the following variables: (i) the inlet molar flow rate of H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF>(F<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF>) and (ii) the initial concentration of ferrous ions ([Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>]). Besides that, the initial mineralization rate and the total organic carbon removal percentages, measured at 5, 10, 15 and 30 min of reaction, were chosen as the response variables. It was observed that F<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF>was the most important variable in relation to the initial degradation rate. In the optimal conditions (F<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF> = 3.27 mmol min<SUP>-1</SUP>and [Fe<SUP>2</SUP><SUP>+</SUP>] = 0.27 mmol L<SUP>-1</SUP>), the photo-Fenton process achieved a percentage of organic carbon removal of 84%, in only 30 min of reaction, presenting an interesting potential for real industrial applications, combined, or not, with conventional technologies (as biological treatments, for example).

AB The impacts to microbial function, overall performance and eventual fate were assessed for triclosan (TCL) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in intensified (re-circulating) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) constructed wetlands (CWs). The potential toxicity of each pharmaceutical to the intrinsic microbial communities was first assessed over a wide exposure range (0-1000 mu g/l) via an ex-situ dose-response assay to estimate the concentration at which adverse effects were likely to occur. Based on these results an acute (7 day) in-situ exposures (500 mu g/l) were then performed and impacts to the mesocosm systems monitored for 1 month via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) alongside chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates and a range of water quality, and hydrological parameters. Despite the clear potential for negative impacts to microbial function from both compounds observed at 100 mu g/l in the ex-situ dose-response test, no impacts were observed for the 500 mu g/l in-situ exposure in the VSSF mesocosms. COD removal, water chemistry, plant health, and hydrological parameters did not significantly change in response to the in-situ exposure. In terms of fate, the removal efficiency for both TCL and SMX was high (>80%) after 1 h and complete removal (>99.7%) was observed after 168 h. Following the in-situ exposure, and subsequent one month effects-monitoring period, the mesocosms were decommissioned with the media biofilm spatially assessed for organic content as well as TCL and SMX concentrations. TCL and SMX were found to have persisted in the media and demonstrated spatial variation with an overall 2-20% and 5-6% recovered respectively. This suggests that biofilm bound TCL and SMX were biologically degraded in VSSF CWs, however may also accumulate in the biofilm if TCL and SMX are maintained in the influent. These results reinforce the robustness and potential of constructed wetlands for the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Pithampur Industrial sectors I, II, and III, located approximately, 45 km from Indore in Central India have emerged as one of the largest industrial clusters in the region. Various types of industries ranging from automobiles to chemicals and pharmaceuticals have been set up in the region since 1990. Most of the industries have effluent treatment plants (ETP) for treating wastewater before its disposal on land and/or in water body. The present study is an attempt to assess the groundwater quality in the watersheds surrounding these industrial sectors to develop the baseline groundwater quality in order to enable the policy makers to facilitate decisions on the development of industries in this region. The industries are located in two sub-watersheds, namely, Gambhir river sub-watershed and Chambal river sub-watershed. Geologically, the study area is located in the Deccan traps of Cretaceous to Paleocene age. The different basaltic flow units underlie clayey soils varying in thickness from 2-3 m. The aquifer is mostly of unconfined nature. Samples have been collected from a network of observation wells set up in the watersheds. The water quality analysis of the groundwater samples has been carried out six times during three hydrological cycles of 2004, 2005, and 2006. The results indicate that a few observation wells in the vicinity of the industrial clusters have very high TDS concentration and exceed the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) guideline for TDS concentration. The contamination of groundwater has been more severe in the Gambhir watershed as compared to the Chambal watershed. The presence of the impermeable clay layers has resulted in a slow migration of contaminants from the sources. The findings reveal that there is no significant groundwater contamination in the Pithampur industrial sectors except in the vicinity of the industrial clusters, which indicates that there is good environmental space available for the expansion of industrial units in the Pithampur industrial hub.

AB Previous studies in extracts of sediments surrounding municipal outfalls off the coast of California, USA and effluents of New York City, NY, USA indicated the UV-filtering agent, oxybenzone (CAS# 131-57-7; benzophenone-3) as a potential estrogen. The effects of oxybenzone on estrogenic activity and reproduction were evaluated using a 14-day juvenile rainbow trout assay for plasma vitellogenin and a subsequent 21-day Japanese medaka reproduction assay. Significant induction of vitellogenin was observed in the rainbow trout at the 1000 mu g/L nominal concentration (749 mu g/L median measured value) of oxybenzone which was approximately 75 times greater than the concentrations observed in previous wastewater effluent. Vitellogenin induction was also observed in the 1000 mu g/L nominal concentration (620 mu g/L median measured) of oxybenzone in male Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) after 21 days of exposure. The number of eggs produced per female per day exposed to the same concentration (620 mu g/L) were significantly lower after 7 days, but returned to control values after 21 days. Fertilized eggs were then monitored for 20 days to assess hatching success. The overall percentage of fertilized eggs collected during the 21-day exposure that hatched was significantly lower in the 620 mu g/L oxybenzone concentration. There was also a temporal effect at this concentration as egg viability (percentage of fertilized eggs that hatched) was diminished 13-15 days after eggs were collected. All three oxybenzone concentrations (16, 132, and 620 mu g/L) and the 50 ng/L estradiol positive control showed reduced hatching of eggs at day 15, and the 132 and 620 mu g/L oxybenzone concentrations diminished the percentage of eggs that hatched on days 13-15. These data indicate that the UV-filter oxybenzone alters endocrine or reproduction endpoints in two fish species, but at concentrations significantly higher than those measured in the environment.

AB In this study, the efficiency of three different hybrid systems coupling ultrafiltration (UF) with (i) UVC/H2O2, (ii) UVC/TiO2, and (iii) UVC was evaluated for the treatment of a secondary effluent (SE) from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a surface water (SW) from Miedwie Lake, both spiked with 5 mg L-1 of oxytetracycline (OTC). A ceramic membrane made of TiO2 was tested. The effect of H2O2 concentration (30 to 120 mg L-1) on the UVC/H2O2-UF system and of P25-TiO2 loading (0.5 to 1.5 g L-1) in suspension on the photocatalytic UVC/TiO2-UF system were investigated. A photonic flux of 5.1 J s(-1) was provided in all systems. The maximum pure water flux (PWF) was 111 L m(-2) h(-1). Adsorption on the photocatalyst particles and/or on the membrane surface was found to be an important contribution for the removal of OTC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The UF membrane contributed significantly to photocatalyst and pollutants rejection in the photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) with the UVC/TiO2 system; whereas when using the UVC/H2O2 process, with the highest H2O2 dose, the membrane effect was negligible. Using SE as reaction matrix in the UVC/ TiO2-UF system with 1.0 g L-1 of TiO2, the complete OTC removal was achieved in 5 h with a mineralization of 49%. For the same reaction period, a DOC removal of 52% was achieved with the UVC/H2O2-UF system (120 mg H2O2 L-1). A similar permeate flux decrease (ca. 40%) was observed in both cases. Furthermore, the highest reduction of permeate flux (60%) was observed when using the UVC-UF system. Using SW as reaction matrix, higher OTC degradation rates and percentage of mineralization were reached for the same reaction period, when compared with SE, due to the lower COD and inorganic salts concentration present in the surface water.

AB A multi-residue screening method for simultaneous measurement of a wide range of micropollutants in drinking water (DW) resources was developed. The method was applied in a field study in central Sweden on water from source to tap, including samples of surface water (upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, WVVTP), intake water before and after a DW treatment plant (DWTP, pilot and full-scale), treated DW leaving the plant and tap water at end users. Low detection limits (low ng L-1 levels) were achieved by using large sample volumes (5 L) combined with ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). In total, 134 different micropollutants were analyzed, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), drug-related compounds, food additives, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Of these 134 micropollutants, 41 were detected in at least one sample, with individual concentrations ranging from sub ng L-1 levels to similar to 80 ng L-1. Two solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis HLB and Bond-Elut ENV) were shown to be complementary in the field study, with three compounds detected exclusively using HLB. The total concentration in treated drinking water (56-57 ng L-1) was at a similar level as upstream from the VVWTP (79-90 ng L-1). The composition of micropollutants changed along the water path, to a higher fraction of food additives and PFASs. Median treatment efficiency in the full-scale DWTP was close to 0%, but with high variability for individual compounds. In contrast, median treatment efficiency in the pilot-scale DVVTP was similar to 90% when using nanofiltration followed by a freshly installed granulated active carbon (GAC) filter.

AB The occurrence of 33 pharmaceuticals and metabolites was evaluated along the Lis river and in the influents and effluents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located along the river. Results indicate that pharmaceuticals, such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and fluoxetine, and the metabolite salicylic acid are widespread along the Lis river, showing 100% of detection frequency, at levels up to 1.3 mu g L-1. The number of molecules detected increased along the river, with 11 molecules in the source, 15 upstream WWTP 1, 16 downstream WWTP 1 and upstream WWTP 2 and 19 downstream WWTP2. The highest concentrations were often found downstream near the river mouth. Different possible sources of contamination of the Lis river were identified, namely WWTP effluents, untreated wastewaters and livestock production. Nevertheless, the discharge of WWTP effluents appeared to be the most pronounced, given that, in general, it was noticed an increase in the concentration of pharmaceuticals downstream of the WWTPs. WWTP effluents contributed with a total mass load of pharmaceuticals into the Lis river between-470 and 2317 mg/d/1000 inhabitants. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/analgesics were the therapeutic group with a high contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals entering the Lis river, followed by psychiatric drugs and antibiotics. No seasonal variation was observed for the detected concentrations of pharmaceuticals. At the levels detected in the Lis river, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ibuprofen showed to have potential risk for aquatic organisms. These findings show that further studies embracing different environmental compartments (water, sediment and biota) are needed, in order to evaluate the partition/distribution of pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and transformation products in the environment as well as to predict their possible impact to non-target organisms and, in a last instance, to human health.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are two common antimicrobial agents found in many personal care products and subsequently are detected ubiquitously in wastewater effluent and receiving waters. Both compounds are of recent regulatory interest due to their omnipresence in the environment, including in humans. Although TCS and TCC have been suggested to be endocrine active, little information exists about their effects on organismal end points in development (growth, escape performance), anatomy (morphological indices, histology), physiology (vitellogenin), and behavior of exposed aquatic organisms. In this study, newly hatched fathead minnows were exposed for 12 days, and mature male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 21 days to environmentally realistic concentrations (nanograms per liter) of these two compounds singularly and in mixtures. At the end of the exposure, larvae were assessed for growth and predator-avoidance performance, and a subset of mature fish was assessed for plasma vitellogenin induction, expression of secondary sexual characteristics, relative size of liver and gonads, and histopathological changes to both organs. The remaining exposed mature fish were placed in breeding pairs of one male and one female minnow from the same treatment to assess their ability to defend a nest site and reproduce. Exposure to either antimicrobial compound, alone or as a mixture, caused no changes to larval fish, gonad size, or vitellogenin concentrations in mature fathead minnows. In contrast, decreased aggression was seen in adult male fathead minnows exposed to TCC (1.6 mu g/l) or a mixture (560 ng/l TCS + 179 ng/l TCC and 1.6 mu g/l TCS + 450 ng/l TCC). Decreased aggression would likely decrease their ability to defend and hold a nest site needed for spawning and reproduction. Substantial variability was found in the severity of observed effects within treatments, suggesting that environmentally realistic concentrations of these compounds may only affect particularly sensitive individuals.

AB The advanced treatment of polluted liquid streams containing traces of pharmaceutical compounds is a major issue, since more and more effluents from pharma labs and wastewaters containing the excretions of medically treated humans and animals are discharged in the conventional wastewater treatment plants without previous effective treatments. Ibuprofen is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which explains why it is found in wastewaters so often. In this paper, the removal of IBP from simulated water streams was investigated by using a lab-scale experimental device, consisting of a batch reactor equipped with a lamp emitting monochromatic UV light at a fixed wavelength (254 nm) and various intensities. Three sets of experiments were carried out: the first to study IBP concentration as a function of time, at different volumes of treated solutions (V = 10-30 mL); the second to explore the effect of pH on IBP degradation as a function of time (pH = 2.25-8.25) and the third to evaluate the effect of different UV light intensities on IBP degradation (E = 100-400 mJ m(-2)). The IBP initial concentration (IBP (0)) was varied in the range 30-60 mg L-1. The results obtained show that the concentration of IBP decreases along with treatment time, with a negative effect of the treated volume, i.e. smaller volumes, such as lower liquid heights, are more easily degraded. Moreover, the higher the pH, the better the IBP degradation; actually, when pH increases from 2.25 to 6.6 and 8.25, the IBP concentration, after an hour of treatment, decreases respectively to 45, 34 and 27 % of its initial value. In addition, as the intensity of light increases from 100 to 400 mJ m(-2), the IBP concentration decreases to 34 % of its initial value. A reaction scheme is put forward in the paper, which well describes the effects of volume, pH and light intensity on the IBP degradation measured experimentally. Moreover, the IBP degradation by-products have been identified.

AB This work focuses on the application of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) to purify phenolic effluents, which when combined with innovation and effectiveness contribute towards the preservation of natural resources and environmental quality. Phenols are typical pollutants found in wastewaters from different industries such as petrochemical, pharmaceutical, resin manufacturing, olive-oil, pesticides, dyeing production or cosmetic industry. Nevertheless due to their toxicity and harmfulness, they cannot be poured to water systems. Phenol has been chosen as a model compound in this study because it is usually a component of industrial wastewaters. Furthermore phenol-like compounds are generated by intermediate compounds in the oxidation pathway of higher molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons.
   Phenol can be effectively removed but this does not imply that the all toxicity levels of the effluent have been diminished, since the oxidation pathway passes through more toxic products. Before each AOP application, the reaction intermediates must be identified in order to determine the influence they have on operating conditions, and subsequently establish the criteria for the complete destruction of toxic compounds. These studies will assist in the cost-effective operation of industrial setups, and also in the design of integrated processes for wastewater treatment.
   The main objectives of this work are, first to identify and measure toxic intermediates and, second, to develop a kinetic model for phenol degradation based on a mechanism in series. Chemical pathways in the phenol oxidation consider its hydroxylation to catechol, hydroquinone and resorcinol. These dihydroxylated rings are later oxidised to quinone-like compounds. These quinone-like compounds break into short-chain acids, like acetic, formic and oxalic acids. In order to propose a reaction pathway several runs were carried out at room temperature controlling the operational pH throughout the reaction. Experiments were carried out under different operating conditions, and the decay curves of phenol and aromatic intermediates were monitored, using doses of oxidant and catalyst until R=40 mol oxidant/mol phenol and [Fe(II)]=20 mg/L. Kinetic parameters were rightly fitted to the kinetic model, predicting successfully the reaction rates of each toxic compounds.

AB While over seven million organic and inorganic compounds that have been indexed by the American Chemical Society's Chemical Abstracts Service in their CAS Registry are commercially available, most pollution monitoring programs focus only on those chemical stressors, for which regulatory benchmarks exist, and have been traditionally considered responsible for the most significant human and environmental health risks. Until the late 1990s, the San Francisco Estuary Regional Monitoring Program was no exception in that regard. After a thorough external review, the monitoring program responded to the need for developing a pro-active surveillance approach for emerging pollutants in recognition of the fact that the potential for the growing list of widely used chemical compounds to alter the integrity of water is high. We describe (1) the scientific and analytical bases underlying a new surveillance monitoring approach; (2) summarize approaches used and results obtained from a forensic retrospective; (3) present the growing data set on emerging pollutants from surveillance monitoring and related efforts in the San Francisco Bay Area to characterize newly targeted compounds in wastewater streams, sediment, storm water runoff, and biota; and (4) suggest next steps in monitoring program development and applied research that could move beyond traditional approaches of pollutant characterization. Based on the forensic analysis of archived chromatograms and chemical and toxicological properties of candidate compounds, we quantified a variety of synthetic organic compounds which had previously not been targeted for analysis. Flame retardant compounds, pesticides and insecticide synergists, insect repellents, pharmaceuticals, personal care product ingredients, plasticizers, non-ionic surfactants, and other manufacturing ingredients were detected in water, sediment, and/or biological tissue samples. Several of these compounds, especially polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants, exhibited concentrations of environmental concern. We also describe environmental management challenges associated with emerging pollutants and how pro-active surveillance monitoring might assist in implementing a more holistic approach to pollution prevention and control before, emerging pollutants become a burden on future generations.

AB Human and veterinarian pharmaceuticals have been detected in the aquatic environment for a number of years, but the potential for biological effects in exposed aquatic organism is only now being reported. The lipid regulator, gemfibrozil (GEM) is detected at mu g/L concentrations in domestic wastewater and ng/L concentrations in surface waters. We investigated the uptake of GEM in goldfish (Carassius auratus) over a 96 h time period by measuring GEM in blood plasma using LC-MS/MS. Results indicated that GEM can be taken up from water through the gills. In goldfish exposed to GEM by a single intraperitoneal injection, concentrations of GEM in the blood plasma declined rapidly over 96 It post-injection, with a half-life estimated at approximately 19 h.
   Exposure of goldfish to waterborne GEM at an environmentally relevant concentration over 14 days resulted in a plasma bioconcentration factor of 113. In goldfish exposed to aqueous concentrations of GEM for 96 It or 14 days, plasma testosterone (T) was reduced by over 50% in fish from all treatments. As a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed reduction in T, levels of steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein transcript in goldfish testes were assessed by RT-PCR. StAR protein is involved in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane for transformation by the first enzyme in steroidogenesis. After exposure to GEM for 96 h, a 50% decrease in StAR mRNA levels was observed in goldfish. Gonadal StAR mRNA levels were not affected in the 14 days exposure, indicating that the observed decreases in plasma testosterone were not solely due to impaired delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results demonstrate that exposure to environmental levels of GEM leads to bioconcentration of the drug in plasma and the potential for endocrine disruption in fish. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aerobic biodegradation of 5-methyl-benzotriazole (5-TTri) was optimized using lab-scale setups and activated sludge communities (ASC) collected from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) MBR-MH, CAS-E and CAS-M being different in their treatment technologies. ASC inocula were diluted to rule out non-biodegrading species and incubated under two nutrient conditions: A) mineral salt media (MSM) and B) carbon and nitrogen supplied MSM giving MSM-CN. 5-TTri removal with the ASC ranged from 60% to 100% in only 10 days. 100 mu L suspended biomass from the biodegrading setups was subsequently plated on solid media to eliminate possible activated sludge remnants. After growth occurred, mixed colonies were harvested and inoculated in fresh liquid MSM containing 20 mg L-1 5-TTri. These bacterial consortia showed good 5-TTri removal in MSM-CN rather than in MSM, indicating nutrient supply being required for efficient biodegradation. In addition, experiments with high 5-TTri concentrations ranging from 20 to 1000 mg L-1 were conducted in both, MSM and MSM-CN and the maximal 5-TTri removal capacity of the ASC evaluated. 50 mg L-1 5-TTri was still removed in both media whereas 100 mg L-1 was solely removed in MSM-CN. 5-TTri biodegradation patterns also indicated that 5-TTri might be co-metabolized by microbial consortia. Furthermore, experiments with gradient-solid-media-plates showed 5-TTri to be inhibitory for the ASC in concentrations above 50 mg L-1 and revealed the optimal conditions regarding carbon and nitrogen concentration and pH value for effective 5-TTri biodegradation by ASC. Nitrogen proved a crucial factor for enhancing organisms' biodegradation capacity with an optimal pH around 7 while carbon showed no such effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A study was undertaken in order to understand the kinetics and mechanism of the chemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, an insect repellent, by sulfate radical. In this experiment, sulfate radical was generated using peroxymonosulfate with iron(II) and cobalt(II) as activator. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of the sulfate radical with N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide was found to be (1.9 +/- A 0.1) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7 and a temperature of 25 A degrees C. Experiments for the chemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in river water and secondary wastewater revealed that the percentage of the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide was slightly influenced by the water matrices. However, the selected oxidation systems are not effective for the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in seawater. Transformation by-products of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide generated using peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) sulfate, peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) chloride, peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) sulfate and peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) chloride systems were identified. The results indicated that there are slight differences in the distributions of the transformation by-products detected depending on the activator. The common transformation by-products detected in all selected oxidation systems are N,N-diethylbenzamide, N-ethyl-m-toluamide, N,N-dimethyl-m-toluamide, N-ethyl-N-acetyl-m-toluamide, 2-(diethylamino)-1-m-tolylethanone, monohydroxylated N-ethyl-m-toluamide, and dihydroxylated N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. Monohydroxylated N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide were detected only when the peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) system was applied. For the peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) systems, additional isomers of monohydroxylated N-ethyl-m-toluamide were detected. Peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) also transformed 2-(diethylamino)-1-m-tolylethanone into N-ethyl-N-(2-oxo-2-m-tolylethyl)acetamide and monohydroxylated 2-(ethyl(vinyl)amino)-1-m-tolylethanone as transformation by-products.

AB Metformin is a glucose-lowering drug commonly found in municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs). The present study investigated the chronic effects of metformin in early-life stages of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Endpoints assessed were growth, survival, and deformities. The larval gut microbiome was also examined using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine microbial community composition and alpha and beta diversity. Eggs and larvae were exposed to metformin measured concentrations (mean [standard deviation]) of 0.020 (0.017) mu g/L (for controls) and 3.44 (0.23), 33.6 (1.6), and 269 (11) mu g/L in a daily static-renewal setup, with 20 embryos per beaker. The low and middle metformin exposure concentrations represent river and MWWE concentrations of metformin. To detect small changes in growth, we used 18 replicate beakers for controls and 9 replicates for each metformin treatment. Over the 21-d exposure (5 d as embryos and 16 d posthatch [dph]), metformin did not affect survival or growth of larval fish. Hatch success, time to hatch, deformities in hatched fry, and survival were similar across all treatments. Growth (wet wt, length, and condition factor) assessed at 9 and 16 dph was also unaffected by metformin. Assessment of the microbiome showed that the larvae microbiome was dominant in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, with small increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Firmicutes with increasing exposure to metformin. No treatment effects were found for microbiome diversity measures. Control fish euthanized with the anesthetic tricaine methane sulfonate had decreased alpha diversity compared to those sampled by spinal severance. This experiment demonstrates that metformin at environmentally relevant concentrations (3.44 and 33.6 mu g/L) and at 10 times MWWE concentrations (269 mu g/L) does not adversely affect larval growth or gut microbiome in this ubiquitous freshwater fish species.

AB Water scarcity is a natural condition in the Mediterranean rim countries. In this region, reuse of reclaimed water (RW) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is becoming a potential source for highly water-demanding activities such as agriculture. However, the removal capacity of contaminants in regular WWTPs has been found to be limited. Considering a Mediterranean scenario, this research investigated the plant uptake and translocation of three representative pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) typically present in RW samples from a WWTP located in an urban area in Spain, and assessed the potential risk to humans from plant consumption. The RW samples were collected and analyzed for three representative PPCPs (atenolol -ATN-, carbamazepine -CBZ- and triclosan -TCS-). The target contaminants were also spiked at two levels in the RW samples to consider two worst-case scenarios. Three plant models (lettuce, maize and radish) were grown outdoors and irrigated with four treatments: tap water; RW samples, and the two spiked RW samples. Generally speaking, results revealed an efficient root uptake for the three PPCPs regardless of plant species and fortification level, and suggested an interaction effect of treatment and plant organ. Different bioaccumulation and translocation potentials of the three PPCPs were seen into the aerial organs of the plants. Overall, these observations support the idea that factors including the physico-chemical properties of the PPCPs and physiological plant variables, could be responsible for the differential accumulation and translocation potentials observed. These variables could be critical for crops irrigated with RW in regions with extended dry seasons, high solar incidence and low annual rainfall such as those in the Mediterranean rim where plants are subjected to high transpiration rates. However, the results obtained from this experimental approach suggested a negligible risk to humans from consumption of edible plants irrigated with RW samples with presence of PPCPs, despite the fact that the three representative PPCPs under study accumulated efficiently in the plants.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug, has been introduced into agricultural soils via irrigation with treated wastewater and biosolids application. Such contamination is problematic because CBZ is persistent and the risks to ecosystems or human health are unknown. The current study examined CBZ biodegradation in two agricultural soils (soil 1 and 2) and the effects on the soil microbial communities during CBZ exposure. The experimental design involved three CBZ concentrations (50, 500, 5000 ng/g), under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. CBZ concentrations were determined using solid phase extraction and LC MS/MS. The effect of CBZ on the soil microbial community was investigated using high throughput sequencing and a computational approach to predict functional composition of the metagenomes (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, PICRUSt). The most significant CBZ biodegradation occurred in soil 1 under aerobic conditions. In contrast, CBZ biodegradation was limited under anaerobic conditions in soil 1 and under both conditions in soil 2. For soil 1, several phylotypes were enriched following CBZ degradation compared to the controls, including unclassified Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, as well as Sphingomonas, Aquicella and Microvirga. These phylotypes are considered putative CBZ degraders as they appear to be benefiting from CBZ biodegradation. PICRUSt revealed that soil I contained a greater abundance of xenobiotic degrading genes compared to soil 2, and thus, this analysis method offers a potential valuable approach for predicting CBZ attenuation in soils. PICRUSt analysis also implicated Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae in drug metabolism. Interestingly, numerous phylotypes decreased in abundance following CBZ exposure and these varied with soil type, concentration, duration of exposure, and the availability of oxygen. For three phylotypes (Flavobacterium, 3 genus incertae sedis and unclassified Bacteroidetes), the relative abundance was reduced in both soils, indicating a notable sensitivity to CBZ for these microorganisms.

AB This study was undertaken to investigate whether adaptation by pre-exposure to trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was necessary for microbial transformation during managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Two pairs of laboratory-scale soil columns, each receiving a different primary substrate, were utilized to simulate the dominant bulk organic carbon present in MAR systems receiving wastewater effluent of varying quality and having undergone different degrees of pre-treatment, as well as organic carbon prevalent at different stages of subsurface travel. Each pair of columns consisted of duplicate set-ups receiving the same feed solution with only one pre-exposed to a suite of eight TOrCs for approximately ten months. Following the pre-exposure period, a spiking experiment was conducted in which the non-exposed columns also received the same suite of TOrCs. TOrC attenuation was quantified for the pre- and non-exposed columns of each pair during the spiking experiment. The microbial community structure and function of these systems were characterized by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics, respectively. Biotransformation rather than sorption was identified as the dominant removal mechanism for almost all the TOrCs (except triclocarban). Similar removal efficiencies were observed between pre-exposed and non-exposed columns for most TOrCs. No obvious differences in microbial community structure were revealed between pre- and non-exposed columns. Using metagenomics, biotransformation capacity potentials of the microbial community present were also similar between pre- and non-exposed columns of each pair. Overall, the pre-exposure of MAR systems to TOrCs at ng/L levels did not affect their attenuation and had no obvious influence on the resulting microbial community structure and function. Thus, other factors such as bioavailability of the primary substrate play a greater role regarding biotransformation of TOrCs. These results indicate that MAR systems adapted to a primary substrate are capable of degrading TOrC without necessarily being pre-exposed to them, making MAR a robust treatment barrier for biodegradable TOrCs.

AB Water reclamation and ecological reuse is gradually becoming a popular solution to address the high pollutant loads and insufficient ecological flow of many urban rivers. However, emerging contaminants in water reuse system and associated human health and ecological risks need to be assessed. This study determined the occurrence and human health and ecological risk assessments of 35 emerging contaminants during one year, including 5 types of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), 5 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), 7 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 18 disinfection by-products (DBPs), in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and receiving rivers, as well as an unimpacted river for comparison. Results showed that most of PPCPs and EDCs, especially antibiotics, tridosan, estrogens and bisphenol A, occurred frequently at relatively high concentrations, and they were removed from 205% to 88.7% with a mean of 58.9% via WWTP. The highest potential noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in different reuse scenarios were assessed using maximal detected concentrations, all below the acceptable risk limits, with the highest total combined risk value of 9.21 x 10(-9) and 9.98 x 10(-7), respectively. Ecological risk assessment was conducted using risk quotient (RQ) method and indicated that several PPCPs, EDCs and haloacetonitriles (HANs) pose high risk (RQ > 1) to aquatic ecology in the rivers, with the highest RQ up to 83.8. The study suggested that ecological risks need to be urgently addressed by updating and optimizing the process in WWTPs to strengthen the removal efficiencies of emerging contaminants. The study can serve as a reference for safer water reuse in the future, while further studies could be conducted on the health risk of specific groups of people, exposure parameters in water reuse, as well as more emerging contaminants.

AB In the present study green chemistry was employed for synthesizing ZnO nanoparticles using the extract of black tea solid waste and Zn acetate dihydrate. The characterization of the green synthesized ZnO was conducted by XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, DLS and EDAX. Urine samples from donors under medication with Ibuprofen, Ephedrine and Propranolol were separated and collected through a diversion toilet. A batch experiment was conducted in order to determine the optimum dose of green synthesized ZnO nanoparticles for the removal of the pharmaceutical compounds from human urine. The determined optimum dose of the ZnO nanoparticles was 1.5 g/l. ZnO nanoparticle possess the ability to adsorb the Pharmaceutical active compounds (PACs) on the surface. In addition, it binds such adsorbed particles and facilitates their precipitation. Coagulant reagents react with some of the suspended and colloidal particles in water/ wastewater to enhance their binding together, thus, allowing their removal in the subsequent treatment processes. The mechanism of aggregation consists of the combination of charge neutralization, entrapment, adsorption and/or complexion with the coagulant ions to form insoluble precipitate. Thus, the particles and colloids can be removed. A semi-pilot plant consisted of mixing tank for chemical coagulation using the predetermined ZnO nanoparticles followed by microfiltration unit, was designed and operated continuously for the treatment of the separated urine. The overall results of the semi-pilot study showed that the concentration of Ibuprofen, Ephedrine and Propranolol decreased from 5.0, 10.15 and 15.2 mg/l to 0.01, 0.10 and 0.03 mg/l respectively. The overall removal rate exceeded 99%. Meanwhile, the treatment system succeeded to improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the contaminated human urine. The treated urine could be safely used for agriculture purposes without any environmental threat. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB The pollution of surface and drinking water with pharmaceuticals is one of the growing problems. One of the groups used in large quantities involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which can be bought without a prescription This group includes naproxen, which was identified in wastewater, surface water and even drinking water all over the world. The aim of the study was to assess the opportunities for the removal of naproxen sodium from water using carbon sorbents. The measurements were carried out for three commercial microporous (WG-12 and F-300) and micro-mesoporous (ROW 08 Supra) activated carbons. The kinetics and statics of adsorption were studied. The adsorption from solutions with pH from 6 to 10 and temperature from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C was analysed. It was found that the higher the pH, the lower the adsorption and the higher the temperature, the greater the adsorption of naproxen sodium. The highest adsorption of naproxen sodium was obtained for the F-300 activated carbon, whereas the lowest - for the ROW 08 Supra activated carbon. It was found that the adsorption results depend on many factors, the most important of which include hydrogen bonds between carboxyl groups of naproxen sodium and phenolic groups on the surface of activated carbons and electrostatic repulsion between the anions of naproxen sodium and negatively charged the surface of the activated carbon. The results of adsorption kinetics were described with the following models: pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order, intraparticle diffusion, and Elovich. The highest values of correlation coefficient R-2 were obtained for the pseudo-second order and Elovich model. The results of adsorption statics were described using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin models. A good match between isotherms and the obtained results was obtained for the Freundlich and Temkin equations. It was found based on the adsorption intensity 1/n and distribution coefficient R-L that this process was beneficial for all the considered activated carbons and the investigated adsorption conditions.

AB Reduced graphene oxide hybridized with zero-valent silver and magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) (rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 nanohybrids) prepared via in situ nucleation and crystallization was used to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for degradation of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (phenol, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, bisphenol A, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol). The deposition of Ag-0 and Fe3O4 in rGO nanosheet enhanced the catalytic removal of phenol in the heterogeneous activation of PDS. The adsorption capacities of rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 for 10 mu M phenol were 1.76, 1.33, and 2.04 mu mol g(-1)-adsorbent at pH 4, 7, and 10, respectively, which are much higher than those of single NPs studied (Ag-0, nanoscale zero-valent iron, and rGO). The rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 effectively activated PDS to produce strong oxidizing SO4 center dot(-) and facilitate an electron transfer on the surface of the nanohybrid. The initial pseudo-first-order rate (k(ini)) constant for phenol degradation in PDS/rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 system was 0.46 h(-1) at pH 7, which is approximately eight times higher than that in the presence of single NPs (k(ini) = 0.04-0.06 h(-1)) due to the synergistic effects between adsorption and catalytic oxidation. Among various organic contaminants tested, the simultaneous use of rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 (0.1 g/L) and PDS (1 mM) achieved more than 99% degradation of acetaminophen and 17 beta-estradiol at pH 7. The radical scavenging studies with methanol and natural organic matter indicated that phenol was more likely to be degraded via free SO4 center dot(-) and center dot OH formation or a non-radical oxidative pathway. Our findings indicate that the rGO-Ag-0/Fe3O4 nanohybrids can be used as an efficient magnetically-separable nanocatalyst for removal of organic compounds in water and wastewater treatment.

AB Final leachates (leachate after storage or treatment processes) from 22 landfills in 12 states were analyzed for 190 pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), which were detected in every sample, with the number of CECs ranging from 1 to 58 (median = 22). In total, 101 different CECs were detected in leachate samples, including 43 prescription pharmaceuticals, 22 industrial chemicals, 15 household chemicals, 12 nonprescription pharmaceuticals, 5 steroid hormones, and 4 animal/plant sterols. The most frequently detected CECs were lidocaine (91%, local anesthetic), cotinine (86%, nicotine degradate), carisoprodol (82%, muscle relaxant), bisphenol A (77%, component of plastics and thermal paper), carbamazepine (77%, anticonvulsant), and N,N-diethyltoluamide (68%, insect repellent). Concentrations of CECs spanned 7 orders of magnitude, ranging from 2.0 ng/L (estrone) to 17 200 000 ng/L (bisphenol A). Concentrations of household and industrial chemicals were the greatest (similar to 1000-1 000 000 ng/L), followed by plant/animal sterols (similar to 1000-100 000 ng/L), nonprescription pharmaceuticals (similar to 100-10 000 ng/L), prescription pharmaceuticals (similar to 10-10 000 ng/L), and steroid hormones (similar to 10-100 ng/L). The CEC concentrations in leachate from active landfills were significantly greater than those in leachate from closed, unlined landfills (p = 0.05). The CEC concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.01) in untreated leachate compared with treated leachate. The CEC concentrations were significantly greater in leachate disposed to wastewater treatment plants from modern lined landfills than in leachate released to groundwater from closed, unlined landfills (p = 0.04). The CEC concentrations were significantly greater (p = 0.06) in the fresh leachate (leachate before storage or treatment) reported in a previous study compared with the final leachate sampled for the present study.

AB This study investigated the applicability of bulk organic parameters like dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and total fluorescence (TF) to act as surrogates in predicting trace organic compound (TOrC) removal by granular activated carbon in water reuse applications. Using rapid small-scale column testing, empirical linear correlations for thirteen TOrCs were determined with DOC, UV254, and TF in four wastewater effluents. Linear correlations (R-2 > 0.7) were obtained for eight TOrCs in each water quality in the UV254 model, while ten TOrCs had R-2 > 0.7 in the TF model. Conversely, DOC was shown to be a poor surrogate for TOrC breakthrough prediction. When the data from all four water qualities was combined, good linear correlations were still obtained with TF having higher R-2 than UV254 especially for TOrCs with log D-ow > 1. Excellent linear relationship (R-2 > 0.9) between log D-ow and the removal of TOrC at 0% surrogate removal (y-intercept) were obtained for the five neutral TOrCs tested in this study. Positively charged TOrCs had enhanced removals due to electrostatic interactions with negatively charged GAC that caused them to deviate from removals that would be expected with their log D-ow. Application of the empirical linear correlation models to full-scale samples provided good results for six of seven TOrCs (except meprobamate) tested when comparing predicted TOrC removal by UV254 and TF with actual removals for GAC in all the five samples tested. Surrogate predictions using UV254 and TF provide valuable tools for rapid or on-line monitoring of GAC performance and can result in cost savings by extended GAC run times as compared to using DOC breakthrough to trigger regeneration or replacement.

AB Duckweeds are a group of monocotyledonous aquatic plants in the Araceae superfamily, represented by 37 species divided into five genera. Duckweeds are the fastest growing flowering plants and are distributed around the globe; moreover, these plants have multiple applications, including biomass production, wastewater remediation, and making pharmaceutical proteins. Dotted duckweed (Landoltia punctata), the sole species in genus Landoltia, is one of the most resilient duckweed species. The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) encodes the RNA components of ribosomes and represents a significant part of plant genomes but has not been comprehensively studied in duckweeds. Here, we characterized the 5S rDNA genes in L. punctata by cloning and sequencing 25 PCR fragments containing the 5S rDNA repeats. No length variation was detected in the 5S rDNA gene sequence, whereas the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) varied from 151 to 524 bp. The NTS variants were grouped into two major classes, which differed both in nucleotide sequence and the type and arrangement of the spacer subrepeats. The dominant class I NTS, with a characteristic 12-bp TC-rich sequence present in 3-18 copies, was classified into four subclasses, whereas the minor class II NTS, with shorter, 9-bp nucleotide repeats, was represented by two identical sequences. In addition to these diverse subrepeats, class I and class II NTSs differed in their representation of cis-elements and the patterns of predicted G-quadruplex structures, which may influence the transcription of the 5S rDNA. Similar to related duckweed species in the genus Spirodela, L. punctata has a relatively low rDNA copy number, but in contrast to Spirodela and the majority of other plants, the arrangement of the 5S rDNA units demonstrated an unusual, heterogeneous pattern in L. punctata, as revealed by analyzing clones containing double 5S rDNA neighboring units. Our findings may further stimulate the research on the evolution of the plant rDNA and discussion of the molecular forces driving homogenization of rDNA repeats in concerted evolution.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater has become a severe, tremendous threaten to ecological environment and human health. Semiconductor photocatalysts have emerged as potential candidates for degrading pharmaceutical pollutants. Construction of highly efficient, stable and recyclable Z-scheme photocatalysts that are superior to individual constituents or widely studied heterojunction photocatalysts is very fascinating yet challenging. Herein, we report an efficient, stable and recyclable visible-light-driven (VLD) Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 Z-scheme heterojunction with compact interface contact fabricated via an electrospinning-calcination-solvothermal route, in which abundant Bi2WO6 nanosheets are in-situ, compactly and vertically grown on the surface of the Ta3N5 nanofibers. These as-fabricated Z-scheme Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 heterojunctions display dramatically enhanced VLD catalytic activity compared to pristine Bi2WO6, Ta3N5, or the mixture of Bi2WO6 and Ta3N5. Particularly, Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 (1.0Bi-Ta) presents the highest photocatalytic property for the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), achieving approximately 86.7% and 81.1% degradation efficiency, respectively. The extraordinary photocatalytic property is ascribed to the Z-scheme hetero-structure with unique core-shell architecture that realizes compactly interfacial contact between the components for efficient separation of photoexcited carriers, strong visible-light absorption, as well as possesses the strong oxidation ability of photo-excited hole, and the high reduction capacity of photo-excited electron. The trapping experiments combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses verify the prevailing role of photo-induced holes (h(+)), superoxide radicals (center dot O2-), and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) in the Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 photocatalytic system. Notably, the direct contact between Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 and contaminants is experimentally demonstrated to be significant for the efficient degradation of pollutants. Moreover, Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 is endowed with easily recyclable characteristics and excellent durability. Therefore, this research illustrates that Bi2WO6/Ta3N5 may hold a great prospect for the treatment of harmful pharmaceutical pollutants.

AB The use of surface water impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents for crop irrigation is a form of unplanned water reuse. Natural attenuation processes can buffer contamination spreading. However, this practice can promote the exposure of crops to contaminants of emerging concern, such as pharmaceuticals, trace metals (TMs) and metalloids, posing a risk to health. This research aimed to evaluate the presence of 50 pharmaceuticals, some transformation products, 7 TMs and a metalloid in the water-sediment-soil-plant system, and their potential to be bioaccumulated into edible parts of plants, as a result of the unplanned water reuse. The study site consists of an extensive agricultural land downstream Madrid city (Spain) where surface water, strongly impacted by WWTP effluents, is applied through gravity-based systems to cultivate mainly maize. Sampling campaigns were conducted to collect WWTP effluent, surface and irrigation water, river sediments, agricultural soils and maize fruits. Results demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of several pharmaceuticals. The concentration pattern in irrigation water did not resemble the pattern of contents in soils and plants. The pharmaceuticals included in the EU surface water watch lists were quantified in the lowest concentration range (macrolide antibiotics, ciprofloxacin) or were not detected (most of the hormones). Therefore, hormones do not represent an emerging risk in our scenario. The TMs and the metalloid in water and agricultural soils should not arise any concern. Whereas, their presence in the river sediments may have an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems. Only acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, nicotine, Zn, Cu and Ni were quantified in corn grains. Calculated parameters to assess bioaccumulation and health risk indicate that neither pharmaceuticals nor TMs pose a threat to human health due to consumption of maize cultivated in the area. Results highlight the need to include different environmental matrices when assessing contaminant fate under real field-scale conditions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The extent of sulfadiazine (SDZ) removal via photo-degradation (UV-C), photocatalysis with TiO2 (UV-C/TiO2) and photo-persulfate-oxidation (UV-C/PS) was investigated in a batch reactor under different UV-C power levels (i.e. 14, 28, 42 and 56 W). Moreover, effects of suspended/immobilized catalyst, i.e. TiO2 slurry/TiO2 supported on granular activated carbon (GAC-TiO2), on SDZ removal and corresponding SDZ degradation kinetics under different catalyst loading (1-6 g/L) were explored. Around 41.7% SDZ removal was observed after 120 min in UV-C system at the highest power level, i.e. 56 W. On the other hand, photocatalysis with TiO2 and GAC-TiO2 has shown better SDZ removal than photo-degradation. In UV-C/TiO2 (4 g/L and 28 W) and UV-C/GAC-TiO2 (5 g/L and 28 W) systems, SDZ removals were 91.8% after 120 min and 100% after 60 min, respectively; however, TOC analysis has revealed that 45.4% and 60.8% SDZ was mineralized in these systems, respectively. In UV-C/PS system, near complete degradation of SDZ (99.8%) was observed within 10 min under 50 mg/L of PS and 28 W UV illumination. On the other hand, complete SDZ removal was observed in PS alone system at a dosage of 1000 mg/L but the formation of SO42- was found to be a drawback. In photolysis and photocatalysis systems, SDZ removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics whereas the kinetics followed pseudo-second-order in UV-C/PS system. The comparison of electrical energy consumed (E-EO) in different systems revealed that UV-C/ GAC-TiO2 and UV-C/PS system were energy efficient compared with other systems. The LC-MS analysis has confirmed the cleavage of C-N bonds in the pyrimidine ring followed by S-N bonds in the sulfonyl group, which was found to be the major degradation pathway of SDZ.

AB The bioregeneration of activated carbon (AC) in biological activated carbon (BAC) systems is limited by sorption-desorption hysteresis and transport between the adsorbent and biomass. In this study, we investigated these limitations and whether a biofilm covering the AC surface is required. Consequently, BAC reactors were operated at different shear stress and AC surface smoothness, since this may affect biofilm formation. The experiments were carried out in BAC and blank reactors treating synthetic wastewater containing the pharmaceutical metoprolol.
   After start-up, all reactors removed metoprolol completely; however, after 840 h the removal dropped due to saturation of the AC. In the blank reactors, the removal dropped to 0% while in the BAC reactors removal recovered to >99%, due to increased biological activity. During the initial phase, the metoprolol was adsorbed, rather than biodegraded. At the end, the AC from the BAC reactors had higher pore volume and sorption capacity than from the blank reactors, showing that the AC had been bioregenerated.
   At high shear (G = 25 s(-1)), the rough AC granules (R-a = 13 mu m) were covered with a 50-400 gm thick biofilm and the total protein content of the biofilm was 2.6 mg/gAC, while at lower shear (G = 8.8 s(-1)) the rough AC granules were only partly covered. The biofilm formation at lower shear (G = 8.8 s(-1)) on smooth AC granules (R-a = 1.6 mu m) was negligible. However, due to the presence of suspended biomass the reactor performance or bioregeneration were not reduced. This showed that direct contact between the AC and biomass was not essential in mixed BAC systems. The microbial analyses of the suspended biomass and the biofilm on AC surface indicated that metoprolol was mainly biodegraded in suspension. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Following soil applications of recycled water and biosolids, pharmaceutical residues can eventually enter the terrestrial environment. In vitro and in vivo assays have largely focused on the acute ecotoxicity of these compounds in aquatic systems. However, studies on the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals in soil biota are especially scarce.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the acute toxicity of 18 pharmaceuticals (4 NSAIDs, 5 blood lipid-lowering agents, 6 beta-blockers and 3 antibiotics) that are usually found in the environment by using an Eisenia fetida bioassay. In addition, the presence of these pharmaceuticals in artificial soil was verified at the end of the test.
   Our results indicate that seven of the studied drugs cause acute adverse effects in E. fetida, in particular, the NSAIDs and the blood lipid-lowering agents. Ibuprofen (LC50=64.80 mg/kg) caused the highest acute toxicity for all tested compounds, followed by diclofenac (LC50=90.49 mg/kg) and simvastatin (LC50=92.70 mg/kg). Other tested pharmaceuticals from NSAIDs and blood lipid-lowering families have toxicity effects, from a LC50=140.87 mg/kg for gemfibrozil to 795.07 mg/kg for lovastatin. Atorvastatin, bezafibrate, beta-blockers and antibiotics showed no detectable lethality in E. fetida. The four NSAIDs showed evidence of modification of their original chemical structure after 14 days so the detected toxicity may be due to the original product as well as their degradation products. The three blood lipid-lowering agents seem to be more stable in soil.
   From an environmental perspective, the lethal concentrations of the tested drugs are much greater than those reported in wastewater and biosolids, therefore acute toxic effects may be improbable. However, little is known about the accumulation of these substances in soils after regular applications, so accumulative and chronic effects cannot be excluded. Moreover, more studies are needed to determine the role of the degradation products of these pharmaceuticals on terrestrial toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanobiomaterials (NBMs) are a special category of nanomaterials used in medicine. As applications of NBMs are very similar to pharmaceuticals, their environmental release patterns are likely similar as well. Different pharmaceuticals were detected in surface waters all over the world. Consequently, there exists a need to identify possible NBM exposure routes into the environment. As the application of many NBMs is only carried out at specific locations (hospitals), average predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) may not accurately represent their release to the environment. We estimated the local release of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which is investigated for their use in drug delivery, to Swiss surface waters by using population data as well as type, size and location of hospitals as proxies. The total mean consumption of PGLA in Switzerland using an explorative full-market penetration scenario was calculated to be 770 kg/year. 105 hospitals were considered, which were connected to wastewater treatment plants and the receiving water body using graphic information system (GIS) modelling. The water body dataset contained 20,167 river segments and 210 lake polygons. Using the discharge of the river, we were able to calculate the PECs in different river segments. While we calculated high PLGA releases of 2.24 and 2.03 kg/year in large cities such as Geneva or Zurich, the resulting local PECs of 220 and 660 pg/l, respectively, were low due to the high river discharge (330 and 97 m3/s). High PLGA concentrations (up to 7,900 pg/l) on the other hand were calculated around smaller cities with local hospitals but also smaller receiving rivers (between 0.7 and 1.9 m3/s). Therefore, we conclude that population density does not accurately predict local concentration hotspots of NBMs, such as PLGA, that are administered in a hospital context. In addition, even at the locations with the highest predicted PLGA concentrations, the expected risk is low.

AB Organic pollutants such as dyes and pharmaceutical drugs have become an environmental menace, particularly in water bodies owing to their unregulated discharge. It is thus required to develop an economically viable and environment-friendly approach for their degradation in water bodies. In this study, for the first time, we report green route-synthesized plasmonic nanostructures (P-M-CQDs (where M: Au and Ag)) decorated onto TiO2 nanofibers for the treatment of toxic dye- and pharmaceutical drug-based wastewater. P-M-CQDs are efficaciously synthesized using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as the sole reducing and capping agent, wherein CQDs are derived via a green synthesis approach from Citrus limetta waste. The characteristic electron-donating property of CQDs played a key role in the reduction of Au3+ to Au-0 and Ag+ to Ag-0 under visible light irradiation to obtain P-Au-CQDs and P-Ag-CQDs, respectively. Thus, the obtained CQDs, P-Au-CQDs, and P-Ag-CQDs are loaded onto TiO2 nanofibers to obtain a P-M-CQD/TiO2 nanocomposite (NC), and are further probed via transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and UV-visible spectrophotometry. The degradation of organic pollutants and pharmaceutical drugs using methylene blue and erythromycin as model pollutants is mapped with UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate the complete MB dye degradation in 20 minutes with 1 mg mL(-1) of P-Au-CQD/TiO2 NC, which otherwise is 30 minutes for P-Ag@CQD/TiO2 dose under visible light irradiation. Similarly, the pharmaceutical drug was found to degrade in 150 minutes with P-Au-CQD/TiO2 photocatalysts. These findings reveal the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the green-synthesized Au decorated with TiO2 nanofibers and are attributed to the boosted SPR effect and aqueous-phase stability of Au nanostructures. This study opens a new domain of utilizing waste-derived and green-synthesized plasmonic nanostructures for the degradation of toxic/hazardous dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants in water.

AB Very recently, several studies have found that homogeneous reducing agents (e.g., sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3)) can activate ferrate to enhance the degradation of selected contaminants. In this work, it was found that heterogeneous carbon nanotube (CNT) could accelerate ferrate (Fe(VI)) for the degradation of bromophenols (BrPs) of environmental concerns and alleviate the appearance of undesired by-products in effluent. Fe(V1) could react with BrPs over a wide pH range of 6 10 with apparent second -order rate constants of 1.8-1850 M-1 s(-1). Electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-QqQMS) analysis showed that dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls and dibrominated phenoxyphenols were possibly formed via coupling reaction of BrPs radicals generated from Fe(VI) oxidation through one-electron transfer. The presence of CNT could remarkably accelerate the degradation rates of BrPs by Fe(VI) in a wide pH range from 7 to 10. Moreover, the formed undesired polybrominated products during Fe(VI)/CNT oxidation were absorbed on CNT surface and thus removed from treated water. The Fe(VI)/CNT system was capable of selectively oxidizing electron-rich pollutants (e.g., BrPs, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)), but reluctant to iopamidol (IPM) and nitrobenzene (NB). High-valent metal-oxo intermediates Fe(V)/Fe(IV) formed in situ from the reaction of CNT with Fe(VI) were likely responsible for this activation effect of CNT, which was further confirmed via using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe compound. Comparatively, homogeneous reducing agent Na2S2O3 could enhance Fe(VI) degradation of BrPs at pH 7 and 8, while undesired polybrominated products were detected in effluent from Fe(VI)/Na2S2O3 system. These findings have crucial implications for the development of a promising oxidation process by combination of Fe(VI) and CNT for water and wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The application of fixed bed high rate nitrifying trickling filters (NTFs) for the removal of track organic chemicals of concern (CoC) is less well known than their application to nutrient removal in water treatment. Particularly, the effect of exogenous organic carbon substrate (sucrose) loading on the performance of NTFs is not well understood. A laboratory-scale NTF system was operated in recirculation mode, with the objective of removing ammonia and CoC simultaneously. The efficiency of a high rate NTF for removal both of low concentration of ammonia (5 mg NH4-N' L-1) and different concentrations of CoC in the presence of an exogenous organic carbon substrate (30 mg total organic carbon (TOC) L-1) was investigated. In the presence of exogenous organic carbon, the results demonstrated that the high rate NTF was able to successfully remove most of the CoCs investigated, with the removal ranging from 20.2% to 87.54%. High removal efficiencies were observed for acetaminophen (87.54%), bisphenol A (86.60%), trimethoprim (86.24%) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (80.60%). It was followed by the medium removal efficiency for N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (61.31%) and atrazine (56.90%). In contrast, the removal of caffeine (28.43%) and benzotriazole (20.20%) was poorer in the presence of exogenous organic carbon. The removal efficiency for CoC was also compared with the results obtained in our previous study in the absence of exogenous organic carbon. The results showed that the addition of exogenous organic carbon was able to improve the removal of some of the CoC. Significant TOC percentage removals (45.68% - 84.43%) and ammonia removal rate (mean value of 0.44 mg NH4-N L-1 h(-1)) were also achieved in this study. The findings from this study provide valuable information for optimising the efficiency of high rate NTF for the removal of ammonia, CoC and TOC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Omeprazole is one of the world-wide most consumed pharmaceuticals for treatment of gastric diseases. As opposed to other frequently used pharmaceuticals, omeprazole is scarcely detected in urban wastewaters and environmental waters. This was corroborated in a previous research, where parent omeprazole was not detected while four transformation products (TPs), mainly resulting from hydrolysis, were found in effluent wastewaters and surface waters. However, the low abundance of omeprazole TPs in the water samples together with the fact that omeprazole suffers an extensive metabolism, with a wide range of excretion rates (between 0.01 and 30%), suggests that human urinary metabolites should be investigated in the water environment. In this work, the results obtained in excretion tests after administration of a 40 mg omeprazole dose in three healthy volunteers are reported. Analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS) reported low concentrations of omeprazole in urine. Up to twenty-four omeprazole metabolites (OMs) were detected and tentatively elucidated. The most relevant OM was an omeprazole isomer, which obviously presented the same exact mass (m/z 346.1225), but also shared a major common fragment at m/z 198.0589. Subsequent analyses of surface water and effluent wastewater samples by both LC-QTOF MS and LC-MS/MS with triple quadrupole revealed that this metabolite (named as OM10) was the compound most frequently detected in water samples, followed by OM14a and OM14b. Up to our knowledge, OM10 had not been used before as urinary biomarker of omeprazole in waters. On the contrary, parent omeprazole was never detected in any of the water samples. After this research, it seems clear that monitoring the presence of omeprazole in the aquatic environment should be focused on the OMs suggested in this article instead of the parent compound.

AB Removal of micropollutants from wastewaters is crucial to ensure safe water reuse and protect natural water-courses. Although membrane bioreactors (MBRs) yield improved degradation of organic compounds, hydraulic retention times are often too short to satisfy acceptable removal rates of recalcitrant organics. Often, results regarding micropollutant removal in treatment plants are susceptible to uncontrolled feed concentrations, which are concomitant to seasonality and consumer habits. In this work, we investigate the concentration transients of four selected pesticides (carbendazim, diuron, 2,4-D and atrazine), which were constantly dosed to a MBR pilot plant treating high-strength industrial effluents (COD values ). In addition to the regular MBR operation, two feasible means of extending pesticide retention in bioreactors were evaluated: (i) addition of small concentrations of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the activated sludge and (ii) coupling of the PAC-assisted MBR and a reverse osmosis unit (RO) with recirculation of the retentate. The aim of this work is to provide reliable information on the fate of micropollutants within wastewater treatment plants using different configurations under controlled feed conditions. Results have shown that carbendazim was the only pesticide efficiently (>80%) removed during regular MBR operation, which has been attributed to the presence of electron donating groups attached to its aromatic ring structure. Improved retention of diuron by addition of PAC enhanced its long-term removal, whereas the effect of PAC addition on the removal of 2,4-D and atrazine was only temporary, thus being mainly attributed to an adsorption effect. Additionally, the function of PAC as platform for biofloc formation limited sludge production and slowed down membrane fouling, further improving the general performance of the MBR. The MBR-RO hybrid process was the most effective one in increasing the residence time of pesticides in the bioreactor, regardless of their functional groups and properties, thus facilitating a generalized removal of micropollutants.

AB Water pollution by pharmaceuticals is a global issue and its remediation is important. To overcome this, we synthesised super hydrophobic nanoporous 3-dimensional ordered nanomaterials with multifunctional binding chemistry for highly efficient adsorption of estrogen (17 beta-estradiol). Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesised via Tours method and methoxylether polyethylene glycol (mPEG) was covalently introduced onto GO surface via facile amidation mild process to give GO-mPEG. GO-mPEG was anchored on nanoporous SBA-15 and homogenously reduced in-situ to SBA-rGO-mPEG. XRD analysis confirmed successful synthesis of SBA-15 and cross-linked GO/rGO-mPEG on SBA-15 surface. Image analysis revealed the architecture of SBA-15 as porous 3-dimensional silica network and presence of interwoven/crosslinked thin-films of GO-mPEG on SBA-15 surface. EDX mapping/elemental analysis showed expected elements were present. FTIR and textural analysis revealed the presence of different functional groups and high surface area as well as porosity, respectively. Optimal molar ratio experiments showed that 0.5SBA-rGO-mPEG had the highest sorption capacity. The relatively large surface area, 3-dimensional nanoprous silica structure and excess of polyamide/amido-carbonic functional groups on nanocomposites were suited for adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol. Equilibrium time was 30 min and effect of pH on adsorption was negligible. Sorption kinetic process of SBA-rGO-mPEG suited the pseudosecond-order model and equilibrium data fitted both Freundlich and Langmuir models. Qm values of 57.1, 78.5, 102.6 and 192.3 mg/g was recorded for SBA-GO, 0.1SBA-rGO-mPEG, 0.25SBA-rGO-mPEG and 0.5SBA-rGO-mPEG, respectively. H-bond, hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions were the sorption mechanism of SBA-rGO-mPEG after detailed analysis of data. Adsorbents was regenerated/re-used after 4 cycles with high remediation from environmental/real water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This manuscript aimed to identify the energy demand, and environmental aspects and impacts of crop fertilisation with human urine when compared to using mineral fertilisers. The Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment methods were adopted covering the options from "cradle to grave". The fertilisation with human urine included the collection, storage, transportation, application and field emissions, while the fertilisation with mineral fertilisers included primary production of fertilisers, transportation, application and field emissions. The reference flows were based on the fertilisation of 1 ha of maize with 225 kg of nitrogen, 29 kg of phosphorus and 48 kg of potassium oxide. We analysed the environmental aspects such as nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, energy demand and water depletion, as well as environmental impacts such as global warming, human toxicity, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, water scarcity and resource depletion. The agricultural fertilisation with full volume of human urine closer to the source presented smaller energy demand and environmental impact indicator values when compared to solid mineral fertiliser, despite the uncertainties. The fertilisation with human urine was more advantageous with transportation distances up to 134 km (energy demand) and 84 km (environmental categories) by truck compared to 1841 km of mineral fertiliser. Ammonia volatilisation control was key to reduce acidification and eutrophication indicator values. When considering additional gains such as the reduction of water demand and wastewater generation from a waterless collection of human urine, the indicator values of environmental aspects and impacts of fertilisation with human urine were smaller than those with mineral fertiliser and reached a break-even point of 193 km (energy demand) and 185 km (environmental categories). The nutrient cycling through resource-based sanitation offers an opportunity to expand sanitation access with smaller environmental impacts and more efficient water-energy-nutrient nexus.

AB Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the (bio)transformation of the antidiabetic sitagliptin (STG) and the antihistamine fexofenadine (FXF) during wastewater treatment. As inoculum either attached-growth on carriers or suspended sludge from a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor (HMBBR) was used. Both target compounds were incubated in degradation experiments and quantified via LC-MS/MS for degradation kinetics. Furthermore transformation products (TPs) were analyzed via high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Structural elucidation of the TPs was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass to propose a molecular formula and on MS2 fragmentation to elucidate the chemical structure of the TPs. In total, 22 TPs (9 TPs for STG and 13 TPs for FXF) were detected in the experiments with STG and FXF. For all TPs, chemical structures could be proposed. STG was mainly transformed via amide hydrolysis and conjugation of the primary amine moiety. In contrast, FXF was predominantly transformed by oxidative reactions such as oxidation (dehydrogenation) and hydroxylation. Furthermore, FXF was removed significantly faster in contact with carriers compared to suspended sludge, whereas STG was degraded slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge. Moreover, the primary TP of FXF was also degraded faster in contact with carriers leading to higher proportions of secondary TPs. Thus, the microbial community of both carriers and suspended sludge catalyzed the same primary transformation reactions but the transformation kinetics of FXF and the formation/degradation of FXF TPs were considerably higher in contact with carrier-attached biomass. The primary degradation of both target compounds in pilot- and full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) and MBBR reactors reached 42 and 61% for FXF and STG, respectively. Up to three of the identified TPs of FXF and 8 TPs of STG were detected in the effluents of pilot- and full-scale CAS and MBBR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, for the first time, faujasite Y zeolite impregnated with iron (III) was employed as a catalyst to remove a real cocktail of micropollutants inside real water samples from the Meurthe river by the means of the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process. The catalyst was prepared by the wet impregnation method using iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as iron precursor. First, an optimization of the process parameters was conducted using phenol as model macro-pollutant. The hydrogen peroxide concentration, the light wavelength (UV and visible) and intensity, the iron loading immobilized, as well as the pH of the solution were investigated. Complete photo-Fenton degradation of the contaminant was achieved using faujasite containing 20 wt.% of iron, under UV light, and in the presence of 0.007 mol/L of H2O2 at pH 5.5. In a second step, the optimized process was used with real water samples from the Meurthe river. Twenty-one micropollutants (endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and perfluorinated compounds) including 17 pharmaceutical compounds were specifically targeted, detected, and quantified. All the initial concentrations remained in the range of nanogram per liter (0.8-88 ng/L). The majority of the micropollutants had a large affinity for the surface of the iron-impregnated faujasite. Our results emphasized the very good efficiency of the photo-Fenton process with a cocktail of a minimum of 21 micropollutants. Except for sulfamethoxazole and PFOA, the concentrations of all the other microcontaminants (bisphenol A, carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, clarithromycin, diclofenac, estrone, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, lidocaine, naproxen, PFOS, triclosan, etc.) became lower than the limit of quantification of the LC-MS/MS after 30 min or 6 h of photo-Fenton treatment depending on their initial concentrations. The photo-Fenton degradation of PFOA can be neglected. The photo-Fenton degradation of sulfamethoxazole obeys first-order kinetics in the presence of the cocktail of the other micropollutants.

AB Knowledge regarding the impact of tourism on the emergence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in Alpine river waters is limited and scarce. Therefore, a study on the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal variability of 105 PPCPs in an Alpine river basin located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region (North-Eastern Italy) has been conducted. We observed that the total concentration of analyzed PPCPs was generally higher in all sampling sites during winter than in the summer. The analysis of tourist data revealed that during both sampling campaigns the number of tourists was lower in the downstream sites in comparison with the upstream area of the basin (Val di Sole). Particularly, sampling sites located near important tourist resorts have shown the highest abundance of the PPCPs during winter, being analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antihypertensives and antibiotics the most abundant pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Diclofenac showed the highest concentration amongst PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 675 ng L-' in the sampling site situated downstream of the Tonale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Antihypertensives were found at concentrations >300 ng L-1, while antibiotics were quantified up to 196 ng L-1, respectively. Amongst personal care products (PCPs), the most abundant compound was octyl-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (ODPABA) with concentrations reaching up to 748 ng L-1 in the sampling site situated within the Rotaliana district In general, concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in water than in the sediment samples. The most frequently detected PhACs in sediments from both sampling campaigns were antibiotics, while amongst PCPs in sediments, octocrylene (OC) showed the highest concentration in both sampling campaigns. As a result, this study highlights the potential impact of tourism on the water quality of the Alpine aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), as a widely used drug, has been detected in various environmental media such as municipal wastewater effluent. However, there is little information on the effects of DCF on freshwater invertebrates potentially exposing to its residues in surface water. In the present study, we investigated the toxic effects of DCF on the physiological parameters (e.g., survival, growth rate, and reproduction) of a crustacean, Daphnia magna, via a 21-d chronic toxicity test, and we also evaluated the effects of DCF on the expression of the genes related to the detoxification metabolism, growth, development and reproduction (e.g., HR96, P-gp, CYP360A8, CYP314, GST, EcR and Vtg) in acute exposure (up to 96 h) with RT-PCR. Significant toxic effects of DCF to D. magna were observed at 50 mu g L-1, the expression of these selected genes was inhibited with 24 h of exposure, and induced after 48 h to some extents. The expression of Vtg was induced at high concentrations of DCF (500 mu g L-1 and 5000 mu g L-1) after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, but also significantly induced at low concentration (50 mu g L-1) after 96 h of exposure. Dose and time-dependent relationships were observed for gene expression of the seven selected genes. In the 21-d chronic toxicity test, the days to the first brood and the days to the first egg production were both significantly delayed at 50 mu g L-1. However, there were no significant differences observed among the molting frequency, number of eggs produced in the first brood, total number of eggs per individual, total number of broods per individual, body length and intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggested that the reproduction parameters are more sensitive endpoints than the survival and growth for evaluating the toxicity of DCF to aquatic invertebrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Disinfection with chloramines is often used to reduce the production of regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). However, chloramination can lead to the formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Previous research used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor of NDMA, but certain widely used tertiary dimethylamines (e.g. the pharmaceutical ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than DMA. This study investigates the NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines including pharmaceuticals and herbicides. The reactivity of these molecules with monochloramine (NH2Cl) is studied through the formation of NDMA, and other halogenated DBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and AOX (Adsorbable Organic Halides). Several compounds investigated formed NDMA in greater amounts than DMA, revealing the importance of structural characteristics of tertiary amines for NDMA formation. Among these compounds, the pharmaceutical ranitidine showed the highest molar conversion to NDMA. The pH and dissolved oxygen content of the solution were found to play a major role for the formation of NDMA from ranitidine. NDMA was formed in higher amounts at pH around pH 8 and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreased NDMA yields. These findings seem to indicate that dichloramine (NHCl2) is not the major oxidant involved in the formation of NDMA from ranitidine, results in contradiction with the reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature. Dissolved oxygen was also found to influence the formation of other oxygen-containing DBPs (i.e. trichloronitromethane and haloketones). The results of this study identify several anthropogenic precursors of NDMA, indicating that chloramination of waters impacted by these tertiary amines could lead to the formation of significant amounts of NDMA and other non-regulated DBPs of potential health concern (e.g. dichloroacetonitrile or trichloronitromethane). This could be of particular importance for the chloramination of wastewater effluents, especially during water reuse processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the order of ng L-1 to sg L-1 have been reported worldwide in waste, fluvial and even drinking water, raising concern about the efficacy of the currently employed waste water treatments in the elimination of this kind of compounds. Despite ranking 29th in terms of population. Spain is currently the 8th country on pharmaceutical prescription with an expense of 14 x 10(9) euros in 2008. In this context, the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 33 pharmaceutically active compounds in specific points of the main rivers of the Madrid Region (MR) as well as tap water samples from the metropolitan area of Madrid. Additionally, a screening level risk characterization by means of the Hazard Quotient (HQ.) method was applied. A total of 25 pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites were detected in the 10 sampling points downstream the outlet of the major STPs of the MR. The highest concentrations were detected for the anticonvulsant carbamazepine and the stimulant caffeine. Concentrations for most of the analyzed compounds exceed levels previously reported in the literature. Moreover, we report the highest concentration of the cytostatic ifosfamide, detected for the first time in Spain in surface water. Preliminary risk characterization shows that a total of 16 compounds represent at least a low potential hazard based on their scored HQs, with five of them present in a concentration that exceeds the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Toxic Units calculation indicates that for all the selected sampling points high hazard is anticipated from the presence of the analyzed compounds in the measured concentrations (TUs > 10). Caffeine and cotinine were detected in all (10) the analyzed tap water samples. Carbamazepine and nicotine were detected in six and venlafaxine in two samples. No studies venlafaxine in drinking water have been reported. These results clearly pinpoint the need for water quality monitoring and research in urban rivers, as well as the need for improved water treatment techniques able to eliminate this kind of compounds from the effluent waters as well as from drinking water sources.

AB The Red River originates in the U.S., drains into Lake Winnipeg, and is a significant pathway for nutrients. We investigate its role as a source for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and microbes bearing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). We delineate agricultural, urban, and rural land-use for organic contaminants to determine the extent of chemical transboundary riverine fluxes, and characterize levels and trends of organic contaminants and ARGs between spring and fall 2014 and 2015. The herbicide atrazine peaked at over 500 ng/L (14-day time-weighted average) near the border, indicating that the U.S. represents the major source into Canada from the Red River. Neonicotinoid insecticides had relatively constant concentrations, suggesting more widespread agricultural use in both countries. Pesticide concentrations were greatest post-application in June and July. Mass loadings of pesticides over the sampling periods, from the river to Lake Winnipeg, ranged from approximately 800 kg of atrazine, to 120 kg of thiamethoxam and clothianidin, to 40 kg of imidacloprid. Exposure distributions for atrazine exceeded benchmark water quality guidelines for protection of aquatic life (0.2% probability of exceeding chronic benchmark) with no exceedances for neonicotinoids. Seven pharmaceuticals were detected, mostly at low ng/L levels downstream of the City of Winnipeg wastewater treatment plant. Carbamazepine, the only pharmaceutical detected consistently at all sites, contributed on average 20 kg each year into Lake Winnipeg. While minor inputs were observed all along the river, city inputs represented the greatest source of pharmaceuticals to the river. Both PFASs and ARGs were observed consistently and ubiquitously, indicative of an anthropogenically-influenced system with no indications of any single point-source signature. While transboundary flux from the U.S. was an important source of pesticides to the Red River, especially for atrazine, observed concentrations of all measured contaminants suggest that known aquatic toxicological risk is minimal.

AB Exposure of wildlife to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) is likely to occur but studies of risk are limited. One exposure pathway that has received attention is trophic transfer of APIs in a water-fish osprey food chain. Samples of water, fish plasma and osprey plasma were collected from Delaware River and Bay, and analyzed for 21 APIs. Only 2 of 21 analytes exceeded method detection limits in osprey plasma (acetaminophen and diclofenac) with plasma levels typically 2-3 orders of magnitude below human therapeutic concentrations (HTC). We built upon a screening level model used to predict osprey exposure to APIs in Chesapeake Bay and evaluated whether exposure levels could have been predicted in Delaware Bay had we just measured concentrations in water or fish. Use of surface water and BCFs did not predict API concentrations in fish well, likely due to fish movement patterns, and partitioning and bioaccumulation uncertainties associated with these ionizable chemicals. Input of highest measured API concentration in fish plasma combined with pharmacokinetic data accurately predicted that diclofenac and acetaminophen would be the APIs most likely detected in osprey plasma. For the majority of APIs modeled, levels were not predicted to exceed 1 ng/mL or method detection limits in osprey plasma. Based on the target analytes examined, there is little evidence that APIs represent a significant risk to ospreys nesting in Delaware Bay. If an API is present in fish orders of magnitude below HTC, sampling of fish-eating birds is unlikely to be necessary. However, several human pharmaceuticals accumulated in fish plasma within a recommended safety factor for HTC. It is now important to expand the scope of diet based API exposure modeling to include alternative exposure pathways (e.g., uptake from landfills, dumps and wastewater treatment plants) and geographic locations (developing countries) where API contamination of the environment may represent greater risk.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate samples were obtained from a RO-membrane system that uses effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as feed water for the production of drinking water. A number of different pharmaceuticals (e.g. antibiotics, contrast media, beta blockers) were found in the WWTP effluent as well as in the RO-concentrate. Overall, a concentration factor (feed: concentrate) of approximately 3-4 was measured. Beta blockers (acebutolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) were found in the range of low ng/L to low mu g/L. Because metoprolol and propranolol are classified as potentially toxic to aquatic organisms and all beta blocker molecules have moieties, which are reactive towards ozone (amine groups, activated aromatic rings), it was tested whether ozonation can be applied for their mitigation. Rate constants for the reaction of acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol with ozone and OH radicals were determined. At pH 7 acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol react with ozone with an apparent second-order rate constant (ko(3)) of about 2000 M-1 s(-1), whereas propranolol reacts with similar to 10(5)M(-1)s(-1). The rate constants for the reaction of the selected compounds with (OH)-O-center dot radicals were determined to be 0.5-1.0 x 10(10)M(-1) s(-1). Experiments with RO concentrate showed that an ozone dose of only 5 mg/L resulted in a quantitative removal of propranolol in 0.8s and 10 mg O-3/L, oxidized 70% of metoprolol in only 1.2s. Tests with chlorinated and non-chlorinated WWTP effluent showed an increase of ozone stability but a decrease of hydroxyl radical exposure in the samples after chlorination. This may shift the oxidation processes towards direct ozone reactions and favor the degradation of compounds with high kO(3). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With constrained Nile water and the cruel drop in per capita freshwater share in Egypt, soil aquifer treatment (SAT) appears an attractive, low-cost, unconventional water resource that is environmentally friendly and relatively easy to operate. Nevertheless, organic micropollutants (OMPs) in treated wastewater pose environmental and health risks if not properly attenuated through vadose zone infiltration. Thus, determination of OMP removal in a SAT system is important for sustainable groundwater management. In this study, a new, simple equation for the prediction of organic micropollutant removal in SAT systems was developed using gene expression programming (GEP). A wide range of 15OMPs and aquifer conditions were examined along with various real operational aspects of SAT systems, including hydraulic loading rate and dry/wet ratio. The effect of spatial heterogeneity on saturated hydraulic conductivity was considered. Developed GEP models had an average coefficient of determination R2 of 0.92. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with 50,000 realizations was used to propagate uncertainty in SAT parameters in order to generate stochastic inputs for the GEP model. It was found that the removal of OMPs in SAT systems is mostly affected by biodegradation rate and soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity, in addition to dry/wet ratio. Finally,the developed GEP models were applied to enhance the criteria for selecting potential sites for SAT systems in Egypt considering OMP. It was shown that a SAT system would perform well at three sites, with a OMP removal efficiency reaching 100%, whereas it would have a removal of only 50% in the other two sites. Uncertainties in predictions were quantified with an average value of 35%. The developed GEP models can serve as basis for preliminary SAT site selection and design, and can substitute for complex commercial modeling software, especially for practitioners and decision makers in feasibility studies. However, for SAT implementation in a selected location, results can be confirmed only through field column tests.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites are continually released from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment; however, their impact on aquatic biota is poorly understood. This study examined the toxicity and bioconcentration of three pharmaceuticals: moxifloxacin, rosuvastatin, and drospirenone to the unionid mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea. Effects of moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin were assessed through aqueous 21-d static-renewal tests using 2-year-old mussels, at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mg/L (nominal concentrations). Following exposure, survival, behavior, algal clearance rate, hemocyte viability and density, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were assessed. In addition, the acute (48 h) toxicity of moxifloxacin (0-100 mg/L) and drospirenone (0-3 mg/L) to glochidia (larval mussels) were examined. In 21 day exposures (2-yr old mussels), there were no differences in survival, oxygen consumption, hemocyte density, or GST activity over the range of concentrations examined: however, the proportion of time mussels spent filtering, and consequently the algal clearance rate, decreased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin concentrations. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranged between 0.03 and 70 for moxifloxacin, and between 0 and 0.05 for rosuvastatin for exposures up to 100 mg/L. The BCF for moxifloxacin at the highest exposure concentration was lower than that at the mid-level concentrations, likely due to decreased filtering activity at the higher exposure levels. The feeding rates declined and the amount of time the subadult mussels spent with their valves closed increased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin exposures. Glochidia viability did not vary with exposure to drospirenone, but declined at the highest moxifloxacin concentration, resulting in an EC50 of 120 mg/L. Overall, observed sublethal and lethal effects occurred at concentrations which exceed expected environmental concentrations through aqueous exposure, suggesting a low risk to freshwater mussels from these particular PPCPs.

AB Dairy operations have the potential to elevate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in ground water, where it may interact with organic and inorganic contaminants, fuel denitrification, and may present problems for drinking water treatment. Total and percent bioavailable DOC and total and carbon-specific trihalomethane (THM) formation potential (TTHMFP and STHMFP, respectively) were determined for shallow ground water samples from beneath a dairy farm in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Sixteen wells influenced by specific land management areas were sampled over 3 yr. Measured DOC concentrations were significantly elevated over the background as measured at an upgradient monitoring well, ranging from 13 to 55 mg L(-1) in wells downgradient from wastewater ponds, 8 to 30 mg L(-1) in corral wells, 5 to 12 mg L(-1) in tile drains, and 4 to 15 mg L(-1) in wells associated with manured fields. These DOC concentrations were at the upper range or greatly exceeded concentrations in most sur e water bodies used as drinking water sources in California. DOC concentrations in individual wells varied by up to a factor of two over the duration of this study, indicating a dynamic system of sources and degradation. DOC bioavailability over 21 d ranged from 3 to 10%, comparable to surface water systems and demonstrating the potential for dairy-derived DOC to influence dissolved oxygen concentrations (Dearly all wells were hypoxic to anoxic) and denitrification. TTHMFP measurements across all management units ranged from 141 to 1731 mu g L(-1), well in excess of the maximum contaminant level of 80 mu g L(-1) established by the Environmental Protection Agency. STHMFP measurements demonstrated over twofold variation (-4 to -8 mmol total THM/mol DOC) across the management areas, indicating the dependence of reactivity on DOC composition. The results indicate that land management strongly controls the quantity and quality of DOC to reach shallow ground water and hence should be considered when managing ground water resources and in any efforts to mitigate contamination of ground water with carbon-based contaminants, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as personal care products are detected in increasing prevalence in different environmental compartments such as surface water, groundwater and soil. Still little is known about the environmental fate of these substances. The type II antidiabetic drug Metformin has already been detected in different surface waters worldwide, but concentrations were significantly lower than the corresponding predicted environmental concentration (PEC). In human and mammal metabolism so far no metabolites of Metformin have been identified, so the expected environmental concentrations should be very high.
   To assess the aerobic biodegradability of Metformin and the possible formation of degradation products, three Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test series were performed in the present study.
   In the Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D), a screening test that simulates the conditions of an environmental surface water compartment, Metformin was classified as not readily biodegradable (no biodegradation). In the Manometric Respiratory test (OEDC 301 F) working with high bacterial density, Metformin was biodegraded in one of three test bottles to 48.7% and in the toxicity control bottle to 57.5%. In the Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B) using activated sludge, Metformin was biodegraded in both test vessels to an extent of 51.3% and 49.9%, respectively.
   Analysis of test samples by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to multiple stage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) showed in the tests vessels were biodegradation was observed full elimination of Metformin and revealed Guanylurea (Amidinourea, Dicyandiamidine) as single and stable aerobic bacterial degradation product. In another Manometric Respiratory test Guanylurea showed no more transformation. Photodegradation of Guanylurea was also negative.
   A first screening in one of the greatest sewage treatment plant in southern Germany found Metformin with high concentrations (56.8 mu g L-1) in the influent (PEC = 79.8 mu g L-1), but effluent concentration was much lower (0.76 mu g L-1) whereas Guanylurea was detected in a low influent and high effluent concentration (1.86 mu g L-1). These data support the experimental findings in the OECD tests and analytical results of other studies, that Metformin under aerobic conditions can bacterially be degraded to the stable dead-end transformation product Guanylurea.

AB Background: Carotenoids are natural tetraterpene pigments widely utilized in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Currently, chemical synthesis of these compounds outperforms their production inEscherichia colior yeast due to the limited efficiency of the latter. The use of natural microbial carotenoid producers, such as bacteria of the genusParacoccus(Alphaproteobacteria), may help to optimize this process. In order to couple the ability to synthesize these pigments with the metabolic versatility of this genus, we explored the possibility of introducing carotenoid synthesis genes into strains capable of efficient growth on simple low-cost media.
   Results: We constructed two carotenoid-producing strains ofParacoccuscarrying a new plasmid, pCRT01, which contains the carotenoid synthesis gene locuscrtfromParacoccus marcusii OS22. The plasmid was created in vivo via illegitimate recombination betweencrt-carrying vector pABW1 and a natural "paracoccal" plasmid pAMI2. Consequently, the obtained fusion replicon is stably maintained in the bacterial population without the need for antibiotic selection. The introduction of pCRT01 into fast-growing "colorless" strains ofParacoccus aminophilusandParacoccus kondratievaeconverted them into efficient producers of a range of both carotenes and xanthophylls. The exact profile of the produced pigments was dependent on the strain genetic background. To reduce the cost of carotenoid production in this system, we tested the growth and pigment synthesis efficiency of the two strains on various simple media, including raw industrial effluent (coal-fired power plant flue gas desulfurization wastewater) supplemented with molasses, an industrial by-product rich in sucrose.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated a new approach for the construction of carotenoid-producing bacterial strains which relies on a single plasmid-mediated transfer of a pigment synthesis gene locus betweenParacoccusstrains. This strategy facilitates screening for producer strains in terms of synthesis efficiency, pigment profile and ability to grow on low-cost industrial waste-based media, which should increase the cost-effectiveness of microbial production of carotenoids.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in the aquatic compartment due to their continuous release in wastewater effluents or direct dispersal in aquaculture practices raising serious threats to human and environmental health. Erythromycin (ERY) is a macrolide antibiotic widely prescribed in human and veterinary medicine to threat a number of bacterial infections, being consequently found in the aquatic environment. The present work intends to evaluate the sub-lethal effects of ERY on juveniles of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in terms of tissue damage using histochemical staining procedures. Individuals were exposed for 96 h (acute exposure: 0.001-10 mg/L) and 28 days (chronic exposure: 0.05-0.8 mu g/L) to environmentally realistic concentrations of ERY. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to assess O. mykiss gills and liver tissue alterations after exposure to ERY. For both exposures the most common gill changes recorded were progressive (e.g. hypertrophy of mucous cells and hyperplasia of the epithelial cells). However, circulatory (e.g. aneurysms and oedemas) and regressive (e.g. epithelial lifting of lamellae and lamellar fusion) changes were also observed in the acute assay. Gill morphometric analysis revealed to be a good indicator of subtle alterations in gill architecture in agreement with the qualitative scoring system. In liver, regressive (e.g. cytoplasmic vacuolization, pyknotic nucleus and hepatocellular degeneration) and circulatory disturbances (e.g. hemorrhage and increase of sinusoidal space) were the most frequently observed alterations, but only for the acute assay. Furthermore, all histological changes observed contributed to a significant increase in the pathological index for both organs. The current data demonstrate the existence of a direct dose-effect relationship between the exposure to this specific macrolide antibiotic and the histological disorders recorded in different tissues of the exposed fish. The histopathological findings observed in this study may have been the result of several physio-metabolic dysfunctions. However, the observed tissue lesions were of minimal or moderate pathological importance, non-specific and reversible. Further investigation into the cellular mechanism of action of ERY is needed.

AB Bed sediments are the major sink for many contaminants in aquatic environments. With increasing knowledge of and research on the environmental occurrence of antibiotics, there has been growing interest in their behaviour and fate in aquatic environments. However, there is little information about the behaviour of antibiotics in a dynamic water/sediment environment, such as river and coastal marine water. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (1) to study the transport and distribution of four common antibiotics between water and sediment in both dynamic and quiescent water/sediment systems and (2) to understand the persistence and possible degradation of the four antibiotics in the two different systems.
   A lid-driven elongated annular flume, designed to reduce the centrifugal effect, was used to simulate a dynamic water environment. In addition, a quiescent water/sediment experiment was conducted for comparison with the dynamic water system. The seawater and sediment, used in both experiments of flowing and quiescent water/sediment systems, were collected from Victoria Harbour, a dynamic coastal environment in an urban setting. The four antibiotics selected in this study were ofloxacin (OFL), roxithromycin (RTM), erythromycin (ETM), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), the most commonly used antibiotics in South China.
   Antibiotics in an overlying solution decreased very quickly in the flume system due to the sorption to suspended particles and surface sediment. There were significant differences in the adsorption of the four antibiotics in sediment. OFL showed a high tendency to be adsorbed by sediment with a high K (d) value (2980 L/Kg), while the low K (d) values of SMZ indicated that there was a large quantity in water. The four antibiotics reached a depth of 20-30 mm in the sediment over a period of 60 days in the flume system. However, the compounds were only found in surface sediment (above 10 mm) in the quiescent system, indicating the influence of the dynamic flume system on the distribution of antibiotics in sediment. OFL showed a moderate persistence in the dynamic flume system, while other three antibiotics had less persistence in sediment. However, all of the four compounds showed moderate persistence in the quiescent system.
   The study showed the rapid diffusive transfer of antibiotics from water to sediment in the dynamic flume system. The four antibiotics exhibited larger differences in their adsorption to sediment in both dynamic and quiescent systems due to their different K (d) values. The high sorption of antibiotics to marine sediment may reduce their availability to benthic invertebrates.

AB Passive sampling is a well-established tool for monitoring time-weighted average concentrations of polar and semi-polar organic contaminants in streams at flow velocities between 0.1 and 0.4 m s(-1). However, its application under low-flow conditions (10(-5) to 0.01 ms(-1)) - as encountered in hyporheic zones has been scarcely reported.-In this study, 3 novel passive sampler configurations were developed for the monitoring of (semi-)polar organic pollutants and related transformation products across the water sediment interface and thus across varying hydrodynamic conditions. Their design was inspired by Chemcatcher and diffusive gradients in thin films for organics. To determine the most optimal sampler design, an uptake experiment was completed involving the 3 novel passive sampler configurations and a reference Chemcatcher in polar configuration. The experiments consisted of a circular flume that simulated the main channel of a stream and an aquarium with stagnant water that represented the underlying hyporheic zone. The systems were exposed to 192 organic pollutants at environmental concentrations, and the samplers were then collected, extracted and analyzed using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry after 2, 6 and 14 days. The configuration that was most insensitive to different hydrodynamic conditions consisted of a reversed-phase sulfonated styrenedivinylbenzene disk as the receiving phase that was covered by an agarose diffusion gel and topped with a polyethersulfone membrane filter. To further evaluate its environmental application, samplers were installed downstream of a sewage treatment plant located at an urban stream in Berlin, Germany (Erpe). The samplers were mounted on custom-made holders which were subsequently embedded in the stream bed to position samplers above (0.30 m) and within the sediment (-0.15/-0.30/-0.45 m) for 11 days. Target and suspect screening workflows were then applied to identify common concentration patterns and link parent attenuation to transformation product formation. A total of 104 concentration profiles were determined, suggesting the efficiency of the proposed sampling strategy in the water sediment interface. Valsartan acid was the only known transformation product indicative of hyporheic zone-driven attenuation as its concentration in porewater by far exceeded its concentration in surface water. Similar patterns were observed for a larger list of suspected transformation products, of which a sotalol transformation product was tentatively identified. Overall, the established sampling methodology can be effectively used to quantify organic contaminants during low-flow conditions and is suitable for the characterization of attenuation patterns of organic pollutants in hyporheic zones.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is a pharmaceutical acting as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is used to treat depression in humans. Fluoxetine and the major active metabolite norfluoxetine (NFLX) are released to aquatic systems via sewage-treatment effluents. They have been found to bioconcentrate in wild fish, raising concerns over potential endocrine disrupting effects. The objective of this study was to determine effects of waterborne FLX, including environmental concentrations, on the reproductive axis in sexually mature male goldfish. We initially cloned the goldfish serotonin transporter to investigate tissue and temporal expression of the serotonin transporter, the FLX target, in order to determine target tissues and sensitive exposure windows. Sexually mature male goldfish, which showed the highest levels of serotonin transporter expression in the neuroendocrine brain, were exposed to FLX at 0.54 mu g/L and 54 mu g/L in a 14-d exposure before receiving vehicle or sex pheromone stimulus consisting of either 4.3 nM 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one (17,20P) or 3 nM prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)). Reproductive endpoints assessed included gonadosomatic index, milt volume, and blood levels of the sex steroids testosterone and estradiol. Neuroendocrine function was investigated by measuring blood levels of luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, pituitary gene expression of luteinizing hormone, growth hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and neuroendocrine brain expression of isotocin and vasotocin. To investigate changes at the gonadal level of the reproductive axis, testicular gene expression of the gonadotropin receptors, both the luteinizing hormone receptor and the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, were measured as well as expression of the growth hormone receptor. To investigate potential impacts on spermatogenesis, testicular gene expression of the spermatogenesis marker vasa was measured and histological samples of testis were analyzed qualitatively. Estrogen indices were measured by expression and activity analysis of gonadal aromatase, as well as liver expression analysis of the estrogenic marker, esr1. After 14d, basal milt volume significantly decreased at 54 mu g/L FLX while pheromone-stimulated milt volume decreased at 0.54 mu g/L and 54 mu g/L FLX. Fluoxetine (54 mu g/L) inhibited both basal and pheromone-stimulated testosterone levels. Significant concentration-dependent reductions in follicle-stimulating hormone and isotocin expression were observed with FLX in the 17,20P- and PGF(2)alpha-stimulated groups, respectively. Estradiol levels and expression of esr1 concentration-dependently increased with FLX. This study demonstrates that FLX disrupts reproductive physiology of male fish at environmentally relevant concentrations, and potential mechanisms are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and related metabolites are not efficiently removed in sewage treatment plants and enter into surface water. There, they might be subject of drinking water abstraction and treatment by ozonation. In this study, a systematic approach for producing and effect-based testing of transformation products (TPs) during the drinking water ozonation process is proposed. For this, two pharmaceutical parent substances, three metabolites and one environmental degradation product were investigated with respect to their biodegradability and fate during drinking water ozonation. The Ames test (TA98, TA100) was used for the identification of mutagenic activity present in the solutions after testing inherent biodegradability and/or after ozonation of the samples. Suspicious results were complemented with the umu test. Due to the low substrate concentration required for ozonation, all ozonated samples were concentrated via solid phase extraction (SPE) before performing the Ames test. With the exception of piracetam, all substances were only incompletely biodegradable, suggesting the formation of stable TPs. Metformin, piracetam and guanylurea could not be removed completely by the ozonation process. We received some evidence that technical TPs are formed by ozonation of metformin and piracetam, whereas all tested metabolites were not detectable by analytical means after ozonation. In the case of guanylurea, one ozonation TP was identified by LC/MS. None of the experiments showed an increase of mutagenic effects in the Ames test. However, the SPE concentration procedure might lead to false-positive results due to the generation of mutagenic artefacts or might lead to false-negative results by missing adequate recovery efficiency. Thus, these investigations should always be accompanied by process blank controls that are carried out along the whole ozonation and SPE procedure. The study presented here is a first attempt to investigate the significance of transformation products by a systematic approach. However, the adequacy and sensitivity of the methodology need to be further investigated. The approach of combining biodegradation and ozonation with effect-based assays is a promising tool for the early detection of potential hazards from TPs as drinking water contaminants. It can support the strategy for the evaluation of substances and metabolites in drinking water. A multitude of possible factors which influence the results have to be carefully considered, among them the selectivity and sensibility of the mutagenicity test applied, the extraction method for concentrating the relevant compounds and the biocompatibility of the solvent. Therefore, the results have to be carefully interpreted, and possible false-negative and false-positive results should be considered.

AB Citalopram is an antidepressant drug, which acts by inhibiting the re-uptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic nerve ending. It is one of the most common drugs used in treatment of depression, it is highly lipophilic and frequently found in sewage treatment plant effluents and surface waters around the world. Citalopram and other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have, at concentrations that occur in nature, been shown to have behavioural as well as physiological effects on fish and other animals. This study is the result of several different experiments, intended to analyse different aspects of behavioural effects of chronic citalopram exposure in fish. Our model species the three-spine stickleback is common in the entire northern hemisphere and is considered to be a good environmental sentinel species. Female three-spine sticklebacks were exposed to 0, 1.5 and 15 mu g/l nominal concentrations of citalopram for 21 days and subjected to the novel tank (NT) diving test. In the NT test, the fish exposed to 1.5 mu g/l, but not the 15 mu g/l fish made a significantly higher number of transitions to the upper half and stayed there for significantly longer time than the fish exposed to 0 mu g/l. The 15 mu g/l group, however, displayed a significantly lower number of freeze bouts and a shorter total freezing time. The test for locomotor activity included in the NT test showed that fish treated with 1.5 and 15 mu g/l displayed a significantly higher swimming activity than control fish both 5-7 and 15-17 min after the start of the experiment. In the next experiment we compared fish exposed to 1.5 mu g/l and 0.15 mu g/l to pure water controls with regard to shoaling intensity and found no effect of treatment. In the final experiment the propensity of fish treated with 1.5 mu g/l to approach an unknown object and aggressive behaviour was investigated using the Novel Object test and a mirror test, respectively. The exposed fish ventured close to the unknown object significantly more often and stayed there for significantly longer time than unexposed fish. The aggression test yielded no statistically significant effects. It is concluded that citalopram changes the behaviour of the three-spine stickleback in a way that is likely to have ecological consequences and that it must not be considered an environmentally safe pharmaceutical.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are an emerging concern because of the large amount of PPCPs that is discharged and its potential ecological effects on the aquatic environment. Chlorination has proven efficient for removing some aromatic PPCPs from wastewater, but the formation of by-products has not been thoroughly investigated partly because of analytical difficulties. This study developed a method for systematically screening and identifying the transformation products (TPs) of multiple aromatic PPCPs through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We spiked an environmentally relevant concentration (5000 ng/L) of three anti-inflammatory drugs, four parabens, bisphenol A, oxybenzone, and triclosan in the Milli-Q water and water containing natural organic matter (NOM). Low-dose chlorination (0.2-0.7 mg/L) was performed. We compared the chemical profiles of the chlorinated and untreated water and selected the ions to be identified based on the results of t-test and the ratio of signal intensities. Compound matching and isotopic pattern comparison were applied to characterising the molecular formulae of TPs. The fragmentation of the PPCPs and TPs was used in elucidating the structures of the TPs. The confirmation of TPs was achieved by comparing the retention time and fragment patterns of TPs with the isomer standards. In the chlorinated water, the aromatic PPCPs were substantially removed, except for the anti-inflammatory drugs (removal rates -5.2%-26%). Even with moderate chlorine dosages, all of the aromatic PPCPs, except for acetylsalicylic acid, were transformed into chlorinated derivatives in the Milli-Q water, and so were some PPCPs in the NOM-added water. The results of structure elucidation and compound confirmation as well as the increases in log K-ow suggested that chlorination could transform aromatic PPCPs into more persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic TPs. The presence of these TPs in the effluents where the PPCPs are removed through chlorination may pose increased risks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of 26 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were evaluated in 68 water samples in 2011-2012 in the Zumbro River watershed, Minnesota, U.S.A. Samples were collected across a range of seasonal/hydrological conditions from four stream sites that varied in associated land use and presence of an upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Selected CECs included human/veterinary pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, phytoestrogens, and commercial/industrial compounds. Detection frequencies and concentrations varied, with atrazine, metolachlor, acetaminophen, caffeine, DEET, and trimethoprim detected in more than 70% of samples, acetochlor, mecoprop, carbamazepine, and daidzein detected in 30%-50% of samples, and 4-nonylphenol, cotinine, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, tylosin, and carbaryl detected in 10%-30% of samples. The remaining target CECs were not detected in water samples. Three land use-associated trends were observed for the detected CECs. Carbamazepine, 4-nonylphenol, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, tylosin, and carbaryl profiles were WWTP-dominated, as demonstrated by more consistent loading and significantly greater concentrations downstream of the WWTP and during low-flow seasons. In contrast, acetaminophen, trimethoprim, DEET, caffeine, cotinine, and mecoprop patterns demonstrated both seasonally-variable non-WWTP-associated and continual WWTP-associated influences. Surface water studies of CECs often target areas near WWTPs. This study suggests that several CECs often characterized as effluent-associated have additional important sources such as septic systems or land-applied biosolids. Finally, agricultural herbicide ( atrazine, acetochlor, and metolachlor) profiles were strongly influenced by agricultural land use and seasonal application-runoff, evident by significantly greater concentrations and loadings at upstream sites and in early summer when application and precipitation rates are greatest. Our results indicate that CEC monitoring studies should consider a range of land uses, seasonality, and transport pathways in relation to concentrations and loadings. This knowledge can augment CEC monitoring programs to result in more accurate source, occurrence, and ecological risk characterizations, more precisely targeted mitigation initiatives, and ultimately, enhanced environmental decision-making.

AB N-nitrosamines are a group of potent human carcinogens that can be formed during oxidative treatment of drinking water and wastewater. Many tertiary and quaternary amines present in consumer products (e.g., pharmaceuticals, personal care and household products) are known to be N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors during chloramination, but the formation of other N-nitrosamines has been rarely studied. This study investigates the specific and total N-nitrosamine (TONO) formation potential (FP) of various precursors from nitrogen-containing micropollutants (chlorhexidine, metformin, benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) and tertiary and quaternary model amines (trimethyl amine, N,N-dimethylbutyl amine, N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine and tetramethyl ammonium). All the studied nitrogenous micropollutants displayed quantifiable TONO FP, with molar yields in the range 0.04-11.92%. However, the observed TONO pools constituted mostly of uncharacterized species, not included in US-EPA 8270 N-nitrosamines standard mix. Only the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride showed quantifiable NDMA FP (0.56% molar yield), however, explaining only a minor fraction of the observed TONO FP. The studied model amines showed molar NDMA yields from 0.10% (trimethyl amine) to 5.05% (N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine), very similar to the molar TONO yields. The comparison of the FPs of micropollutants and model compounds showed that the presence of electron donating functional groups (such as a benzyl group) in tertiary and quaternary amine precursors leads to a higher formation of NDMA and uncharacterized N-nitrosamines, respectively. LC-qTOF screening of a list of proposed N-nitrosamine structures has enabled to identify a novel N-nitrosamine (N-nitroso-N-methyldodecylamine) from the chloramination of benzalkonium chloride. This finding supports the hypothesis that different functional groups in quaternary amines can act as leaving groups during chloramination and form differing N-nitrosamine structures at significant yield. Molar TONO yields determined for micropollutants were finally validated under experimental conditions closer to real water matrices, confirming their representativeness also for lower concentration ranges.

AB The frequent detection of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in wastewater and surface waters gives rise of concerns about their ecotoxicological, effects and potential risks to induce antibacterial resistant genes. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/PDS) advanced oxidation processes have been demonstrated to be effective for the elimination of SMX, but there is still a need for a deeper understanding of product formations. In this study, we identified and compared the transformation products of SMX in UV, UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS processes. Because of the electrophilic nature of SO4 center dot-, the second-order rate constant for the reaction of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) with the anionic form of SMX was higher than that with the neutral form, while hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) exhibited comparable reactivity to both forms. The direct photolysis of SMX predominately occurred through cleavage of the N-S bond, rearrangement of the isoxazole ring, and hydroxylation mechanisms. Hydroxylation was the dominant pathway for the reaction of center dot OH with SMX. SO4 center dot- favored attack on -NH2 group of SMX to generate a nitro derivative and dimeric products. The presence of bicarbonate in UV/H2O2 inhibited the formation of hydroxylated products, but promoted the formation of the nitro derivative and the dimeric products. In UV/PDS, bicarbonate increased the formation of the nitro derivative and the dimeric products, but decreased the formation of the hydroxylated dimeric products. The different effect of bicarbonate on transformation products in UV/H2O2 vs. UV/PDS suggested that carbonate radical (CO3 center dot-) oxidized SMX through the electron transfer mechanism similar to SO4 center dot- but with less oxidation capacity. Additionally, SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot- exhibited higher reactivity to the oxazole ring than the isoxazole ring of SMX. Ecotoxicity of transformation products was estimated by ECOSAR program based on the quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis as well as by experiments using Vibrio fischeri, and these results indicated that the oxidation of SO4 center dot- or CO3 center dot- with SMX generated more toxic products than those of (OH)-O-center dot.

AB The main objective of this work was the development and characterization of sustainable electro-responsive ionic liquid-based cationic copolymers. For this purpose degradable semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (s-IPNs) based on starch and on ion-conducting cationic copolymers of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazohum chloride (BVImCI), cross-linked with N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA), were synthesized by following principles of green chemistry. Cross-linked poly(HEMA-co-BVImCl) copolymers were also prepared for comparison. The resulting cationic hydrogels (copolymer and s-IPNs) were characterized in terms of their physicochemical, thermomechanical, morphological, and electrochemical properties, as well as in terms of cell viability and proliferation against fibroblast cells. Furthermore, the electro- assisted sorption/release capacity of the prepared hydrogels toward i-tryptophan (used as a model biomolecule) was also studied at different applied DC voltages (0, 2, 5, and 100 V). Results demonstrated that the properties of the synthesized hydrogels can be tuned, depending on their relative chemical composition, presenting electronic conductivity and ionic conductivity values in the 0.1 to 5.2 S cm(-1) range, and complex shear modulus in the 0.6 to 6.4 MPa range. The sorption/ release capacity of the s-IPNs after 3 h at 25 degrees C can also be modulated between 2.5 and 70% and 4.5 and 40%, depending on the applied DC voltage and/or sorption/release medium. Finally, none of the synthesized cationic hydrogels induced fibroblast cells lysis, although s-IPNs had a lower impact on cell proliferation than poly(HEMA-co-BVImCl) copolymers, indicating a favorable effect of starch on the biocompatibility of the synthesized s-IPNs. The designed cationic hydrogels could be useful for the development of efficient, stable, degradable and cheaper soft and multiresponsive platforms with potential applications in bioseparation processes, wastewater treatment systems (e.g., pharmaceutical), biomedical devices (e.g., sustained delivery of specific charged-biomolecules), and nonleaching electrochemical devices.

AB Numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) typically occur in urban rivers. Wastewater effluents are a major source of many CECs. Urban runoff (stormwater) is a major urban water budget component and may constitute another major CEC pathway. Yet, stormwater-based CEC field studies are rare. This research investigated 384 CECs in 36 stormwater samples in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. Nine sampling sites included three large stormwater conveyances (pipes) and three paired iron enhanced sand filters (IESFs; untreated inlets and treated outlets). The 123 detected compounds included commercial-consumer compounds, veterinary and human pharmaceuticals, lifestyle and personal care compounds, pesticides, and others. Thirty-one CECs were detected in >= 50% of samples. Individual samples contained a median of 35 targeted CECs (range: 18-54). Overall, median concentrations were >= 10 ng/L for 25 CECs and >= 100 ng/L for 9 CECs. Ranked, hierarchical linear modeling indicated significant seasonal- and site type-based concentration variability for 53 and 30 CECs, respectively, with observed patterns corresponding to CEC type, source, usage, and seasonal hydrology. A primarily warm weather, diffuse, runoff-based profile included many herbicides. A second profile encompassed winter and/or late summer samples enriched with some recalcitrant, hydrophobic compounds (e.g., PAHs), especially at pipes, suggesting conservative, less runoff-dependent sources (e.g., sediments). A third profile, indicative of mixed conservative/non-runoff, runoff, and/or atmospheric sources and transport that collectively affect a variety of conditions, included various fungicides, lifestyle, non-prescription, and commercial-consumer CECs. Generally, pipe sites had large, diverse land-use catchments, and showed more frequent detections of diverse CECs, but often at lower concentrations; while untreated sites (with smaller, more residential-catchments) demonstrated greater detections of "pseudo-persistent" and other ubiquitous or residentially-associated CECs. Although untreated stormwater transports an array of CECs to receiving waters, IESF treatment significantly removed concentrations of 14 (29%) of the 48 most detected CECs; for these, median removal efficiencies were 26%-100%. Efficient removal of some hydrophobic (e.g., PAHs, bisphenol A) and polar-hydrophilic (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) compounds indicated particulate-bound contaminant filtration and for certain dissolved contaminants, sorption.

AB The occurrence, fate, seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of four selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, were studied in 15 different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Portugal. Influent and effluent samples from four sampling campaigns, in 2013, were extracted through Oasis HLB cartridges, and quantified through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Results showed that citalopram was the SSRI most frequently found, both in influents and in effluents, with mean mass loads ranging between 14.56 and 9.51 mg/day/1000 inhabitants, respectively. Fluoxetine and sertraline were only detected in influent samples, in lower mean mass loads (14.60 and 1.36 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively), whereas paroxetine was found in influent and effluent samples (12.61 and 18.90 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). WWTPs were not capable of completely removing these pharmaceuticals; nonetheless, the mean removal efficiency was 82.24%. Removal efficiency was lower in winter (74.21%), summer (72.02%), and autumn (81.19%), when compared to spring (100%).
   Our results translate the variations in SSRI prescription and use between the five Portuguese regions in study. Influent contaminated samples were found in WWTPs from Lisbon, Alentejo, Center and North (28.25, 19.01, 16.55 and 6.98 mg/day/1000 inhab., respectively). In the Algarve region no contaminated samples were found. A seasonal pattern in the presence of SSRIs in influent wastewaters was observed. The SSRIs mass loads in influent wastewaters were higher in autumn, followed by spring, winter, and summer.
   Finally, the potential ecotoxicological risk posed by SSRIs to different trophic levels of aquatic organisms, exposed to the effluent wastewaters studied was evaluated by means of risk quotients (RQ). Citalopram and paroxetine, the only SSRIs found in these samples, presented RQ lower than 1. According to the results, algae appeared to be the most sensitive followed by fish and daphnids.

AB In this study, elsmoreite/tungsten oxide is used to form a heterojunction with ZnS-containing industrial waste. The effect of the elsmoreite/tungsten oxide content on photocatalytic activity of ZnS using the different ratios of ZnS:Na2WO4 in the synthesis solution is estimated. The initial ZnS:Na2WO4 ratio leads to the formation of hexagonal WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O on the surface of ZnS. A further increase in the ZnS:Na2WO4 ratio results in the domination of cubic WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O over hexagonal WO3. The ultraviolet visible (UV Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra of elsmoreite/tungsten oxide@ZnS composite photocatalysts show that the absorption onset shifts monotonously towards lower wavelengths from 450 nm to 400 nm. The microrods of hexagonal WO3 and {111}-truncated submicron-sized crystals of WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O are grown on the ZnS surface. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirm the formation of a heterojunction between elsmoreite/tungsten oxide and ZnS. The photocatalytic activities of elsmoreite/tungsten oxide@ZnS composite photocatalysts are evaluated for the degradation of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs): metoprolol - Mt, triclosan - TCS, and caffeine CAF both in single and in mixture solutions. The elsmoreite/tungsten oxide@ZnS photocatalysts degrade 50% of Mt, 70% TCS, and 60% CAF in single solution and 35% of Mt, 20% of CAF, and 20% of TCS in mixture solution. Hydrated Mt and TCS are preferably adsorbed on the surface of WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O (111), and CAF has better affinity to the surface of WO3. The elsmoreite/tungsten oxide@ZnS photocatalysts show a good reusability. Hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and photogenerated holes (h(+)) are involved in the photocatalytic removal of Mt, while only h(+) is involved in the photocatalytic removal of TCS. Interestingly, none of the above-mentioned species is involved in the photocatalytic removal of CAF. Also, nontoxic CAF is mainly degraded into intermediates with higher toxicity. The toxicity of the photocatalytically treated model wastewater in the mixture solution, tested with Vibrio fischeri, is much lower than that in the single solution.

AB Most of the projected global population increases will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, the various water uses (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, environmental protection, and economics are key factors. More storage of water behind dams and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground as groundwater, its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and other sources and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. In irrigated areas, groundwater levels may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well systems to prevent waterlogging and salinization of soil. Salty drainage waters must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This "virtual" water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social, ecological, or economic returns or saved for the future. Climate changes in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emission are difficult to predict in space and time. Resulting uncertainties require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surpluses, water shortages, and weather extremes. Long-term storage behind dams and in aquifers may be required. Rising sea levels will present problems in coastal areas.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) is often considered to efficiently remove polar trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from lotic systems, mitigating potential adverse effects of TrOCs on ecosystem functioning and drinking water production. Predicting the fate of TrOCs in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult as the in-situ removal rate constants are not known and the biogeochemical factors as well as hydrological conditions controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine the in-situ removal efficiency of the HZ for a variety of TrOCs as a function of the biogeochemical milieu, we conducted a field study in an urban river near Berlin, Germany. Subsurface flow was studied by time series of temperature depth profiles and the biogeochemical milieu of the HZ by concentration depth profiles. These results, in conjunction with a 1D advection-dispersion transport model, were used to calculate first-order removal rate constants of several polar TrOCs in the HZ. For the majority of TrOCs investigated, removal rate constants were strongly dependent on redox conditions, with significantly higher removal rates observed under predominantly suboxic (i.e. denitrifying) compared to anoxic (i.e. Fe and Mn reducing) conditions. Compared to previous studies on the fate of TrOCs in saturated sediments, half-lives within oxic/suboxic sections of the HZ were relatively low, attributable to the site-specific characteristics of the HZ in a stream dominated by wastewater treatment plant effluent. For nine out of thirteen investigated TrOCs, concentrations decreased significantly in the HZ with relative removal percentages ranging from 32% for primidone to 77% for gabapentin. For many TrOCs, removal efficiency decreased drastically as redox conditions became anoxic. For the majority of compounds investigated here, the HZ indeed acts as an efficient bioreactor that is capable of removing TrOCs along relatively short flow paths. Depending on the TrOC, removal capacity may be enhanced by either increasing the magnitude of groundwater-surface exchange fluxes, by increasing the total residence time in the HZ or the exposure time to suboxic zones, respectively.

AB The metabolic diversity present in microbial communities enables cooperation toward accomplishing more complex tasks than possible by a single organism. Members of a consortium communicate by exchanging metabolites or signals that allow them to coordinate their activity through division of labor. In contrast with monocultures, evidence suggests that microbial consortia self-organize to form spatial patterns, such as observed in biofilms or in soil aggregates, that enable them to respond to gradient, to improve resource interception and to exchange metabolites more effectively. Current biotechnological applications of microorganisms remain rudimentary, often relying on genetically engineeredmonocultures (e.g., pharmaceuticals) ormixed-cultures of partially known composition (e.g., wastewater treatment), yet the vast potential of "microbial ecological power" observed in most natural environments, remains largely underused. In line with the Unified Microbiome Initiative (UMI) which aims to "discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems," we propose in this concept paper to capitalize on ecological insights into the spatial and modular design of interlinked microbial consortia that would overcome limitations of natural systems and attempt to optimize the functionality of the members and the performance of the engineered consortium. The topology of the spatial connections linking the various members and the regulated fluxes of media between those modules, while representing a major engineering challenge, would allow the microbial species to interact. The modularity of such spatially linked microbial consortia (SLMC) could facilitate the design of scalable bioprocesses that can be incorporated as parts of a larger biochemical network. By reducing the need for a compatible growth environment for all species simultaneously, SLMC will dramatically expand the range of possible combinations of microorganisms and their potential applications. We briefly review existing tools to engineer such assemblies and optimize potential benefits resulting from the collective activity of their members. Prospective microbial consortia and proposed spatial configurations will be illustrated and preliminary calculations highlighting the advantages of SLMC over co-cultures will be presented, followed by a discussion of challenges and opportunities for moving forward with some designs.

AB Mercury is a longstanding concern in Maritime Canada due to high levels of contamination in a number of fish and bird species. The recycled component of past releases of anthropogenic mercury may be a significant source of ongoing pollution in many areas. Historical information on mercury releases can be used to quantify past and present anthropogenic contamination. We present an inventory of historical mercury emissions from anthropogenic sources in Maritime Canada for the years 1800-1995. Long-term trends in mercury emissions and the significance of the cumulative burden of mercury released from local sources are discussed. Emissions are calculated using both historical monitoring data and the application of emission factors. The nature of current anthropogenic sources of mercury is quite different than it was several decades ago when many of the existing policies governing mercury pollution were created. Our inventory illustrates that many of the most significant sources in the past such as the chlor-alkali industry, paint containing mercury additives, and pharmaceuticals, have been largely phased out with fossil fuel combustion and waste disposal remaining as the most significant modern sources. Atmospheric emissions in Maritime Canada peaked in 1945 (> 1750 kg year(-1)), and again between 1965 and 1970 (> 2600 kg year(-1)). Cumulative releases of mercury from anthropogenic sources for the years 1800-1995 were between 115 and 259 t to the atmosphere alone, and 327-448 t when discharges to wastewater and effluents were included. Assuming that only 0.2% (Nriagu, 1994.) of these releases become part of the recycled fraction of current fluxes, we estimate that between 570 and 900 kg Hg year(-1) is deposited in Maritime Canada from past anthropogenic sources. Modern sources within Maritime Canada contribute at least 405 kg year(-1) to the total annual deposition of 1.71 t over the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, leaving similar to 735 kg year(-1) from natural sources and long-range contamination. Further study is needed to verify these estimates and clarify the significance of natural and long-range sources of mercury in Maritime Canada. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are biologically active molecules that may exert toxic effects to a wide range of aquatic organisms. They are considered contaminants of emerging concern due to their common presence in wastewaters and in the receiving surface waters, and the lack of specific regulations to monitor their environmental occurrence and risks. In this work, the environmental exposure and risks of pharmaceuticals have been studied in the Mijares River, Eastern Mediterranean coast (Spain). A total of 57 surface water samples from 19 sampling points were collected in three monitoring campaigns between June 2018 and February 2019. A list of 40 compounds was investigated using a quantitative target UHPLC-MS/MS method. In order to complement the data obtained, a wide-scope screening of pharmaceuticals and metabolites was also performed by UHPLC-HRMS. The ecological risks posed by the pharmaceutical mixtures were evaluated using species sensitivity distributions built with chronic toxicity data for aquatic organisms. In this study, up to 69 pharmaceuticals and 9 metabolites were identified, out of which 35 compounds were assessed using the quantitative method. The highest concentrations in water corresponded to acetaminophen, gabapentin, venlafaxine, valsartan, ciprofloxacin and diclofenac. The compounds that were found to exert the highest toxic pressure on the aquatic ecosystems were principally analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics. These were: phenazone > azithromycin > diclofenac, and to a lower extent norfloxacin > ciprofloxacin > clarithromycin. The monitored pharmaceutical mixtures are expected to exert severe ecological risks in areas downstream of WWTP discharges, with the percentage of aquatic species affected ranging between 65% and 82% in 3 out of the 19 evaluated sites. In addition, five antibiotics were found to exceed antibiotic resistance thresholds, thus potentially contributing to resistance gene enrichment in environmental bacteria. This work illustrates the wide use and impact of pharmaceuticals in the area under study, and the vulnerability of surface waters if only conventional wastewater treatments are applied. Several compounds included in this study should be incorporated in future water monitoring programs to help in the development of future regulations, due to their potential risk to the aquatic environment.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF) in a mesocosm two-stage constructed wetland system consisting of a subsurface-flow bed (first stage; CW-1) and a surface-flow system (second stage; CW-2) with an emphasis on the effect of artificial aeration as a potential performance intensification option. Furthermore, the additional aim was to identify the transformation products of DCF and SMX along the flow path of the treatment system. This two-stage system was fed for 442 days with an artificial municipal wastewater containing DCF and SMX at a concentration of 2 mg/L each. The removal of SMX in the CW-1 was found to be significantly higher under non-aerated conditions ( > 77%) as compared to aerated conditions (26%), but the aeration of the CW-2 was insignificant for the SMX removal. In contrast, the removal of DCF was not affected by aeration in the CW-1 (removal efficiency of approximately 50%), but was significantly positively influenced by the combined effect of plants and aeration in the CW-2. The overall removal of SMX and DCF in the two-stage system was 95.8% and 77.6%, respectively. The transformation products of SMX and DCF detected in the studied system indicated the potential contribution of both oxic and anoxic transformation pathways, potentially including also abiotic reaction between SMX and Fe(II) leading to the cleavage of the isoxazole ring in this compound. Some of the transformation products found in the CW-1 were not further detected in the CW-2. Based on the literature data the antimicrobial activity and potential activity of the identified transformation products cannot be ruled out. Giant miscanthus growing in the CW-1 was unaffected by the high concentrations of DCF and SMX in contrast to the emergent macrophytes (on the floating island) or the free-floating plants present in the CW-2, which failed to adapt to the presence of the pharmaceuticals. As a result, the CW-2 was colonized by an unidentified species of a water moss and algae.

AB Ag2S-ZnO@rGO core-shell structured microspheres were prepared through a very simple, novel and green in-situ method using dimethyl sulfoxide as both the solvent and sulfur S source at low temperature (140 degrees C). The photocatalytic performance of synthesized samples was tested for degradation of acetaminophen (ACT) under visible light irradiation. ACT removal efficiency was directly depended on the GO-level in composite and the maximum photocatalytic yield was achieved for the sample with GO concentration of 0.2 g/L. Formation of Ag2S in the nanocomposite was confirmed using XRD, XPS and UV-Vis DRS and photoluminescence (PL) measurement. XRD patterns pointed to the existence of a wurtzite structure for all samples and by silver loading, Ag2S peaks were visualized in the XRD patterns, with increased intensity by rising the Ag content in the solution precursor. EDS and XPS data indicated the presence of sulfur and silver in the form of Ag+ and S2-. A considerable red shift in absorption edge and reduce in PL emission peak intensity was observed over the introduction of Ag in the precursor solution due to the existence of Ag2S. The Ag2S-ZnO@rGO composites indicated enhanced photocatalytic performance toward degradation of ACT under visible light compared to bare ZnO and ZnO@rGO. The underlying mechanism has been investigated based on the results of UV-Vis DRS, PL and reactive species scavenging experiments. The improved photocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to better light harvesting and increased photogenerated electron-hole separation. Ag2S play an important role in the composite due to the synergistic effect of Ag2S and rGO, which not only improve the light harvesting but also reduce the charge recombination. The as-made catalyst indicated a great potential for recycling, suggesting the potentially large-scale applications of prepared catalyst for emerging water contaminants and wastewater treatment. The cytotoxicity of untreated and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-treated ACT solutions was evaluated using the cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, which revealed that ACT solution in the developed PCO system could be significantly detoxified.

AB Wastewater effluents increase the nutrient load of receiving streams while introducing a myriad of anthropogenic chemical pollutants that challenge the resident aquatic (micro)biota. Disentangling the effects of both kind of stressors and their potential interaction on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities requires highly controlled manipulative experiments. In this work, we investigated the effects of a combined regime of nutrients (at low, medium and high concentrations) and a mixture of emerging contaminants (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, and methylparaben) on the bacterial composition, abundance and antibiotic resistance profile of biofilms grown in artificial streams. In particular, we investigated the effect of this combined stress on genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnrS), erythromycin (ermB), sulfamethoxazole (sul1 and sul2) as well as the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1). Only genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and intI1 gene were detected in all treatments during the study period. Besides, bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants showed higher copy numbers of sul1 and intI1 genes than those not exposed, whereas nutrient amendments did not affect their abundance. However, bacterial communities exposed to both emerging contaminants and a high nutrient concentration (1, 25 and 1 mg L-1 of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, respectively) showed the highest increase on the abundance of sul1 and intI1 genes thus suggesting a factors synergistic effect of both stressors. Since none of the treatments caused a significant change on the composition of bacterial communities, the enrichment of sul1 and intI1 genes within the community was caused by their dissemination under the combined pressure exerted by nutrients and emerging contaminants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the contribution of nutrients on the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in streambed biofilms under controlled conditions. Our results also highlight that nutrients could enhance the effect of emerging contaminants on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various three-dimensional (3D) flower-like nanostructures of ZnO were synthesized by following a facile and low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis approach, using Zn(CH3COO)(2)center dot 2H(2)O as the starting precursor reagent, in the presence of different bases at varying concentrations as the structure-directing reagents. BET studies indicated that the ZnO-flowers 1 were more superior than ZnO-flowers 2 and 3, as it possessed the highest specific surface area (10.83 m(2)/g), pore volume (0.054 cm(3)/g) and pore size (23.52 nm). Subsequently, the photoactivities of ZnO-flowers on the degradation of emerging salicylic acid micropollutant under UV-A illumination were examined. Batch studies suggested that the ZnO-flowers were photoactive and photocatalysed optimally under neutral pH condition that are aligned with the cost-effective and practical implementation for water/wastewater treatment. ZnO-flowers 1 demonstrated the highest photoactivity according to its reaction rate constant, where the kinetics data was well-fitted using the pseudo-first order Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equation. This finding was well correlated to the BET studies, where the high photoactivity in ZnO-flowers 1 could be ascribed to its exceptional surface morphology that maximises the surface contact area with salicylic acid during photodegradation. Finally, the radicals trapping experiments were carried out in order to validate the role of primary photogenerated holes (h(+)) and various secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the photodegradation of salicylic acid using ZnO-flowers photocatalysts. It was confirmed that the active species of photogenerated h(+), center dot OH, and center dot O-2(-) were responsible for the photodegradation process. The plausible mechanistic pathways for the reaction between scavenging reagents and the reactive transitory species to form by-products and intermediates were also proposed.

AB A nanoheterojunction photocatalyst of the spherical titanium dioxide (TSN) over ZSM5 mesoporous was synthesized by the ecofriendly direct co-template technique with assisting of the solvent evaporation to photodegrade harmful Cefazolin compound from drinking water under simulated solar light illumination. The fabricated nanoheterojunction photocatalyst shown an efficient performance by a near-complete degrade of Cefazolin compound with an estimated efficiency of 98.5% under optimum conditions. Many parameters were considered in details, including pH solution, catalyst loading, kinetic studies, initial concentrations, optical bandgap, intermediate compounds, regeneration and the reusability. The prepared TSN@ ZSM-5 mesoporous was effectively activated in the weak acid pH region of 6.5. The data results revealed that a remarkable photodegradation of Cefazolin on the spherical TiO2 nanoparticles enhanced by the cylindrical hollow of the ZSM-5 mesoporous, which has a preferable as photogenerated delivery of the e(-)/h(+) reducing the recombination rate. High specific surface area with wide pore volume of 360 m(2) g(-1) & 0.42 cm(3) g(-1), respectively, enhanced the absorbance capacity of Cefazolin compound. The maximum absorption capacity was 1.24 mg/g under the optimum conditions. Moreover, a magnificent optical bandgap of the synthesized TSN@ ZSM-5 mesoporous was obtained. The prepared nanoheterojunction photocatalyst is well conformable the pseudo second order model and it has a high correlation coefficient of R-square is 0.9869. The data were also given by the fact that the Cefazolin compound was highly degraded with the assisting of the superoxide specie including anion radical of the .O-2(-). The Cefazolin and their intermediate compounds were decomposed to less noxious compound using the synthesized TSN@ ZSM-5 mesoporous. Although many cycles of use, the nanoheterojuncation photocatalyst was maintained its high performance with excellent durability. According to the overall results, the proposed nanoheterojunction photocatalyst can have a potential credit for participating in the wastewater treatment plant to get rid of the risk effects of the medical waste in the aqueous media.

AB Since the early 1920s, the intensive use of antibiotics has led to the contamination of the aquatic environment through diffuse sources and wastewater effluents. The antibiotics commonly found in surface waters include sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), which belong to the class of sulfonamides, the oldest antibiotic class still in use. These antibiotics have been detected in all European surface waters with median concentrations of around 50 ng L-1 and peak concentrations of up to 4-6 mu g L-1. Sulfonamides are known to inhibit bacterial growth by altering microbial production of folic acid, but sub-lethal doses may trigger antimicrobial resistance, with unknown consequences for exposed microbial communities. We investigated the effects of two environmentally relevant concentrations (500 and 5,000 ng L-1) of SMZ and SMX on microbial activity and structure of periphytic biofilms in stream mesocosms for 28 days. Measurement of sulfonamides in the mesocosms revealed contamination levels of about half the nominal concentrations. Exposure to sulfonamides led to slight, transitory effects on heterotrophic functions, but persistent effects were observed on the bacterial structure. After 4 weeks of exposure, sulfonamides also altered the autotrophs in periphyton and particularly the diversity, viability and cell integrity of the diatom community. The higher concentration of SMX tested decreased both diversity (Shannon index) and evenness of the diatom community. Exposure to SMZ reduced diatom species richness and diversity. The mortality of diatoms in biofilms exposed to sulfonamides was twice that in non-exposed biofilms. SMZ also induced an increase in diatom teratologies from 1.1% in non-exposed biofilms up to 3% in biofilms exposed to SMZ. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the teratological effects of sulfonamides on diatoms within periphyton. The increase of both diatom growth rate and mortality suggests a high renewal of diatoms under sulfonamide exposure. In conclusion, our study shows that sulfonamides can alter microbial community structures and diversity at concentrations currently present in the environment, with unknown consequences for the ecosystem. The experimental set-up presented here emphasizes the interest of using natural communities to increase the ecological realism of ecotoxicological studies and to detect potential toxic effects on non-target species.

AB This work aimed to investigate the possible effect of 2 quenchers commonly used in H2O2-based advanced oxi-dation technologies (AOTs), i.e. catalase and sodium sulphite (Na2SO3), on the analytical signal of 3 detectors coupled to liquid chromatography (LC): tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), fluorescence detection (LCFD) and LC-diode array detection (LC-DAD). The observation of analytical interferences fora group of compounds when studying the removal by continuous mode UV/H2O2 of 26 micropollutants (MPs) from a spiked surface water (SW), for which the residual H2O2 in the samples was quenched by Na2SO3, triggered the need of understanding these effects and thus catalase was used as comparative quencher. From the 26 MPs having a wide range of polarity and pKa, those monitored after electrospray ionization (ESI) under positive ionization (PI) mode and presenting a pKa higher than 5.9 revealed a great signal suppression, but only when using Na2SO3 as H2O2 quencher. In this sense, we further explored this effect by selecting 2 MPs, metoprolol and diclofenac, which had respectively signal suppression and no interference in the LC-MS/MS response. These MPs were analysed be-fore and after addition of H2O2 and catalase or Na2SO3 in reaction vials, using: (i) different detectors coupled to LC, namely LC-MS/MS with ESI under PI and negative ionization (NI) modes, LC-FD and LC-DAD; (ii) different en-vironmental matrices (SW, drinking water, wastewater) and ultrapure water; and (iii) different magnitude levels (0.1-10 mg L-1). The results demonstrated a remarkable signal suppression in LC-MS/MS analyses under P1 mode for those compounds with pic higher than 5.9, confirming the interfering effect of H2O2/Na2SO3. To the best of our knowledge, the analytical interference in the LC-MS/MS analysis, after adding Na2SO3 to quench H2O2 in AOTs experiments was never reported before and the results presented herein support the recommendation to use catalase instead of Na2SO3 as quencher in AOTs studies.

AB Biochar was produced from the fast pyrolysis of Douglas fir (DFBC). Magnetic biochar (MDFBC) was prepared by magnetite (Fe3O4) precipitation onto the biochar's surface from an aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+ solution upon NaOH treatment. The resulting MDFBC was used to remove 4-nitroaniline (4NA), salicylic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BA) and phthalic acid (PA) from water. The surface chemistry and composition of the MDFBC were examined by SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, PZC, XPS, XRD, elemental analysis, and surface area measurements. Batch sorption studies were carried out from pH 2 to 10 and adsorbate concentrations from 25 to 500 mg/L at 15, 25, 35 and 45 degrees C. MDFBC suspensions in the contaminated solutions were vortexed for two min and then magnetically removed. Remediated solutions were then analyzed using UV Visible spectroscopy. The amounts of 4NA, SA, BA and PA adsorbed onto MDFBC was higher at low pH values and decreased with increasing pH. MDFBC sorption at 15, 25, 35 and 45 degrees C was evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, Redlich Peterson, and Toth adsorption isotherm models. Langmuir adsorption capacities at pH 5 and 45 degrees C for 4NA, SA, BA and PA were 114, 109, 90 and 86 mg/g, respectively. Thrice recycled MDFBC using extraction" with methanol (5 x 10 mL) and water (10 mL) had 90% of the original adsorption capacities for 4NA, SA, BA and PA, respectively. The adsorption kinetics of MDFBC and DFBC were far faster than four other biochars (mixed feed, magnetized mixed feed, pinewood and magnetized switchgrass) and also faster than a commercial activated carbon. Equilibrium for MDFBC and its DFBC precursor was reached within 2 min, while the other biochars took between 8 and 20 h. The fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption capacities of MDFBC could be advantageously employed in filtration devices, columns, or as shown here, in batch operations with stirring to speed adsorption, followed by magnetic separation of the adsorbent for regeneration.

AB In the present study, a graft copolymer was synthesized in accordance with the free radical method using N-tertiary butylacrylamide monomer on chitosan, which is an environmentally friendly polymer. The chemical structure and surface morphology of the newly synthesized graft copolymer were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the thermal behavior was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. The chitosan-graft-poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide) graft copolymer was used as an adsorbent for the rapid removal of tetracycline from aqueous solutions in order to investigate its applicability. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the optimization of the study conditions, namely adsorbent dosage (0.01-0.04 g 100 mL(-1)), reaction time (10-90 min) and initial tetracycline concentration (10-100 mg 100 mL(-1)). The effects of these conditions on tetracycline uptake capacity were examined and the results were statistically analyzed. The RSM results showed that the maximum tetracycline uptake capacity of 104.81 mg g(-1) was achieved under the following conditions: adsorbent dose of 0.03 mg 100 mL(-1), reaction time of 51.12 min and initial tetracycline concentration of 97.99 mg L-1. ANOVA based on central composite design combined with RSM showed a good agreement between the experimental values and quadratic model estimates, thus resulting in a coefficient (R-2) of 0.9118 for tetracycline uptake. The kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics of adsorption were examined, and results showed that equilibrium data fitted the Freundlich isotherm model, and the adsorption kinetics of tetracycline followed pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters like the enthalpy - 10.39 kJ mol(-1) (Delta H degrees), entropy 0.044 kJ mol(-1) K-1 (Delta S degrees) and Gibbs free energy - 23.26 kJ mol(-1) (Delta G degrees) were evaluated and also, Delta G degrees shows a negative values indicating that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. The findings demonstrated that the chitosan-graft-poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide) copolymer is an effective adsorbent for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB BackgroundAcetate, an economical industrial chemical, which is also the precursor of acetyl-CoA, could serve as an alternative substrate for biomanufacturing. This nontraditional substrate can be widely produced from syngas via hydrolysis or pyrolysis of the cellulosic biomass, chemical or microbial catalysis, anaerobic fermentation in treated wastewater, etc. However, the toxicity of acetate to microorganisms has held back its utilization, especially for the eukaryotes that are good hosts for production of complicated pharmaceuticals or chemicals. This study seeks to improve acetate utilization in a widely used yeast host, Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris), by metabolic engineering of acetate tolerance, transport, and metabolism.ResultsA kinase-deficient library of K. phaffii was firstly used to screen acetate-resistant kinases. The HRK1 knockout strain was sensitive to acetate and overexpression of this gene improved acetate tolerance and cell growth of the strain. Also, overexpression of HRK1 caused a 55% productivity improvement of acetyl-CoA-dependent 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA). However, activation of Hrk1 on membrane H(+)-ATPase Pma1 seemed not to work in the engineered strain. Acetate transporter gene ScFPS1* was further overexpressed, despite of not improving 6-MSA biosynthesis. To enhance acetate metabolism, acetyl-CoA synthesizing related genes, yeast PpACS1, ScACS1*, and E. coli ackA/pta were overexpressed separately. Introduction of PpACS1 and ScACS1* each increased biosynthesis of 6-MSA by approximately 20% on 20mM acetate. Finally, co-overexpression of HRK1 and ScACS1* improved 6-MSA productivity by 51% on 20mM acetate, despite that a low expression level of HRK1 happened when genes were expressed under the same promoter.ConclusionsHRK1 screened by K. phaffii kinase-deficient library played an important role in acetate tolerance and was proved to profit the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. It could be a potential target for metabolic engineering of acetate utilization in other eukaryotic hosts as well. A combined strategy of introducing genes for acetate tolerance and metabolism further improved biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA derived reporter compound in K. phaffii. This makes it a good choice for acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals with acetate as substrate or precursor in K. phaffii, which would also extend the use of this chassis host.

AB Natural treatment systems such as bank filtration (BF) and artificial recharge (via an infiltration basin) are a robust barrier for many organic micropollutants (OMPs) and may represent a low-cost alternative compared to advanced drinking water treatment systems. This study analyzes a comprehensive database of OMPs at BF and artificial recharge (AR) sites located near Lake Tegel in Berlin (Germany). The focus of the study was on the derivation of correlations between the removal efficiencies of OMPs and key factors influencing the performance of BF and AR. At the BF site, shallow monitoring wells located close to the Lake Tegel source exhibited oxic conditions followed by prolonged anoxic conditions in deep monitoring wells and a production well. At the AR site, oxic conditions prevailed from the recharge pond along monitoring wells to the production well. Long residence times of up to 4.5 months at the BF site reduced the temperature variation during soil passage between summer and winter. The temperature variations were greater at the AR site as a consequence of shorter residence times. Deep monitoring wells and the production well located at the BF site were under the influence of ambient groundwater and old bank filtrate (up to several years of age). Thus, it is important to account for mixing with native groundwater and other sources (e.g., old bank filtrate) when estimating the performance of BF with respect to removal of OMPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate correlations between OMP removals and hydrogeochemical conditions with spatial and temporal parameters (e.g., well distance, residence time and depth) from both sites. Principal component-1 (PC1) embodied redox conditions (oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen), and principal component-2 (PC2) embodied degradation potential (e.g., total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) with the calcium carbonate dissolution potential (Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-)) for the BF site. These two PCs explained a total variance of 55% at the BF site. At the AR site, PCA revealed redox conditions (PC1) and degradation potential with temperature (PC2) as principal components, which explained a total variance of 56%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) inwater remains a concern due to their potential threat to environmental and human health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been receiving attention in water treatment studies to remove PPCPs. However, most studies have been focused on pure water containing a limited number of substances. In this study, the photocatalytic efficiency of commercially available titaniumdioxide nanoparticles (P25) and P25 modified by silver nanoparticles (Ag-P25) were compared for their ability to degrade 23 target PPCPs (2 mu g L-1) in realistic water matrices containing natural organic matter (Suwanee River NOM, 6.12 mg L-1). The experiments were completed under ultraviolet-light emitting diode (UV-LED) illumination at 365 and 405 nm wavelengths, with the latter representing visible light exposure. Under 365 nm UV-LED treatment, 99% of the PPCPs were removed using both P25 and Ag-P25 photocatalysts within 180 min of the treatment duration. The number of PPCPs removed dropped to 57% and 53% for P25 and Ag-P25 respectively under the 405 nm UV-LED irradiation. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm(UV254) measured at the end of the experiment indicated that the aromatic fraction of NOM was preferentially removed from the water matrix. Also, Ag-P25 was more effective in DOC removal than P25. The relationships of removal rate constants with physico-chemical properties of the substances were also determined. The molecular weight and charge were strongly associated with removal, with the former and the latter being positively and negatively correlated with the rate constants. The results of this work indicate that Ag-P25 is a promising photocatalyst to degrade persistent substances such as PPCPs and NOM even if they are present in a complex water matrix. The properties of individual substances can also be employed as an indication of their removal using this technology. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR) is a typical kind of Fluoroquinolone antibiotics which is extensively used around the world. Residues of NOR have been found continuously increasing in the water systems thus posing detrimental effects to the aquatic ecosystem and human health. In this study, the degradation effect and mechanism on NOR in aqueous solution are investigated by gas-liquid phase dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma combined with different catalysts (H2O2 or Fe2+). The concentrations of three representative plasma-generated long-lived reactive species (H2O2 , O-3 and NO3(-))were measured in dH(2)O and found enhancing with the lengthening discharge period. Variations on the treatment parameters were carried out in discharge power, initial solution pH and the concentration of catalysts. A discharge power at 60 W provided optimal balance on the degradation effect and energy efficiency would be beneficial, while there is not much impact from the initial solution pH on NOR degradation. Both H2O2 and Fe2+ at low concentration (0.5-10 mg/L of Fe2+, 0.1-1.0 mmol/L of H2O2) were observed contributing to the improvement on the NOR degradation rate, while inhibition would occur at high concentration (10-20 mg/L of Fe2+, 1.0-2.0 mmol/L of H2O2). The DBD/H2O2 (0.5 mmol/L)/Fe2+ (10 mg/L) system was found the optimal condition to achieve a high NOR degradation rate of more than 98% after plasma treatment for only 0.5 min at discharge power of 60 W. Moreover, 72.3 +/- 1.7% of the total organic carbon (TOC) in NOR solution have been removed in the DBD/Fe2+ (10 mg/L) system at 15 min which signifies a high mineralization efficiency. The cleavage of piperazine ring and quinolone ring, defluorination and hydroxylation are considered the major pathways for NOR degradation. The biological toxicity of the plasma/Fe2+-induced degradation intermediates has been detected and it fluctuated with the treatment time and finally declined. Therefore, the DBD/catalyst system could be an effective and promising method on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in the future.

AB A novel process consisted of an anaerobic bioscrubber was studied at the field scale for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from a printing press facility. The pilot unit worked under high fluctuating waste gas emissions containing ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 1-ethoxy-2-propanol as main pollutants, with airflows ranging between 184 and 1253 m(3) h(-1) and an average concentration of 1126 +/- 470 mg-C Nm(-3). Three scrubber configurations (cross-flow and vertical-flow packings and spray tower) were tested, and cross-flow packing was found to be the best one. For this packing, daily average values of VOC removal efficiency ranged between 83% and 93% for liquid to air volume ratios between 3.5.10(-3) and 9.1.10(-3). Biomass growth was prevented by periodical chemical cleaning; the average pressure drop was 165 Pa m(-1). Rapid initiation of anaerobic degradation was achieved by using granular sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant. Despite the intermittent and fluctuating organic load, the expanded granular sludge bed reactor showed an excellent level of performance, reaching removal efficiencies of 93 +/- 5% at 25.1 +/- 3.2 degrees C, with biogas methane content of 94 +/- 3% in volume. Volatile fatty acid concentration was as low as 200 mg acetic acid L-1 by treating daily average organic loads up to 3.0 kg COD h(-1), equivalent to 24 kg COD m(-3) bed d(-1). The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed the initial shift of the domains Archaea and Bacteria associated with the limitation of the carbon source to a few organic solvents. The Archaea domain was more sensitive, resulting in a drop of the Shannon index from 1.07 to 0.41 in the first 123 days. Among Archaea, the predominance of Methanosaeta persisted throughout the experimental period. The increase in the proportion of Methanospirillum and Methanobacterium sp. was linked to the spontaneous variations of operating temperature and load, respectively. Among Bacteria, high levels of ethanol degraders (Geobacter and Pelobacter sp.) were observed during the trial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA) is a biopolymer with many useful properties making it applicable for instance in food and skin care industries, in wastewater treatment, in biodegradable plastics or in the pharmaceutical industry. gamma-PGA is usually produced microbially by different Bacillus spp. The produced. gamma-PGA increases the viscosity of the fermentation broth. In case of shake flask fermentations, this results in an increase of the volumetric power input. The power input in shake flasks can be determined by measuring the torque of an orbitally rotating lab shaker. The online measurement of the volumetric power input enables to continuously monitor the formation or degradation of viscous products like gamma-PGA. Combined with the online measurement of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), the respiration activity of the organisms can be observed at the same time.
   Results: Two different Bacillus licheniformis strains and three medium compositions were investigated using online volumetric power input and OTR measurements as well as thorough offline analysis. The online volumetric power input measurement clearly depicted changes in gamma-PGA formation due to different medium compositions as well as differences in the production behavior of the two investigated strains. A higher citric acid concentration and the addition of trace elements to the standard medium showed a positive influence on gamma-PGA production. The online power input signal was used to derive an online viscosity signal which was validated with offline determined viscosity values. The online measurement of the OTR proved to be a valuable tool to follow the respiration activity of the cultivated strains and to determine its reproducibility under different cultivation conditions.
   Conclusions: The combination of the volumetric power input and the OTR allows for an easy and reliable investigation of new strains, cultivation conditions and medium compositions for their potential in gamma-PGA production. The power input signal and the derived online viscosity directly reflect changes in gamma-PGA molecular weight and concentration, respectively, due to different cultivation conditions or production strains.

AB During membrane treatment of secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants, a reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) containing trace organic contaminants is generated. As the latter are of concern, effective and economic treatment methods are required. Here, we investigated electrochemical oxidation of ROC using Ti/Ru0.7Ir0.3O2 electrodes, focussing on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and 28 pharmaceuticals and pesticides frequently encountered in secondary treated effluents. The experiments were conducted in a continuously fed reactor at current densities (J) ranging from 1 to 250 A m(-2) anode, and a batch reactor at J = 250 A m(-2). Higher mineralization efficiency was observed during batch oxidation (e.g. 25.1 +/- 2.7% DOC removal vs 0% removal in the continuous reactor after applying specific electrical charge, Q = 437.0 A h m(-3) ROC), indicating that DOC removal is depending on indirect oxidation by electrogenerated oxidants that accumulate in the bulk liquid. An initial increase and subsequent slow decrease in SUVA(254) during batch mode suggests the introduction of auxochrome substituents (e.g. -Cl, NH2Cl, -Br, and -OH) into the aromatic compounds. Contrarily, in the continuous reactor ring-cleaving oxidation products were generated, and SUVA(254) removal correlated with applied charge. Furthermore, 20 of the target pharmaceuticals and pesticides completely disappeared in both the continuous and batch experiments when applying J >= 150 A m(-2) (i.e. Q >= 461.5 A h m(-3)) and 437.0 A h m(-3) (J = 250 A m(-2)), respectively. Compounds that were more persistent during continuous oxidation were characterized by the presence of electrophilic groups on the aromatic ring (e.g. triclopyr) or by the absence of stronger nucleophilic substituents (e.g. ibuprofen). These pollutants were oxidized when applying higher specific electrical charge in batch mode (i.e. 1.45 kA h m(-3) ROC). However, baseline toxicity as determined by Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition tests (Microtox) was increasing with higher applied charge during batch and continuous oxidation, indicating the formation of toxic oxidation products, possibly chlorinated and brominated organic compounds.

AB Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogenic agent and can enter the aquatic environment in wastewater. It has been reported that TAM can induce hepatic steatosis in vertebrates, however, the effects of TAM exposure on lipid metabolism of hepatopancreas in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, four TAM concentrations (0, 6.7, 13.4 and 20 mu g g(-1) crab body weight) were injected into the swimming-leg of swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus, as a means of evaluating the effects of TAM on the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes, lipid composition, and hepatopancreas histology. The results showed that the mRNA levels of three lipogenic related genes (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acyl desaturase (FAD)) decreased significantly in the 6.7 mu g g(-1) and 20 mu g g(-1) TAM treatments compare to the control. The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner as TAM concentration increased. The mRNA levels of two lipid catabolism-related genes (acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)) were down-regulated among the three TAM treatments, while the enzyme activity and mRNA level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) was up-regulated by TAM treatments. Compared to the control, the lowest levels of total lipids and phospholipids were detected in the 6.7 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment, while the 20 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment had the lowest free fatty acids concentration. The 6.7 mu g g(-1) TAM treatment had the lowest percentages of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and total monounsaturated fatty acids (Sigma MDFA), whilst simultaneously recording the highest percentages of 18:2n-6 and 20:2n-6 in this treatment. Moreover, histological observations indicated that TAM caused the walls of the hepatopancreatic tubules to become brittle, with a concurrent increase in the number of blister-like cells. These results suggest that TAM damages the hepatopancreas and leads to a reduction in hepatopancreatic lipid deposition in P. trituberculatus.

AB The occurrence of emerging organic contaminants within the aquatic environment in Africa is currently unknown. This study provides early insights by characterising a broad range of emerging organic contaminants (n > 1000) in groundwater sources in Kabwe, Zambia. Groundwater samples were obtained during both the dry and wet seasons from a selection of deep boreholes and shallow wells completed within the bedrock and overlying superficial aquifers, respectively. Groundwater sources were distributed across the city to encompass peri-urban, lower cost housing, higher cost housing, and industrial land uses. The insect repellent DEET was ubiquitous within groundwater at concentrations up to 1.8 mu g/L. Other compounds (n = 26) were detected in less than 15% of the sources and included the bactericide triclosan (up to 0.03 mu g/L), chlorination by-products - tri-halornethanes (up to 50 mu g/L), and the surfactant 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (up to 0.6 mu g/L). Emerging contaminants were most prevalent in shallow wells sited in low cost housing areas. This is attributed to localised vulnerability associated with inadequate well protection, sanitation, and household waste disposal. The five-fold increase in median DEET concentration following the onset of the seasonal rains highlights that more mobile compounds can rapidly migrate from the surface to the aquifer suggesting the aquifer is more vulnerable than previously considered. Furthermore it suggests DEET is potentially useful as a wastewater tracer in Africa. There was a general absence of personal care products, life-style compounds, and pharmaceuticals which are commonly detected in the aquatic environment in the developed world. This perhaps reflects some degree of attenuation within the subsurface, but could also be a result of the current limited use of products containing emerging contaminants by locals due to unaffordability and unavailability. As development and population increases in Africa, it is likely a wider-range of emerging contaminants will be released into the environment. (C) 2014 British Geological Survey o NERC 2014.

AB With a high rejection coefficient for trace pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), forward osmosis (FO) membrane separation has become a cutting-edge technology in water treatment owing to its low energy consumption and low membrane fouling. Wastewater contains many types of PPCPs, and one pharmaceutical molecule affects the separation behaviors of other pharmaceuticals in FO. Therefore, simultaneous FO of multiple PPCPs needs to be investigated. In this study, the separation behaviors of four trace pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxadn (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), acetaminophen (ACP), carbamazepine (CBZ)), individually (termed "single pharmaceuticals") and in combination (termed "binary pharmaceuticals" as two pharmaceuticals were studied simultaneously), during FO were investigated at trace concentrations using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that for single pharmaceuticals, the molecular sieve dominates their retention rate-the retention rate increases with increasing Stokes radius of the molecules (29.1 -> 94.8% for 0.35 -> 0.47 nm). For binary pharmaceuticals, the retention rates of both pharmaceuticals without charge decrease with increasing total molecule number (for ACP + CBZ, 31.4 -> 52.1% (ACP), 75.1 -> 83.0% (CBZ)). Negatively charged pharmaceuticals are mutually exclusive with the negatively charged FO membrane, resulting in the increase of the retention rate of pharmaceuticals (83.1 -> 90.1% (CIP) when CIP + ACP -> CIP SMX). In the presence of a positively charged pharmaceutical, the retention rate of negatively charged pharmaceuticals decreases (85.7 -> 80.4% (SMX) when SMX + ACP -> SMX + CIP) because the positively charged pharmaceutical neutralizes the negative charge on the FO membrane surface, resulting in the weakening of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged pharmaceutical and FO membrane surface. The positively charged molecule attracts the negatively charged molecule, forming a couple of molecules with larger molecule weight and increasing the retention rate of the pharmaceuticals (80.4 -> 882% (SMX) when pH = 7 -> 5 for SMX + CIP). The results suggest that the interactions between pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored in the process of removing PPCPs by FO. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the current global issues of increasing environmental-health concern is the ubiquitous occurrence of emerging micropollutants (EMPs) in aquatic environments. Among these EMPs, bisphenol A (BPA), technical 4-nonylphenol (NP), tonalide (AHTN), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF) and galaxolide (HHCB) find their way into aquatic environments as a result of their ever increasing production and consumption coupled with their incomplete removal in conventional water and wastewater treatment plants. This study fabricated silicon dioxide (silica) (SiO2) and germanium dioxide (GeO2) embedded polyethersulfone (PES) blend membranes using phase inversion method for the removal of EMPs from water samples collected from North West Province, South Africa. The EMPs were extracted and enriched by auto-trace solid-phase extraction and analyzed using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). The fabricated membranes' permeation properties were determined by computing the pure water flux and EMPs' rejection. The water flux was observed to increase with increase in transmembrane pressure as well as increase in SiO2 and GeO2 nanoparticle loadings in the polymer matrices. Compared to the pristine PES, the contact angles for the SiO2/PES and GeO2/PES membranes were much lower, showing increased hydrophilicity of the membranes with increase in SiO2 and GeO2 nanoparticle loadings in the matrices. The mean EMPs' concentrations (ng/L) ranges in the feed were found to be: BPA (5.19 +/- 0.8 to 53.60 +/- 4.25), CAF (6.09 +/- 0.00 to 49.96 +/- 3.45), CBZ (0.68 +/- 0.00 to 3.06 +/- 0.74), HHCB (21.31 +/- 4.24 to 13.31 +/- 14.8), AHTN (8.31 +/- 2.23 to 141.82 +/- 21.70), and NP (0-174.99 +/- 14.5). Even though SiO2/PES membranes showed slightly higher EMPs' removal efficiencies than their GeO2/PES counterparts, both membranes showed the highest and lowest removal efficiencies range of 97.85-99.00% (for HHCB) and 87.42-93.00% (for CAF), respectively. The results showed superiority in capability of the fabricated nanocomposite membranes in removing EMPs from water.

AB In this study, we systematically investigated the potential applicability of potassium permanganate for removal of triclosan (TCS) in water treatment. A series of kinetic experiments were carried out to study the influence of various factors, including the pH, oxidant doses, temperature, and presence of typical anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-), humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (FA) on triclosan removal. The optimal reaction conditions were: pH = 8.0, [TCS](0):[KMnO4](0) = 1:2.5, and T = 25 degrees C, where 20 mg/L of TCS could be completely degraded in 120 s. However, the rate of TCS (20 mu g/L) oxidation by KMnO4 ([TCS](0):1KMnO(4)](0) = 1:2.5) was 1.64 x 10(-3) mg L-1 .h(-1), lower than that at an initial concentration of 20 mg/L (2.24 x 10(3) mg L-1.h(-1)). A total of eleven products were detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole -time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) analysis, including phenol and its derivatives, benzoquinone, an organic acid, and aldehyde. Two main reaction pathways involving C-O bond cleavage (-C(8)-0(7)) and benzene ring opening (in the less chlorinated benzene ring) were proposed, and were further confirmed based on frontier electron density calculations and point charges. Furthermore, the changes in the toxicity of the reaction solution during TCS oxidation by KMnO4 were evaluated by using both the luminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and the water flea Daphnia magna. The toxicity of 20 mg/L triclosan to D. magna and P. phosphoreum after 60 min was reduced by 95.2% and 43.0%, respectively. Phenol and 1,4-benzoquinone, the two representative degradation products formed during permanganate oxidation, would yield low concentrations of DBP5 (STHMFP, 20.99-278.97 mu g/mg; SHAAFP, 7.86 x 10(-4)-45.77 jig/mg) after chlorination and chloramination. Overall, KMnO4 can be used as an effective oxidizing agent for TCS removal in water and wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasonic irradiation is a promising technique for the degradation of persistent organic molecules such as pharmaceuticals in wastewater. This paper focuses on the sonolytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. During a first experiment at 25 C and 544 kHz, the degradation of a 15 mg L-1 CIP-solution showed a pseudo-first order degradation constant k(1) equal to 0.0067 +/- 0.0001 min(-1) (n = 3). Experiments with the addition of t-butanol as a radical scavenger showed that reaction with OH radicals is the main degradation route for ciprofloxacin. Since the production of OH radicals was the highest at 544 kHz, this was also the most favorable frequency for CIP degradation in comparison with 801 (k(1) = 0.0055 min(-1)) and 1081 kHz (k(1) = 0.0018 min(-1)). The degradation constant is also strongly dependent on the temperature of the bulk solution. The degradation constant increased significantly with increasing temperature from 0.0055 min-1 at 15 C to 0.0105 min-1 at 45 C. According to the Arrhenius law, the apparent activation energy was determined to be 17.5 kJ mol(-1). This suggests that the degradation of CIP is diffusion controlled, as is the case for most radical reactions. A Langmuir-type heterogeneous reaction kinetics model could be used to explain the increasing degradation constant with decreasing initial CIP concentration from 0.0204 min-1 (C-0 = 0.15 mg L-1) to 0.0009 min-1 (C0 = 150 mg L-1). According to the model a local reaction zone exists at the interface region of the cavitation bubbles. During bubble oscillation, molecules accumulate in the reaction zone and when the bubble finally collapses, the molecules in the reaction zone can be oxidized by the formed OH radicals. This means that degradation is limited by the available surface at the interface. The model agreed very well with the experimental data (R-2 = 0.975). The pseudo rate constant for decomposition (k(d)) was estimated to be 0.40 mu M min-1 and the modeled equilibrium constant (K) was equal to 0.047 mu M-1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar adsorbent can be produced in low-resource settings using local materials and simple pyrolysis technology, and it has shown promise for uptake of micropollutants (MPs) such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds, and chemicals released from consumer goods present in water at ng/L to mu g/L levels. Accordingly, the use of biochar in water treatment applications where granular activated carbon (GAC) is economically or logistically infeasible is gaining interest. Monitoring treatment systems for individual MPs require laboratory analytical techniques that are typically cost-prohibitive and impractical for low-resource settings. Therefore, identification of surrogate parameters(s) for adsorbent bed life that can be measured inexpensively and in the field is a high priority. Background dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in natural and anthropogenic waters at concentrations typically 1,000 to 100,000 that of MPs. Some constituents of DOM foul the adsorbent and reduce bed life for removal of target contaminants. Aromatic DOM foulants absorb ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 nm (UVA(254)). Because DOM fouling directly affects MP adsorption capacity and DOM is a bulk water parameter that can be quantified using relatively inexpensive and portable instruments, it could be exploited as a surrogate for monitoring biochar adsorber bed life under field conditions. The objective of this study was to quantify removal of MPs from waters containing different types and concentrations of background DOM (surface water, wastewater, dump leachate) and thus exhibiting different UVA(254) breakthrough profiles in bench-scale column experiments. Breakthrough profiles of weakly to moderately adsorbing MPs, including herbicides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and perfluoroalkyl acids, were collected using biochars generated under different pyrolysis conditions and a commercial GAC as a performance benchmark. Optimal conditions for biochar water treatment include using biochar produced from wood at >= 850 degrees C under slightly aerobic conditions, empty bed contact times of >= 30 min, and upstream treatment processes to reduce DOM. Relative UVA(254) breakthrough (C/C-0) up to 0.6-0.9 corresponded to >= 90% MP removal for most MP-water combinations studied.

AB Much of the current understanding of pharmaceutical pollution in the aquatic environment is based on research conducted in Europe, North America and other select high-income nations. One reason for this geographic disparity of data globally is the high cost and analytical intensity of the research, limiting accessibility to necessary equipment. To reduce the impact of such disparities, we present a novel method to support large-scale monitoring campaigns of pharmaceuticals at different geographical scales. The approach employs the use of a miniaturised sampling and shipping approach with a high throughput and fully validated direct-injection High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry method for the quantification of 61 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their metabolites in tap, surface, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and WWTP effluent water collected globally. A 7-day simulated shipping and sample stability assessment was undertaken demonstrating no significant degradation over the 1-3 days which is typical for global express shipping. Linearity (r(2)) was consistently 0.93 (median = 0.99 +/- 0.02), relative standard deviation of intra- and inter-day repeatability and precision was <20% for 75% and 68% of the determinations made at three concentrations, respectively, and recovery from Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry grade water, tap water, surface water and WWTP effluent were within an acceptable range of 60-130% for 87%, 76%, 77% and 63% of determination made at three concentrations respectively. Limits of detection and quantification were determined in all validated matrices and were consistently in the ng/L level needed for environmentally relevant API research. Independent validation of method results was obtained via an interlaboratory comparison of three surface-water samples and one WWTP effluent sample collected in North Liberty, Iowa (USA). Samples used for the interlaboratory validation were analysed at the University of York Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry (York, UK) and the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver (Colorado, USA). These results document the robustness of using this method on a global scale. Such application of this method would essentially eliminate the interlaboratory analytical variability typical of such large-scale datasets where multiple methods were used.

AB As reclaimed water use is increasing, its safety attracts growing attention, particularly with respect to the health risks associated with the wide range of micropollutants found in the reclaimed water. In this study, sophisticated analysis was conducted for water samples from a water reclamation and ecological reuse system where domestic wastewater was treated using an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic unit followed by a membrane bioreactor (A(2)O-MBR), and the reclaimed water was used for replenishing a landscape lake. A total of 58 organic micropollutants were detected in the system, consisting of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 16 phenols, 3 pesticides, and 26 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). After treatment by the A(2)O-MBR process, effective removal of pesticides and phenols was achieved, while when the reclaimed water entered the landscape lake, PPCPs were further removed. From the physicochemical properties of micropollutants, it could be inferred that phenols and dichlorphos (the only pesticide with considerable concentration in the influent) would have been mainly removed by biodegradation and/or volatilization in the biological treatment process. Additionally, it is probable that sludge adsorption also contributed to the removal of dichlorphos. For the predominant PPCP removal in the landscape lake, various actions, such as adsorption, biodegradation, photolysis, and ecologically mediated processes (via aquatic plants and animals), would have played significant roles. However, according to their logK(oc), logK(ow) and logD (pH = 8) values, it could be concluded that adsorption by suspended solids might be an important action. Although carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks associated with all the detected micropollutants were at negligible levels, the hazard quotients (HQs) of PPCPs accounted for 92.03%-97.23% of the HQ(Total). With the significant removal of PPCPs through the ecological processes in the landscape lake, the safety of reclaimed water use could be improved. Therefore, the introduction of ecological unit into the water reclamation and reuse system could be an effective measure for health risk reduction posed by micropollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (beta-blocker) that is frequently used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions in humans. Detected in surface waters due to discharge of domestic wastewater, propranolol has demonstrated significant species differences in toxicity between fish. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of propranolol on heart rate and development in embryos of two species of fish; Japanese medaka (JM) Oryzias latipes and zebrafish (ZF) Danio rerio. Parents and fertilized embryos of each species were exposed to nominal (measured) concentrations of 0.1 (0.09), 1 (1.1) and 10 (8.3) mu g/L of propranolol. Heart rate was monitored during subsequent exposure in embryos at incremental developmental periods (44, 54, 64 h post-fertilization (hpf) for ZF and 68, 116, 164 hpf for JM). Heart development and morphology was examined using whole mount immunostaining with distance measurements between the sinus venosus (SV) and bulbus arteriosis (BV). Morphological measurements were made at 44 hpf for ZF and 164 hpf for JM. In ZF, a significant reduction in heart rate was observed at 0.08 mu g/L propranolol, along with an increase in the SV-BA distance at 44 hpf. Significant reductions in heart rate were also observed in ZF at 54 and 64 hpf at all concentrations of propranolol. For JM, heart rates generally decreased at all developmental timepoints (68, 116 and 164 hpf) after propranolol treatment, with concentration dependent decreases observed at 164 hpf and a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.09 mu g/L propranolol at each timepoint. However, significant alterations in cardiac morphology were not observed in JM at 164 hpf. In contrast, heart rates and morphology in ZF were affected with a non-monotonic concentration response in morphology and a LOEC of 0.09 mu g/L propranolol for morphological alterations at 44 hpf and for heart rate at each timepoint. These data indicated unique developmental stages of susceptibility between species and that combined parental and embryo exposures may lead to greater impairment of cardiac development and function in offspring than separate exposures of adults and embryos.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) were investigated as a source of iodine in the formation of iodo-trihalomethane (iodo-THM) and iodo-acid disinfection byproducts (DBPs), both of which are highly genotoxic and/or cytotoxic in mammalian cells. ICM are widely used at medical centers to enable imaging of soft tissues (e.g., organs, veins, blood vessels) and are designed to be inert substances, with 95% eliminated in urine and feces unmetabolized within 24 h. ICM are not well removed in wastewater treatment plants, such that they have been found at elevated concentrations in rivers and streams (up to 100 mu g/L). Naturally occurring iodide in source waters is believed to be a primary source of iodine in the formation of iodo-DBPs, but a previous 23-city iodo-DBP occurrence study also revealed appreciable levels of iodo-DBPs in some drinking waters that had very low or no detectable iodide in their source waters. When 10 of the original 23 cities' source waters were resampled, four ICM were found-iopamidol, iopromide, iohexol, and diatrizoate-with iopamidol most frequently detected, in 6 of the 10 plants sampled, with concentrations up to 2700 ng/L. Subsequent controlled laboratory reactions of iopamidol with aqueous chlorine and monochloramine in the absence of natural organic matter (NOM) produced only trace levels of iodo-DBPs; however, when reacted in real source waters (containing NOM), chlorine and monochloramine produced significant levels of iodo-THMs and iodo-acids, up to 212 nM for dichloroiodomethane and 3.0 nM for iodoacetic acid, respectively, for chlorination. The pH behavior was different for chlorine and monochloramine, such that iodo-DBP concentrations maximized at higher pH (8.5) for chlorine, but at lower pH (6.5) for monochloramine. Extracts from chloraminated source waters with and without iopamidol, as well as from chlorinated source waters with iopamidol, were the most cytotoxic samples in mammalian cells. Source waters with iopamidol but no disinfectant added were the least cytotoxic. While extracts from chlorinated and chloraminated source waters were genotoxic, the addition of iopamidol enhanced their genotoxicity. Therefore, while ICM are not toxic in themselves, their presence in source waters may be a source of concern because of the formation of highly toxic iodo-DBPs in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are recognized as one emerging group of environmental contaminants, capturing worldwide attention. These chemicals, closely connected to anthropogenic activities, are mainly transported through aquatic environments and reach coastal areas, eventually entering ocean offshore. Thus, this study concentrated on the 30 PPCPs in coastal waters of the Yellow and Bohai seas (77 sites), a fast-growing area with intensive anthropogenic activities. In general, the total concentrations of PPCPs in Chinese coastal waters (0.880-1194 ng L-1) greatly varied and were relatively greater than those (9.91-442 ng L-1) in Korean coastal waters. Sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, oxytetracycline, ofloxacin, roxithromycin, anhydro-erythromycin, and caffeine were the seven predominant PPCPs in the coastal waters of study area. Further, we established the Predicted PPCPs Contamination Indicator (PPCI) to address potential anthropogenic activities being associated with site-specific PPCPs contamination. Three anthropogenic factors to PPCPs contamination were proven as the most influential, including (1) quantity of wastewater discharge, (2) gross product of meat, poultry, eggs and milk, and (3) gross aquatic product. The relatively high PPCI values appeared in Tianjin, Dalian, Tangshan, Yantai, and Qingdao in China and Gyeonggi and Jeonbuk in South Korea, which exhibited fairly good consistency with the corresponding PPCPs concentrations. A mini-review of the global PPCPs distributions revealed that seven priority PPCPs found in this study distributed widely in Asia rather than Europe, North America, and Australia. In general, global PPCPs contamination also reflected site-and region-specific distributions, suggesting varying usages and sources cross the region and/or country. Finally, the risk assessment suggested that ofloxacin and anhydro-erythromycin, with 36.4% and 23.4% sites higher than medium risks respectively, posed relatively high risks to sensitive algal species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Selenastrum capricornutum. Overall, the ecological risks of exposure of PPCPs in the Yellow and Bohai seas were higher compared to other regions of the world, thus the bilateral management of PPCPs between China and South Korea needs an immediate attention.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and bioaccumulates in wild-caught fish, especially in brain, liver and muscle tissues. Previous studies indicated that FLX is pharmacologically active in fish species exerting anorexigenic effects, but it is not clear whether waterborne FLX has any potential effects on regulating food intake and energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of two doses of FLX, an environmental concentration of 540 ng/L, and 100-times this concentration (54 mu g/L), on feeding and key metabolic parameters in goldfish. Fish were exposed for a period of 28 days and changes in food intake and body mass were assessed. Pair-fed groups were maintained to discern primary FLX-induced effects from secondary metabolic responses induced by the decreased food intake. Additionally, an untreated control group and a fasted group were used to further compare physiological changes in the context of nutritional status of the animals. Significant decreases in food intake and weight gain were recorded in goldfish exposed to 54 mu g/L FLX. Furthermore a significant decrease occurred in circulating glucose levels in the group exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we investigated gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in the neuroendocrine brain of goldfish as well as gene expression and enzymatic activity of glycolytic and gluconeogenetic enzymes in liver and muscle tissues. The results confirm brain gene expression patterns in line with potential anorexigenic effects in the hypothalamus, with increased expression in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and decreased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY). With respect to glucose metabolism, liver gene expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase decreased and muscle hexokinase activity increased in fish exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Overall, this study demonstrated anorectic properties of FLX at a dose of 54 mu g/L FLX and moderate but significant effects on glucose metabolism in goldfish exposed to 540 ng/L FLX. Future studies investigating the importance of these changes in fish are warranted. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic micropollutants found in the environment are a diverse group of compounds that includes pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors. Their presence in the aquatic environment continues to be a concern as the risk they pose towards both the environment and human health is still inconclusive. Removal of these compounds from water and wastewater is difficult to achieve and often incomplete, but UV-TiO2 is a promising treatment approach. In this study, the efficiency of titanium dioxide (TiO2) immobilized on porous supports were tested for treatment of target pharmaceuticals and their metabolites under UV-LED exposure, a potential low energy and cost effective alternative to conventional UV lamps. Immobilization was completed using two different methods: (1) dip coating of TiO2 onto quartz fiber filters (QFT) or (2) thermal-chemical oxidation of porous titanium sheets (PIT). Comparison against experimental controls (dark QFT, dark PTT, and photolysis using UV LED only) showed that UV-LED/PTT and UV-LED/QFT treatments have the potential to reduce the concentrations of the target compounds. However, the treatments were found to be selective, such that individual pharmaceuticals were removed well using QFT and FIT but not both. The complementary treatment behavior is likely driven by electrostatic interactions of charged compounds with the membranes. QFT membranes are negatively charged at the experimental pH (4.5-5) while FIT membranes are positively charged. As a result, cationic compounds interact more with QFT while anionic compounds with FIT. Neutral compounds, however, were found to be recalcitrant under any treatment conditions suggesting that ionic interactions were important for reactions to occur. This behavior can be advantageous if specificity is required. The behavior of pharmaceutical metabolites is similar to the parent compounds. However, isomeric metabolites of atorvastatin with functional groups in para and ortho configurations behave differently, suggesting that the positioning of functional groups can have an impact in their interaction with the immobilized TiO2. It was also apparent that FIT can be reused after cleaning by heat treatment. Overall, these newly synthesized membrane materials have potential applications for treatment of trace organic contaminants in water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex mixtures of low concentrations of organic micropollutants are commonly found in rivers and streams, but their relationship to the structure of native bacterial communities that underlie critical ecological goods and services in these systems is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we used correlation-based network analysis to explore co-occurrence patterns between measured micropollutant concentrations and the associated surface water and sediment bacterial communities in a restored riparian zone of the Des Plaines River (DPR) in Illinois that is impacted by both wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and agricultural runoff. Over a two year period, we collected 55 grab samples at 11 sites along the DPR and one of its tributaries (48 surface water samples) and from WWTP effluent (7 samples), and screened for 126 organic micropollutants. In parallel, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial community in sediment and surface water. Our results revealed quantifiable levels of 102 micropollutants in at least one surface water or WWTP effluent sample, 85 of which were detected in at least one surface water sample. While micropollutants were temporally and spatially variable in terms of both presence and concentration, 21 micropollutants were measured in over 75% of the 48 surface water samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing documented diverse bacterial communities along the DPR transect, with highly distinct community structures observed in sediment and water. Bacterial community structure in surface water, but not in sediment, was significantly associated with concentrations of micropollutants, based on a Mantel test. Correlation-based network analyses revealed diverse strong and significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion patterns between specific bacterial OTUs and both micropollutant groups (defined based on k-means clustering on chemical substructure) and individual micropollutants. Significantly more associations were documented between micropollutants and bacterial taxa in the water compared to the sediment microbiomes. Taken together, our results document a significant link between complex mixtures of micropollutants commonly found in aquatic systems and associated bacterial community structure. Furthermore, our results suggest that micropollutants may exert a more significant impact on water-associated than on sediment-associated bacterial taxa.

AB Organic micropollutants (MPs) are increasingly detected in water resources, which can be a concern for human health and the aquatic environment. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation based advanced oxidation processes (AOP) such as low-pressure mercury vapor arc lamp UV/H 2 O 2 can be applied to abate these MPs. During UV/H 2 O 2 treatment, MPs are abated primarily by photolysis and reactions with hydroxyl radicals ( 'OH), which are produced in situ from H 2 O 2 photolysis. Here, a model is presented that calculates the applied UV fluence ( H calc ) and the 'OH exposure ( C T ?OH , calc ) from the abatement of two selected MPs, which act as internal probe compounds. Quantification of the UV fluence and hydroxyl radical exposure was generally accurate when a UV susceptible and a UV resistant probe compound were selected, and both were abated at least by 50 %, e.g., iopamidol and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole. Based on these key parameters a model was developed to predict the abatement of other MPs. The prediction of abatement was verified in various waters (sand filtrates of rivers Rhine and Wiese, and a tertiary wastewater effluent) and at different scales (laboratory experiments, pilot plant). The accuracy to predict the abatement of other MPs was typically within ?20 % of the respective measured abatement. The model was further assessed for its ability to estimate unknown rate constants for direct photolysis ( k UV , MP ) and reactions with 'OH ( k ?OH , MP ). In most cases, the estimated rate constants agreed well with published values, considering the uncertainty of kinetic data determined in laboratory experiments. A sensitivity analysis revealed that in typical water treatment applications, the precision of kinetic parameters ( k UV , MP for UV susceptible and k ?OH , MP for UV resistant probe compounds) have the strongest impact on the model?s accuracy. ? 2021 The Author(s).

AB One of the major sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment is wastewater effluent of which human urine contributes the majority of pharmaceuticals. Urine source separation has the potential to isolate pharmaceuticals at a higher concentration for efficient removal as well as produce a nutrient byproduct. This research investigated the efficacy of using strong-base anion exchange polymer resins to remove the widely detected and abundant pharmaceutical, diclofenac, from synthetic human urine under fresh and ureolyzed conditions. The majority of experiments were conducted using a strong-base, macroporous, polystyrene resin (Purolite A520E). Ion-exchange followed a two-step removal rate with rapid removal in 1 h and equilibrium removal in 24 h. Diclofenac removal was >90% at a resin dose of 8 mL/L in both fresh and ureolyzed urine. Sorption of diclofenac onto A520E resin was concurrent with desorption of an equivalent amount of chloride, which indicates the ion-exchange mechanism is occurring. The presence of competing ions such as phosphate and citrate did not significantly impact diclofenac removal. Comparisons of three polystyrene resins (A520E, Dowex 22, Dowex Marathon 11) as well as one polyacrylic resin (IRA958) were conducted to determine the major interactions between anion exchange resin and diclofenac. The results showed that polystyrene resins provide the highest level of diclofenac removal due to electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium functional groups of resin and carboxylic acid of diclofenac and non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix and benzene rings of diclofenac. Diclofenac was effectively desorbed from A520E resin using a regeneration solution that contained 4.5% (m/m) NaCl in an equal-volume mixture of methanol and water. The greater regeneration efficiency of the NaCl/methanol-water mixture over the aqueous NaCl solution supports the importance of non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix and benzene rings of diclofenac. Experiments with ketoprofen, in addition to diclofenac, suggest that polystyrene anion exchange resins can be used to selectively remove other acidic pharmaceuticals from urine.

AB Exposure of wild organisms to anthropogenic substances never follows a definite time-course and pulsed events can often determine biological responses to such chemicals, confounding the interpretation of toxicological data. This is the case of specific chemicals such as pharmaceutical drugs, which are commonly released by sewage systems into sensitive areas, including estuaries. The presence and amount of these chemicals in the wild can be modulated by events such as dilution due to heavy rain, floods, or by varying patterns of domestic water use (daily vs. seasonal). The present study aimed to obtain additional data about the toxicity of paracetamol towards the marine clam species Ruditapes philippinarum, following realistic modes of exposure. Thus, the toxicity assessment was made after an acute exposure to different concentrations of paracetamol, followed by a recovery period. The adopted toxicological endpoints included energy-related parameters (glycogen content, GLY; protein content, PROT; electron transport system activity, ETS), activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; Glutathione-S-transferases, GSTs), levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), neurotoxicity (cholinesterases activity, ChEs), and indicators of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, LPO). The here obtained results showed an increase in SOD and GPx activities after exposure. In organisms exposed to the highest concentration tested it was also possible to observe a significant increase in GSTs activity. However, these alterations in the antioxidant defence system were not able to prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress in exposed organisms. Furthermore, exposure to paracetamol induced neurotoxicity in clams, with a concentration-dependent ChEs inhibition along the exposure concentrations. Exposure to paracetamol also led to an increase of GLY content which resulted from metabolic activity depression along the increasing exposure gradient. In recovering organisms the activities of SOD, GPx and GSTs decreased back towards control values presenting lower values than the ones observed in organisms after acute exposure to paracetamol. No LPO was registered in organisms after the recovery period. In addition, after recovery, clams showed no signs of neurotoxicity, with ChEs activities in previously exposed organisms similar to control clams. After recovery clams seemed to re-establish their metabolic capacity, especially evidenced in clams previously exposed to the highest paracetamol concentration as demonstrated by the increase of ETS activity up to control values. Furthermore, the decrease of GLY content after recovery may indicate that clams increased their metabolic activity and started to use their energetic reserves to re-establish their oxidative status. This set of data shows that an acute exposure to paracetamol can exert deleterious effects that may compromise specific biochemical pathways in sensitive aquatic species, such as R. philippinarwn, but organisms can re-establish their biochemical status to control levels after a recovery period.

The mineralization trend of atenolol in the presence of NaCl, Na2SO4 and NaNO3 was followed using total organic carbon analyzer.

The BDD anode was found to be effective in the presence of Na2SO4 whereas Pt yields better removal in the presence of Naa The initial concentration of NaCl and applied current density on the mineralization of atenolol were found to be significant for both BDD and Pt anodes. These results are explained in terms of electrogenerated oxidants such as (OH)-O-center dot, SO4- S2O82-, Cl-2, HOCl and OCl-. The evolution of chlorine at BDD and Pt with respect to NaCl concentration was studied by means of cyclic voltammetric technique. Though the rate of mineralization was observed to be initially higher in the presence of Pt anode, the overall rate of mineralization is more or less similar beyond 15 h of electrooxidation. The slow degradation at the later stages of electrooxidation was attributed to the presence of residual chlorinated organic compounds which are very refractive.

AB Operating conditions of forced circulation crystallizer, which is equipped with a condenser, are investigated in this research. The results can be used as tally rules for design and process optimization. The effect of operating pressure, operating temperature, and cooling water flow rate on the performance of forced circulation crystallizer as an industrial type of evaporators is evaluated in this research. Moreover, the relationship between the amounts of produced sugar crystal, acidity, distilled water, sugar crystal size, and energy consumption in the heat exchanger has been investigated, experimentally. Finally, the relationship between the concentration of sugar in liquor and related density is measured in this article. The experimental results show, with increasing operating temperature from 87.1 to 91.6 degrees C, the density of outlet liquor from the crystallizer decreases from 1,122.37 to 1,121.48kg/m(3). In addition, 6.24kWh as the minimum amount of energy consumption is obtained at a temperature of 27.3 degrees C. Results show that the difference between feed temperature and heat exchanger temperature is between 5.9 and 9.8% for different cooling water flow rates.
   Practical applicationsA forced-circulation crystallizer operates under reduced pressure. A high recirculation rate through the external heat exchanger is used to provide good heat transfer and minimize encrustation. The crystal magma is circulated from the lower conical section of the evaporator body through the vertical tubular heat exchanger and reintroduced tangentially into the evaporator below the liquor level to create a swirling action and prevent flashing (sudden evaporation). Feedstock enters on the pump inlet side of the circulation system. Product crystal magma is removed below the conical section. Its purpose is to concentrate nonvolatile materials such as organic compounds, mineral sugars, acids, and bases. Totally, a forced circulation evaporator utilizes a heavily recirculated heat exchanger with suppressed boiling. Moreover, it is typically used for fouling or crystallizing products. A high liquid rate combined with induced turbulence deters scaling on the heat transfer surfaces. Totally, the forced circulation crystallizers apply in food industries. Some of the industries, which are related to the forced circulation crystallizer, are mineral ingredients companies, chemical companies, and feed industries. The main applications of forced circulation crystallizer are as follows: (a) suitable for material with bigger concentration ratio, higher viscosity, and easily crystallization; (b) widely used in the evaporation and concentration of water phase solution or organic phase solution, in food, pharmaceutical, chemical, biological engineering, and other industries; (c) widely used for the evaporation and concentration of tomato sauce, malt dextrin, starch, sugar, glucose, lysine, inositol, fructose, oligosaccharides, peptides, and so on; (d) compact structure and convenient operation, ideal evaporator for treating corn syrup, tomato paste, and industrial sewage; and (e) for the production of chemical and petrochemical compositions such as phosphoric acid, ammonium sulfate, soda, sodium sulfate, and gelatin, urea.

AB Introduction: Triclosan (TCS) is an extensively used antibacterial agent which has been frequently detected in different environmental compartments. Because of TCS inhibition effect on vast majority of bacterial species, it is important to explore fungal species and their involved enzymes in TCS biodegradation. The aim of this study was to compare the potential of two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor for TCS biodegradation through the whole cell culture of fungi in an aqueous culture medium. Additionally, the changes in ligninolytic enzyme activities and possible correlations and contributions of degradative enzymes during TCS biodegradation process were monitored.
   Material and methods: This study was carried out using a factorial experiment with a completely randomized design in three replications. factorial design in The experimental factors included: two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor and uninoculated controls which were subjected to five levels of TCS concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 mu g mL(-1)) to assess ligninolytic enzymatic activity during biodegradation of TCS. Samples were harvested periodically at three time intervals (4, 7 and 10 days). An AB SCIEX 3200 QTRAP LCMS/MS system was used in order to analyze the biodegradation of TCS in liquid medium.
   Results: Results suggested that the two white rot fungi responded differently when exposed to the different concentrations of TCS. In general, P. ostreatus exhibited more potential and ligninolytic enzymatic activity compared to T. versicolor. LC-MS/MS analyses also showed that P. ostreatus degraded TCS with higher efficiency compared to T. versicolor. In addition, almost all P. ostreatus biodegradation activity was completed within the first day of sampling. Contrasting, less efficient degradation was observed by T. versicolor, reaching around 88% of TCS biodegradation at concentration of 20 mu g mL(-1) after 10 days. At higher TCS concentrations (>= 30 mu g mL(-1)), the growth of T. versicolor severely inhibited and led to a drop in enzymatic activity and biodegradation. Furthermore, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were determined as more involved enzymes which significantly correlated to TCS biodegradation by T. versicolor and P. ostreatus, respectively.
   Conclusion: P. ostreatus might be considered as efficient fungus in biodegradation of high amount of TCS in environmental matrices. The results of the present study might provide insights for future investigations on potential of fungi for applications in bioaugmentation-based strategies to remove TCS from wastewater and activated sludge.

AB The pharmaceutical industry in China makes an important contribution to the national economy. However, the associated pollution problems cause gradual deterioration of the environment and impact adversely on the local community. Cleaner production (CP) technology, an effective way to reduce waste emission and save resources, has been widely employed in the pharmaceutical industry in the developed countries. Such technologies have been applied in a number of factories in China, although there is no integrated assessment and implementation procedure for implementing CP technologies in pharmaceutical plants. To solve such problems, a series of CP options are proposed and assessed here. CP is a powerful tool for decreasing waste production, limiting environmental pollution and natural resource depletion. Moreover, the return on investment in CP is quick, so it would seem that CP activities should be very much in demand by enterprises. Reality is less optimistic: frequently only limited interest is expressed, even after an explanation; business people hesitate to become actively involved. The processes in the pharmaceutical production industry produce a vast amount of waste, including wastewater with high concentrations of organic substances (the principal component), solid waste, and organic off-gas. To solve such problems, a series of CP options are proposed and assessed in this study. Having consideration to environmental impacts and economic efficiency, four groups of medium/high cost CP options were screened in an integrated assessment. To verify the proposed options, a case study was conducted in Degussa Luyuan, Northeast China. The characteristics of resource consumption and waste emission during the production process were identified. The proposed options were evaluated according to different aspects. An integrated CP system based on the proposed options was designed and then implemented in the factory. In three years of practical use, the productivity and quality of alcohol product were improved, with a reduction in waste and pollution and a marked increase in water/energy savings. This study provides theoretical and practical support for the extensive application of CP technologies and sustainable development in China's pharmaceutical industry. These methods include ways to clean up production that are incorporated in the process design, reforming present production technologies, updating the equipment, exploiting new producing flowcharts, using cleaner energy, building recycling into the manufacturing process, recycling waste, enhancing management, developing environmental protection technology, and ensuring satisfactory end-of-pipe disposal.

AB Nitrification and distillation of urine allow for the recovery of all nutrients in a highly concentrated fertilizer solution. However, pharmaceuticals excreted with urine are only partially removed during these two process steps. For a sustainable and safe application, more extensive removal of pharmaceuticals is necessary. To enhance the pharmaceutical removal, which is already occurring during urine storage, nitrification and distillation, an adsorption column with granular activated carbon (GAC) can be included in the treatment train. We executed a pilot-scale study to investigate the adsorption of eleven indicator pharmaceuticals on GAC. During 74 days, we treated roughly 1000 L of pre-filtered and nitrified urine spiked with pharmaceuticals in two flow-through GAC columns filled with different grain sizes. We compared the performance of these columns by calculating the number of treated bed volumes until breakthrough and carbon usage rates. The eleven spiked pharmaceuticals were candesartan, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, diclofenac, emtricitabine, hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, metoprolol, N-4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. At the shortest empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 25 min, immediate breakthrough was observed in both columns shortly after the start of the experiments. Strong competition by natural organic material (NOM) could have caused the low pharmaceutical removal at the EBCT of 25 min. At EBCTs of 70, 92 and 115 min, more than 660 bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough in the column with fine GAC. The earliest breakthrough was observed for candesartan and clarithromycin. On coarse GAC, only half the number of bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough compared to fine GAC. The probable reason for the later breakthrough with fine GAC is the smaller intraparticle diffusive path length. DOC and UV absorbance measurements at 265 nm indicated that both parameters can be used as indicators for the breakthrough of pharmaceuticals. In contrast to pharmaceuticals and DOC, the nutrient compounds ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, potassium and sulfate were not removed significantly. A comparison with literature values suggests that the amount of GAC needed to remove pharmaceuticals from human excreta could be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude, if urine were treated on site instead of being discharged and treated in a centralized wastewater treatment plant.

AB Purpose Pollution of surface water and groundwater by bulky molecules such as pesticides has been recognized as a major problem in many countries due to their persistence in aquatic environment and potential adverse health effects. The main purpose of this study is the development of a capable adsorbent to remove these bulky molecules from wastewater such as the pesticide Mesosulfuron-Methyl (MM) by reducing the diffusion path, to overcome the problems of diffusional limitations on microporous adsorbents. Methods The adsorption of mesosulfuron-methyl (MM) from aqueous solution is curried out using treated acid HY zeolite. Batch sorption equilibrium and kinetic experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of these materials. Parent zeolites and their derivatives have been characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, pyridine chemisorption followed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. Results The acid treatment leads to an increase in the specific surface from 691 to 853 m(2) g(- 1) for HY(30) and from 631 to 806 m(2) g(- 1) for the HY(16.6) zeolites. It also leads to a reduction in Lewis acidity from 74 to 25 mu mol g(- 1) and from 135 to 31 mu mol g(- 1) for HY(30) and HY(16.6) zeolites respectively, and increases the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction. The adsorption capacity increased from 83 to 99 % after acid treatment. The equilibrium adsorption time is decreased from 15 h to 10 min for the HY(30)_A and from 20 h to 20 min for the HY(16.6)_A for an initial concentration of 20 mg L- 1. The adsorption capacity depends on the pH solution, and the neutral form of the MM is more easily adsorbed into zeolite than the dissociated form via the framework bridged oxygen atoms. For all the samples, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits very well with the experimental data. In the case of the modified zeolites, the approaching equilibrium factor R-w decreases from 0.08183 to 0.00008 when the Lewis acid sites decrease; indicating that the equilibrium is reached more quickly. S-shape adsorption isotherms indicates that cooperative adsorption phenomena. Nevertheless, the shape of acid treated zeolites evolves to an L type indicating a significant enhancement of the adsorbent - adsorbate interactions inducing better adsorption efficiency. Conclusions Mesosulfuron-methyl adsorption has been successfully enhanced after acid treatments of zeolites HY.

AB This study provided a holistic understanding of the sources, fate and behaviour of 142 compounds of emerging concern (CECs) throughout a river catchment impacted by 5 major urban areas. Of the incoming 169.3 kg d(-1) of CECs entering the WwTWs, 167.9 kg d(-1) were present in the liquid phase of influent and 1.4 kg d(-1) were present in the solid phase (solid particulate matter, SPM). Analysis of SPM was important to determine accurate loads of incoming antidepressants and antifungal compounds, which are primarily found in the solid phase. Furthermore, these classes and the plasticiser, bisphenol A (BPA) were the highest contributors to CEC load in digested solids. Population normalised loads showed little variation across the catchment at 154 +/- 12 mg d(-1) inhabitant(-1) indicating that population size is the main driver of CECs in the studied catchment. Across the catchment 154.6 kg d(-1) were removed from the liquid phase during treatment processes. CECs discharged into surface waters from individual WwTWs contributed between 0.19 kg d(-1) at WwTW A to 7.3 kg d(-1) at WwTW E, which correlated strongly with the respective contributing populations. Spatial and temporal variations of individual CECs and their respective classes were found in WwTW influent (both solid (influent(SpM)) and liquid phases (influentAQ)) throughout the catchment, showing that different urban areas impact the catchment in different ways, with key variables being lifestyle, use of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and industrial activity. Understanding of both spatial and temporal variation of CECs at the catchment level helped to identify possible instances of direct disposal, as in the case of carbamazepine. Analysis of surface waters throughout the catchment showed increasing mass loads of CECs from upstream of WwTW A to downstream at WwTW D, showing clear individual contributions from WwTWs. Many CECs were ubiquitous throughout the river water in the catchment. Daily loads ranged from 0.005 g d(-1) (ketamine, WwTW A) up to 1890.3 g d(-1) (metformin, WwTW C) for the 84/138 CECs that were detected downstream of the WwTWs. For metformin this represents the equivalent of similar to 1,890 tablets (1,000 mg per tablet) dissolved in the river water downstream of WwTW C.

AB By using an innovative, positive pressure sample loading technique in combination with an in-line filter of finely ground sand the bottleneck of solid phase extraction (SPE) can be reduced. Recently published work by us has shown the proof of concept of the technique. In this work, emphasis is put on the SPE flow rate and method validation for 26 compounds of emerging environmental concern, mainly from the 1st and 2nd EU Watch List, with various physicochemical properties. The mean absolute recoveries in % and relative standard deviations (RSD) in % for the investigated compounds from spiked pure water samples at the three investigated flow rates of 10, 20, and 40 mL/min were 63.2% (3.2%), 66.9% (3.3%), and 69.0% (4.0%), respectively. All three flow rates produced highly repeatable results, and this allowed a flow rate increase of up to 40 mL/min for a 200 mg, 6 mL, reversed phase SPE cartridge without compromising the recoveries. This figure is more than four times the maximum flow rate recommended by manufacturers. It was indicated that some compounds, especially pronounced for the investigated macrolide molecules, might suffer when long contact times with the sample glass bottle occurs. A reduced contact time somewhat decreases this complication. A very good repeatability also held true for experiments on both spiked matrix-rich pond water (high and low concentrations) and recipient waters (river and wastewater) applying 40 mL/min. This work has shown that, for a large number of compounds of widely differing physicochemical properties, there is a generous flow rate window from 10 to 40 mL/min where sample loading can be conducted. A sample volume of 0.5 L, which at the recommended maximum flow rate speed of 10 mL/min, would previously take 50 min, can now be processed in 12 min using a flow rate of 40 mL/min. This saves 38 min per processed sample. This low-cost technology allows the sample to be transferred to the SPE-column, closer to the sample location and by the person taking the sample. This further means that only the sample cartridge would need to be sent to the laboratory, instead of the whole water sample, like today's procedure.

AB While the 2005 progress report of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals stresses out the need of a dramatic increase in investment to meet the sanitation target in the third world, it is important to anticipate about some parallel negative impacts that may have this optimistic programme (extension of sewer networks without sufficient treatment works). Research was initiated on Lerma River (Mexico), subjected to many rejects disposal, to design a monitoring network and evaluate the impact of wastewaters on its water quality. The discharges was inventorized, geo-positioned with a GPS and mapped, while the physico-chemical characteristics of the river water, its tributaries and main rejects were evaluated. Microtox system was used as an additional screening tool. Along the 60 km of the High Course of Lerma River (HCLR), 51 discharges, with a diameter or width larger than 0.3 m (including 7 small tributaries) were identified. Based on the inventory, a monitoring network of 21 sampling stations in the river and 13 in the important discharges (> 2 m) was proposed. A great similitude was found between the average characteristics of the discharges and the river itself, in both the wet and dry seasons. Oxygen was found exhausted (< 0.5 mg/L) almost all along the high course of the river, with COD and TDS average levels of 390 and 1980 mg/L in the dry season, against 150 and 400 mg/L in the wet season. In the dry season, almost all the sites along the river revealed some toxicity to the bacteria test species (2.9 to 150 TU, with an average of 27 TU). Same septic conditions and toxicity levels were observed in many of the discharges. Four of the six evaluated tributaries, as well as the lagoon (origin of the river), were relatively in better conditions (2 to 8 mg/L D.O., TU < 1) than for the Lerma, acting as diluents and renewal of the HCLR flow rate. The river was shown to be quite a main sewer collector. The high surface water contamination by untreated wastewaters that is depicted in this research should be taken into account in the Millennium Goals strategies, by promoting treatment plan works simultaneously, when sewer networks in the third world would extend.

AB Due to their particular properties, detergents are widely used in household cleaning products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in agriculture as adjuvants tailoring the features of pesticides or other crop protection agents. The continuously growing use of these various products means that water soluble detergents have become one of the most problematic groups of pollutants for the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Thus it is important to identify bacteria having the ability to survive in the presence of large quantities of detergent and efficiently decompose it to non-surface active compounds. In this study, we used peaty soil sampled from a surface flow constructed wetland in a wastewater treatment plant to isolate bacteria that degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We identified and initially characterized 36 Pseudomonas spp. strains that varied significantly in their ability to use SDS as their sole carbon source. Five isolates having the closest taxonomic relationship to the Pseudomonas jessenii subgroup appeared to be the most efficient SDS degraders, decomposing from 80 to 100% of the SDS present in an initial concentration 1 g/L in less than 24 h. These isolates exhibited significant differences in degree of SDS degradation, their resistance to high detergent concentration (ranging from 2.5 g/L up to 10 g/L or higher), and in chemotaxis toward SDS on a plate test. Mass spectrometry revealed several SDS degradation products, 1-dodecanol being dominant; however, traces of dodecanal, 2-dodecanol, and 3-dodecanol were also observed, but no dodecanoic acid. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography revealed that all of the selected isolates possessed alkylsulfatase-like activity. Three isolates, AP3_10, AP3_20, and AP3_22, showed a single band on native PAGE zymography, that could be the result of alkylsulfatase activity, whereas for isolates AP3_16 and AP3_19 two bands were observed. Moreover, the AP3_22 strain exhibited a band in presence of both glucose and SDS, whereas in other isolates, the band was visible solely in presence of detergent in the culture medium. This suggests that these microorganisms isolated from peaty soil exhibit exceptional capabilities to survive in, and break down SDS, and they should be considered as a valuable source of biotechnological tools for future bioremediation and industrial applications.

AB Models of microcontaminant fate and transport in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rivers have been developed and used to assist decision-making in the field of water management. These models come with parameter uncertainties that must be properly incorporated in the decision-making process. The main goal of this study is to evaluate how the magnitudes of key model parameter uncertainties influence the selection of end-of-pipe interventions (at WWTPs) designed to reduce the micro contaminant loads in rivers. We developed a model that describes the fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs and the river network based on 3 key parameters: human pharmaceutical consumption and excretion (F) and the pharmaceutical degradation constants in WWTPs (k(wwrp)) and rivers (k(river)). We modelled the fate and transport of diclofenac in the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). We calibrated the model using a Bayesian approach, which resulted in an accurate prediction of measured diclofenac loads at 9 locations along the Llobregat River and at the influents and effluents of 2 WWTPs (R-2 = 0.95). Using different scenarios, we evaluated three levels of uncertainty in the key model parameters. The first level of uncertainty corresponded to the reference distributions obtained from the Bayesian calibration. Then, for each parameter, we generated a narrower PDF (decreased uncertainty with respect to the reference) and a wider PDF (increased uncertainty). For each level of uncertainty, we evaluated increasing removal efficiencies of diclofenac at the WWTPs, from 38% to 98%. We assumed that removal efficiencies of up to 75% can be achieved by upgrading secondary treatment: beyond 75%, tertiary treatment is needed. The scenario analysis showed that achieving diclofenac removal efficiencies corresponding to tertiary treatment results in apparent concentration reductions (statistically significant differences relative to the reference situation), regardless of the level of uncertainty applied to the model parameters. However, upgrades in the secondary treatment resulted in apparent reductions only in the case of reduced uncertainty. We concluded that model uncertainty greatly influences the decisions that river basin authorities must make to reduce the microcontaminant loads released by WWTPs into rivers. In addition, we discussed research priorities to help reduce model uncertainty and thereby make more appropriate decisions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clotrimazole is a pharmaceutical used for treatment of fungal infections. It has been found in surface waters outside municipal wastewater treatment plants but data are scarce regarding its effects on aquatic organisms. It is known that clotrimazole and other imidazole fungicides are inhibitors of the enzyme aromatase (CYP 19). Aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and is suggested to be involved in the sex differentiation in amphibians. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of larval exposure to clotrimazole on aromatase activity in brain and gonads, and on gonadal differentiation in Xenopus tropicalis frogs. Another purpose was to determine if larval exposure to ethynylestradiol (EE2), at a concentration known to cause male-to-female sex reversal, affects aromatase activity in brain and gonads during gonadal differentiation. Tadpoles were exposed from shortly after hatching (Nieuwkoop and Faber developmental stages 47-48) until complete metamorphosis (NF stage 66) to 6, 41, and 375 nM clotrimazole or 100 nM (nominal) EE2. Aromatase activity was measured in the brain and gonad/kidney complex of tadpoles during gonadal differentiation (NF stage 56) and, in the clotrimazole experiment, also at metamorphosis. In clotrimazole-exposed tadpoles gonadal aromatase activity increased over exposure time in the 41 and 375 nM groups but did not differ significantly from the control group. Gonadal aromatase activity was increased in both sexes exposed to 41 and 375 nM clotrimazole at metamorphosis. Brain aromatase activity was decreased in tadpoles (NF stage 56) exposed to 375 nM clotrimazole. but at metamorphosis no differences were seen between groups or between sexes. No effects of clotrimazole on sex ratio or gonadal histology were noted at completed metamorphosis. EE2-exposed tadpoles had a slightly decreased gonadal aromatase activity, though not significantly different from control group, and there was no effect of EE2 on brain aromatase activity. All EE2-exposed tadpoles developed ovaries. These findings indicate that estrogen-induced ovarian differentiation is not paralleled by increased gonadal aromatase activity in X. tropicalis. Further studies are needed, especially on developmental reproductive toxicity, to assess the risk for endocrine disruption in wild amphibians posed by clotrimazole and other imidazole fungicides.

AB Methamphetamine (METH) has been recognized as an emerging organic contaminant as it was widely detected in the aquatic environment via wastewater effluent discharge. However, the ecological hazard posed by METH at environmentally relevant concentrations was remained unclear. In this study, adult medaka fish were exposed to METH at environmental levels (0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 5 mu g L-1) and high level (25 and 100 mu g L-1) for 90 days to investigate its effect on ecologically behavioral functions, histopathology, bioconcentration, and transgenerational toxicity. The significant increase of locomotion activity, total distance, and max velocity of adult medaka were observed at low METH levels (0.2-0.5 mu g L-1), while it markedly decreased at high levels (25-100 mu g L-1). This effect may increase the predation risk of the fish. The significant alteration on the relative expressions of the genes (cacna1c, oxtr, erk1, and c-fos ), as well as the contents of the proteins (oxytocin (OXT) and protein kinase A (PKA)) involved in Volt age Dependent Calcium Channel (VDCC) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling channel induced by METH could partly elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the changes of the behavioral traits. METH could induce obvious minimal gliosis, neuronal loss, and necrotic in brain tissues. Additionally, the significant increase of hepatic-somatic index (HSI) of male medaka at 0.2-5 mu g L-1 groups, and the decrease of female medaka at 100 mu g L-1 group indicated male fish was more susceptible to METH. Nephric-somatic index (NSI) of medaka markedly declined induced by METH at 0.05-100 mu g L-1. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) (0.4-5.8) in medaka fish revealed the bioconcentration potential of METH in fish. This study for the first time demonstrated METH could induced the development defects of larvae in F1 generation at environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby resulting in a significant decrease in the capacity of fish to produce offspring. Meanwhile, the RQ values ( > 1) of METH in river in China, USA, and Australia showed a high teratogenic risk level, suggesting the ecosystem-levels consequence posed by METH should be concerned.

AB The strain TN638 was isolated from Tunisian soil contaminated with industrial wastewater and selected for its potent antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC 6538 and Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) ATCCC 19117, and Gram negative bacteria: Agrobacterium turnefaciens (A. tumefaciens) ATCC 23308 and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) ATCC 14028 and fungi: Candida albicans (C. albicans) ATCC 10231, Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) ATCC 58938 and Fusarium sp. Solidestate fermentation (SSF) dry crude extract of the TN638 strain presents a strong inhibitory activity notably against the phytopathogenic microorganism A. turnefaciens ATCC 23308 and the two pathogenic bacteria S. aureus ATCC 6538 and L. monocytogenes ATCCC 19117 with a zone of inhibition of 48, 34 and 34 mm respectively. According to the morphological characteristic, the complete 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence determination [1492 bp deposited in National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database under the accession no. LN854629.1; http://ntserver1.wsulibs.wsu.edu:2073/nuccore/LN854629.1/] and the phylogenetic analysis, we can deduce that our isolate is an actinomycete bacterium belonging to the genus Streptomyces and the most closely related strain was Streptomyces cavourensis (S. cavourensis) NRRL 2740 T (99.9%). We propose the assignment of our strain as Streptomyces cavourensis (S. cavourensis) TN638 strain. Work-up and purification of the strain extract using different chromatographic techniques afforded seven bio-compounds namely: Cyclo(Leu-Pro) (1), Cyclo-(Val-Pro) (2), Cyclo-(Phe-Pro) (3), nonactin (4), monactin (5), dinactin (6) and trinactin (7). The chemical structures of compounds 1-7 were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1D and 2D spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and comparison with literature data. The three purified diketopiperazine (DKP) derivatives (1-3), demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against A. turnefaciens ATCC 23308 and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028. The four pure macrotetrolides (4-7), exhibited strong inhibitory effect against all tested Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria notably against A. tumefaciens ATCC 23308 and S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) around 8 mu g/mL quite similar to that of ampicillin. Thus, we propose the use of the (SSF) active extract of the S. cavourensis TN638 strain as safe biological product to control disease caused by plant pathogen A. tumefaciens.

AB Antibiotics are entrained in agricultural soil through the application of manures from medicated animals. In the present study, a series of small field plots was established in 1999 that receive annual spring applications of a mixture of tylosin, sulfa-methazine, and chlortetracycline at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg.kg(-1) soil. These antibiotics are commonly used in commercial swine production. The field plots were cropped continuously for soybeans, and in 2012, after 14 annual antibiotic applications, the nodules from soybean roots were sampled and the occupying brady-rhizobia were characterized. Nodules and isolates were serotyped, and isolates were distinguished using 16S rRNA gene and 16S to 23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region sequencing, multilocus sequence typing, and RS alpha fingerprinting. Treatment with the antibiotic mixture skewed the population of bradyrhizobia dominating the nodule occupancy, with a significantly larger proportion of Bradyrhizobium liaoningense organisms even at the lowest dose of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) soil. Likewise, all doses of antibiotics altered the distribution of RS alpha fingerprint types. Bradyrhizobia were phenotypically evaluated for their sensitivity to the antibiotics, and there was no association between in situ treatment and a decreased sensitivity to the drugs. Overall, long-term exposure to the antibiotic mixture altered the composition of bradyrhizobial populations occupying nitrogen-fixing nodules, apparently through an indirect effect not associated with the sensitivity to the drugs. Further work evaluating agronomic impacts is warranted.
   IMPORTANCE Antibiotics are entrained in agricultural soil through the application of animal or human waste or by irrigation with reused wastewater. Soybeans obtain nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Here, we evaluated the impact of 14 annual exposures to antibiotics commonly used in swine production on the distribution of bradyrhizobia occupying nitrogen-fixing nodules on soybean roots in a long-term field experiment. By means of various sequencing and genomic fingerprinting techniques, the repeated exposure to a mixture of tylosin, sulfamethazine, and chlortetracycline each at a nominal soil concentration of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) soil was found to modify the diversity and identity of bradyrhizobia occupying the nodules. Nodule occupancy was not associated with the level of sensitivity to the antibiotics, indicating that the observed effects were not due to the direct toxicity of the antibiotics on bradyrhizobia. Altogether, these results indicate the potential for long-term impacts of antibiotics on this agronomically important symbiosis.

AB Human pharmaceutical drugs have been found in surface waters worldwide, and represent an increasing concern since little is known about their possible effects on wildlife. Propranolol is a common beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (B-blocker) typically prescribed to people suffering from heart disease and hypertension. Propranolol has been detected in United States wastewater effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.026 to 1.90 mu g/l. In mammals, there is evidence that beta-blockers can cause sexual dysfunction, and alter serotonergic pathways which may impact reproductive behavior but little is known about the effects on fish behavior. The present study tested the effects of propranolol on fecundity, on brain gene expression and on reproductive behavior of the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, a fish that exhibits male parental care. Sexually mature fathead minnows were housed at a ratio of one male and two females per tank and exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10 mu g/l for 21 days. Measured concentrations (+/- SD) of propranolol were 0.003 +/- 0.004, 0.05 +/- 0.02, 0.88 +/- 0.34 and 4.11 +/- 1.19 mu g/l. There were no statistically significant differences in fecundity, fertilization rate, hatchability and time to hatch. Propranolol exposure was not associated with a change in nest rubbing behavior, time spent in the nest or approaching the females. There was a significant difference in the number of visits to the nest with males receiving low and medium propranolol treatments. The microarray analysis showed that there were 335 genes up-regulated and 400 genes down-regulated in the brain after exposure to the highest dose of propranolol. Among those genes, myoglobin and calsequestrin transcripts (fold change=10.84 and 5.49, respectively) were highly up-regulated. Ontological analyses indicated changes in genes involved in calcium ion transport, transcription, proteolysis and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. Pathway analysis indicated that the reduced expression of caspases may lead to impaired neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter secretion and brain function in developing organisms. The results showed that exposure to propranolol at concentrations as high as 4.11 mu g/l did not significantly impact reproductive behavior or spawning abilities of fathead minnow but did alter the regulation of genes within the brain of fish.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is an effective natural and economically feasible tertiary treatment for wastewater reuse. An innovative hybrid process based on biofiltration, ozonation and short SAT (sSAT, with similar to 22 days retention time) was demonstrated in a 6 m(3)/hr pilot system to remove emerging trace organic compounds (TrOCs), organic matter and control Mn2+ dissolution in reclaimed water. The biofiltration stage was proposed for nitrification of ammonia as well as removal of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), to enable efficient ozonation of secondary effluents. The pilot system was operated in two modes, where samples were periodically taken from all pilot stages to observe changes in product water quality. At first (Mode 1), biofiltered effluents were infiltrated through sSAT (i.e., no ozonation prior infiltration). During this operation, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were completely removed, and pathogens were highly reduced. In addition, all measured TrOCs were effectively removed after sSAT, besides the persistent TrOCs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Iodine-organic contrast media Iopamidol (IPDL). In Mode 2, biofiltered and ozonated (1.0-1.2 mg ozone/mg DOC) effluents were infiltrated through sSAT. In the final reclaimed product, values of DOC, UVA and Mn2+ were reduced to 0.8 mg/L, 2.2 L/m, and 29-35 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, ammonia and nitritewere not detected in the product, and good bacterial quality was obtained. Following 56-75 days of operation at Mode 2, all TrOCs were reduced down to <100 ng/L. The delay in the effect of the pretreatment stages on TrOCs removal by sSAT (>56 days instead of similar to 22 days) could be explained by their displacement retardation in the upper soil layers of the pilot SAT (0-25 cm). In-depth sampling inbservation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water. the observation well after 111 days atMode 2 showed homogeneity along the overall perforated section of the well (from -14 to -26 m) with 0.7-0.9 mg/L DOC, 2.1-2.2 1/m UVA and <10 ng/L CBZ. This result proved that the ozonated water completely covered the area around the observation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water.

AB The prescribing and usage of medications (for both humans and domestic animals) have ramifications extending far beyond the traditional objectives of conventional medical care. The healthcare industry has an environmental footprint that includes the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications, residues of which can establish themselves as environmental pollutants. This occurs by a variety of routes, but primarily from excretion, bathing and disposal. Many parallels exist between healthcare and the protection and remediation of the environment, spanning the stages from symptomology and diagnosis to treatment. The critical role played by pharmacovigilance in healthcare has a counterpart with the ecological environment. The term ecopharmacovigilance has been used with respect to the unforeseen consequences APIs can have once they enter the environment. We propose that conventional phannacovigilance could be expanded to encompass environmental concerns - a concept we term pharmEcovigilance - as a way to unify the parallel but interconnected needs for protecting both human and ecological health.
   To convey the scope of a pharmEcovigilance programme, we provide an overview of the occurrence of APIs as environmental pollutants, their ramifications for human health and the environment and some of the ways in which their impact could be reduced or minimized. The major areas discussed include: (i) the routes by which APIs become contaminants in the environment; (ii) the hazards of leftover drugs as a result of stockpiling and from disposal to sewage, which can also eventually contribute to the contamination of drinking water; (iii) why drugs accumulate unused; and (iv) the benefits for humans and the environment that could accrue from reducing the accumulation of leftover drugs and the subsequent introduction of APIs into the environment.
   A broad spectrum of actions could be taken by prescribers (including veterinarians) and the healthcare industry at large (including manufacturers and insurers) to reduce the release or introduction of APIs to the environment. Most significantly, however, a major reason to consider implementing a pharmEcovigilance programme - beyond reducing the environmental footprint of healthcare - is the previously unforeseen collateral benefit in making further progress in optimizing the delivery, effectiveness, outcomes and cost of healthcare, as well as improving safety for humans, pets and wildlife.
   For this reason, the relationships that healthcare professionals and patients have with medications might also include consideration of pharmEcovigilance. Like any profession that deals with chemicals, perhaps a major challenge to be faced is how to ensure the sustainability (and minimize the life cycle exposure hazards) of a chemical-based, chemical-centric society in the most cost-effective and safest manner. Given that the medical community is a major source of numerous 'exotic' chemical pollutants in the environment (with thousands of chemically distinct APIs in current use), albeit at very low levels, an imperative could be created for designing and implementing approaches for reducing and controlling this source of pollution. With reduced wastage of medications, in part driven by appropriate or rational prescribing and dispensing, the ecological footprint of medicine could be greatly reduced, with concomitant improvements in many aspects of healthcare.

AB Acute toxicity and genotoxic activity of 11 pollutants were investigated in wild populations of Diamesa cinerella and Diamesa zernyi (Diptera Chironomidae) from two alpine streams (Italian Alps). D. cinerella was collected in two sites on the non-glacial Vermigliana stream, 50 m-upstream and 5-m downstream of the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) at the Tonal Pass (1799 m a.s.l.). D. zernyi was collected in the Presena glacial stream, close to the glacier snout (2685 m a.s.l.). IV-instar larvae were exposed for 24-96 h to increasing concentrations of three drugs (ibuprofen-IBU, furosemide-FUR, trimethoprim-TMP), three personal care products (triclocarban-TCC, tonalid-TON, sucralose-SUCR), and five pesticides (boscalid-BOS, captan-CAP, chlorpyrifos-CPS, metolachlor-MET, terbuthylazine-TER). The experimental concentrations were from one to several million times higher than the highest environmental concentration (EC) measured in the study sites. Two mixtures of pesticides were also prepared: MIX 1K=10(3) x EC of CPS, MET and TER, and MIX 10K=10(4) x EC of CPS, MET and TER. Species-and site-specific responses were observed for both tests. On the basis of survival data, both species resulted very resistant to pharmaceuticals (mainly to FUR for which no effects on survival and movement or pupation were observed), and more sensitive to pesticides (mainly to CPS, MET and CAP). Genotoxicity tests (Comet assay) highlighted a WTP effect under natural conditions and a genotoxic effect for 9 of the 11 tested compounds. Overall, a clear gradient of increasing resistance in larvae from the least (PR0) to the most polluted (TP_dw) site was highlighted by both tests, ecotoxicological and of genotoxicity, as also expected according to species autecology (D. zernyi is restricted to very cold and pristine habitats). D. cinerella living downstream of the effluent accumulates a significantly higher DNA damage than the other populations, highlighting a basal physiological stress condition in nature. It is plausible that these larvae possess chemical resistance strategies to survive already under natural conditions. Diamesa spp. exhibited a higher toxic resistance than any other model species tested to date under the same pollutants, probably associable to its strong cold resistance. The results emphasised that the measured concentrations of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and pesticides seem to be far below those required to cause acute effects. However, the effects on freshwater communities of prolonged exposure to mixture of trace CECs and pesticides remain unknown.

In this study, two new quantum yields were determined for diatrizoic acid (0.071 mol.Einstein(-1)) and iotalamic acid (0.038 mol.Einstein(-1)) while values for iopromide (IOP) (0.039 mol.Einstein(-1)), iopamidol (0.034 mol.Einstein(-1)) and iohexol (0.041 mol.Einstein(-1)) were consistent with published data. The photodegradation of IOP led to an increasing release of iodide with increasing UV doses. Iodide is oxidized to hypoiodous acid (HOI) either by HOCl or NH2Cl. In presence of NOM, the addition of oxidant increased the formation of iodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs). On one hand, when the concentration of HOCl was increased, the formation of I-DBPs decreased since HOI was converted to iodate. On the other hand, when NH2Cl was used the formation of I-DBPs was constant for all concentration since HOI reacted only with NOM to form I-DBPs. Increasing the NOM concentration has two effects, it decreased the photodegradation of IOP by screening effect but it increased the number of reactive sites available for reaction with HOI. For experiments carried out with HOCl, increasing the NOM concentration led to a lower formation of I-DBPs since less IOP are photodegraded and iodate are formed. For NH2Cl the lower photodegradation of IOP is compensated by the higher amount of NOM reactive sites, therefore, I-DBPs concentrations were constant for all NOM concentrations. 7 different NOM extracts were tested and almost no differences in 101, degradation and I-DBPs formation was observed. Similar behaviour was observed for the 5 ICM tested. Both oxidant poorly degraded the ICM and a higher formation of I-DBPs was observed for the chloramination experiments compared to the chlorination experiment. Results from toxicity testing showed that the photodegradation products of IOP are toxic and confirmed that the formation of I-DBPs leads to higher toxicity. Therefore, for the experiment with HOCl where iodate are formed the toxicity was lower than for the experiments with NH2Cl where a high formation of I-DBPs was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Slow sand filtration (SSF) has been widely used as a means of providing potable water due to its efficacy, low cost, and minimal maintenance. Advances in analytical instrumentation have revealed the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in surface water as well as in ground water. It is unclear if the presence of these compounds in the feed water can interfere with the performances of an SSF unit. The aim of this work was to examine i) the ability of two SSF units to remove six PhACs (caffeine, carbamazepine, 17-beta estradiol [E2], estrone [E1], gemfibrozil, and phenazone), and ii) the impact of these PhACs on the removal of bacteria by two SSF units. The presence of PhACs in feed water for SSF can occur in surface waters impacted by wastewater or leakage from sewers and septic tanks, as well as in developing countries where unregulated use and improper disposal are prevalent. Two pilot-scale SSF units were used during the study. Unit B1 was fed with stream water with 1% of primary effluent added, while unit B2 was fed with stream water alone. Although limited removal (<10%) of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and phenazone occurred, the complete removal of caffeine, and the partial removal (11-92%) of E2 and E1 were observed in the two SSF units. The results of this study suggest that the occurrence of the selected PhACs, probably estrogens and caffeine, in the feed water at 50 mu g L-1 affected the ability of the schmutzdecke to remove total coliform and Escherichia coli. The bacterial removal achieved within the schmutzdecke dropped from 95% to less than 20% by the end of the study. This decrease in removal may be related to the change in the microbial community within the schmutzdecke. A diverse microbial community, including Bacteroidetes and several classes of Proteobacteria, was replaced by a microbial community in which Gammaproteobacteria was the predominant phylum (99%). Despite the low removal achieved within the schmutzdecke, removal of total coliform and E. coli greater than 99% occurred after both SSF units throughout the study. Bacterial removal occurred in the upper half of the sand filter. This was probably due to a diverse microbial community established in the packing material, in which Bacteroidetes (13-25%), Acidobacteria (7-17%) and several classes of Proteobacteria (35-52%) (Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria) were the predominant phyla.

AB The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a well-known sentinel of environmental contamination, yet no studies have traced pharmaceuticals through the water-fish-osprey food web. A screening-level exposure assessment was used to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of 113 pharmaceuticals and metabolites, and an artificial sweetener in this food web. Hypothetical concentrations in water reflecting wastewater effluent dominated or dilution dominated scenarios were combined with pH-specific bioconcentration factors (BCFs) to predict uptake in fish. Residues in fish and osprey food intake rate were used to calculate the daily intake (DI) of compounds by an adult female osprey. Fourteen pharmaceuticals and a drug metabolite with a BCF greater than 100 and a DI greater than 20 mu g/kg were identified as being most likely to exceed the adult human therapeutic dose (HTD). These 15 compounds were also evaluated in a 40 day cumulative dose exposure scenario using first-order kinetics to account for uptake and elimination. Assuming comparable absorption to humans, the half-lives (t(1/2)) for an adult osprey to reach the HTD within 40 days were calculated. For 3 of these pharmaceuticals, the estimated t(1/2) in ospreys was less than that for humans, and thus an osprey might theoretically reach or exceed the HTD in 3 to 7 days. To complement the exposure model, 24 compounds were quantified in water, fish plasma, and osprey nestling plasma from 7 potentially impaired locations in Chesapeake Bay. Of the 18 analytes detected in water, 8 were found in fish plasma, but only 1 in osprey plasma (the antihypertensive diltiazem). Compared to diltiazem detection rate and concentrations in water (10/12 detects, <method detection limits [MDL]-173ng/L), there was a lower detection frequency in fish (31/233 detects, <MDL-2400ng/L); however when present in fish, all values exceeded the maximum diltiazem concentration found in water. Diltiazem was found in all 69 osprey plasma samples (540-8630ng/L), with 41% of these samples exceeding maximum concentrations found in fish. Diltiazem levels in fish and osprey plasma were below the human therapeutic plasma concentration (30000ng/L). Effect thresholds for diltiazem are unknown in ospreys at this time, and there is no evidence to suggest adverse effects. This screening-level exposure model can help identify those compounds that warrant further investigation in high-trophic level species. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2015;11:118-129. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB Various water treatment processes may be ineffective to remove pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) and their by-products, leading to endocrine-disruptive activity that might be detrimental to wildlife and human health. This study investigated the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and their intermediates, as well as estrogenic activity that is not effectively removed by conventional methods. A consortium of isolated South African indigenous fungi A. niger, M. circinelloides, T. polyzona, T. longibrachiatum and R. microsporus, was used in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to remove PhCs, their intermediates and strongly reduce their estrogenic activity. The fungal ligninolytic enzymatic activity was determined for laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) using a spectrophotometric method. The biodegradation of PhCs and their intermediates was monitored by SPE-UPLC/MS. The in vitro estrogenic activity was assessed in the T47D-KBluc reporter gene assay. Lac, MnP and LiP production appeared to be biomass growth dependent. During a lag phase of growth, a constant biomass of about 122.04 mg/100 mL was recorded with average enzymatic activity around 63.62 U/L for Lac, 151.91 U/L for MnP and 42.12 U/L for LiP. The exponential growth phase from day 7 to day 17, was characterised by a biomass increase of 124.46 units, and an increase in enzymatic activity of 9.91 units for Lac, 99.03 units for MnP and 44.24 units for LiP. These enzymes played an important synergistic role in PhCs degradation in the cytochrome P450 system. A decrease of 13.89%, 29.7% and 16.15% in PhC concentrations was observed for CBZ, DCF and IBP, respectively, and their intermediates were identified within 4 h of incubation. The removal efficiency achieved after 24 h in the SBR was about 89.77%, 95.8% and 91.41% for CBZ, DCF and IBP, respectively. The estradiol equivalent (EEq) values of 1.71 +/- 0.30 ng/L and 2.69 +/- 0.17 ng/L were recorded at the start-up time and after 4 h, respectively. The presence of intermediates was found to induce estrogenic activity. The EEq values after 24 h incubation was found to be below the LoQ and below the LoD of the assay. None of the samples exhibited any anti-estrogenic activity. The fungal consortium inoculum was found to induce toxicity at a 0.4 x concentration, as observed under a microscope. This study revealed that the use of the fungal consortium can remove the estrogenic activity of pharmaceutical metabolites, which appeared to be the most significant contributors to the endocrine-disrupting activity of the wastewater treatment plant effluents.

AB The Tai Hu (Tai Lake) is used as a raw water reservoir for approximately ten million inhabitants predominantly in Jiangsu province, China. Algal/cyanobacterial blooms occur frequently in the eutrophic shallow lake and present a challenge for drinking water treatment. Furthermore, occasionally taste and odor (T&O) problems have been reported in drinking water. Due to the impacts of wastewater and surface water runoff, pesticides and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds must be considered as well.
   In our study, a large spectrum of emerging pollutants was analyzed in the northern part of Tai Hu. In a Zhushan Bay wetland, emerging pollutants such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and the pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and diazepam were detected. Additionally, pesticides were present in the lake water in concentrations of 0.1-0.5 mu g/L. The occurrence of antibiotic resistances at the microbial level was examined in water and sediment samples. In particular the antibiotic resistance genes sul1 and sul2, which encode for resistance against sulfonamide antibiotics, were detected in all samples. Furthermore, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(C) was detected frequently and tet(B) in 10% of the samples. Also, the genes blaTEM and ermB were detected in Tai Hu samples encoding for resistances against beta-lactams and macrolides, respectively.
   The T&O problems observed in drinking water of the Tai Hu region could not be attributed to the algae burden T&O compounds such as geosmin or 2-MIB. This study demonstrates the effects on the water treatment process caused by high amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The elevated concentration of organic compounds in raw water results in a short life span of ozone during advanced treatment. In the disinfection process, the remaining nitrogen-containing organic compounds undergo subsequent reactions. In particular, amino acids might trigger the formation of chloramine-type T&O compounds. Amino acids were detected in raw water samples taken at the inlets of the Tai Hu water treatment plants and were shown to be present in fluctuating concentrations. Most probably, lysis of algae cells during drinking water treatment due to oxidation processes such as pre-ozonation results in the release of intracellular compounds and elevated aqueous phase concentrations of DOC and DON (containing proteins, peptides, and amino acids). In laboratory experiments, it was shown that algae could be removed effectively by ultrafiltration, thus proving to be a suitable pretreatment process while avoiding cell disruption and subsequent formation of T&O compounds.
   Based on analysis of Tai Hu field samples and laboratory experiments, pilot-scale proof-of-concept studies were developed. Future studies will focus on online monitoring of drinking water treatment performance including the precursors of T&O compounds. Also, the removal of emerging chemical and microbiological pollutants will be emphasized in order to ensure high-quality drinking water.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are being increasingly included in Life Cycle Assessment studies (LCAs) since they have brought into evidence both human and ecological adverse effects due to their presence in different environmental compartments, wastewater facilities and industry. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to estimate the characterization factors (CFs) of 27 PPCPs widely used worldwide in order to incorporate their values into Life Cycle Impact Assessment studies (LCIA) or to generate a toxicity impact score ranking. Physicochemical properties, degradation rates, bioaccumulation, ecotoxicity and human health effects were collected from experimental data, recognized databases or estimated using EPI Suite (TM) and the USEtox (TM) software, and were subsequently used for estimating CFs. In addition, a Spanish toxicity impact score ranking was carried out for 49 PPCPs using the 27 newly calculated CFs, and 22 CFs already available in the literature, besides the data related to the occurrence of PPCPs in the environment in Spain. It has been highlighted that emissions into the continental freshwater compartment showed the highest CFs values for human effects (ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-3) Cases.kg(-1)), followed by emissions into the air (10(-9) to 10(-5) Cases.kg(-1)), soil (10(-11) to 10(5) Cases.kg(-1)) and seawater (10(-12) to 10(-4) Cases.kg(-1)). CFs regarding the affectation of freshwater aquatic environments were the highest of those proceeding from emissions into continental freshwater (between 1 to 104 PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)) due to the direct contact between the source of emission and the compartment affected, followed by soil (among 10(-1) to 104 PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)), and air (among 10(-2) to 10(4)-PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)) while the lowest were the CFs of continental seawater (among 10(-28) to 10(-3) PAF.m(3).day.kg(emission)(-1)). Freshwater aquatic ecotoxicological CFs are much higher than human toxicity CFs, demonstrating that the ecological impact of PPCPs in aquatic environments must be a matter of urgent attention. According to the Spanish toxicity impact score calculated, the PPCPs with the highest impact are hormones, antidepressants, fragrances, antibiotics, angiotensin receptor blockers and blood lipid regulators, which have already been found in other kinds of score rankings. These results, which were not available until now, will be useful in order to perform better LCIA studies, incorporating the micro-pollutants whose CFs have been estimated, or in order to carry out single hazard/risk environmental impact assessments.

AB This paper reported the first example on the use of chitosan films, without further modification, to remove and recover, through bio-sorption processes, the emerging pollutant Diclofenac from water. The latter was adopted as a model, among non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, by obtaining a maximum adsorption capacity, q(max), on chitosan of about 10 mg/g, under the applied experimental conditions of work. The literature gap about the use of chitosan films, which was already used for dyes and heavy metals removal, to adsorb emerging pollutants from water was covered, claiming the wide range application of chitosan films to remove a different class of pollutants. Several parameters affecting the Diclofenac adsorption process, such as the pH and ionic strength of solutions containing Diclofenac, the amount of the bio-sorbent and pollutant, and the temperature values, were investigated. The kinetics and the adsorption isotherms, along with the thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, and Delta S degrees) were also evaluated. The process occurred very efficiently, and Chitosan/Diclofenac amounts dependent, remove about the 90% of the pollutant, in 2 h, from the tested solutions, through electrostatic interaction involving the carboxylic moiety of Diclofenac and Chitosan amino groups. This finding was confirmed by the pH and salt effects on the bio-sorption process, including swelling measurements of Chitosan films and by FTIR-ATR analysis. In detail, the maximum adsorption was observed at pH 5, when pollutant and Chitosan were negatively and positively charged, respectively. By reducing or increasing the pH around this value, a reduced affinity was observed. Accordingly, the presence of salts retarded the Diclofenac removal screening its charges, which hinders the interaction with Chitosan. The sorption was spontaneous (Delta G degrees < 0) and endothermic (Delta H degrees > 0) following the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The process was Diclofenac and Chitosan amount dependent. In addition, the Freundlich and Temkin isotherms well described the process, which showed the heterogeneous character of the process. Experiments of the complete desorption were also performed by using NaCl solutions 0.25 M (like sea water salt concentration) proposing the reuse of the pollutant and the recycling of the bio-sorbent lowering the associated costs. The versatility of the adsorbent was reported by exploring the possibility to induce the Diclofenac light-induced degradation after the adsorption and by-products adsorption onto chitosan films. To emphasize the chitosan capacity of treating water, the removal of another pollutant such as Ketoprofen and the mixture of Diclofenac and Ketoprofen were investigated. In this way, a green and eco-friendly production-pollution prevention technology for removing emerging pollutants from water was presented, which reduced the overall environmental impact. This illustrated experiments both in static and dynamic conditions for potential industrial applications.

AB The contamination of waters by persistent organic pollutants, especially pharmaceutical contaminants, is one of the concerns all over the world. To date, among the treatment methods, the efficient EAOPs method have shown a high ability to treat this type of pollutant. However, conducting adequate tests for taking into account almost all possible conditions to predict the amount of pollutant removal in different conditions is still a challenge. On the other hand, achieving this aim requires a lot of cost and time. The superiority of data mining based methods over conventional mathematical methods have made these methods a good solution to solve this problem. Hence, in present study a model by employing data mining algorithms includes Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), M5 model tree, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and hybrid of LSSVM and firefly optimization algorithm (FFA), scatter interpolation method, and multi-criteria decision making, namely DID, is presented for modeling of drugs removal. For this purpose, four different inputs include current density, electrolyte concentration, pH, and electrolysis time are used for electrochemical removal of Ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a model pollutant. Subsequently, Scatter interpolation method is used for generating enough data for more accurate modeling and more reliable results. In the final part of the survey, the TOPSIS method under six scenario, is employed for ranking of algorithms by considering accuracy and time criteria. In defined scenarios for TOPSIS, six different weights are considered for time criteria as well as the weights of accuracy are considered as equal in each scenario. Also, the sum of scores of each algorithm in all scenarios is used for final decision. The finding results by TOPSIS for original data showed the superiority of LSSVM_FFA. After generating new data, the M5 and the ANFIS have better results in 0.25 time weight. However, by decreasing time weight and increasing accuracy weight (after second scenario), the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have better results. Besides, based on the sum of scores for new data, the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have superiority. Finally, it can be concluded that M5 in about to 3 s, and LSSVM_FFA in about to 17 s lead to estimate the drug removal value with good accuracy, and without needing to high cost, and several months laboratory works. Therefore, the mentioned models can be used for different tasks, such as determining the optimal removal of drug, and investigating the impact of different parameters on drug removal process, without needing to each special experiment. Thus, for generating the large data set, the results of the present study are reliable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants widely used in everyday urban activities which can be detected in surface, ground, and drinking waters. Their presence is derived from consumption of medicines, disposal of expired medications, release of treated and untreated urban effluents, and from the pharmaceutical industry. Their growing use has become an alarming environmental problem which potentially will become dangerous in the future. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about long-term effects in non-target organisms as well as for human health. Toxicity testing has indicated a relatively low acute toxicity to fish species, but no information is available on possible sublethal effects. This study provides data on the physiological pathways involved in the exposure of Atlantic salmon as representative test species to three pharmaceutical compounds found in ground, surface, and drinking waters based on the evaluation of the xenobiotic-induced impairment resulting in the activation and silencing of specific genes.
   Individuals of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr were exposed during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of three representative pharmaceutical compounds with high consumption rates: the analgesic acetaminophen (54.77 +/- 34.67 A mu g L-1), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (7.85 A +/- 0.13 A mu g L-1), and the beta-blocker atenolol (11.08 A +/- 7.98 A mu g L-1). Five immature males were selected for transcriptome analysis in brain tissues by means of a 17k salmon cDNA microarray. For this purpose, mRNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA which was labeled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized against a common pool to the arrays. Lists of significantly up- and down-regulated candidate genes were submitted to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) in order to analyze for induced pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of this method in cases of not completely annotated test organisms.
   Exposure during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of the selected pharmaceutical compounds acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol produced differences in the expression of 659, 700, and 480 candidate genes, respectively. KEGG annotation numbers (KO annotations) were obtained for between 26.57% and 33.33% of these differently expressed genes per treatment in comparison to non-exposure conditions. Pathways that showed to be induced did not always follow previously reported targets or metabolic routes for the employed treatments; however, several other pathways have been found (four or more features) to be significantly induced.
   Energy-related pathways have been altered under exposure in all the selected treatments, indicating a possible energy budget leakage due to additional processes resulting from the exposure to environmental contaminants. Observed induction of pathways may indicate additional processes involved in the mode of action of the selected pharmaceuticals which may not have been detected with conventional methods like quantitative PCR in which only suspected features are analyzed punctually for effects. The employment of novel high-throughput screening techniques in combination with global pathway analysis methods, even if the organism is not completely annotated, allows the examination of a much broader range of candidates for potential effects of exposure at the gene level.
   The continuously growing number of annotations of representative species relevant for environmental quality testing is facilitating pathway analysis processes for not completely annotated organisms. KEGG has shown to be a useful tool for the analysis of induced pathways from data generated by microarray techniques with the selected pharmaceutical contaminants acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol, but further studies have to be carried out in order to determine if a similar expression pattern in terms of fold change quantity and pathways is observed after long-term exposure. Together with the information obtained in this study, it will then be possible to evaluate the potential risk that the continuous release of these compounds may have on the environment and ecosystem functioning.

AB Biowastes produced by humans and animals are routinely disposed of on land, and concern is now growing that such practices provide a pathway for fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibacterial agents and their environmental metabolites (FQEMs) to contaminate the terrestrial environment. The focus of concern is that FQs and FQEMs may accumulate in amended soils to then adversely impact on the terrestrial environment. One postulated impact is the development of a selective environment in which FQ-resistant bacteria may grow. To find evidence in support of an accumulation of antibacterial-like activity, it was first necessary to establish whether any biologically active FQEMs could be synthesized by physicochemical factors that are normally present in the environment. However, many FQEMs are not commercially available to be used as standards in such studies. FQEMs were therefore synthesized using well-defined processes. They were subsequently analyzed using spectroscopy (UV-vis) and high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection. The antibacterial-like activities of fractionated FQEMs were then assessed in novel bacterial growth inhibition bioassays, and results were compared to those obtained from instrumental analyses.
   Parent FQs were either exposed to sunlight or were synthesized using defined aerobic microbial (Mycobacterium gilvum or a mixed culture derived from an agricultural soil) fermentation processes. Mixtures of FQEMs derived from photo- and (intracellular) microbial processes were isolated by preparative chromatography and centrifugation techniques, respectively. Mixtures were subsequently fractionated using analytical high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), and excised analytes were tested in bioautography assays for their antibacterial-like activities. Two bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Azospirillum brasilense (A. brasilense) were used as reporter organisms in testing FQ standards and any subtle differences between biologically active FQEMs of ciprofloxacin (CF).
   FQEMs produced in the photo-synthetic process had UV-vis profiles that were indistinguishable from the parent FQs, and yet mass spectral data revealed the presence of N-formylciprofloxacin (FCF). In contrast, the UV-vis profiles of FQEMs synthesized by M. gilvum and a mixed culture of microorganisms had UV-vis profiles that were similar to one another and markedly different to the parent fluoroquinolones. Mass spectral studies confirmed the presence of FCF and N-acetylciprofloxacin in both microbial ferments. In addition, a photo-FQEM (Cp 6), three M. gilvum FQEMs (Cm 5, Cm 8, and Cm 10) and a mixed culture FQEM (Cs 6) of CF and many other FQEMs of CF, norfloxacin (NF), and enrofloxacin (EF) were fractionated using HPTLC, although their identities have yet to be confirmed. Differences between bioautography results were obtained when E. coli or A. brasilense were used as reporter organisms. Parent FQs (CF and EF) and the FQEMs of CF (Cp 6, Cm 8, and Cs 6) displayed antibacterial-like activity when using E. coli as the reporter organism. In contrast, A. brasilense was insensitive to parent CF and sensitive to EF and all tested FQEMs of CF. Results are consistent with photo- and microbial processes modifying CF in different ways, with the latter changing the UV-vis chromophores. It can be inferred that a lack of detection of analytes (especially photo-FQEMs) when using UV-vis does not necessarily indicate an absence of analyte. Additionally, similarities between the UV-vis profiles of FQEMs extracted from the (monoculture) M. gilvum and the mixed culture microbial aerobic ferments are consistent with similar processes operating in both ferments. Results of HPTLC and bioautography studies revealed that mixtures of (photo- and microbial) FQEMs could be fractionated into individual components.
   Bioactive FQEMs of ciprofloxacin, as a representative FQ, can be synthesized by photo- and microbial processes, and their detection required the use of both instrumental and bioautography analytical techniques. It is likely that such FQEMs will also be present on agricultural land that has been repeatedly amended with FQ-contaminated biosolids.
   The use of instrumental analytical techniques alone and especially photometric detection techniques will underestimate antibacterial-like activities of FQEMs. Moreover, the extraction technique(s) and the selected toxicological endpoint(s) require careful consideration when assessing bioactivity. It is therefore recommended that instrumental analytical techniques and several bioautography assays be performed concurrently, and bioautography assays should use a variety of reporter organisms. Two types of bacterial growth bioassays are recommended in any assessment of antibacterial-like activity derived from CF (and possibly from other FQs). A standardized E. coli bioassay should be used as a general screening procedure to facilitate intra- and inter-laboratory exchange of data. Additionally, soil-specific (region-specific) growth inhibition bioassays should be undertaken using several species of endemic soil bacteria. It is likely that the two sets of data will be useful in future risk assessment processes.

AB Antibacterial fluoroquinolones (FQs) are third-generation antibiotics that are commonly used as therapeutic treatments of respiratory and urinary tract infections. They are used far less in intensively farmed animal production systems, though their use may be permitted in the veterinary treatments of flocks or in medicated feeds. When used, only a fraction of ingested parent FQ actually reaches the in vivo target site of infection, while the remainder is excreted as the parent FQ and its metabolized products. In many species' metabolism, enrofloxacin (EF) is converted into ciprofloxacin (CF) while both FQs are classified as parent FQs in human treatments. It is therefore likely that both FQs and their metabolic products will contribute to a common pool of metabolites in biological wastes. Wastes from intensive farming practices are either directly applied to agricultural land without treatment or may be temporarily stored prior to disposal. However, human waste is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) where it is converted into biosolids. In the storage or treatment process of STPs, FQs and their in vivo metabolites are further converted into other environmental metabolites (FQEMs) by ex vivo physicochemical processes that act and interact to produce complex mixtures of FQEMs, some of which have antibacterial-like activities. Biosolids are then often applied to agricultural land as a fertilizer amendment where FQs and FQEMs can be further converted into additional FQEMs by soil processes. It is therefore likely that FQ-contaminated biowaste-treated soils will contain complex mixtures of FQEMs, some of which may have antibacterial-like activities that may be expressed on bacteria endemic to the receiving agricultural soil environment. Concern has arisen in the scientific and in the general community that repeated use of FQ-contaminated biowaste as fertilizer amendments of nutrient-impoverished agricultural land may create a selective environment in which FQ-resistant bacteria might grow. The likelihood of this happening will depend, to some extent, on whether bioactive FQEMs are first synthesized from the parent FQs by the action and interaction of in vivo and ex vivo processes producing bioactive FQEMs in biowastes and biosolids. The postulated creation of a selective environment will also depend, in part, on whether such bioactive FQEMs are biologically available to bacteria, which may, in turn, be influenced by soil type, amendment regime, and the persistence of the bioactive FQEMs. Additionally, soil bacteria and soil processes may be affected in different ways or extents by bioactive FQEMs that could possibly act additively or synergistically at ecological targets in these non-target bacteria. This is an important consideration, since, while parent FQs have well-defined ecological targets (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) and modes of bactericidal action, the FQEMs and their possible modes of action on the many different species of soil bacteria is less well studied. It is therefore understandable that there is a lack of conclusive evidence directly attributing biosolid usage to any increase in FQ-resistant bacteria detected in biowaste-amended agricultural soil. However, a lack of evidence may simply imply that a causal relationship between biosolid usage programs and any detection of low levels of FQ-resistant bacteria in soils has yet to be established, rather than an assumption of no relationship whatsoever.
   Based on results presented in this paper, the precautionary principle should be applied in the usage of FQ-contaminated biosolids as fertilizer amendments of agricultural land. The aim of this research was to test whether any bioactive FQEMs of EF could be synthesized by aerobic fermentation processes using Mycobacterium gilvum (American Tissue Culture Collection) and a mixed culture of microorganisms derived from an agricultural soil. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and bioautography were tested as screening techniques in the detection and analysis of bioactive FQEMs.
   FQEMs derived from M. gilvum and mixed (soil) culture aerobic ferments were fractionated using preparative HPTLC. A standard strain of Escherichia coli was then used as the reporter organism in a bioautography assay in the detection of bioactive-FQEMs on a mid-section of the HPTLC plate. Plate sections were reassembled, and a photograph was taken under low-intensity ultraviolet (UV) light to reveal regions that contained analytes that had UV chromophores and antibacterial-like activities.
   Many fractionated FQEMs displayed antibacterial-like activity while bound to silica gel HPTLC plates. These results also provide evidence that sufficient quantities of biologically active FQEMs were biologically available from a silica gel surface to prevent the adherent growth of E. coli. Six to seven FQEMs derived from EF using aerobic fermentation processes had antibacterial-like activities, while two FQEMs were also detectable using UV light. Furthermore, similar banding patterns of antibacterial-like activity were observed in both the monoculture (M. gilvum) and mixed culture bioautography assays, indicating that similar processes operated in both aerobic fermentations, either producing similar biologically active FQEMs or biologically active FQEMs that had similar physicochemical properties in both ferments. The simplest explanation for these findings is that the tested agricultural soil also contained mycobacteria that metabolized EF in a similar way to the purchased standard monoculture M. gilvum. Additionally, the marked contrast between the bioautography results and the UV results indicated that the presence of UV chromophores is not a prerequisite for the detection of antibacterial-like activity.
   A reliance on spectrophotometric techniques in the detection of bioactive FQEMs in the environment may underestimate component antibacterial-like activity and, possibly, total antibacterial-like activity expressed by EF and its FQEMs. The described bioautography method provides a screening technique with which antibacterial-like activities derived from EF and possibly other FQs can be detected directly on silica gel HPTLC plates.
   It is recommended that both bioassay and instrumental analytical techniques be used in any measurement of hazard and risk relating to antibacterial-like activities in the environment that are derived from fluoroquinolone antibiotics and their environmental metabolites.
