AB The occurrence and removal rate of seven pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, fluoxetine, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin), two metabolites (norfluoxetine, clofibric acid), one degradation product (4-isobutylacetophenone) and 3 estrogens (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estrone) were studied in the inlet and outlet of a tertiary sewage treatment plant (STP) in Sweden as well as between different treatment steps in the STP which includes a conventional activated sludge step. Pharmaceuticals in raw household and raw hospital sewage streams leading to the STP were as well investigated. Hydraulic retention times (HRT) of each treatment step was considered for sampling and for the calculation of the removal rates. These rates were above 90%, except for diclofenac, clofibric acid, estrone and ofloxacin. However, only diclofenac and naproxen showed significant effluent loads (>145 mg/d/1000 inh). Diclofenac was not eliminated during the treatment and in fact even higher concentrations were found at the effluent than in the inlet of the STP. 17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol was not detected in any of the samples. Results indicate that a STP such as the one in Kristianstad, Sweden, with a tertiary treatment is sufficient to remove significantly most of the investigated pharmaceuticals. The chemical treatment improved the removal of several pharmaceuticals especially the antibiotics, which showed step removal rates between 55 and 70%. The expected concentration levels of the pharmaceuticals in the surface water (dilution 1 to 10) close to the outlet of the STP are below the no-observed effect-concentration (NOEC). However, despite that this would imply no important effects in the aquatic environment one cannot rule out negative consequences nearby the STP because most of the NOEC values are derived from acute toxicity data. This may underestimate the real impact of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging pollutants can reach the environment through the sludge of Wastewater Treatment Plants. In this work, the use of Trametes versicolor in biopiles at lab-scale was studied, evaluating its capacity to remove the most hydrophobic Pharmaceuticals and assessing the evolution of the biopiles microbial communities. The total removal of drugs at real concentrations from sewage sludge was assessed for non-inoculated and fungal inoculated biopiles, testing if the re-inoculation of the biopiles after 22 days of treatment would improve the removal yields. It was found that 2 out of the 15 initially detected pharmaceuticals were totally degraded after 22 days, and re-inoculated fungal biopiles achieved higher removal rates than non-re-inoculated fungal biopiles for single compounds and for all the drugs simultaneously: 66.45% and 49.18% re-inoculated and non-re-inoculated biopiles, respectively. Finally, the study of the bacterial and fungal communities revealed that fungal inoculated and non-inoculated biopiles evolved to similar communities adapted to the presence of those drugs.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), consisting of pharmaceuticals, industrial/household additives, and their transformation products, have been widely detected in surface water bodies and may lead to potential ecological risks. Installing a tertiary treatment step in sewage treatment plants (STP) is an effective method to control their contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale biofilter was set up with natural manganese oxides as carrier materials at a local STP to treat the real secondary effluent. This innovative and simple reactor was on-site operated for approximately 500 days. Some EOCs were effectively removed after adaptation, including 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (98%), gabapentin (97%), tramadol (93%), carbamazepine (91%), benzotriazole (91%), sulfamethoxazole (88%), erythromycin (86%). By contrast, the removal of others can be obtained without adaptation, including diclofenac (91%), carboxy-acyclovir (91%), iomeprol (89%), 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (87%), 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (86%), acyclovir (73%), tolyltriazole (70%). Overall, 80% of the total mass of 15 detected EOCs was eliminated from the secondary effluent. In addition, 53% of UV254 was removed from wastewater, indicating the aromatic content was damaged to a certain extent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation has been considered to be an effective means for the reduction of excess sludge in recent years. However, it remains largely unknown whether hydrophobic organic micro-pollutants, which are originally adsorbed on activated sludge, will be released into wastewater upon ozonation because of sludge solubilization. This study investigated the degradation efficiencies of several typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during sludge ozonation, including estrone (El), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), and 4-nonylphenol (NP). Results indicate that the EDCs present in activated sludge could be effectively removed by O-3 even though the apparent rate constants in sludge were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than those in water. However, the applied O-3 dose should be prudently controlled because a low dose (e.g., 29 mg O-3 g(-1) SS) may lead to an increase of BPA and NP concentrations in the liquid phase of activated sludge. Furthermore, H2O2 addition or pH adjustment could improve the removal of most studied EDCs, but exert a negative effect on the more hydrophobic and refractory compound, NP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The influence of seasonal changes in water conditions and parameters on several major pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) and s-triazine herbicides was assessed in the wastewater and sewage treatment plant (WSTP) effluent as well as the downstream surface water from sites on the Canadian side of the upper Detroit River, between the Little River WSTP and near the water intake of a major drinking water treatment facility for the City of Windsor (ON, Canada). The assessed PhACs were of neutral (carbamazepine, cotinine, caffeine, cyclophosphamide, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, pentoxifylline, and trimethoprim) and acidic (ibuprofen, bezafibrate, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, indomethacin, naproxen, and ketoprofen) varieties. The major assessed s-triazine herbicides were atrazine, simazine, propazine, prometon, ametryn, prometryn, and terbutryn. At sampling times from September 2002 to June 2003, 15 PhACs were detected in the WSTP effluent at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 1,244 ng/L. The PhAC concentrations decreased by as much 92 to 100% at the Little River/Detroit River confluence because of the river dilution effect, with further continual decreases at sites downstream from the WSTP The only quantifiable s-triazine in WSTP effluent, atrazine, ranged from 6.7 to 200 ng/L and was higher in Detroit River surface waters than in WSTP effluent. Only carbamazepine, cotinine, and atrazine were detectable at the low-nanogram and subnanogram levels in surface waters near a drinking water intake site. Unlike the PhACs, atrazine in the Detroit River is not attributable to point sources, and it is heavily influenced by seasonal agricultural usage and runoff. Detroit River surface water concentrations of carbamazepine, cotinine, and atrazine may present a health concern to aquatic wildlife and to humans via the consumption of drinking water.

AB In response to the U.S. National Academies' call for a better assessment of chemical pollutants contained in the approximately 7 million dry tons of digested municipal sludge produced annually in the United States, the mean concentration of 72 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) were determined in 110 biosolids samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its 2001 National Sewage Sludge Survey Composite samples of archived biosolids, collected at 94 U.S. wastewater treatment plants from 32 states and the District of Columbia, were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using EPA Method 1694 Thirty-eight (54%) of the 72 analytes were detected in at least one composite sample at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 48 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Triclocarban and triclosan were the most abundant analytes with mean concentrations of 36 +/- 8 and 12.6 +/- 3.8 mg kg(-1) (n = 5), respectively, accounting for 65% of the total PPCP mass found The loading to U.S. soils from nationwide biosolids recycling was estimated at 210-250 metric tons per year for the sum of the 72 PPCPs investigated The results of this nationwide reconnaissance of PPCPs in archived U.S biosolids mirror in contaminant occurrences, frequencies and concentrations, those reported by the U.S. EPA for samples collected in 2006/2007 This demonstrates that PPCP releases in U.S. biosolids have been ongoing for many years and the most abundant PPCPs appear to show limited fluctuations in mass over time when assessed on a nationwide basis The here demonstrated use of five mega composite samples holds promise for conducting cost-effective, routine monitoring on a regional and national basis (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Background: Due to the complexities involved in the extraction of micropollutants, the information regarding micropollutants like paraben in wastewater and sludge is scarce. The aim of this study was to adopt a microwave-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (MADLLME) method for the extraction of parabens in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
   Methods: A mixed stock solution of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butyl-parabens with concentration of 10 mg/mL were prepared in methanol. To validate this method, the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, and m/z were measured. To adopt this method in different condition, the effect of pH (3, 7, 9, and 12), microwave power (180, 300, 450, and 600 W), solvent type (methanol, acetone, methanol/water, acetone/water), and 1 g folorisil were assessed. After adopting MADLLME method, the paraben fate of this WWTP was evaluated through mass loading and emission.
   Results: The optimum performance of MADLLME method was observed at pH = 7, microwave power - 450 W, reaction time - 30 s, and methanol as the solvent. The total concentrations of four paraben metabolites in the WWTP ranged between 2505 ng/L in influent, 1953 ng./L in effluent, and 8.03 ng/g at wet weight sludge samples. The total mass loading and emission of four parabens in this WWTP was 0.672 mg/d/1000 people and 0.186 mg/d/1000 people, respectively.
   Conclusion: MADLLIVIE method seems to be an excellent alternative, as a given extraction technique, for determining various groups of emerging micropollutants in different matrices.

AB Thousands of tons of pharmaceuticals are introduced into the aqueous environment due to their incomplete elimination during treatment process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water treatment plants (WTPs). The presence of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment is of a great interest because of their potential to cause negative effects. Furthermore, drugs can undergo different processes leading to the formation of new transformation products, which may be more toxic than the parent compound. In light of these concerns, within the research a new, rapid and sensitive analytical procedure for the determination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals from different classes using solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) technique in different water samples was developed. This methodology was applied to investigate the occurrence, removal efficiency of 25 pharmaceuticals during wastewater and drinking water treatment, and seasonal variability in the amount of selected pharmaceuticals in WWTP and WTP over a year. The most often detected analytes in water samples were carbamazepine (100 % of samples) and ibuprofen (98 % of samples), concluding that they may be considered as pollution indicators of the aqueous environment in tested area. Highly polar compound, metformin, was determined at very high concentration level of up to 8100 ng/L in analyzed water samples. Drugs concentrations were much higher in winter season, especially for non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and caffeine, probably due to the inhibited degradation related to lower temperatures and limited sunlight. Carbamazepine was found to be the most resistant drug to environmental degradation and its concentrations were at similar levels during four seasons.

AB Due to a widespread usage and a lack of biodegradability, Synthetic Musk Compounds (SMC) can be found as ubiquitous environmental pollutants, which enter the environment especially via domestic wastewater. We investigated the occurrence and fate of six Polycyclic and two Nitro Musk Compounds in water and sediment samples from 13 locations along the river Saale in the municipal area of Halle (Saale), Germany on a monthly basis for one year. Sample analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and Galaxolide (R) (HHCB) was by far the most abundant analyte in all water samples. The remaining substances could be detected at least once, but mostly in concentrations below their respective Limits of Quantification. Highest concentrations for all detected compounds were determined in final effluent of the local sewage treatment plant (STP). Based on statistical analysis of the data obtained, a second, much smaller emission source could be identified in the examined area. In sediment samples five out of eight analytes could be detected. The analyte contents were very variable, depending on the sediment's character.

AB This study examines the transformation and removal of the atypical antipsychotics amisulpride and sulpiride and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine were selected using a tailored non-target screening approach. In WWTPs, lamotrigine concentrations increased from 1.1 to 1.6 mu g/L awhile sulpiride and amisulpride exhib, ited similar concentrations, up to 1.1 mu g/L and 1.3 mu g/L respectively. It was found that N2-glucuronide conjugates of lamotrigine were cleaved to form lamotrigine. Both lamotrigine and amisulpride were detected in groundwater with a concentration of 0.07 mu g/L. Sulpiride was identified but not quantified. This demonstrates that amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine might be used as indicators for treated wastewater in raw waters used for drinking water production.
   Furthermore, it could be shown that all three pharmaceutical compounds are efficiently oxidized by ozonation, leading mainly to N-oxide oxidation products. No significant removal of the N-oxides of amisulpride, sulpiride and lamotrigine was observed in the bench-scale biodegradation experiments with activated sludge. This indiCated their high biological persistence. Therefore, N-oxides might be appropriate as indicators for post-ozonation as a major technology for the advanced treatment of secondary effluent.

ID DOPED DIAMOND ELECTRODES
AB Wastewater effluents from sewage treatment plants (STP) are important point sources for residues of pharmaceuticals and complexing agents in the aquatic environment. For this reason a research project, which started in December 2006, was established to eliminate pharmaceutical substances and complexing agents found in wastewater as micropollutants. For the treatment process a combination of anodic oxidation by boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and ozonation is examined and presented. For the ozone production a non-conventional, separate reactor was used, in which ozone was generated by electrolysis with diamond electrodes For the determination of the achievable remediation rates four complexing agents (e.g., EDTA, NTA) and eight pharmaceutical substances (e.g., diazepam, carbamazepin) were analyzed in several test runs under different conditions (varied flux, varied current density for the diamond electrode and the ozone producing electrode of the ozone generator, different packing materials for the column in the ozone injection system). The flowrates of the treated water samples were varied from 3 L/h up to 26 L/h. For the anodic oxidation the influence of the current density was examined in the range between 22.7 and 45.5 mA/cm(2), for the ozone producing reactor two densities (1.8 a/cm(2) and 2.0 A/cm(2)) were tested. Matrix effects were investigated by test runs with samples from the effluent of an STP and synthetic waste water. Therefore the impact of the organic material in the samples could be determined by the comparison of the redox potential and the achievable elimination rates of the investigated substances. Comparing both technologies anodic oxidation seems to be superior to ozonation in each investigated area. With the used technology of anodic oxidation elimination rates up to 99% were reached for the investigated pharmaceutical substances at a current density of 45.5 mA/cm(2) and a maximum sample flux of 26 L/h.

AB The high levels of antibiotic residues in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) make these plants the hotspots for the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigated the fate and removal of 11 ARG subtypes for sulfonamide, tetracycline, beta-lactam,and macrolide resistance in each processing stage of two full-scale PWWTPs in northern China. The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from (2.56 +/- 0.13) x 10(1) to (2.36 +/- 0.11) x 10(7) copies/ml. The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for only 0.03-78.1 % of influents of the two PWWTPs, while the majority of the ARGs were transported to the dewatered sludge with concentrations from (2.65 +/- 0.43) x 10(5) to (4.27 +/- 0.03) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). The total loads of ARGs discharged through dewatered sludge plus effluent was 1.01-14.09-fold higher than that in the raw influents, suggesting the proliferation of ARGs occurred in the wastewater treatment. The proliferation of ARGs mainly occurs in biological treatment process, such as aeration tank, anoxic tank, sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and bio-contact oxidation, facilitates the proliferation of various ARGs, implying significant replication of certain ARG subtypes may be attributable to microbial growth. Chemical oxidation seems promising to remove ARGs, with removal efficiency ranged from 29.3 to 85.7 %, while the partial correlation analysis showed significant correlations between antibiotic concentration and ARG removal. Thus, the high antibiotic residues within the PWWTPs may have an influence on the proliferation, fate, and removal of the associated ARG subtypes.

AB The role of microbial communities in the degradation of trace organic contaminants in the environment is little understood. In this study, the biotransformation potential of 27 pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds was examined in parallel with a characterization of the native microbial community in water samples fromfour sites variously impacted by urban run-off andwastewater discharge in LakeMead, Nevada and Arizona, USA. Samples included relatively pristine Colorado River water at the upper end of the lake, nearly pure tertiarytreated municipal wastewater entering via the Las Vegas Wash, and waters of mixed influence (Las Vegas Bay and Boulder Basin), which represented a gradient of treatedwastewater effluent impact. Microbial diversity analysis based on 16S rRNA gene censuses revealed the community at this site to be distinct from the less urbanimpacted locations, although all sites were similar in overall diversity and richness. Similarly, Biolog EcoPlate assays demonstrated that the microbial community at Las Vegas Wash was the most metabolically versatile and active. Organic contaminants added as a mixture to laboratory microcosms were more rapidly and completely degraded in the most wastewater-impacted sites (Las Vegas Wash and Las Vegas Bay), with the majority exhibiting shorter half-lives than at the other sites or in a bacteriostatic control. Although the reasons for enhanced degradation capacity in the wastewater-impacted sites remain to be established, these data are consistent with the acclimatization of native microorganisms (either through changes in community structure or metabolic regulation) to effluent-derived trace contaminants. This study suggests that in urban, wastewaterimpacted watersheds, prior exposure to organic contaminants fundamentally alters the structure and function of microbial communities, which in turn translates into greater potential for the natural attenuation of these compounds compared to more pristine sites.

AB Conventional activated sludge treatment plants have limited capability to remove micropollutants from municipal wastewater, and as a consequence, concentrations of micropollutants in water bodies are increasing. This creates concerns due to their potentially harmful effects on the aquatic environment, as well as needs to improve or replace the traditional wastewater treatment processes with novel process concepts. In this study, two novel process concept alternatives for enhanced removal of micropollutants are examined. The experiments were done in pilot scale with real wastewater of a small municipality. In the first concept, a membrane bioreactor process (MBR) without phosphorus precipitation was combined with high permeability nanofiltration (NF), and in the other, the MBR with the precipitation of phosphorus was combined with advanced oxidation implemented by pulsed corona discharge (PCD). The results showed that the MBR processes were insufficient for removing unreadily biodegradable micropollutants, such as carbamazepine and diclofenac. However, combining the nanofiltration or PCD oxidation step with the MBR enabled significant enhancement in the removal of micropollutants. Over 84% removal was reached with nanofiltration (NF270) for most of the studied micropollutants, except caffeine and hydrochlorothiazide. The performance of PCD oxidation (oxidation energy 0.2 kWhim(3)) in the removal of micropollutants exceeded the one of nanofiltration; over 90% removal of most of the studied micropollutants was reached, and the pollutants were degraded below 0.1 mu g/L concentration. Thus, the total removal of micropollutants was better in the concept combining MBR and oxidation treatment. However, the concept combining MBR and nanofiltration provided better overall removal of organic compounds (removal of COD and DOC > 99%), and it also enabled the recovery of phosphorus as a concentrated solution.

AB Achromobacter denitnficans strain PR1, previously found to harbour specific degradation pathways with high sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation rates, was bioaugmented into laboratory-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) operated under aerobic conditions to treat SMX-containing real domestic wastewater. Different hydraulic retention times (HRTs), which is related to reaction time and loading rates, were considered and found to affect the SMX removal efficiency. The availability of primary substrates was important in both bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented activated sludge (AS) for cometabolism of SMX. High HRT (24 h) resulted in low food to microorganism ratio (F/M) and low SMX removal, due to substrate limitation. Decrease in HRT from 24 h to 12 h, 6 h and finally 4 h led to gradual increases in primary substrates availability, e.g. organic compounds and ammonia, resulted in increased SMX removal efficiency and degradation rate, and is more favorable for high-rate wastewater treatment processes. After inoculation into the MBRs, the bioaugmentation strain was sustained in the reactor for a maximum of 31 days even though a significant decrease in abundance was observed. The bioaugmented MBRs showed enhanced SMX removal, especially under SMX shock loads compared to the control MBRs. The results of this study indicate that re-inoculation is required regularly after a period of time to maintain the removal efficiency of the target compound. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence and fate of pharmaceutical residues in environmental samples are of great interest. There is a vast number of studies published regarding their input, presence, effects and risks in ecosystems. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the primary source of input of these contaminants in the environment is from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). It is therefore essential to evaluate the efficiency of commonly used treatments and the necessity of applying novel purification processes in order to eliminate or reduce the concentration of pharmaceuticals from wastewater or from the effluent of WWTPs. The aim of this work was to quantify twenty-three pharmaceutical compounds in the aqueous phase at different stages of a conventional and a natural WWTP situated in Gran Canaria (Spain). The results indicate concentration levels in the range of 0.004 +/- 0.001 to 59.2 +/- 11.7 mu g L-1 and 0.018 +/- 0.001 to 148 +/- 14.7 mu g L-1 from conventional and natural WWTPs, respectively. Better efficiency was, however, offered by the conventional WWTP with a removal median of 99.7%. In addition, the impact on different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish) was assessed in terms of risk quotients. The results reveal a possible highly harmful effect towards organisms by gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and, ofloxacin. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are commonly found in wastewater influent. However, little research has focused on determining their impact on fundamental processes in wastewater treatment such as nitrogen removal. In this study, focus was placed on 4 commonly occurring PhACs (ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil). Their effect was ascertained in the ammonia oxidizing bacterium (AOB), Nitrosomonas europaea in terms of membrane integrity and nitrite production. These PhACs were shown to inhibit nitrite production at concentrations of 1 and 10 mu M while no effect was observed at 0.1 mu M. The maximum observed nitrification inhibition was 25%, 29%, 22% and 26% for ketoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, respectively. A decrease in the live/dead ratio ranging from 10% to 16% suggests that these PhACs affect membrane integrity in N. europaea. The difference in nitrite production between PhACs treated cells and non PhAC treated controls was still significant following washing suggesting that inhibition is irreversible. Finally, nitrite production when adjusted to the live fraction of cells was also found to decrease suggesting that PhACs inhibited the activity of surviving cells. These results suggest that the presence of PhACs may affect AOB activity and may impact nitrogen removal, a key function in wastewater treatment. Follow up studies with additional AOB and in mixed culture are needed to further confirm these results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of certain pharmaceutical compounds in ground- and surface waters may constitute a serious environmental problem, even at low concentrations. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment indicates incomplete removal of these pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study four representative pharmaceutical compounds were identified and quantified in influent and effluent of WWTPs around the Region of Murcia. In addition, the removal efficiencies of the five different treatment systems employed by these WWTPs were evaluated for the four pharmaceutical compounds. Influent and effluent wastewaters were sampled on a weekly basis during four consecutive weeks and compound concentrations were quantitatively determined by HPLC-DAD.
   Pharmaceuticals were detected at mu g/L levels (0.34-26.52 mu g/L) in influent and effluent samples from all five different systems of the twelve WWTPs sampled in this work. The two most abundant pharmaceutical compounds were carbamazepine and naproxen. WWTPs that worked with extended aeration activated sludge processes, coagulation-flocculation, sand filtration and as tertiary treatment processes are used ultraviolet and chlorination systems (EAAS + C-F + SF + UV + Cl) removed better carbamazepine and ketoprofen than conventional activated sludge system with a double aeration tank, sand filtration, lamination, coagulation-flocculation and as tertiary treatment processes are used ultraviolet systems (CAS-DS + L + C-F + SF + UV) that removed better naproxen and diclofenac.

AB Agricultural irrigation using raw wastewater is a popular practice in developing countries. However, as endocrine disrupting chemicals have been found in this water, the potential pollution of soil and water sources has become a source of concern. Such pollutants may be removed during the passage of wastewater through the soil by degradation and/or sorption. In this study the sorption and mobility of bis-2-ethyl(hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) in three different soils (Leptosol, Phaeozem and Vertisol) was compared. The distribution coefficients showed that DEHP is rapidly sorbed onto the three tested soils (K-d between 1.8 x 10(4) and 4.2 x 0(4) L/kg), while sorption of 4-NP (K-d between 15 and 80 L/kg) was weaker. In batch experiments the soil sorption capacity observed was as follows: Vertisol > Phaeozem > Leptosol for both compounds. However, in column experiments the retardation factor (R-F) for 4-NP was higher than for the DEHP in the three soils. This suggests the possible migration of DEHP through the soil via colloids. The column results were found consistent with those observed in the field. It was concluded that the risk of groundwater contamination is higher for Leptosol soil than for Phaeozem and Vertisol soils and that DEHP can reach the aquifer prior to 4-NP.

AB Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) are surfactants often used in applications that result in their disposal and treatment in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, three municipal activated sludge WWTPs, receiving primarily residential wastewater, were monitored, with their receiving waters, to determine the occurrence of NPEs and their biodegradation metabolites, including nonylphenol (NP), low-mole and higher-mole nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2-8, and NPE >= 9), and nonylphenol ether carboxylates (NPECs). The facilities were moderately sized and operating normally when influent and effluent samples were taken. Treatment efficiencies, taking into account concentrations of the parent ethoxylate and metabolites, ranged from 97.2 to 99.8%. Samples of receiving stream water, sediment, and pore water were collected upstream, downstream at the end of the mixing zones, and farther downstream from the WWTP discharges, to determine the occurrence of NPE and their metabolites and to assess the potential effect on the receiving stream ecosystems. Concentrations of nonylphenol or total nonylphenol equivalents measured upstream (<0.02 to 1.29 mu g/L), at the end of the mixing zone (0.2 to 3.15 mu g/L), and farther downstream (<0.02 to 1.84 mu g/L) were compared with the recently established national ambient water quality chronic criteria of 6.6 mu g/L. On the basis of this analysis, the likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic species within the three receiving streams is low. Water Environ. Res., 82, 447 ( 2010).

AB Novel wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are based on a partial nitritation-anammox (PN-anammox) process, enable higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery to produce biogas and lower treatment costs. In this study, rotating belt filters (RBFs) were examined in different configurations to identify the opportunities for RBFs to be included in novel WWTP configurations. RBFs enable recovery of 22-37% of the influent COD and removal of 34-56% of hydrophobic organic micropollutants (OMPs). However, the effluent was not suitable for treatment in a PN-anammox process due to its high COD. Chemically enhanced settling (CES) enabled these limitations to be overcome and caused an increase in OMP removal to 73-94%. However, a dose of 300 mg L-1 of ferric chloride was required to produce a suitable effluent for a PN-anammox reactor. The combination of RBFs and CES not only produced effluents suitable for treatment in PN-anammox units but also decreased the alkalinity consumption and the required chemical dose 3-fold to achieve comparable COD recovery and OMP removal. The methane yield of the combined sludges that were produced (184 L(N) CH4 per kg CODinfluent) was 75% higher than that obtained from a conventional wastewater treatment (105 L(N) CH4 per kg CODinfluent), and the electricity requirements decreased from 0.54 to 0.41 kWh m(-3) of treated wastewater. The energetic calculations showed that a WWTP incorporating this combined treatment could attain energy autarky with 29% lower operational costs than that of a conventional treatment (0.022 vs. 0.031 (sic) m(-3)) as long as a minimum alkalinity-to-ammonium ratio of 1-1.25 g IC to g NH4+-N was ensured in the effluent of the combined treatment.

AB The aim of this study is to compare measured and predicted concentrations of 11 antibiotics and the antiepileptic carbamazepine in wastewater and surface water and to discuss the accuracy and usefulness of applied predictive models in assessing their concentrations. The occurrence (exposure assessment) of the target compounds was monitored in the influent and effluent of a large municipal wastewater treatment plant, and in its receiving water body, situated in the Po Valley, Italy. Information on the consumption and sales of pharmaceuticals in Italy, along with data related to their excretion and removal during wastewater treatment, were used to predict the concentrations of the selected pharmaceuticals for the studied site. The measured and predicted concentrations were compared for all three sampling points, and according to a criterion available in literature and already adopted in similar studies, the prediction was considered "acceptable" when the ratio of predicted and measured concentrations was between 0.5 and 2. The results show that the concentrations were accurately predicted for ciprofloxacin in wastewaters, and for azithromycin, trimethoprim and carbamazepine in surface water. For all the other compounds and sampling points, the difference between the measured and the predicted concentrations was very high. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed and the main potential factors that influence both measured and predicted concentrations are identified by means of an assessment of the uncertainties in the measured values and sensitivity of all the parameters required for predicting concentration ones. The potential factors are sampling mode for measured values and dilution factor, removal and excretion for predicted ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantitative analysis of human urinary metabolites as biomarkers in wastewater streams has been used to estimate the rates of illicit drug use in the wider community. The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The activated sludge modelling framework for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these compounds is considered.

AB Caffeine, a purine alkaloid drug, has been recognized as a contaminant of water bodies in various climatic regions, however, these environmental caffeine concentrations are the first to be reported in the tropical Caribbean. The major objective of this study was to develop an improved method to extract caffeine from surface and wastewaters in the warm Caribbean environment and measure caffeine concentrations in highly populated areas in Barbados. Caffeine was extracted from water via solid phase extraction (SPE); the acidified water samples were loaded onto C-18 cartridges and eluted with pure chloroform. The extracted caffeine was quantified using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy - multiple reaction monitoring (GC-MS/MS-MRM). Method detection limits of 0.2 ng L-1 from 1 L water samples were achieved. Caffeine was detected in all environmental water samples investigated. The concentrations of caffeine in surface waters were detected in the range 0.1 - 6.9 mu g L-1. The two wastewater treatment plants, primary and secondary treatment systems, significantly differed in their ability to eliminate caffeine in the raw sewage (38% and 99% caffeine removal efficiencies respectively). Thus, it may be essential to employ secondary treatment to effectively remove caffeine from wastewater systems in Barbados. Caffeine in water bodies are principally attributed to anthropogenic sources as caffeine-producing plants are not commonly grown on the island of Barbados. The study also shows the recalcitrance of caffeine to hydrolytic degradation.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a fugacity-based analysis of the fate of selected industrial compounds (alkylphenols and phthalates) with endocrine disrupting properties in a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP A) in South East Queensland, Australia. Using mass balance principles, a fugacity model was developed for correlating and predicting the steady-state-phase concentrations, the process stream fluxes, and the fate of four phthalates and four alkylphenols in WWTP A. Input data are the compound's physicochemical properties, measured concentrations and the plant's operating design and parameters. The relative amounts of chemicals that are likely to be volatilized, sorbed to sludge, biotransformed, and discharge in the effluent water was determined. Since it was difficult to predict biotransformation, measured concentrations were used to calibrate the model in terms of biotransformation rate constant. Results obtained by applying the model for the eight compounds showed <40% differences between most of the estimated and measured data from WWTP A. All eight compounds that were modelled in this study had high removal efficacy from WWTP A. Apart from benzyl butyl phthalate and bisphenol A, the majority is removed via biotransformation followed by a lesser proportion removed with the primary sludge. Fugacity analysis provides useful insight into compound fate in a WWTP and with further calibration and validation the model should be useful for correlative and predictive purposes.

AB The behavior of 10 micropollutants, i.e. four estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17a-ethynylestradiol), carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), triclosan, oxybenzone, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A, was investigated in a typical domestic wastewater treatment plant. LC-MS and yeast estrogen screen bioassay were used to study the changes in micropollutants and estrogenicity across unit processes in the treatment system. Primary treatment via sedimentation showed that only 4-nonylphenol was removed, but led to no significant change in estrogenicity. Secondary treatment by the biological nitrification-dentrification process showed complete removal of oxybenzone and partial removal of the estrogens, which led to a decrease in estrogenic activity from 80 to 48 ng/L as estradiol equivalent (EEq). Ultraviolet treatment completely degraded the estrogens and triclosan, but failed to lower the concentrations of bisphenol A, SMX, and CBZ; a decrease in estrogenic activity from 48 to 5 ng/L EEq across the unit, a value that was only slightly larger than the observed EEq of 1 ng/L for the deionized control. Similarly, the anaerobic digestion of sludge completely degraded estrogens, oxybenzone, and SMX, but had no impact on bisphenol A, triclosan, and CBZ. The study emphasises the need to complement chemical analyses with estrogenic bioassays to evaluate the efficacy of waste water treatment plants.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals is increasing in both hospitals and households. After administration, many compounds enter the water cycle as parent compounds or their metabolites via excretion. Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants are unable to efficiently remove all the different compounds found in sewage and, consequently, treated effluents are one of the main sources of persistent micropollutants in the environment. Hospital patients are administered relatively high quantities of drugs and therefore hospital wastewaters can consistently contribute to treatment plant influent loads, with the magnitude of environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals originating from hospital effluents largely unknown. This study has therefore developed a framework to enable authorities responsible for hospital management and environmental health to evaluate such risk, considering site-specific information such as the contribution of human population and hospital sizes, wastewater treatment removal efficiency, and potential dilution in the receiving water body. The framework was applied to three case studies, that are representative of frequent situations in many countries, and findings demonstrated that the degree of risk posed by any compound was site-specific and depended on a combination of several factors: compound concentration and toxicity, compound removal efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant and dilution factor.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as one of the most important sources of antibiotics in the environment. The occurrence, seasonal variation and removal efficiency of 21 antibiotics and 10 metabolites, including five sulfonamides and three of their metabolites, six quinolones, two macrolides, two beta-Lactams and five tetracyclines and seven of their metabolites, were investigated in five WWTPs in different seasons in the Jiulongjiang River Region, South China. 16 antibiotics and 6 metabolites in summer and 14 antibiotics and 6 metabolites in winter were found, respectively. The most frequently detected antibiotics were sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, n-acetyl sulfamethazine, n-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, cephalexin monohydrate and cephradine; of these, the concentration of cephradine was the highest in most of the influent and effluent samples. The highest level of total antibiotics was found in Longyan City WWTPs, where there are more population and swine farms. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in wastewater samples was also studied. The concentrations of antibiotics in winter were higher than those in summer. The antibiotics could not be removed completely by the WWTPs, and the mean removal efficiency ranged from -71.6 to 56.3%. Of all the antibiotics, the tetracyclines were removed comparatively more efficiently, probably due to their adsorption to sludge. The low removal efficiency of antibiotics in WWTPs could be one of the important reasons for the presence of antibiotics in the environment in Jiulongjiang Region.

AB Antibiotics (sulfonamides and tetracyclines) have attractive increasing attention due to their persistence for a long time, which lead to concern of widespread antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes in the aquatic environment. Investigation of the occurrence and elimination of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is thus imperative. This paper presents the method development of the liquid chromatography-ion-trap mass spectrometer (IT-MS)-time-of-flight mass spectrometer in series (LC-IT-ToF/MS) hybrid technique to determine concentrations of sulfonamides and tetracyclines in the effluent of animal WWTP. Detection limits of the developed method were 22.8, 23.0, 25.8, 23.6, and 9.8 ng L-1 for sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline, respectively. Average recovery efficiencies of the method for sulfonamides fortified in effluent samples of ananimal WWTP at 1.0, and 4.0 mu g L-1 were 73-95%, and 89-104%, respectively, while that of the method for tetracyclines fortified at 0.4 and 4.0 mu g L-1 was 76-104%, and 101-107%, respectively. The analysis of effluent of the WWTP showed that more than 90% of analyzed antibiotics were removed by the treatment consisted of biological, a UF membrane, and a coagulation process. The maximum concentrations of sulfonamide and tetracycline in the WWTP were 49.5 and 4.1 mu g L-1, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are becoming widely distributed in waters and wastewaters and pose a serious threat to public health. The present study aimed to analyze non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in surface waters, drinking water, and wastewater in Tehran, Iran. Thirty-six samples were collected from surface waters, tap water, and influent and effluent of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). A solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for the determination of pharmaceuticals, namely ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DIC), and indomethacin (IDM). IBP was found in most of the samples and had the highest concentration. The highest concentrations of NSAIDs were found in the municipal WWTP influents and hospital WWTP effluents. In the municipal WWTP influent samples, the concentrations of IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 1.05, 0.43, 0.23, and 0.11 mu g/L, respectively. DIC was found only in one river sample. All NSAIDs were detected in tap water samples. However, their concentration was very low and the maximum values for IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 47, 39, 24, and 37 ng/L, respectively, in tap water samples. Results showed that the measured pharmaceuticals were detected in all rivers with low concentrations in nanograms per liter range, except DIC which was found only in one river. Furthermore, this study showed that the aforementioned pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during their passage through WWTPs. A potential environmental risk of selected NSAIDs for the urban wastewater has been discussed. However, given their low measured concentrations, no ecotoxicological effect is suspected to occur.

AB The objective of this study was to examine sorption of a suite of 19 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) to activated sludge. Compounds examined in this study included neutral, nonionized TOrCs as well as acidic TOrCs which may carry a negative charge and basic TOrCs which may carry a positive charge at the pH of wastewater. These TOrCs were evaluated to examine how sorptive behavior might differ for TOrCs in different states of charge. Additionally, multiple sludges from geographically and operationally different wastewater treatment plants were studied to elicit how solid-phase characteristics influence TOrC sorption. Characterization of sludge solids from 6 full scale treatment facilities and 3 bench-scale reactors showed no significant difference in fraction organic carbon (f(oc)) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Sorption experiments demonstrated that sorption of TOrCs also exhibits little variation between these different sludges. Organic carbon normalized partition coefficients (log K-oc) were determined as a measure of sorption, and were found to correlate well with octanol water partition coefficients (log K-ow) for nonionized TOrCs, and log D-ow for anionic TOrCs where log D-ow is greater than 2. These data were used to construct a linear free energy relationship (LFER), which was comparable to existing LFERs for sorption onto sludge. No trend in sorption was apparent for the remaining anionic TOrCs or for the cationic TOrCs. These data suggest that predicting sorption to activated sludge based on K-ow values is a reasonable approach for neutral TOrCs using existing LFERs, but electrostatic (and likely other) interactions may govern the sorptive behavior of the charged organic chemicals to sludge.

AB Due to the well-known endocrine disrupting ability of bisphenol A (BPA), its production and usage have been regulated. Consequently, other bisphenol analogues (BPs) have been used as the replacement of BPA. Despite their widespread use, few studies have investigated the occurrence and fate of BPs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we conducted a city-wide monitoring survey and collected the wastewater and sludge samples from seven WWTPs in Xiamen, China over seven days. The concentrations of dissolved and adsorbed BPs in the influent and effluent, together with the BP concentrations in the sludge were determined. Five BPs, including BPA, BPAF, BPE, BPF, and BPS, were widely detected. The medium concentrations of BPA, BPAF, BPE, BPF, and BPS were 1318, 0.282, 3.70, 50.0, and 48.0 ng/L in the influent, 177, 0.714, 3.64, BLD, and BLD in the effluent, and 343, 3.09, BLD, 56.5,1.01 mu g/kg in the sludge. Spatial variations were observed, which implied the industrial origin of BPA. The efficiencies of BP removal from aqueous phase were evaluated, and results showed that BPA, BPF, and BPS were highly removed with removal efficiencies higher than 78%, while BPAF and BPE were resistant in WWTPs. Mass load calculations showed that 2075 g BPs entered into the WWTPs in Xiamen City each day, while 246 g and 63 g were discharged via effluent and excess sludge, respectively. Mass balance analysis showed that BPS and BPA were mainly biodegraded, BPF were mainly adsorbed and biodegraded, BPAF was resistant to biodegradation, while BPE was resistant to both biodegradation and adsorption.

AB In order to add to the current state of knowledge regarding occurrence and fate of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCP's) in the environment, influent, effluent and biosolids from three wastewater treatment facilities in Northwest Ohio, USA, and a stream containing effluent discharge from a rural treatment facility were analyzed. The three WWTP facilities vary in size and in community served, but are all Class B facilities. one facility was sampled multiple times in order to assess temporal variability. Twenty compounds including several classes of antibiotics, acidic pharmaceuticals, and prescribed medications were analyzed using ultrasonication extraction, SPE cleanup and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The highest number of compounds and the greatest concentrations were found in the influent from the largest and most industrial WWTP facility. Short-term temporal variability was minimal at this facility. Many compounds, such as clarithromycin, salicylic acid and gemfibrizol were found at concentrations more than one order of magnitude higher than found in the effluent samples. Effluent waters contained elevated levels of carbamazepine, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole. Differences in composition and concentration of effluent waters between facilities existed. Biosolid samples from two different facilities were very similar in PPCP composition, although concentrations varied. Ciprofloxacin was found in biosolids at concentrations (up to 46 mu g/kg dry mass) lower than values reported elsewhere. Diclofenac survived the WWTP process and was found to persist in stream water incorporating effluent discharge. The low variability within one plant, as compared to the variability found among different wastewater treatment plants locally and in the literature is likely due to differences in population, PPCP usage, plant operations and/or local environment. These data are presented here for comparison with this emerging set of environmental compounds of concern. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB An experimental study for combined stabilization and dewatering of industrial wastewater was carried out by means of a microfiltration unit inside a bioreactor. The module type used was a hollow fiber membrane with a transport area of 0.3 m(2) and pore size of 0.1 mu m. The membrane material was polyethylene. Dewatering was accomplished by applying suction pressure across the membrane. Four suction pressures in short-term experiments with activated sludge from the Barceloneta Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (BRWTP) were studied. The objective here was to determine the membrane hydraulic characteristics and the best conditions for stable, long-term operation. The experiments showed that the flux through the membrane decreases with vacuum pressures greater than 60 kPa owing to rapid clogging of the membrane micropores. Long-term experiments of 62 days duration were carried out with a pharmaceutical wastewater at a suction pressure of 20 kPa. Parameters measured included COD, MLSS, and MLVSS. The operation mode was intermittent with cycle time of 20 min: 4 min of suction followed by 16 min without suction, with average hydraulic retention time of 10.5 h. This mode of operation gave better and more stable results than continuous operation. The MLSS concentration inside the reactor increased throughout the operation, but was always under 40,000 mg/l, the limit for stable operation without sludge wastage. The average COD removal efficiency during the long-term experiments was 63%, with a maximum value of 86%.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a veterinary antibiotic that is not efficiently removed from wastewater by routine treatment and therefore can be detected widely in the environment. Here, we investigated whether microbial anaerobic transformation can contribute to the removal of SMX in constructed systems. We enriched SMX-transforming mixed cultures from sediment of a constructed wetland and from digester sludge of a wastewater treatment plant. Transformation of SMX was observed in both sulfate-reducing and methanogenic cultures, whereas nitrate-reducing cultures showed no SMX transformation. In sulfate reducing cultures, up to 90% of an initial SMX concentration of 100-250 mu M was removed within 6 weeks of incubation, and the experiments demonstrated that the transformation was microbially catalyzed. The transformation products in sulfate-reducing cultures were identified as the reduced and isomerized forms of the isoxazole SMX moiety. The transformation products did not spontaneously reoxidize to SMX after oxygen exposure, and their antibacterial activity was significantly decreased compared to SMX. Population analyses in sequential transfers of the sulfate-reducing cultures revealed a community shift toward the genus Desulfovibrio. We therefore tested a deposited strain of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough for its capacity to transform SMX and observed the same transformation products and similar transformation rates as in the enrichment cultures. Our work suggests that an initial anaerobic step in wastewater treatment can reduce the concentration of SMX in effluents and could contribute to decreased SMX concentrations in the environment.

AB As a new pollutant, antibiotics in the environment and their removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have gained considerable attention. However, few studies investigated antibiotics in the north-eastern areas of China. By employing high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the concentration distribution and removal of 12 antibiotics belonging to four types (cephalosporins, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides) were investigated in influents and effluents as well as the removal efficiencies of four typical treatment processes in 18 wastewater treatment plants of Harbin City, north-eastern China. Macrolides and fluoroquinolones presented relatively higher detection concentrations and rates both in the water and in the sludge phases. Sulfonamides and cephalosporins displayed higher detection concentrations in the water phase. The representative antibiotics in influents and effluents included ROX, NOR, OFL, SMX, AZI, and CLA, with detection rates above 95%. The detection rates of the other six antibiotics exceeded 30%. In the sludge, the other five antibiotics, except SMX, presented relatively higher detection concentrations and rates, with detection rates greater than 95%. For cephalosporin, the detection rates of CTX and CFM in the sludge were 0. The removal efficiencies for the 12 antibiotics differed greatly, with average values ranging from 30% to 80% and the highest values for cephalosporin. The removal of antibiotics did not differ significantly among the four different treatment processes. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019

AB In developed, non-agricultural, unsewered areas, septic systems and fertilizer application to lawns and gardens represent two major sources of nitrogen to coastal groundwater, in addition to atmospheric input. This study was designed to distinguish between these two possible nitrogen sources by analyzing groundwater samples for pharmaceutical residuals, because fertilizers do not contain any of these pharmaceuticals, but domestic wastewater commonly does. In addition, several herbicides and insecticides used in lawn treatment were analyzed as indicators of nitrogen delivery to groundwater from fertilizers. Groundwater samples were taken through piezometres at shoreline sites in unsewered areas surrounding Northport Harbor and in sewered areas adjacent to Manhasset Bay (hereafter referred to as "Northport" and "Manhasset", respectively), both in northwestern Long Island, USA. Excessive nitrogen loading has led to reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations in Long Island Sound, and the groundwater contribution to the nitrogen budget is poorly constrained. The frequent detection of the anticonvulsant compound carbamazepine in groundwater samples of the Northport Harbor area (unsewered), together with the fact that few pesticides associated with lawn applications were detected, suggests that wastewater input and atmospheric input are the likely sources of nitrogen in the Northport groundwater. High concentrations of nitrogen were also detected in the Manhasset (sewered) groundwater. The low detection frequency and concentration of carbamazepine, however, suggest that the sewer system effectively intercepts nitrogen from wastewater there. The likely sources of nitrogen in the Manhasset groundwater are atmospheric deposition and lawn fertilizers, as this area is densely populated.

AB Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication use is on the rise in the United States. The most widely used ADHD medications are the amphetamine-type compounds Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) and Ritalin (methylphenidate). According to survey data ADHD medications are used as a study drug or "Smart Drug" by students without a prescription on college campuses. Survey data of non-prescribed drug use has limitations with accurate reporting and no empirical data of usage exists in the literature. This study looks for trends in the use of these drugs on a college campus among low-stress and high stress periods. The metabolites of these two drugs, amphetamine and ritalinic acid, are quantified in campus wastewater using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Trends show a possible increase in amphetamine levels during periods of high stress such as midterms, the last week of classes and finals week over levels from the baseline low stress weeks such as the first week of classes. Both semesters from the 2011-12 academic year were studied and the highest increase over baseline (760%) occurred during finals week of the second semester. Ritalinic acid levels gradually climbed first semester but had no obvious periodic trend second semester. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of several psychoactive drugs in water resources from north-eastern Spain (NE-Spain) has been evaluated. The drugs were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) after enrichment by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Most of the studied controlled drugs (8 out of 11) were found in both influent and effluent samples from several wastewater treatment plants. Cocaine and its metabolite were detected in wastewaters at concentrations ranging from 4 ng/L to 4.7 mu g/L and from 9 ng/L to 7.5 mu g/L respectively while concentrations of amphetamine type stimulatory drugs ranged from 2 to 688 ng/L.
   Removal percentages were estimated by sampling eight WWTPs (n=4). Cocaine and benzoylecgonine removal percentages were higher than 88% while those of amphetamine type stimulants varied ranging from 40% to more than 99%. Daily variability was also evaluated by performing a sequential survey, which revealed important fluctuations in the concentrations of nicotine, paraxanthine, amphetamine and ecstasy during the week. From the total concentrations found in wastewater influents estimations of the cocaine and ecstasy consumption were performed. For cocaine the results were approximately 14 doses per 1000 inhabitants (15-64 years old) per day and for ecstasy, approximately 4 doses per 1000 young adults (15-34 years old) per day for ecstasy.

AB A simple on-line method was developed for the analysis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and some metabolites in drinking, surface and wastewater samples. The technique is based on the use of on-line solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization (LC-ESI(PI)-MS/MS). The injection of only 1 mL of filtered water sample is used with a total analysis time of 20 min, including the period required to flush the SPE cartridge with organic solvent and reconditioning the LC column. Method detection limits were in the range of 2 to 24 ng L-1 for the compounds of interest, with recoveries from 87 to 110% in surface as well as wastewater samples. Matrix effects were observed for some compounds without exceeding more than 25%. All results displayed a good degree of reproducibility, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 12% for all compounds. Moreover, at least 200 samples were analyzed without altering the performance of the pre-concentration column. This method was preferred over traditional off-line procedures because it minimizes tedious sample preparation, increases productivity and sample throughput. The analysis of various water and wastewater samples showed that caffeine, carbamazepine and atrazine could be detected in all the samples analysed and the selected compounds are always present in at least one of the sample types.

AB The substantial transformation of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist valsartan to the transformation product 2'-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (referred to as valsartan acid) during the activated sludge process was demonstrated in the literature and confirmed in the here presented study. However, there was a severe lack of knowledge regarding the occurrence and fate of this compound in surface water and its behavior during drinking water treatment. In this work a comparative study on the occurrence and persistency of valsartan acid, three frequently used beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, and sotalol), atenolol acid (one significant transformation product of atenolol and metoprolol), and the two widely distributed persistent anthropogenic wastewater indicators carbamazepine and acesulfame in raw sewage, treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and tap water is presented. Median concentrations of valsartan acid in the analyzed matrices were 101, 1,310, 69, <1.0, and 65 ng L-1, respectively. Treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants were confirmed as significant source. Regarding concentration levels of pharmaceutical residues in surface waters valsartan acid was found just as relevant as the analyzed beta-blockers and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine. Regarding its persistency in surface waters it was comparable to carbamazepine and acesulfame. Furthermore, removal of valsartan acid during bank filtration was poor, which demonstrated the relevance of this compound for drinking water suppliers. Regarding drinking water treatment (Muelheim Process) the compound was resistant to ozonation but effectively eliminated (>= 90%) by subsequent activated carbon filtration. However, without applying activated carbon filtration the compound may enter the drinking water distribution system as it was demonstrated for Berlin tap water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the year 2010, effluents from 90 European wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were analyzed for 156 polar organic chemical contaminants. The analyses were complemented by effect-based monitoring approaches aiming at estrogenicity and dioxin-like toxicity analyzed by in vitro reporter gene bioassays, and yeast and diatom culture acute toxicity optical bioassays. Analyses of organic substances were performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) or gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). Target microcontaminants were pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), veterinary (antibiotic) drugs, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organophosphate ester flame retardants, pesticides (and some metabolites), industrial chemicals such as benzotriazoles (corrosion inhibitors), iodinated x-ray contrast agents, and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging agents; in addition biological endpoints were measured. The obtained results show the presence of 125 substances (80% of the target compounds) in European wastewater effluents, in concentrations ranging from low nanograms to milligrams per liter. These results allow for an estimation to be made of a European median level for the chemicals investigated in WWTP effluents. The most relevant compounds in the effluent waters with the highest median concentration levels were the artificial sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose, benzotriazoles (corrosion inhibitors), several organophosphate ester flame retardants and plasticizers (e.g. tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate; TCPP), pharmaceutical compounds such as carbamazepine, tramadol, telmisartan, venlafaxine, irbesartan, fluconazole, oxazepam, fexofenadine, diclofenac, citalopram, codeine, bisoprolol, eprosartan, the antibiotics trimethoprim, ciprofloxacine, sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycine, the insect repellent N,N'-diethyltoluamide (DEET), the pesticides MCPA and mecoprop, perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOS and PFOA), caffeine, and gadolinium.

AB The presence of five selected pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and an antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, was determined at four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the receiving waterway in central Finland. The samples were taken from influents and effluents of the WWTPs and from surface water of six locations along the water way, including northern Lake Paijanne. In addition, seasonal variation in the area was determined by comparing the concentrations in the winter and summer. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations in the influents and effluents ranged from hundreds of nanogram per liter to microgram per liter while ranged from tens of nanogram per liter in northern parts of the waterway to hundreds of nanogram per liter in northern Lake Paijanne near the city area. In addition, the concentrations were higher in the winter compared to summer time in surface water due to decreased temperature and solar irradiation. On the other hand, higher concentrations of ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen were found in summer at the WWTPs, possibly due to seasonal variations in consumption. In conclusion, there are considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals not only in influents and effluents of the WWTPs but also in lake water along the waterway and in northern Lake Paijanne.

AB Different UVA radiation and advanced oxidation systems, most of them involving ozone, have been applied to remove mixtures of three contaminants of pharmaceutical type: diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMT) and caffeine (CFF), both in ultrapure and secondary treated wastewater. The influence of the water matrix has been studied in terms of individual compound concentration and TOC removal. Also, biodegradability of the treated wastewater before and after the advanced oxidation process, as BOD/COD ratio, the partial oxidation yield, the increment of average state of carbon oxidation and ozone consumption have been determined. For mgL(-1) to 100 mu gL(-1) concentrations and regardess of the ozone process and water type, DCF and SMT are removed in less than 10 min mainly by direct reaction with ozone, especially in the case of DCF CFF, on the contrary, is mainly removed through hydroxyl radicals. For lower concentration (<= 100 mu gL(-1)), ECF still disappears by direct ozonation, CFF by hydroxyl radicals oxidation and SMT through both direct zonation and hydroxyl radical oxidation. Once DCF and SMT have disappeared, TOC is removed by reacting with hydroxyl radicals, regardless of the water matrix. Photocatalytic ozonation allows the highest TOC degradation rate, partial oxidation yield, increment of average state of carbon oxidation and biodegradability together to the lowest ozone consumption per mg TOC eliminated.

AB Artificial sweeteners are contaminants of emerging concern that can enter the aquatic and terrestrial environments via wastewater effluent discharge and the environmental application of biosolids. The release of artificial sweeteners from the use of biosolids in Australia was assessed. The concentration of seven artificial sweeteners was quantified in biosolids samples collected from 71 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Australia during Census 2016. Sucralose, saccharin, acesulfame, aspartame and cyclamate were detected in biosolids samples at median concentrations ranging from 0.18 ng/g (dry weight) (range: < LOQ-34 ng/g) for cyclamate to 220 ng/g (range: < LOQ-3,670 ng/g) for sucralose, while neotame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone were not detected. The relationship between the concentration of artificial sweeteners in biosolids and moisture content was assessed with the concentration of artificial sweeteners decreasing as dewatering time increased in a biosolids drying hall. The geometric means (+/- standard deviation) for per capita loads of individual artificial sweeteners ranged from 8.7 (1.6, 48) mu g year & minus;1 person & minus;1 for cyclamate to 4,0 0 0 (1,0 0 0, 15,0 0 0) mu g year & minus;1 person & minus;1 for sucralose with 223 kg of artificial sweeteners released to terrestrial environment from biosolids end-use annually in Australia. Due to the low loads of artificial sweeteners in biosolids compared with wastewater effluent, risks associated with artificial sweeteners in biosolids are likely limited.

AB The present study investigated the occurrence of 29 selected micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters and wastewaters in Seoul (South Korea) during both dry and wet weather conditions. The study area was selected based on the lack of available information regarding the suspected contamination of rivers/creeks by EDCs and PPCPs in the Seoul region and the presence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which serves approximately 4.1 million inhabitants and has a design capacity of 1,297x10(3) m(3)/day. Many target compounds (83 %) were detected in samples collected from wastewater treatment influent/effluent, creek water, and combined sewer overflow (CSO). The total EDC/PPCP concentrations were as follows: WWTP influent (69,903 ng/L)>WWTP effluent (50,175 ng/L) >3 creek samples (16,03544,446 ng/L) during dry weather, and WWTP influent (53,795 ng/L)>WWTP bypass (38,653 ng/L) > 5 creek samples (15,260-29,113 ng/L) >2 CSO samples (11,109-11,498 ng/L) during wet weather. EDCs and PPCPs were found to be present at high daily loads (65.1 and 69.8 kg/day during dry and wet weather, respectively) in the WWTP effluent. Compound removal by the WWTP varied significantly by compound: caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and propylparaben (> 90 %), and acesulfame, DEET, iohexol, iopromide, and iopamidol (<5 %). These findings and literature information support the hypothesis that the efficiency of removal of EDCs and PPCPs is strongly dependent on both removal mechanism (e. g., biodegradation, adsorption to sludge, and oxidation by chlorine) and compound physicochemical properties (e. g., pKa and hydrophobicity).

AB The occurrence and removal of 58 pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pesticides, were assessed in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, as well as in the effluent-receiving water body, the Vidy Bay of Lake Geneva. An analytical screening method to simultaneously measure all of the 58 micropollutants was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The selection of pharmaceuticals was primarily based on a prioritization study, which designated them as environmentally relevant for the Lake Geneva region. Except for the endocrine disruptor 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, all substances were detected in 24-h composite samples of wastewater entering the WWTP or in the treated effluent. Of these compounds, 40% were also detected in raw drinking water, pumped from the lake 3 km downstream of the WWTP. The contributions of dilution and degradation to micropollutant elimination between the WWTP outlet and the raw drinking water intake were established in different model scenarios using hypothetical residence times of the wastewater in Vidy Bay of I. 4, or 90 d. Concentration decrease due to processes other than dilution was observed for diclofenac, beta-blockers, several antibiotics, corrosion inhibitors, and pesticides. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of pharmaceuticals were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) determined in the prioritization study and agreed within one order of magnitude, but MECs were typically greater than the corresponding PECs. Predicted no-effect concentrations of the analgesic paracetamol, and the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, were exceeded in raw drinking water samples and therefore present a potential risk to the ecosystem.

AB The project studied the occurrence, fate, and seasonal variation of 14 antibiotics, from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shanghai. The results indicated that ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and oxytetracycline were the predominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 1208.20, 959.13, and 564.30 ng/L in influents, while 916.88, 106.60, and 337.81 ng/L in effluents, respectively. The level of antibiotics in WWTPs obviously varied with seasonal changes, and higher detectable frequencies and concentrations were found in winter. The daily mass loads per capita of amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline in the study were all higher than those in other regions/countries, such as Hong Kong, Australia, and Italy. The elimination of antibiotics through these WWTPs was incomplete, and a wide range of removal efficiencies during the different treatment process and seasons were observed (-500.56 to 100 % in winter and -124.24 to 94.21 % in summer). Sulfonamides were relatively easy to be removed in WWTPs and the ultraviolet (UV) process can effectively improve the removal efficiency. Risk assessment of antibiotics in effluents was estimated. Only AMOX's hazard quotient (HQ) was higher than 0.01. Even though the environmental risks in the study were estimated to be low, the potential negative effects on aquatic ecosystems should call our attention as continually discharge in the long term.

AB The antidiabetic drug metformin is among the pharmaceuticals with the highest production numbers world-wide. This paper presents first data on the occurrence of metformin in sewage and surface waters in Germany. Analysis of metformin is based on pre-concentration of the analyte onto a polymeric solid-phase material and subsequent determination by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Applying the method to sewage and surface waters, recoveries >90% and limits of detection of 10 ng L-1 could be achieved by pre-concentration of a sample volume of only 10 mL. Measurements in sewage and surface waters showed an almost ubiquitous presence of metformin in the aquatic environment. The measured concentration levels in sewage treatment plant influents correlate nicely to the prescription numbers for metformin in Germany. During sewage treatment a significant reduction of metformin concentrations was observed which seems to be mainly due to microbial degradation. Despite this significant elimination during sewage treatment, metformin was found in all river waters under investigation. Concentration levels depend on the sewage fraction of the receiving waters and for most rivers are in the range of several 100 ng L-1, i.e. in the same order of magnitude or even higher than for other relevant pharmaceutical residues.

AB Urban effluents are rich in nutrients, organic matter, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, hydrocarbons, surfactants, and others. Previous studies have shown that oysters Crassostrea gigas accumulate significant levels of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) in sanitary sewage contaminated sites, but there is little information about its toxicological effects in marine bivalves. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcription of genes in two tissues of C. gigas exposed for 12, 24, and 36 h to LABs or sanitary sewage. Likewise, the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes was measured in oysters exposed for 36 h in all groups. Oysters exposed to LABs and oysters exposed to sanitary sewage showed different patterns of transcriptional responses. LAB-exposed oysters showed lower level of biological responses than the oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Despite the ability of the oyster C. gigas to accumulate LABs (28-fold), the data indicate that these contaminants are not the cause for the transcriptional responses observed in oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Possibly, the biological changes observed in the sanitary sewage-exposed oysters are associated with the presence of other contaminants, which might have caused synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. The results show that FABP-like and GST-omega-like messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have a rapid response in tissues of oyster C. gigas exposed to sanitary sewage, suggesting a possible protective response and a role in maintaining homeostasis of these organisms.

AB The prevalence of organic wastewater compounds in surface waters of the United States has been reported in a number of recent studies. In karstic areas, surface contaminants might be transported to groundwater and, ultimately, cave ecosystems, where they might impact resident biota. In this study, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCISs) and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed in six caves and two surface-water sites located within the Ozark Plateau of northeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas in order to detect potential chemical contaminants in these systems. All caves sampled were known to contain populations of the threatened Ozark cavefish (Amblyopsis rosae). The surface-water site in Oklahoma was downstream from the outfall of a municipal wastewater treatment plant and a previous study indicated a hydrologic link between this stream and one of the caves. A total of 83 chemicals were detected in the POCIS and SPMD extracts from the surface-water and cave sites. Of these, 55 chemicals were detected in the caves. Regardless of the sampler used, more compounds were detected in the Oklahoma surface-water site than in the Arkansas site or the caves. The organic wastewater chemicals with the greatest mass measured in the sampler extracts included sterols (cholesterol and beta-sitosterol), plasticizers [diethylhexylphthalate and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate], the herbicide bromacil, and the fragrance indole. Sampler extracts from most of the cave sites did not contain many wastewater contaminants, although extracts from samplers in the Oklahoma surface-water site and the cave hydrologically linked to it had similar levels of diethylhexyphthalate and common detections of carbamazapine, sulfamethoxazole, benzophenone, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), and octophenol monoethoxylate. Further evaluation of this system is warranted due to potential ongoing transport of wastewater-associated chemicals into the cave. Halogenated organics found in caves and surface-water sites included brominated flame retardants, organochlorine pesticides (chlordane and nonachlor), and polychlorinated biphenyls. The placement of samplers in the caves (near the cave mouth compared to farther in the system) might have influenced the number of halogenated organics detected due to possible aerial transport of residues. Guano from cave-dwelling bats also might have been a source of some of these chlorinated organics. Seven-day survival and growth bioassays with fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to samples of cave water indicated initial toxicity in water from two of the caves, but these effects were transient, with no toxicity observed in follow-up tests.

AB The occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological assessment of selected estrogenic compounds were investigated at Tunisian urban sewage treatment plant. The influents, effluents, as well as primary, secondary and dehydrated sludge, were sampled and analyzed for the target estrogens to evaluate their fate. All target compounds were detected in both sewage and sludge with mean concentrations from 0.062 to 0.993 mu g L-1 and from 11.8 to 792.9 mu g kg(-1)dry weight, respectively. A wide range of removal efficiencies during the treatment processes were observed, from 6.3 % for estrone to 76.8 % for estriol. Ecotoxicological risk assessment revealed that the highest ecotoxicological risk in sewage effluent and dehydrated sludge was due to 17 beta-estradiol with a risk quotient (RQ) of 4.6 and 181.9, respectively, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol with RQ of 9.8 and 14.85, respectively. Ecotoxicological risk after sewage discharge and sludge disposal was limited to the presence of 17 beta-estradiol in dehydrated-sludge amended soil with RQ of 1.38. Further control of estrogenic hormones in sewage effluent and sludge is essential before their discharge and application in order to prevent their introduction into the natural environment.

AB This study was undertaken to assess the capacity of the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, one of the most commonly used systems in Brazilian sewage treatment plants, to remove municipal sewage toxicity using different Danio rerio life stages (embryo, embryo-larval, larval, adult), and estrogenicity using in vitro (yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in vivo (vitellogenin induction in D. rerio) assays. Sensitivity of chronic fish assays were compared to the chronic Ceriodaphnia dubia assay. UASB-treated sewage met Brazilian legal limits for BOD and COD removals, but did not remove toxicity, and treated sewage remained extremely toxic to D. rerio larvae and C. dubia, and highly toxic to D. rerio embryos. The 4-day embryo assay had the same sensitivity as the adult acute toxicity assay, and could safely replace it, avoiding the need to sacrifice adult fish. No significant differences were identified in vitellogenin induction among organisms exposed to sewage or control. However, the in vitro test showed that anaerobic treatment increased sample estrogenicity from 27 to 40 ng equivalents of 17-beta estradiol per liter, a result corroborated by the greater induction of vitellogenin in male fish exposed to 5% (2.73 mu g/g) and 20% (2.12 mu g/g) treated sewage compared to the same concentrations of raw sewage (0.174 mu g/g at 5% and 0.188 mu g/g at 20%). Thus, UASB reactor should be followed by post-treatment to reduce risks of sewage discharge to receiving waters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the behavior of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at laboratory-scale in removing the emerging contaminants, ibuprofen (IBP) and methylparaben (MPB), at different concentrations. Individual experiments were carried out for each pollutant and they were divided into six stages of operation, which included starting, load variation, and interim periods of system stabilization. The treated wastewater was synthetic, and it included the pollutions MPB or IBP, glucose as a co-substrate, macronutrients, and micronutrients. The inoculum used to start the reactor was an aerobic sludge from an SBR system used in the treatment of domestic wastewater, which presented with high-content organic material and featured good sedimentation characteristics. The removal percentages of the two compounds at concentrations of 300, 500, and 1000 mu g/L were not similar. For MPB, high removal percentages (>96 %) were obtained, while for IBP, decreasing removal percentages were found with increases in analyte concentration, exhibiting average values of 51 +/- 15.3, 26 +/- 16.6, and 16 +/- 5.4 %. Following the removal of IBP, this behavior showed pronounced effects in biomass inhibition during exposure to high concentrations of the pollutant.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micro-pollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to meet reuse applications and contribute to reach the good status of the water bodies. A hundred priority and relevant emerging substances were measured to evaluate at full-scale the removal efficiencies of seven advanced treatment lines (one membrane bioreactor process and six tertiary treatment lines) that were designed for reuse applications. To reliably compare the processes, specific procedures for micro-pollutants were applied for sampling, analysis and calculation of removal efficiencies. The membrane bioreactor process allowed to upgrade the removal efficiencies of about 20% of the substances measured, especially those that were partially degraded during conventional processes. Conventional tertiary processes like high rate clarification, sand filtration and polishing pond achieved significant removal for some micro-pollutants, especially for adsorbable substances. Advanced tertiary processes, like ozonation, activated carbon and reverse osmosis were all very efficient to complete the removal of polar pesticides and pharmaceuticals; metals and less polar substances were better retained by reverse osmosis.

AB Discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities (PMFs) previously have been identified as important sources of pharmaceuticals to the environment. Yet few studies are available to establish the influence of PMFs on the pharmaceutical source contribution to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and waterways at the national scale. Consequently, a national network of 13 WWTPs receiving PMF discharges, six WWTPs with no PMF input, and one WWTP that transitioned through a PMF closure were selected from across the United States to assess the influence of PMF inputs on pharmaceutical loading to WWTPs. Effluent samples were analyzed for 120 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical degradates. Of these, 33 pharmaceuticals had concentrations substantially higher in PMF-influenced effluent (maximum 555,000 ng/L) compared to effluent from control sites (maximum 175 ng/L). Concentrations in WWTP receiving PMF input are variable, as discharges from PMFs are episodic, indicating that production activities can vary substantially over relatively short (several months) periods and have the potential to rapidly transition to other pharmaceutical products. Results show that PMFs are an important, national-scale source of pharmaceuticals to the environment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Digestion of municipal wastewater biosolids is a necessary prerequisite to their beneficial use in land application, in order to protect public health and the receiving environment. In this study, 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), 11 musks, and 17 polybrominated diphenyl ethers were analyzed in 84 samples including primary sludge, waste activated sludge, digested biosolids, dewatered biosolids, and dewatering centrate or filtrate collected from five wastewater treatment plants with aerobic or anaerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion processes were sampled during both warm and cold temperatures to analyze seasonal differences. Among the studied compounds, triclosan, triclocarban, galaxolide, and BDE-209 were the substances most frequently detected under different treatment processes at levels up to 30,000 ng/g dry weight. Comparing aerobic and anaerobic digestion, it was observed that the levels of certain PPCPs and musks were significantly higher in anaerobically digested biosolids, relative to the residues from aerobic digestion. Therefore, aerobic digestion has the potential advantage of reducing levels of PPCPs and musks. On the other hand, anaerobic digestion has the advantage of recovering energy from the biosolids in the form of combustible gases while retaining the nutrient and soil conditioning value of this resource.

AB The occurrence of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) at detectable levels in wastewater and surface waters led to a growing concern over the persistence of toxicological effects in the environment. Sorption is significant process in municipal wastewater treatment plants to remove TOrCs due to low water solubility and high hydrophobic of most TOrCs. The work herein explored the sorption behavior of four typical TOrCs onto sludge solids. The sorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. Greater sorption amount was observed for EE2 that 60.9% of EE2 in liquid phase was removed, followed by BPA (49.4%) and SMX (35.8%), while only 19.5% of CBZ was adsorbed. Sorption of CBZ, BPA and EE2 was primarily a physical process dominated by partition function, while SMX was mainly sorbed through multiple interactions, and this strong affinity between SMX and activated sludge resulted in least desorption rate. Deep insight into the pathway of SMX in SBA revealed that total removal rate in a period was about 50.22%. Sorption process was observed in anaerobic stage, and biological degradation was mainly occurred in aerobic stage with biodegradation rate of 29.18%.

AB While anaerobic treatment is capable of treating pharmaceutical wastewater and removing antibiotics in liquid phases, solid phases may still contain significant amounts of antibiotics following this treatment. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the use of white-rot fungi to remove erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline combinations from biosolids. The degradation potential of Trametes versicolor and Bjerkandera adusta was evaluated via the sequential treatment of anaerobic sludge. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses were used to identify competition between the autochthonous microbial communities and white-rot fungi. Solid-phase treatment using white-rot fungi substantially reduced antibiotic concentrations and toxicity in sludge. According to PCR-DGGE results, there is an association between species of fungus and antibiotic type as a result of the different transformation pathways of fungal strains. Fungal post-treatment of sludge represents a promising method of removing antibiotic combinations, therefore holding a significant promise as an environmentally friendly means of degrading the antibiotics present in sludge.

AB Carbamazepine, which is an anti-epileptic drug, is ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater. Owing to its recalcitrant chemical structure, carbamazepine is not significantly removed during conventional biological treatment or even by membrane bioreactor (MBR). With the ultimate aim of providing insights into the strategies to enhance carbamazepine removal, the effect of key operational parameters, namely, loading rate (2-750 mu g/L.d), pH (5-9), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration (1-15 g/L) and dissolved oxygen (DO) (<0.5-5 mg/L) on the removal of carabamazepine by MBR was systematically studied. Results obtained in this study revealed negligible influence of pH and of MLSS concentration (beyond 5 g/L) on the removal of carbamazepine. The removal rate, however, was significantly enhanced under a DO concentration of less than 0.5 mg/L, suggesting that an alternating anoxic-oxic environment in MBR would achieve high removal. Significantly enhanced (287 mg/g vs. 0.02 mg/g) adsorption of carbamazepine on powdered activated carbon (PAC) as compared to MBR sludge indicated that simultaneous PAC adsorption in MBR may achieve enhanced removal.

AB BACKGROUND: The performance of a pilot membrane bioreactor system (MBR) was tested for the treatment of municipal wastewater, with emphasis on the capability for removal of selected pharmaceuticals
   RESULTS: The MBR showed excellent performance with regards to conventional pollutants. However, the removal of specific pharmaceuticals was not as high. Carbamazepine and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol showed the lowest removal, with mean removal rates of around 20%. Clofibric acid showed the highest removal 70%, while for 17 beta-estradiol the mean removal was 40%. In order to distinguish between the two basic mechanisms of removal, adsorption on biomass and biodegradation, adsorption studies on inactivated biomass were performed and mass balances were written for the four pharmaceuticals. The immediate removal observed for the three compounds during short hydraulic retention times may have been primarily due to adsorption.
   CONCLUSIONS: The removal of carbamazepine, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethynil estradiol, as well as half of the removal of chlofibric acid could be attributed to direct adsorption on biomass within the hydraulic residence time of the reactor. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pharmaceuticals and recently also illicit drugs have been recognised as emerging environmental contaminants due to their potential environmental impact: frequent occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic life and humans. This manuscript is part one of the two-part study aiming to provide a better understanding and application of environmental data not only for environmental aims but also to meet forensic objectives. An attempt to use wastewater data is made in order to verify patterns of the usage of drugs (in particular illicit) in local communities. The average usage of cocaine in South Wales was estimated at 0.9 g day(-1) 1000 people(-1), which equals I tonne of this drug used or disposed of to sewage annually in Wales. The calculated usage of amphetamine denoted 2.5 g day(-1) 1000 people(-1) and is suspected to be an overestimate. Because no analysis of enantiomers of amphetamine was undertaken, no distinction between amphetamine's legal and illicit usage could be made (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Erythromycin (ERY), a widely used antibiotic, has recently been detected in municipal secondary effluents and poses serious threats to human health during wastewater reusing. In this study, the removal, fate, and degradation pathway of ERY in secondary effluent during soil aquifer treatment was evaluated via laboratory-scale SAT tests. Up to a 92.9% reduction of ERY in synthetic secondary effluent was observed in 1.0 m depth column system, which decreased to 64.7% when recharged with wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent. XRD-fractionation results demonstrated that the transphilic acid and hydrophobic acid fractions in secondary effluent compete for the adsorption sites of the packed soil and lead to a declined ERY removal. Moreover, aerobic biodegradation was the predominant role for ERY removal, contributing more than 60% reduction of ERY when recharged with synthetic secondary effluent. Destruction of 14-member macrocyclic lactone ring and breakdown of two cyclic sugars (L-cladinose and D-desosamine) were main removal pathways for ERY degradation, and produced six new intermediates.

AB Peracetic acid (PM) is an oxidizer widely used for the sterilization of equipment in hospitals, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries and also for water and wastewater disinfection. Even with its increasing applications, there have been no previous theoretical studies that explain the experimental results based on its molecular behavior. In this context, this work used calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) combined with experimental results to elucidate the decomposition mechanisms of PAA for predicting its stability and the possible products generated from its decomposition. The results obtained showed that the protonation of PAA promoted its spontaneous decomposition in acetic acid and molecular oxygen. The hydrolysis mechanism of PM in acidic medium indicated that the low energy difference involved in the mechanism's stages is responsible for the equilibrium between PAA and H2O2. The structural and electronic comparison of PM with H2O2 showed that the O-O bond length of PM is longer than that of H2O2 and is also weaker, therefore may demonstrate greater efficiency in advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis.

AB Ten infrequently monitored antibiotics in biosolids were examined in archived American sewage sludges (n=79) collected as part of the 2006/2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey. This study inspected the occurrence of amoxicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone [ proxy metabolite: 3-(2-nitrobenzylidenamino)-2-oxazolidinone (NP-AOZ)], nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline, spiramycin, sulfadimidine, and sulfadimethoxine in sewage sludges after nearly a decade in frozen storage. Six antibiotics were detected at the following average concentrations (ng/g dry weight): amoxicillin (1.0), nalidixic acid (19.1), oxolinic acid (2.7), erythromycin (0.6), oxytetracycline (4.5), and ampicillin (14.8). The remaining four were not detected in any samples (bmethod detection limit, ng/g dry weight): sulfadimethoxine (<0.5), sulfadimidine (<1.0), spiramycin (<2.0), and NP-AOZ (<20.0). This study provides the first data on spiramycin, NP-AOZ, and nalidixic acid in U.S. sewage sludges. This study also provides new data on the losses of 5 antibiotics during long term frozen storage (-20 degrees C) in comparison to the 2006/2007 U.S. EPA Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey.

AB Simultaneous determination of endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs), namely diltiazem, progesterone, benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), estrone, and carbamazepine (Cbz) were performed by using high performance LC-electrospray tandem MS. The ultrasound-aided sequential extraction of sludge samples was optimized to increase extraction efficiencies of the analytes; ranging between 93.0-98.3% recovery. The limit of detection values for diltiazem, progesterone, BBP, estrone, and Cbz were found as 0.78, 0.72, 0.24, 0.75, and 0.72 mu g/kg, respectively. Sludge samples taken from Ankara Tatlar; Hurma, Lara and Kemer of Antalya, and Middle East Technical University-vacuum rotating membrane wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) aeration tanks were analyzed for their EDCs contents under optimized conditions. Diltiazem was found in all the samples in the range between 116.4-180.8 ng/g while progesterone and estrone were not detected in any of the samples analyzed with the exception of Tatlar WWTP. The BBP concentration was between beyond detection and 9195.5 ng/g. In addition, Cbz was found in all the samples ranging from 25.6 to 118.8 ng/g.

AB This study investigates the removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in two sets of anoxic/anaerobic/ oxic sequencing batch reactors inoculated with either suspended or granular activated sludge. Continuously, for three months, 2 mu g/L SMX was spiked into the reactor feeds in a synthetic municipal wastewater with COD, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) of 400, 43 and 7 mg/L, respectively. The presence of SMX had no significant impact on treatment performance of the suspended and granular biomass. After 12 h of hydraulic retention time, SMX removal efficiencies of 84 and 73% were obtained for the granular and suspended biomass, respectively. Mixing without aeration did not remove SMX, confirming the insignificance of SMX removal via sorption. The pseudo-first order SMX removal rate constants in the granular and suspended biomass were 2.25 +/- 0.30 and 1.34 +/- 0.39 L/gVSS.d, respectively. The results suggest that granules with advantages such as elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration could be effective for the removal of this class of antibiotics.

AB The environmental benefits and burdens of phosphorus recovery in four centralized and two decentralized municipal wastewater systems were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA). In centralized systems, phosphorus recovered as struvite from the solids dewatering liquid resulted in an environmental benefit except for the terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, with power and chemical use offset by operational savings and avoided fertilizer production. Chemical-based phosphorus recovery, however, generally required more resources than were offset by avoided fertilizers, resulting in a net environmental burden. In decentralized systems, phosphorus recovery via urine source separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials but increased terrestrial ecotoxicity and salinization potentials due to application of untreated urine to land. Overall, mineral depletion and eutrophication are well-documented arguments for phosphorus recovery; however, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily present a net environmental benefit. While avoided fertilizer production does reduce potential impacts, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily offset the resources consumed in the process. LCA results indicate that selection of an appropriate phosphorus recovery method should consider both local conditions and other environmental impacts, including global warming, ozone depletion, toxicity, and salinization, in addition to eutrophication and mineral depletion impacts.

AB The present research work involved the effectiveness of seven different sorbents (three inorganics, three organic, and one biopolymer) in eliminating sixteen micropollutants (dyes, metals, organophosphates, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food additives, surfactants, and cosmetics), nitrogen and phosphorus was investigated in batch mode study using wastewater. Three inorganic sorbents were silica gel/rice flour decorated biochar, Ca/rice flour decorated biochar and bentonite clay whereas organic materials comprised of organic charcoal, fruit peel (kiwi) and Aloe vera and one biopolymer was magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads. The maximum nitrogen (93%) and phosphorus (73%) were removed by inorganic sorbents efficiently as compared to other sorbents. Maximum dyes removal was occurred by magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads (96%), whereas the highest metals (93%) and pesticides (94%) removal were investigated by using inorganic sorbents. The surfactants and pharmaceuticals showed promising removal y using organic sorbents. Magnetic, silica gel chitosan beads showed the highest removal efficiency (93%-97%) for food additives. Whereas cosmetics and organophosphates were moderately eliminated by all sorbents. Analysis of variance was applied to data to calculate the difference in removal capacity. The results showed that both Langmuir and Freundlich's isotherms were best fitted to experimental data.

AB Municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs) represent one of the largest point sources of contamination, but few studies have addressed the impact on fish populations. We tested the hypothesis that MWWEs disrupt multiple stress-related pathways by examining expression of genes and proteins in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A caging study was undertaken by placing juvenile trout for 14 d either at an upstream control or 100%, 50%, and 10% MWWE sites. A custom-made low-density rainbow trout cDNA microarray was utilized for transcriptomics, and select gene expression was confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR. MWWE exposure significantly elevated plasma cortisol, glucose, and vitellogenin levels, and altered the expression of a number of hepatic genes. Notably, expression of stress-related genes, hormone receptors, glucose transporter 2, and genes related to immune function were altered. The gene and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor, heat shock proteins 70 and 90, and cytochrome P4501A1 were also impacted by MWWE exposure. Our results demonstrate that tertiary-treated MWWEs elicit an organismal and cellular stress response in trout and may lead to an enhanced energy demand in the exposed fish. The disruption in multiple stress-related pathways suggests that tertiary-treated MWWEs exposure may reduce fish performance to subsequent stressors.

AB Activated sludge pilot plant studies were carried out in order to investigate the treatability of ethylene glycol, an organic chemical commonly used as a coolant in the pharmaceutical industry.  Four completely mixed, single-stage, activated sludge units, with a capacity of 80-litres were operated in parallel.  The effect of various concentrations of the test chemical on the sludge settleability, the sludge growth, and the plant performance in terms of BOD and COD removal were examined during the study.  It was concluded that a concentration of 0.1% ethylene glycol in the raw wastewater of the full-scale plant was treatable, as higher concentrations appeared to cause a deterioration in the floc structure and to enhance Nocardia scum formation on the surface of the aeration basin.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWIN) and application of biosolids introduce numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into agro-food systems. While the use of TWW and biosolids has many societal benefits, introduction of PPCPs in production agriculture poses potential food safety and human health risks. A comprehensive risk assessment and management scheme of PPCPs in agro-food systems is limited by multiple factors, not least the sheer number of investigated compounds and their diverse structures. Here we follow the fate of PPCPs in the water-soil-produce continuum by considering processes and variables that influence PPCP transfer and accumulation. By analyzing the steps in the soil-plant-human diet nexus, we propose a tiered framework as a path forward to prioritize PPCPs that could have a high potential for plant accumulation and thus pose greatest risk. This article examines research progress to date and current research challenges, highlighting the potential value of leveraging existing knowledge from decades of research on other chemicals such as pesticides. A process-driven scheme is outlined to derive a short list that may be used to refocus our future research efforts on PPCPs and other analogous emerging contaminants in agro-food systems.

AB In the paper, the problem of water pollution risks with pharmaceuticals was discussed. The results of the investigation from different countries are shown. Polish results are presented as well. Particular emphasis was put on water pollution with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and psychoactive drugs. The need for additional disinfection of drinking water has been highlighted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonic (US) process on the degradation of pharmaceuticals. For testing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs were selected. The tests were performed using Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer with a sonotrode. The samples were exposed to an ultrasonic field with parameters 250W and 20 kHz. During the experiment, sonication time was altered and it was equalled to 30, 60, 120, and 240 s. Based on the results, the relationship between the ultrasonic field, length of its duration, and particles' diameters was determined. Particle sizes were strongly correlated with the intensity and time of the ultrasonic field exposition. The largest particles were obtained for unmodified samples and they amounted to even 479 mu m. The smallest particles were obtained for samples modified for 240 s and amounted to 0.724 mu m for ketoprofen.

AB Wastewater from defect sewers can affect groundwater quality. An assessment of this environmental impact for a city of 50 000 inhabitants (Rastatt, SW Germany) was done using marker species distributions, condition monitoring of the sewer network, lab-scale analogy experiments, and specifically instrumented in-situ test sites near defect sewers. The studies revealed elevated concentrations of iodated X-ray contrast media (up to 360 ng/L amidotrizoic acid) and boron concentrations in the urban groundwater which are directly related to leaky sewers. Other common pharmaceuticals could not be detected in the groundwater. Observation wells were installed based on the information from a sewer defect database. These wells focusing on specific sewer leakages show significant changes in groundwater quality parameters.

AB Irrigation of crops with treated wastewater has been employed in many regions of the world. It mitigates the pressure of water demand, however, it also introduces effluent-derived organic contaminants into surface waters via agricultural runoff. In this study, a potato field located in southern California was selected as the research site. Runoff samples were collected during irrigation events, and a variety of compounds were identified both in irrigation water and runoff samples. Treatments on the field included polyacrylamide (PAM) application, deep plow, previous-grown Sudan grass, and control (without above treatments). The compounds included pharmaceuticals (e.g., clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac), personal care product (e.g., triclosan), endocrine disrupting compounds (e.g., bisphenol A, 4-n-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol), and estrogenic compounds (e.g., estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol). The monitoring results showed the presence of these compounds in runoff samples. They were at concentrations from below limits of quantification (LOQ) to sub mu g/l levels. Although their levels were low, their potential to elicit adverse effects in aquatic organisms cannot be overlooked.

AB The concentrations of some widely used pharmaceuticals, namely fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin C17H18FN3O3, norfloxacin C16H18FN3O3 and ofloxacin C18H20FN3O4) and sulfonamides (sulfadimethoxine C12H14N4O4S and sulfamethoxazole C10H11N3O3S) were determined in urban sewage sludge utilized for making compost. The levels of degradation of these pharmaceuticals resulting from sludge treatment were assessed. The concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals sufficiently varied both in sewage sludge and in compost and due to this phenomenon the possible danger resulting from the presence of pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge, used for composting, can not be ignored. The concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals were lower in compost, if compared to the relevant concentrations in sewage sludge. The highest pharmaceutical concentration in sewage sludge - 426 mu g/kg - was detected in the case of ciprofloxacin. The highest concentrations present in compost were 22 mu g/kg of norfloxacin and 20 mu g/kg of ciprofloxacin. Results show that before using the sewage sludge for making compost or before using the compost a fertilizer for food plants, they should be carefully tested against the content of commonly used pharmaceuticals.

AB Southern California imports nearly all of its potable water from two sources: the Colorado River and the California State Water Project (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin). Sewage treatment plant effluent (STPE) heavily impacts both of these sources. A survey of raw and treated drinking water from four water filtration plants in San Diego County showed the occurrence of several polar organic '' pharmaceuticals and personal care products '' (PPCP). These included phthalate esters, sunscreens, clofibrate, clofribric acid, ibuprofen, triclosan, and DEET. Several of these were also found in the finished water, such as di(ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzophenone, ibuprofen, and triclosan. Occurrence and concentrations of these compounds were highly seasonally dependent, and reached maximums when the flow of the San Joaquin River was low and the quantity of imported water was high. The maximum concentrations of the PPCPs measured in the raw water were correlated with low flow conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that feeds the State Water Project. The PPCP concentrations in raw imported water in the summer months approached that of reclaimed nonpotable wastewater.

AB The presence of emerging organic micropollutants (such as pharmaceuticals) in sewage has been, for a long time, an issue of great concern within the international scientific debate. This item represents one of the main challenges related to a sustainable development, with particular concern to the public health control. While most of the work has been concentrated on their detection and the evaluation of their average level, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of concentrations of these compounds in the effluent and its capability to affect the concentrations in time of the receiving water body. In this study, three sampling campaigns were carried out at two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Varese area (Northern Italy) with the aim of monitoring the occurrence of some pharmaceuticals to evaluate their removal efficiency. The detected pharmaceuticals were: Ofloxacin, Ibuprofen, Atenolol, Bezafibrate, Carbamazepine, Salbutamol, Cyclophosphamide and Hydrochlorothiazide. The results obtained, together with the analysis of the characteristics of the chemicals and of the two WWTPs, allowed evaluating the factors affecting the spatial and temporal concentration variability in effluent waters and the potential influence of this variability in driving the exposure of the aquatic ecosystems in the receiving water body.

AB We analyzed pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) in 36 samples taken from surface water, wastewater, ground-water, tap water and bottled water in Hanoi, Vietnam. We then compared the occurrence and fates of PMMoV with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which are known wastewater tracers. PMMoV was detected in 94% of the surface water samples (ponds, water from irrigated farmlands and rivers) and in all the wastewater samples. The PMMoV concentration ranged from 5.5 x 10(6)-72 x 10(6) copies/L in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents, 6.5 x 10(5)-8.5 x 10(5) copies/L in WWTP effluents and 1.0 x 10(4)-1.8 x 10(6) copies/L in surface water. Among the sixty PPCPs analyzed, caffeine and carbamazepine had high detection rates in surface water (100% and 88%, respectively). In surface water, the concentration ratio of PMMoV to caffeine remained unchanged than that in WWTP influents, suggesting that the persistence of PMMoV in surface water was comparable to that of caffeine. The persistence and the large concentration ratio of PMMoV in VVWTP influents to the method detection limit would account for its ubiquitous detection in surface water. In comparison, human enteric viruses (HEV) were less frequently detected (18-59%) than PMMoV in surface water, probably because of their faster decay. Together with the reported high human feces-specificity, our results suggested that PMMoV is useful as a sensitive fecal indicator for evaluating the potential occurrence of pathogenic viruses in surface water. Moreover, PMMoV can be useful as a moderately conservative fecal tracer for specifically tracking fecal pollution of surface water. PMMoV was detected in 38% of the groundwater samples at low concentrations (up to 19 copies/L). PMMoV was not detected in the tap water and bottled water samples. In groundwater, tap water and bottled water samples, the occurrence of PPCPs and HEV disagreed with that of PMMoV, suggesting that PMMoV is not suitable as an indicator or a tracer in those waters.

AB A sensitive method was developed to measure the sediment concentration of 10 wastewater micropollutants selected as potential sanitary tracers of sewage contamination and include: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (acetaminophen - ACE and diclofenac - DIC), an anti-epileptic drug (carbamazepine - CBZ), a beta-blocker (atenolot - ATL), a stimulant (caffeine - CAF), a bronchoditator (theophylline - THEO), steroid hormones (progesterone - PRO and medroxyprogesterone - MedP), an artificial sweetener (aspartame - APM) and personal care products (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide - DEET). Natural sediments (combined sewer overflow and stream sediments) were extracted by ultrasonic-assisted extraction followed by solid-phase extraction. Analyses were performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation in positive mode (APCl+) with a total analysis time of 4.5 min. Method detection limits were in the range of 0.01 to 15 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) for the compounds of interest, with recoveries ranging from 75% to 156%. Matrix effects were observed for some compounds, never exceeding vertical bar +/- 18%vertical bar. All results displayed a good degree of reproducibility and repeatability, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 23% for all compounds. The method was applied to an investigation of stream and combined sewer overflow sediment samples that differed in organic carbon contents and particle size distributions. Acetaminophen, caffeine and theophylline (as confounded with paraxanthine) were ubiquitously detected at 0.13-22 ng g(-1) dw in stream bed sediment samples and 98-427 ng g(-1) dw in combined sewer overflow sediment samples. Atenolot (80.5 ng g(-1) dw) and carbamazepine (54 ng g(-1) dw) were quantified only in combined sewer overflow sediment samples. The highest concentrations were recorded for DEET (14 ng g(-1) dw) and progesterone (11.5 ng g(-1) dw) in stream bed and combined sewer overflow sediment samples, respectively. The ratio of concentration to its limit of detection (C : LOD) in sediments for a subset of compounds were compared to their C: LOD in water. In waters with a large capacity for dilution relative to fecal sources, the C: LOD ranges in sediments were greater than in water. Thus monitoring programs for fecal source tracking using wastewater micropollutants should consider sediment sampling, particularly for waters with highly diluted sources of fecal contamination.

AB The European Union has defined environmental quality standards (EQSs) for surface waters for priority substances and several other pollutants. Furthermore national EQSs for several chemicals are valid in Austria. The study investigated the occurrence of these compounds in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In a first screening of 15 WWTPs relevant substances were identified, which subsequently were monitored in 9 WWTPs over 1 year (every 2 months). Out of 77 substances or groups of substances (including more than 90 substances) 13 were identified as potentially relevant in respect to water pollution and subjected to the monitoring, whereas most other compounds were detected in concentrations far below the respective EQS for surface waters and therefore not further considered. The preselected 13 compounds for monitoring were cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), diuron, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), di(ethyl-hydroxyl)phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin compounds (TBT), nonylphenoles (NP), adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and the complexing agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as well as nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). In the effluents of WWTPs the concentrations of the priority substances Cd, NP, TBT and diuron frequently exceeded the respective EQS, whereas the concentrations for DEHP and Ni were below the respective EQS. The effluent concentrations for AOX, EDTA, NTA, Cu, Se and Zn frequently are in the range or above the Austrian EQS for surface waters. Besides diuron and EDTA all compounds are removed at least partially during wastewater treatment and for most substances the removal via the excess sludge is the major removal pathway. For the 13 compounds which were monitored in WWTP effluents population equivalent specific discharges were calculated. Since for many compounds no or only few information is available, these population equivalent specific discharges can be used to assess emissions from municipal WWTPs to surface waters as well as to make a first assessment of the impact of a discharge on surface waters chemical status. Comparing discharges and river pollution on a load basis, the influence of diffuse sources becomes obvious and therefore should also be taken into consideration in river management.

AB Elimination of recalcitrant chemicals during wastewater treatment is a difficult problem for both developing and industrialized countries. The biological elimination of very persistent xenobiotics such as endocrine disrupting chemicals from municipal and industrial sewage treatment plants is an ambitious challenge as existing physico-chemical methods, such as advanced oxidation processes, are energy-intensive and consume high amounts of chemicals. Through the entry into force of strict legislative measures, such as the Water Framework Directives (EU WFD in Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the Community action in the field of water policy, 2000) and REACH (REACH EU in European Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe use (EC 1907/2006), 2007), the market for wastewater treatment is exploding. For instance the European market potential for the membrane bioreactor technology is estimated to 57 M(sic) per year. Based on recent progresses in nanotechnology, new developments in catalysis and environmental applications can be foreseen for the near future. Indeed, because of high surface area-to-volume ratio in nanosystems, heterogeneous enzymatic or catalytic reactions can be greatly enhanced. In the LANCE project a nanoparticle (NP)-based technology is under development. Cheap and resistant oxidative enzymes, i.e. laccases are immobilized onto the surface of the particles in order to produce systems possessing a broad substrate spectrum for the degradation of cocktails of recalcitrant pollutants. One of the objectives is to produce NPs that are compatible with wastewater treatment and can be synthesised in a cost-effective and large-scale fashion, e.g. silicabased NPs using flame spray pyrolysis and emulsion-based techniques. The modified particles are applied in bioreactors where they are retained, i.e. membrane bioreactors or perfusion basket reactors to eliminate pollutants from the wastewater. Such reactors allow multi-cycle use of the NPs coated with active enzymes and thus contribute to decrease the treatment costs. The two-year activities of the LANCE project encompass the synthesis of various NP systems, the immobilization of selected low cost industrial laccases on the latter, and the technical and scientific proof of the "depollution'' concept.

AB Siloxanes are widely used in various industrial applications as well as in personal care products. Despite their widespread use and potential toxic effects, few studies have reported on the occurrence of siloxanes in the environment. In this study, we determined the concentrations of 5 cyclic and 15 linear siloxanes in sludge collected from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. Total concentrations of 20 siloxanes (Sigma siloxane) in sludge ranged from 0.05 to 142 (mean: 45.7) mu g/g dry weight, similar to the concentrations reported in European countries but higher than those reported in China. The concentrations of siloxanes in sludge from domestic WWTPs were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those from industrial WWTPs, indicating higher consumption of siloxanes in various personal care products (e.g. shampoos and conditioners). The major siloxane compounds found in sludge were decamethylcyclopentasilane (D5), docosamethyldecasiloxane (L10) and dodecamethylcyclohexasilane (D6), which collectively accounted for, on average, 62% of the Sigma siloxane concentrations. Non-parametric multidimensional scaling ordination of the profiles of siloxanes indicated the existence of different usage patterns of siloxanes between industrial and household activities. Multiple linear regression analysis of siloxane concentrations and WWTP characteristics suggested that D5, D6 and linear siloxane concentrations in sludge were positively correlated with population served by a WWTP. Environmental emission fluxes of cyclic and linear siloxanes through sludge disposal in Korea were 14,800 and 18,500 kg/year, respectively. This is the first report describing occurrence and environmental emission of siloxanes through sludge in Korea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of detectable amounts of contaminants in treated sewage sludge (concentrations mu g/kg - mg/kg) has led to concerns that land applications of biosolids may result in an accumulation of contaminants in the soil and their subsequent translocation through the food chain. Despite advances in wastewater management (e.g., anaerobic, thermophilic, and mesophilic digestion), many compounds and their metabolites remain intact following treatment. This review looks at the main risk factors relating to the occurrence of "classic" (persistent organic pollutants [POPs]) and emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in biosolids. Relevant EU legislation and risk assessment strategies for the control of emerging contaminants are also considered. Organic pollutants regulated under the Stockholm Convention on POPs along with PPCPs were identified as contaminants of concern based on the risk factors: persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT). PPCPs were recognized as being of particular concern as their high transformation/removal rates are compensated by their continuous introduction into the environment. This study highlights the growing concern in relation to emerging contaminants in biosolids and highlights risk assessment strategies that can be used to characterize potential human/environmental risks.

AB The occurrence, fate and environmental impact of 30 pharmaceuticals including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, b-blockers, antiepileptics, lipid regulators, and stimulants were studied in two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in Wuxi City, East China. A total of 23 pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater samples, with a maximum concentration of 16.1 mg L-1 (caffeine) in the influent and 615.5 ng L-1 (azithromycin) in the effluent; 19 pharmaceuticals were detected in sludge samples at concentrations up to 12.13 mg kg(-1), with ofloxacin, azithromycin and norfloxacin being the predominant species. Mass balance analysis showed that biodegradation primarily accounted for the removal of sulfonamides, most of the macrolides, and other miscellaneous pharmaceuticals, while adsorption onto the sludge was the primary removal pathway for fluoroquinolones, tetracylines, and azithromycin during biological treatment. The total mass loads of target pharmaceuticals per capita in the two WWTPs were in the ranges of 2681.84333.3, 248.0-416.6 and 214.6-374.5 mg per day per inhabitant in the influent, effluent and dewatered sludge, respectively. The upgraded Plant A adopting the combined anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and moving bed biofilm process exhibited a much higher removal of target pharmaceuticals than the conventional Plant B adopting the C-Orbal oxidation ditch process. The concentration levels of sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin in the effluent, ofloxacin in the sludge, and the mixture of all target pharmaceuticals in both effluent and sludge posed a high risk to algae in aquatic environments.

AB The reuse of treated municipal wastewater (herein referred to as reclaimed water) in agricultural irrigation (RWAI) as a means to alleviate water scarcity is gaining increasing policy attention, particularly in areas where water demand mitigation measures have proved insufficient. However, reclaimed water reuse in practice is lagging behind policy ambition, with <2.5% of it reused in a European context. A key barrier identified as limiting its full valorisation is concern over its impact on human and environmental health. To address this concern, and to meet further objectives including achieving parity between current reclaimed water reuse guidelines operational in various Member States, the European Commission has proposed a regulation which identifies minimum quality requirements (MQR) for a range of microbiological and physico-chemical parameters but the inclusion of compounds of emerging concern (CECs) in terms of the determination of quality standards (QS) is missing. This paper reviews the existing pertinent EU legislation in terms of identifying the need for CEC QS for RWAI, considering the scope and remit of on-going pan-European chemicals prioritisation schemes. It also evaluates opportunities to link in with the existing EQS derivation methodology under the EU WFD to address all protection targets in the environmental compartments exposed via potential pathways of RWAI. Finally, it identifies the main data gaps and research needs for terrestrial ecosystems, the removal efficiency of CECs by WWTPs and transformation products generated during the wastewater reuse cycle.

AB The primary objective of this study was to determine the presence of unregulated organic chemicals in reclaimed water using complementary targeted and broad spectrum approaches. Eleven of 12 targeted human pharmaceuticals, antioxidants, and plasticizers, and 27 tentatively identified non-target organic chemicals, were present in secondary effluent entering tertiary treatment trains at a wastewater treatment plant and two water reclamation facilities. The removal of these compounds by three different tertiary treatment trains was investigated: coagulant-assisted granular media filtration (California Title-22 water, 22 CCR 60301-60357; Barclay [2006]), lime clarification/reverse osmosis (lime/RO), and microfiltration-reverse osmosis (MF/RO). Carbamazepine, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, p-toluenesulfonamide, caffeine, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA) were present at low to high nanogram-per-liter levels in Title 22 water. The lime/RO product waters contained lower concentrations of clofibric acid, ibuprofen, caffeine, BHA, and N-BBSA (< 10 to 71 ng/L) than their Title 22 counterparts. The MF/RO treatment reduced concentrations to levels below their detection limits, although BHT was present in MF/RO product water from one facility. The presence of the target analytes in two surface waters used as raw drinking water sources and a recharged groundwater was also examined. Surface waters used as raw drinking water sources contained caffeine, BHA, BHT, and N-BBSA, while recharged groundwater contained BHT, BHA, and N-BBSA. Nontarget compounds in recharged groundwater appeared to be attenuated with increased residence time in the aquifer.

AB The occurrence of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) consisting of natural and synthetic estrogens, namely estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was quantified in wastewater samples. The aim of this study was to assess the removal efficiency for the selected estrogens (E-1, E-2, E-3 and EE2) and reduction of estrogenic activity in wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using different processes. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were used to quantify the selected estrogens in wastewater samples. Estrogenic activity was assessed using the T47D-KBluc gene reporter assay. Results revealed a decrease in estrogen concentrations observed in the effluents of all the WWTPs, except for E-2 at Daspoort where no removal was noted. In general, the highest removal for total estrogens was observed at Phola (84%) combining three processes (AP, BF and wetland). The AS at Daspoort had a highest removal of 75% for E3; while at Zeekoegat the highest removal reached 61% for EE2. The PST at Daspoort had no removal recorded for all the compounds, except for the EE2 (33%). The AP and BF systems at Phola contributed to a higher removal of selected compounds. Downstream of the wetland at Phola no removal was recorded for E-3; while the highest removal reached 61% for E-1. The best performance in terms of the overall influent-to-effluent removal efficiency was observed at Phola WWTP, where E-1 removal of 85% was recorded.
   The highest estrogenic activity in the effluent was reported at Phola, with an average estradiol equivalent (EEQ) value of 6.3 +/- 6.7 ng/L. However, no anti-estrogenic activity was detected in any of the samples. The daily mass load discharged from the effluent of the three WWTPs was higher for E-1 recorded at Zeekoegat (8002.3 +/- 6416.3 mg/d), followed by Daspoort (3509.8 +/- 849.0 mg/d) and finally Phola (176.1 +/- 34.9).

AB Anti-inflammatory and anti-convulsive drugs are being detected in measurable quantities in municipal wastewaters. Some of these emerging substances undergo major transformation at the sewage treatment plant after biological and chemical treatments. The degradation of pharmaceutical products from high-quality treated wastewaters by disinfection processes is well documented. However, the effect of disinfection processes on these products in physicochemical primary-treated municipal effluents remains to be investigated. Pilot projects using ozone, performic acid and UV-radiation disinfection processes were carried out at the Montreal wastewater treatment plant. Residues of pharmaceutical products like salicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen were found in the treated wastewaters before disinfection at concentrations ranging from 42 to 2556 ng/L. Most of these substances were eliminated at a rate greater than 50% at an ozone dose of 10 mg/L. Higher removal rates (as high as 70%) were observed when 20 mg/L of ozone was used. Removal rates for UV radiation, on the other hand, were often below 10% among the substances studied. Limited removal rate was observed after UV radiation for diclofenac and triclosan (25 and 40% efficiency, respectively). The irradiation used here (25 mJ/cm(2)) for bacterial treatment appeared, as previously reported, to be too low to cause the significant breakdown of many of the pharmaceutical substances contained in these wastewaters. Poor reduction efficiencies ( 8%) were observed with the performic acid treatment. Further investigations on analytical methodologies are therefore needed to assess the potential impact of degradation by-products on the environment and on human health.

AB Fluctuations in ammonium (NH4+), measured as NH4-N loads using an ion-selective electrode installed at the inlet of a sewage treatment plant, showed a distinctive pattern which was associated to weekly (i.e., commuters) and seasonal (i.e., holidays) fluctuations of the population. Moreover, population size estimates based on NH4-N loads were lower compared to census data. Diurnal profiles of benzoylecgonine (BE) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC- COOH) were shown to be strongly correlated to NH4-N. Characteristic patterns, which reflect the prolonged nocturnal activity of people during the weekend, could be observed for BE, cocaine, and a major metabolite of MDMA (i.e., 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine). Additional 24 h composite samples were collected between February and September 2013. Per-capita loads (i.e., grams per day per 1000 inhabitants) were computed using census data and NH4-N measurements. Normalization with NH4-N did not modify the overall pattern, suggesting that the magnitude of fluctuations in the size of the population is negligible compared to those of illicit drug loads. Results show that fluctuations in the size of the population over longer periods of time or during major events can be monitored using NH4-N loads: either using raw NH4-N loads or population size estimates based on NH4-N loads, if information about site-specific NH4-N population equivalents is available.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds are known as emerging contaminants and their amounts are increasing in the environment. This study is focused on removing codeine phosphate (CPh) from water. In this respect, removing CPh by sand and two different types of modified sand were analyzed. The first silica sand modification was carried out by (3-Amino propyl) trimethoxysilane, and silica particles were coated by amine groups (S-A). With the second modification, the carboxylic acid group was bound with silica particles (3-Amino propyl) trimethoxysilane. Characterization was conducted by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-Ray Diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Effects of pH, contact time, and temperature of two modified silica sand were investigated. The results showed that silica sand does not have any effect on removing CPh; however, the removal percentages of S-A and S-C were 55% and 69%, respectively. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic were studied for both adsorbents. The results of the experiments show that the adsorbents follow Langmuir and pseudo-second-order rate. Maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of the S-A and S-C was 3.3 and 4.14 (mg/g) respectively. These adsorbents could be regenerated easily and used for more than 10 times. The speed of desorption was very fast. This study proposes that these adsorbents could be utilized for CPh removal from wastewater: the results show that removal percentages of CPh from wastewater for S-A and S-C adsorbents are 30% and 37%, respectively.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have raised considerable concern around the world due to their potential toxicity for ecological system and human health. PPCPs are ineffectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes and thus occur widely in aqueous environments. This study investigated the occurrence and removal of 28 often-used PPCPs (including selected antibiotics, estrogens, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and lipid regulators) in the primary, secondary and tertiary (ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (UF/RO)) treatment processes of the Water Resource Recycling Center (WRRC) and surface waters in Taiwan. We have demonstrated 20 target PPCPs in WRRC influents; sulfamethoxazole (1353 ng/L), caffeine (6823 ng/L) and acetaminophen (2716 ng/L) were found at high concentrations. Secondary and chlorination processes showed inefficient removal for PPCPs (12 PPCPs had <80% removal). However, most target compounds were removed effectively (with similar to 90% removal) in the tertiary process (UF/RO) except for oxytetracycline and caffeine, and the overall removal efficiency by WRRC was >99%. More than 10 compounds were detected in the surveyed surface waters (from reservoirs, river waters and dams). Caffeine had the highest observed concentration (1,813 ng/L) while others were present at <260 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine and caffeine were detected most frequently (>70%). Some of the PPCPs found originated from discharges from conventional wastewater treatment plants. In conclusion, RO demonstrated good overall performance and could be used to process wastewater to better ensure the health of humans and wildlife.

AB To simulate the filtration and/or degradation of trickling sewage from leaky sewers through the non-water-saturated underground, sewage was trickled through sand of 0.4-2 mm from the Rhine valley in glass columns of 125 cm length. For the same sewage the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was almost independent of low or high trickling rates. The COD removal efficiency varied, however, from 67% to 79%, for sewage from rain and dry weather periods, respectively. The water content of the moist sand increased from initially 80ml kg(-1) with increasing sewage trickling rates to 108 ml kg(-1) sand. It remained at 108 ml kg(-1) at higher trickling rates higher than 600 ml d(-1). Analyses of effluent of five consecutive 25-cm soil columns revealed that about 50% of the initial COD were filtrated off on top of the sand or degraded in the uppermost 25 cm. at varying trickling rates. Another 6-12% of the COD were removed in the following 25-50 cm of sand, whereas almost no further COD removal was seen in the subsequent two or three 25-cm columns. The COD elimination during trickling of sewage through the segmented column (interrupted random flow) was slightly better than that in the non-segmented column. Total and faecal coliform bacteria decreased faster with increasing trickling depth than that of total aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. After a filter/degradation stretch of 125cm elimination of all bacteria reached 96.2-99.9%. The sewage contained low concentrations of at least 10 different pharmaceuticals or X-ray media. During trickling of sewage through sand, elimination of these compounds by adsorption onto sand and/or biodegradation varied from a complete removal, e.g. Ibuprofen or Naproxen, to almost no removal for several X-ray contrast media. Some of the medicals were removed as effectively as during conventional sewage treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ferric (Fe3+) salt dosing is an efficient sulfide control strategy in the sewer network, with potential for multiple benefits including phosphorus removal in the biological reactors and sulfide emission control in the anaerobic digesters of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This paper extends the knowledge on the benefit of iron dosing by exploring its impact on the fate of organic micropollutants (MPs) in the wastewater using sewer reactors simulating a rising main sewer pipe. The sulfide produced by the sewer biofilms reacted with Fe3+ forming black colored iron sulfide (FeS). Among the selected MPs, morphine, methadone, and atenolol had >90% initial rapid removal within 5 min of ferric dosing in the sewer reactor. The ultimate removal after 6 h of retention time in the reactor reached 93-97%. Other compounds, ketamine, codeine, carbamazepine, and acesulfame had 30-70% concentration decrease. The ultimate removal varied between 35 and 70% depending on the biodegradability of those MPs. In contrast, paracetamol had no initial removal. The rapid removal of MPs was likely due to adsorption to the FeS surface, which is further confirmed by batch tests with different FeS concentrations. The results showed a direct relationship between the removal of MPs and FeS concentration. The transformation kinetics of these compounds in the reactor without Fe3+ dosing is in good agreement with biodegradation associated with the sewer biofilms in the reactor. This study revealed a significant additional benefit of dosing ferric salts in sewers, that is, the removal of MPs before the sewage enters the WWTP.

AB The occurrence, fate, mass loading and environmental emission of 37 pharmaceuticals were studied through an integrated approach involving both dissolved and adsorbed phase at a typical wastewater treatment plant in Hunan Province, Southern China. The results displayed the prevalence of 24 and 23 compounds in dissolved phase of influent and effluent, respectively. Fourteen compounds were found adsorbed onto sludge with a mean concentration ranging from 0.85 to 2900 mu g/kg dry weight. Twelve compounds exhibited high adsorption potential onto suspended particulate matter (SPM) with a mean fraction ranging from 8.8% (trimethoprim) to 97% (tetracycline). Furthermore, SPM showed a diverse absorbability in influent and effluent water circumstance. The overall elimination varied from -16% for lincomycin to 99% for paracetamol, while macrolides were able to withstand the whole treatment process. Mass balance analysis indicated that degradation was the predominant removal pathway for most compounds, and adsorption onto sludge combined with a minor portion of degradation explained for the reduction of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas macrolides were recalcitrant to both two processes. The total mass loading was estimated to be up to 2800 mg/d/1000 inhabitants and most compounds exhibited lower or comparable level comparing to the global published data. The total environmental emission was estimated up to be 1000 mg/d/1000 inhabitants, and a value of 650 mg/d/1000 inhabitants was obtained when considering merely the dissolved phase. This work would be helpful for the better understanding of ultimate fate and real pollution of pharmaceuticals in the water environment.

AB Many of the drugs used are not completely metabolized in the human body and with urine and faces are introduced into the sewage system. Finally, due to their incomplete removal during the conventional waste-water treatment process (CWTP), they call be released into the receiving water. One of the medicaments frequently detected in surface water is diclofenac. The present Study addresses the problem) of diclofenac removal in various aquatic samples using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The experiments were performed in distilled water and in biologically treated wastewater. The following AOPs were applied: Fenton's reagent, UV-and UV/H(2)O(2)-processes. The concentration of diclofenac in distilled water corresponded to the concentration of this drug in human urine (ca. 20 mg-dm(-3)). The real wastewater samples contained diclofenac concentrations ranging from 630 to 790 ng.dm(-3). The photodegradation of diclofenac was carried Out ill the photoreactor with a medium pressure Hg-vapor lamp (400 W). In the Fenton's reaction different( molar ratios-of H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) were used. The diclofenac; mineralization (TOC removal) strictly depended on the amount of H(2)O(2) applied in the Fenton's reaction. Diclofenac was rapidly degraded by direct photolysis (UV) and in UVA-H(2)O(2) process both in distilled water and in wastewater samples. The results proved that the advanced oxidation processes are effective in diclofenac removal from aquatic samples. The Pseudo first order rate constants for diclofenac photodegradation were determined.

AB While nutrient removal has been well studied in waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), studies of organic micropollutant removal in pond systems are limited. In this study, we investigated organic micropollutant, nitrogen and organic carbon removal in selected WSPs that differed in geographical location and pond configuration, and compared their performance to an oxidation ditch wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Of the 232 chemicals measured, 36 were detected in wastewater influent and 33 were detected in treated wastewater effluent. New data for micropollutant removal in WSPs was generated for three pesticides or related chemicals, five pharmaceuticals, the plasticizer N-butylbenzenesulfonamide, the antioxidant 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol, and two flame retardants tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate and tris(chloropropyl)phosphate isomers. Most of these micropollutants were relatively well removed in WSPs. The poorest treatment efficiency was observed in the single facultative pond system, with no maturation pond, suggesting that the presence of a maturation pond is important for chemical removal. The two WSPs in temperate climates were found to have higher concentrations of motile algae that can optimise their position with respect to light and temperature. However, to-date, the micropollutant removal by these algal species is not known. The highest removals of micropollutants in a WSP were measured in a complex WSP system with two maturation ponds, and the removals achieved were comparable to the oxidation ditch system. The key factors contributing to high micropollutant removal in this WSP were high solar irradiation and warm temperatures that promoted the growth of non-motile green algae previously found to degrade micropollutants, and photodegradation.

AB Presence of antimicrobial cocktails in the hydrological cycles is of interest because of their potential to mediate antimicrobial resistance within the natural environment. In this study, we determined the concentrations of selected antibiotics and antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, effluent suspended particulate matter (SPM), surface waters and river sediments in Kenya in order to determine the extent of pollution within the sampled environment. Target analysis for the most common antibiotics and ARVDs was done. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), trimethoprim (TMP), norfloxacin (NOR), zidovidine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP) were analyzed using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Effluent aqueous phase had concentrations ranging between 1.2 mu g L-1 to 956.4 mu g L-1 while the effluent SPM showed higher concentrations, ranging between 2.19 mg Kg(-1) and 82.26 mg Kg(-1). This study shows emission of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from WWTP to the environment mainly occurs via the SPM phase, which is usually overlooked in environmental analyses. Concentrations in surface waters and river sediments ranged between 1.1 mu g L-1 to 228 mu g L-1 and 11 mu g Kg(-1) to 4125 mu g Kg(-1) respectively. ARVDs occurred at consistently higher concentrations than antibiotics in both the aqueous and solid samples. The wastewater treatment plants and lagoons where sludge degradation should occur, are sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) including transformational products, nutrients and organic matter that are released back to the aqueous phase.

AB Three tributaries of the Fuyang River System, North China (Shaocun River-SR, Wangyang River-WR and Xiao River-XR), were selected for a case study evaluating the effect of industrialization on the accumulation of sedimentary trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), as well as the potential ecological risk (PER). This study showed that different pollution sources resulted in varying sedimentary trace metal characteristics and caused tremendously high metal contents. SR had high mean sedimentary Cr (1,588 mg/kg) and Zn (958 mg/kg) contents due to tannery wastewater discharge, while high mean contents of Zn (493 mg/kg) and Pb (481 mg/kg) were observed in the sediments from WR which received pharmaceutical wastewater, and high Cr (822 mg/kg) and Zn (695 mg/kg) contents were attributed to domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater effluent to XR. The highest mean content of Cd (6.69 mg/kg) was observed in XR, Cr (1,588 mg/kg) in SR and Pb (481 mg/kg) in WR. Enrichment factors indicated that Cd in XR, Pb in WR and Cr in SR were enriched largely due to the fast industrialization in the watershed, with the average values of 47.8, 37.0 and 17.6, respectively. The calculation of comprehensive PER indices revealed that there was serious ecological risk in XR due to high Cd contents, whereas moderate risk existed in WR and low risk in SR. Hence, sedimentary trace metal pollution resulting from regional industrialization should be taken into consideration seriously with respect to aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and ambient quality.

ID SEWER SYSTEMS; PHARMACEUTICALS; SOLIDS
AB The aim of this study was to assess uncertainties associated with different sampling modes when evaluating loads of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewers and influents to sewage treatment plants (STPs). The study demonstrates that sampling uncertainty can range from "not significant" to "far greater than the uncertainty due to chemical analysis", which is site- and compound-specific and depends on the (in)accuracy of the analytical method Conventional sampling devices operated in common time- or flow-proportional sampling modes, and applying traditional sampling intervals of 30 min or longer can result in the collection of nonrepresentative samples At the influent of a STP, wastewater may appear as a continuous stream, but it is actually composed of a number of intermittently discharged, individual wastewater packets from household appliances, industries, or subcatchments in pressurized sewer systems. The resulting heterogeneity can cause significant short-term variations of pollutant loads We present different experimental results and a modeling approach showing that the magnitude of sampling uncertainty depends mainly on the number of pollutant peaks and the sampling frequency, sampling intervals of 5 min or shorter may be required to properly account for temporal PPCP variations in influents of STPs A representative sample is a prerequisite for providing meaningful analytical results and cannot be compensated with a large number of samples, accurate chemical analysis, or sophisticated statistical evaluation This study highlights that generalizing from one case to another is difficult and hence a careful systems analysis of the catchment under investigation, or precautionary choice for a sophisticated sampling mode, is necessary to prove reproducibility.

AB In this study, we investigated the occurrences and fates of eight quinolones (QNs), nine sulfonamides (SAs), and five macrolides (MCs) in a wastewater reclamation plant (WRP) in Beijing, China. Among all the 22 antibiotics considered, quinolones were the dominant antibiotics in all samples (4916 ng L-1 in influents, 1869 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 123 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 9200 mu g kg(-1) in sludge samples), followed by sulfonamides (2961 ng L-1 in influents, 1053 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 25.9 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 63.7 mu g kg(-1) sludge samples) and macrolides (365 ng L-1 in influents, 353 ng L-1 in secondary effluents, 24.7 ng L-1 in tertiary effluents, and 32.7 mu g kg(-1) in sludge samples). The removal efficiencies of the target antibiotics were limited (-32 to 78%) in the conventional treatment. This study indicated that quinolones were mainly removed from the secondary clarifier, and sulfonamides were degraded in the oxic tank; while macrolides were considered as persistent during the conventional treatment. After the advance treatment, the target antibiotics could be effectively removed at high rates (85-100%), and the risks of antibiotic contamination significantly decreased. However, risk assessment showed that the risk of ofloxacin and erythromycin on organisms in recycled water needed further investigations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal efficiencies and elimination kinetics of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and BOD5, TSS, and ammonium were evaluated in a pilot vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and compared with those obtained by a sand filter. On the basis of the observed removals, the PPCPs studied were grouped in relation to their removal efficiency into (i) PPCPs very efficiently removed, that is, >95% removal in one of the systems (caffeine, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, CA-ibuprofen, hydrocinnamic acid, oxybenzone, ibuprofen, OH-ibuprofen); (ii) PPCPs moderately removed, with removals between 70 and 90% in the two systems (naproxen, diclofenac, galaxolide, and tonalide); and finally (iii) PPCPs poorly removed, with elimination rates of <30% (carbamazepine). At design hydraulic loading rate (HLR) the planted VFCW and the nonplanted SF exhibited similar PPCP removal efficiencies, but the VFCW was less sensitive to removal decline in overloading conditions (up to 2 times the design HLR). Moreover, under a clogging simulation, the HLR and the presence of vegetation were some of the key aspects affecting the PPCPs, BOD5, and ammonium removal from domestic wastewater. The VFCW evaluated was more efficient in terms of removal efficiency and loading rate for most of the PPCPs studied in comparison to constructed wetlands of other configurations (i.e., horizontal subsurface flow) and SF (nonplanted). The shorter hydraulic residence time (a few hours) in VFCW compared to that in other CW configurations ranging from days to weeks makes VFCWs a very appropriate wastewater treatment option in space-limited areas.

AB Pharmaceutical discharges into the aquatic ecosystem are of environmental concern and sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been pointed out as the major source of these compounds to coastal zones, where oceanic disposal of sewage occurs through submarine outfalls. Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water, but little is known about the effects on marine organisms. In this study, we employed a tiered approach involving the determination of environmental concentrations of DCF in marine water and the adverse biological effects for fertilization, embryo-larval development and biomarker responses of the mussel Perna perna. Results indicate that effects in fertilization rate and embryo-larval development were found in the order of mg.L-1. However, low concentrations of DCF (ng.L-1) significantly decreased the lysosomal membrane stability and COX activity, as well as triggered DNA damage, oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant defenses. Our results point to an environmental hazard at coastal ecosystems and suggest the need for improvements in the treatment of domestic wastewater aiming to reduce DCF concentrations, as well as regulation on current environmental legislation and monitoring of aquatic ecosystems.

AB As with other emerging economies, the rapid economic development of Indonesia has led to a migration towards the cities. The coastal megacity Jakarta is one of the largest urban agglomerations worldwide. The uncontrolled increase in urban population results in increased pressure on public infrastructure such as sewage treatment facilities leading to severe pollution of surface waters. In this study, a mass flux approach was used to assess the transport of organic pollutants by the largest city bound river of Jakarta, the Ciliwung, into the adjacent coastal ecosystem. Mass flux approaches are useful to track the origin and transport of wastewater-borne pollution, but are mostly neglected in favor of solely concentration-based evaluations.
   Constituents of municipal sewage made up around 70-80% of the fluxes of the 32 quantified water pollutants. Personal care product ingredients, especially the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), exhibited the highest fluxes. Our first assessment revealed that the Ciliwung River transports around 5-17 tons year(-1) of the quantified pollutants into the Java Sea. Such huge pollutant fluxes from municipal sources -a problem that is also relevant in other coastal megacities-might severely affect vulnerable coastal habitats.

AB The occurrence of a broad spectrum of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in raw sewage from a small resort town and their removal by a full- and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was analysed in this study. The MBR systems demonstrated similar reduction of chemical oxygen demand. However, the full-scale MBR sustained higher and more stable nutrient removal (>95% for both total nitrogen, TN and phosphate, PO43--P) than the pilot-scale system (ca. 80% TN and 30% PO43--P removal). Of the 45 monitored TrOCs including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), industrial chemicals, steroid hormones, and pesticides, 41 compounds were detected in the raw sewage above detection limits of 5-20 ng L-1. A correlation between the removal of TN and eight TrOCs (atenolol, caffeine, naproxen, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, DEET, estrone and diuron) was observed. Additionally, the full-scale MBR demonstrated higher and/or more stable removal for sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, diclofenac, diuron and amitriptyline. With the exception of caffeine, estrone and triclosan, TrOC concentrations in MBR effluent were lower than the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Augmentation of Drinking Water Supplies.

AB Propylparaben is widely used as a preservative in pharmaceuticals and personal care products and is ultimately excreted by the human body. Thus, propylparaben reaches sewage and enters the soil environment by sludge fertilization and wastewater irrigation. However, there are few existing studies on the toxicity and risks of such chemicals in terrestrial environments. In this study, a multispecies bioassay for propylparaben was performed and protective concentrations (PCs) were derived based on toxicity values by probabilistic ecological risk assessment. Acute and chronic bioassays were conducted on 11 species in eight taxonomic groups (Magnoliopsida, Liliopsida, Clitellata, Entognatha, Entomobryomorpha, Chromadorea, Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae). Based on the toxicity values calculated, the PC95 values for acute and chronic SSDs were 13 and 6 mg/kg dry soil, respectively. Toxicity varied among taxa, with soil algae emerging as the most sensitive to propylparaben. This may be attributable to differences in exposure pathways among species. The exposure pathway of propylparaben can be altered by adsorption to soil particles. As parabens are presently under-regulated globally in terms of their environmental effects, our findings can serve as the basis to propose standard values for environmental protection.

AB Wastewater (WW) for irrigation and application of biosolids in soil is becoming important as it is going to become very common in the near future. By 2050, the world is going to have four billion people living in water-scarce countries, making it a norm of freshwater for the cities and WW for agriculture. Further, biosolids might still be used as green biofertilizers for soils, if they are improved from an ecological point of view. However, application of biosolids in soil is argued because of the amount of organic pollutants that compromise the dynamic equilibrium of the biological systems. Therefore, information on the concentration, behavior, and cycling of organic pollutants as well as their possible degradation pathways is needed to predict, prevent, and remediate these pollutants from different sources including WW and biosolids. Among the group of organic pollutants, emerging contaminants (ECs) enter into the soil with the irrigation water from treated effluents and fertilization by biosolids. Quantification of ECs from WW and biosolids is of main importance to predict the toxic effects of WW effluents and sludge. Moreover, their incorporation into vegetables through irrigation and their magnification through natural food webs have been proved and must be monitored. This review presents information on the different sources of emerging contaminants and linking with the ecological effects they produced by reacting in the environment during various applications of WW and biosolids in soil. The available methods for analysis and quantification of ECs in different matrices, such as WW and biosolids, are also presented.

AB Sewage and sewage sludge is known to contain pharmaceuticals, and since sewage sludge is often used as fertilizer within agriculture, the reduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Citalopram, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine and Fluoxetine during composting has been investigated. Sewage sludge was spiked with the SSRIs before the composting experiment started, and the concentration of the SSRIs in the sludge during a 21 day composting period was measured by liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All the SSRIs had a significant decrease in concentration during the composting process. The highest reduction rates were measured for Fluoxetine and Paroxetine and the lowest for Citalopram. In addition three out of four known SSRI metabolites were found in all the samples, and two of them showed a significant increase in concentration during the composting period. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Concern over the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment is mounting due to the potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms. This study draws upon a nationwide survey of psychoactive pharmaceuticals (i.e., antischizophrenics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants) in sludge from 40 representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that receive domestic, industrial, or mixed (domestic plus industrial) wastewaters in Korea. A total of 16 psychoactive pharmaceuticals (0.12-460 ng/g dry weight) and nine of their metabolites (0.97-276 ng/g dry weight) were determined in sludge. The median concentrations of psychoactive drugs in sludge from domestic WWTPs were 1.2-3.2 times higher than the concentrations found in WWTPs that receive combined domestic and industrial wastewaters. Among the psychoactive drugs analyzed, the median environmental emission rates of alprazolam (APZ) and carbamazepine (CBZ) through domestic WWTPs (both sludge and effluent discharges combined) were calculated to be >= 15.5 mu g/capita/day, followed by quetiapine (QTP; 8.51 mu g/capita/day), citalopram (CLP; 5.45 mu g/capita/day), and venlafaxine (VLF; 3.59 mu g/capita/day). The per-capita emission rates of some of the metabolites of psychoactive drugs through WWTP discharges were higher than those calculated for parent compounds. Significant correlations (rho = 0.432-0.780, p < 0.05) were found between the concentrations of typically coprescribed antischizophrenics and antidepressants in sludge. Multiple linear regression analysis of measured concentrations of drugs in sludge revealed that several WWTP parameters such as treatment capacity, population-served, sludge production rate, composition of wastewater (domestic versus industrial), and hydraulic retention time can affect the concentrations of psychoactive drugs in sludge.

AB This study quantifies the removal of amixture of commonly detected emerging contaminants, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 4-nonylphenol (NP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) fromsynthetic wastewater using aerobic granular sludge in a sequential batch reactor. The emerging contaminant concentration in the influent wastewater was maintained near 500 mu g/L for the duration of the experiment. Removal of EE2, NP, and CBZ is comprised of both adsorption and degradation. In general, the main removalmechanism for the emerging contaminants was initially adsorption, however it transitions to degradation as the adsorption capacity is saturated. The stabilized degradation for EE2 and NP in the SBR, was 16.09 mu g/g and 20.05 mu g/g, respectively. There was limited degradation of CBZ during the anaerobic phase. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms fit the data well and constants for the equations are calculated. The constants for the Langmuir Isotherm are found to be (X/m)(max)= 36.23, b= 0.0019 for EE2 and (X/m)(max) = 44.25, b= 0.0004 for CBZ. None of the tested compounds were found to be detrimental to the performance of the aerobic granules, and high macronutrient removal efficiency was maintained. The granule sludge bed and particle size were not negatively affected by EE2 and NP, however, carbamazepine appeared to interfere with the mechanism of granule formation resulting in a decrease in particle size during the experiment.

AB N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and formaldehyde (FAH) are probable carcinogenic disinfection by-products and have been found to occur in areas of the Yodo River basin that are influenced by treated wastewater. The diurnal patterns of them were examined with water samples collected over 4 years in different seasons at five outlets of four sewage treatment plants (STPs), seven main stream sites, and five tributary sites in the basin. Based on mass flux calculations, STPs were shown to be the main sources of the downstream for NDMA and FAH loads in the study area. Moreover, results revealed that photo degradable NDMA and non-photo degradable FAH showed different fates during the river transportation. For NDMA, in addition to direct photolysis, water temperature was identified as an important factor in NDMA attenuation in surface waters. NDMA attenuated significantly in the daytime and even during summer nights but persisted during winter nights, while attenuation of FAH was found to mainly be influenced by water temperature, and persisted during winter. Their behaviors were compared in an artificial river channel and whole study area, clearly demonstrating the importance of monitoring them in the water environment during periods of low UV intensity and water temperature, especially winter nights.

AB The application of treated sewage sludge on farmland is a suggested method for recycling nutrients and reducing demand for commercial fertilizer. However, sludge needs to be safe from possible contaminants which can cause acute and long-term health and environmental problems. Residual pharmaceuticals and organic contaminants are mentioned as emerging threats since wastewater treatment plants are not designed to degrade these substances. The aim of this study was to screen and evaluate the presence, and reduction, of pharmaceuticals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during anaerobic digestion of mixed primary and waste-activated sludge at 35, 55 and 60 degrees C and during pasteurization at 70 degrees C. The study showed the difficulty of analysing pharmaceutical compounds in low concentrations in the sludge matrix. No general reduction of these compounds was seen during treatment, but for individual substances some reduction occured. The PAHs were generally not reduced during digestion or pasteurization, but for three substances (indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyreneand dibenzo[a,h] anthracene (analysed together) and benzo [g,h,i] perylene) reduction (up to 60%) during digestion was seen. Digestion at 35 and 55 degrees C resulted in about the same order of reduction of the three individual PAHs, which was higher than for digestion at 60 degrees C.

AB Most wastewater treatment processes are not specifically designed to remove micropollutants. Many micropollutants are hydrophobic so they remain in the biosolids and are discharged to the environment through land-application of biosolids. Micropollutants encompass a broad range of organic chemicals, including estrogenic compounds (natural and synthetic) that reside in the environment, a.k.a. environmental estrogens. Public concern over land application of biosolids stemming from the occurrence of micropollutants hampers the value of biosolids which are important to wastewater treatment plants as a valuable by-product. This research evaluated pyrolysis, the partial decomposition of organic material in an oxygen-deprived system under high temperatures, as a biosolids treatment process that could remove estrogenic compounds from solids while producing a less hormonally active biochar for soil amendment. The estrogenicity, measured in estradiol equivalents (EEQ) by the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay, of pyrolyzed biosolids was compared to primary and anaerobically digested biosolids. The estrogenic responses from primary solids and anaerobically digested solids were not statistically significantly different, but pyrolysis of anaerobically digested solids resulted in a significant reduction in EEQ; increasing pyrolysis temperature from 100 degrees C to 500 degrees C increased the removal of EEQ with greater than 95% removal occurring at or above 400 degrees C. This research demonstrates that biosolids treatment with pyrolysis would substantially decrease (removal >95%) the estrogens associated with this biosolids product. Thus, pyrolysis of biosolids can be used to produce a valuable soil amendment product, biochar, that minimizes discharge of estrogens to the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the occurrence and fate of 49 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2/O) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for seven consecutive days using 24-h composite sampling technique. Special emphasis was placed to understand the distribution of PPCPs in dissolved and adsorbed phase, and to evaluate PPCP fate in different treatment units. Among the 49 PPCPs, 40 PPCPs in influent, 36 in effluent, 29 in sludge and 23 in suspended solids were detected at least once during sampling. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a stimulant were predominant PPCPs in influent whereas antibiotics were predominant in sludge, effluent and suspended solids. Removal efficiencies from the aqueous phase based on the dissolved PPCPs showed variable contribution in removing different PPCPs under screen and grit chamber, anaerobic treatment, anoxic treatment, oxic treatment and sedimentation-UV treatments, with the highest removal percentage by anaerobic process in terms of both individual and overall treatment. Mass load analysis showed that 352 g PPCPs enter the WWTP daily while 14.5 g and 58.1 g were discharged through effluent and excess sludge to the receiving sea water and soil applications, respectively. Mass balance analysis based on both aqueous and suspended PPCPs showed 280 g (79.4%) mass of influent PPCPs was lost along the wastewater treatment processes, mainly due to degradation/transformation.

AB Microcosm constructed wetland systems established with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and Typha spp. or Phragmites australis were used to evaluate their ability to remove atenolol from wastewater. Combined with an efficient SPE concentration step, the use of HPLC-DAD yielded an analytical method for atenolol quantification with very low LOQ (9 ng mL-1) and high reproducibility (RSD 4%). Overall removal efficiencies of 92.5% and 94.5% were achieved after a retention time of only 4 days with the microcosm systems planted with Phragmites australis and Typha spp., respectively. The removal kinetics was characterised by an initial fast step (removal of about 75% after just 24 h) which is mainly attributable to adsorption on the LECA matrix. Atenolol removal in LECA beds continues to increase in a steady pace up to the end of the assay (8 days) being nevertheless about 5-10% lower than those observed in the planted beds after the first 4 days. For the retention time of 4 days most of the atenolol is removed by the LECA matrix but an additional 12-14% of the overall removal efficiency can be attributed to the Typha and Phragmites plants, which is in agreement with other published reports. Despite the fact that further tests using larger-scale flowing systems are required to evaluate fully the atenolol behaviour in constructed wetlands, this study points to the possible application of these low-cost wastewater treatment systems to treat atenolol contaminated wastewater.

AB A hybrid anaerobic/aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (A/O MBBR) system was established for wastewater treatment which contained tetracycline (TC) at the "mu g/L" level. The pilot-scale system was contained an 11.87 L anaerobic unit, a 32.29 L aerobic unit and a 21.53 L secondary sedimentation tank. Results for the single-factor experiment showed that the optimal temperature for this A/O MBBR was 25 degrees C with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal rate at 85.71% +/- 0.94% and 90.46% +/- 1.45%, respectively. Otherwise, the A/O MBBR system showed a high organic load that when the influent COD concentration was about 450 mg/L, the removal efficiency of COD and NH4+-N was 84.51% +/- 1.23% and 81.24% +/- 1.35% respectively, with effluent concentration of 71.94 +/- 5.18 and 7.24 +/- 0.63 mg/L respectively. The highest TC removal efficiency occurred at an influent concentration of 50 mu g/L under 8 h of hydraulic retention time, and the average degradation rate during this phase was 50.03% +/- 1.67%. In addition, the highest TC removal amount was 73.40 mu g/L occurred at a fourth phase when the initial concentration of TC was 206.46 mu g/L, showing the desired performance than many existed municipal sewage treatment plants. Moreover, this research provides a case study of a pilot-scale model for TC wastewater biodegradation and practical application.

AB A passive sampling device, the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS), was calibrated in-situ over a 4-week period in Oslo (Norway) for 10 illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals with the goal of developing an approach for monitoring long-term wastewater drug loads. The calibrations were performed in triplicate using three different overlapping calibration sets under changing environmental conditions that allowed the uncertainty of the sampling rates to be evaluated. All 10 compounds exhibited linear uptake kinetics and provided sampling rates of between 0.023 and 0.192 L d(-1). POCIS were deployed for consecutive 2-week periods during 2012 and 2013 and the calculated time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations used to define different drug use trends. The relative uncertainty related to the POCIS data was approximately 40% and, except for citalopram, 85% of all the long-term measurements of pharmaceuticals were within the confidence interval levels calculated to evaluate the effects of changing environmental conditions on the TWA estimations. POCIS was demonstrated to be sufficiently robust to provide reliable annual drug use estimates with a smaller number of samplers (n = 24) than recommended for active sampling (n = 56) within an acceptable level of sample size related uncertainty < 10%. POCIS is demonstrated to be a valuable and reliable tool for the long-term monitoring of certain drugs and pharmaceuticals within a defined population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comparison of time-weighted average pharmaceutical concentrations, loadings and enantiomer fractions (EFs) was made among treated wastewater from one rural aerated lagoon and from two urban tertiary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Alberta, Canada Passive samplers were deployed directly in treated effluent for nearly continuous monitoring of temporal trends between July 2007 and April 2008. In aerated lagoon effluent, concentrations of some drugs changed over time, with some higher concentrations in winter likely due to reduced attenuation from lower temperatures (e g, less microbially mediated biotransformation) and reduced photolysis from ice cover over lagoons, however, concentrations of some drugs (e.g antibiotics) may also be influenced by changing use patterns over the year Winter loadings to receiving waters for the sum of all drugs were 700 and 400 g/day from the two urban plants, compared with 4 g/day from the rural plant Per capita loadings were similar amongst all plants This result indicates that measured loadings, weighted by population served by WWTPs, are a good predictor of other effluent concentrations, even among different treatment types Temporal changes in chiral drug EFs were observed in the effluent of aerated lagoons, and some differences in EF were found among WWTPs. This result suggests that there may be some variation of microbial biotransformation of drugs in WWTPs among plants and treatment types, and that the latter may be a good predictor of EF for some, but not all drugs (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB In urban, industrial, and agricultural areas, a vast array of contaminants may be found because they are introduced into the aquifers by different recharge sources. The emerging contaminants (ECs) correspond to unregulated contaminants, which may be candidates for future regulation depending on the results of research into their potential effects on health and on monitoring data regarding their occurrence. ECs frequently found in wastewater, such as acetaminophen, carbamazepine, primidone, and sulfamethoxazole, may be good indicators of the introduction of the reclaimed water to the aquifers. The resistance of the ECs to removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) causes them to be appropriate sewage markers. Plana de Castellon (Spain) is a coastal area that has been characterized by intensive citrus agriculture since the 1970s. Traditionally, in the southern sector of Plana de Castellon, 100% of irrigation water comes from groundwater. In recent years, local farmers have been using a mixture of groundwater and reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to irrigate the citrus. The aims of the present study were: (i) to assess the occurrences, spatial distributions, and concentrations of selected ECs, including 32 antibiotics, 8 UV filters, and 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in groundwater in a common agricultural context; (ii) to identify the recharge (pollution) sources acting as the origin of the ECs, and (iii) to suggest ECs as indicators of reclaimed water arrival in detrital heterogeneous aquifers. The obtained data provided relevant information for the management of water resources and elucidated the fate and behavior of emerging contaminants in similar contexts.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine and cetirizine were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in surface and wastewaters from Berlin, Germany. This fast and cost-efficient method enabled to assess the spatial and temporal variation of these anthropogenic markers in a high-throughput screening. CBZ and cetirizine were detected by the same antibody, which selectively discriminates between both compounds depending on the pH value used in the incubation step. To our best knowledge, this is the first dual-analyte immunoassay working with a single antibody.
   The frequent sampling with 487 samples being processed allowed for the repeated detection of unusually high concentrations of CBZ and caffeine. ELISA results correlate well with the ones obtained by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Caffeine concentrations found in surface waters were elevated by combined sewer overflows after stormwater events. During the hay fever season, the concentrations of the antihistamine drug cetirizine increased in both surface and wastewaters.
   Caffeine was almost completely removed during wastewater treatment, while CBZ and cetirizine were found to be more persistent. The maximum concentrations of caffeine, CBZ and cetirizine found in influent wastewater by LC-MS/MS were 470, 5.0 and 0.49 mu g L-1, while in effluent wastewater the concentrations were 0.22, 4.5 and 0.51 mu g L-1, respectively. For surface waters, concentrations up to 3.3, 4.5 and 0.72 mu g L-1 were found, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anesthetic drug wastage has increasingly become the main resource of operating room sewage, which poses a great risk to the safety of humans and other organisms. Propofol is the most widely used anesthetic drug in the world, and also occupies the largest proportion of the total anesthetic wastage in the operating room. In this work, a 2D Cu2O anchored carbon catalyst (Cu2O@NC) was prepared by the assembly-pyrolysis process and successfully applied to peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. We took propofol as a typical example and investigated the removal activity through heterostructure-enhanced advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Through the degradation process, propofol can be removed from 20 ppm to ultralow levels within 5 min using the PMS/Cu2O@NC system. The degradation pathway of propofol was deduced through quantum chemical calculation and LC/GC-MS results. The final products were verified as CO2 and H2O. Moreover, sulfate radicals (SO4-) proved to be the dominant reactive oxidation species by radical scavenger experiments and ESR results. In addition, it has great universality for various pharmaceuticals such as tetracycline (TC), amoxicillin (AMX), cephalexin (CPX), and norfloxacin (NFX). Our work provided the possibility to treat operation room sewage in a rapid, high-efficiency, and feasible way.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging chemicals of concern detected in surface waters globally. Recent reviews advocate that PPCP occurrence, fate, and exposure need to be better predicted and characterized. The use of pharmaceutical prescription rates to estimate PPCP concentrations in the environment has been suggested. Concentrations of 7 pharmaceuticals (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) were measured in municipal wastewater using gas chromatography/ion trap-tandem mass spectroscopy (GC/IT-MS/MS). Subregional pharmaceutical prescription data were investigated to determine whether they could predict measured effluent concentrations (MECs) in wastewaters. Predicted effluent concentrations (PECs) for 5 of the 7 pharmaceuticals were within 2-fold agreement of the MECs when the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was not considered. When the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was considered, the respective PECs decreased, and most were within an order of magnitude of the MECs. Regression relationships of monthly PECs versus MECs were statistically significant (p < 0.05) but weak (R-2 = 0.18-0.56) for all pharmaceuticals except ketoprofen. This suggests high variability in the data and may be the result of factors influencing MECs such as the analytical methods used, wastewater sampling frequency, and methodology. The PECs were based solely on prescription rates and did not account for inputs of pharmaceuticals that had a significant over-the-counter component or were from other sources (e.g., hospitals).

AB Pharmaceutical residues are polluting the surface water environments worldwide. Sewage and wastewater treatment, therefore, needs to be improved in order to remove pharmaceutical residues from the effluent. One such treatment improvement is effluent ozonation. Even though ozonation has proven to be very efficient in reducing pharmaceutical parent compound concentrations in wastewater effluents, much remains unclear regarding potentially toxic ozonation by-product (OBP) formation. In this study, we sought to elucidate the aquatic toxicity of ozonated pharmaceuticals in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in a static 144 h post fertilization (hpf) fish embryotoxicity (ZFET) assay. Three pharmaceuticals commonly detected in wastewater effluents, i.e. carbamazepine, diclofenac, and oxazepam, were selected for testing. Toxicity was assessed before and after 1 min ozonation (0.053 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration) and 10 min ozonation (0.147 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration). Chemical analysis showed that carbamazepine and diclofenac were largely removed by ozone (90 +/- 11% and 97 +/- 3.8%), whereas oxazepam was removed to a lesser extent (19 +/- 5.7%). The ZFET assay revealed diverging toxicities. Diclofenac embryotoxicity decreased with increasing ozonation. Oxazepam did not cause embryotoxicity in the ZFET assay either pre- or post ozonation, but larvae swimming activity was affected at 144 hpf. Carbamazepine embryotoxicity, on the other hand, increased with increasing ozonation. Chemical analysis showed the formation of two OBPs (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide and 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine), possibly explaining the increased embryotoxicity. The results of this study highlight the importance of new chemical and toxicological knowledge regarding the formation of OBPs in post-ozonated effluents. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB This article reports on degradation using TiO2 immobilized on glass spheres of 15 emerging contaminants (ECs) at low concentrations in simulated and real Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) effluents. A sal containing titanium isopropoxide, commercial P25 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was prepared, and a layer of the photoactive precursor was immobilized on glass spheres by dip-coating. The raw materials and the xerogels were characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption, XRD and TGA-DTA. The xerogel showed the TiO2 anatase, rutile and brookite crystal phases characteristic of the reference materials. The diffraction pattern showed no modification of the crystal size from incorporation of the PEG. Two different TiO2 anatase crystal sizes were identified, which was attributed to the different TiO2 precursors used in the synthesis route. Degradation of the emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, flumequine, hydroxybiphenyl, ibuprofen, isoproturon, ketorolac, ofloxacin, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan), at an initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 each was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-UV) and mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar of Almeria (Spain). 85% of the compounds were degraded within 120 min of illumination time depending on the water. The results show the potential application of this technology as a good alternative to suspension systems for the treatment of polluted water. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the past two decades much research effort has focused on the occurrence, effects, and risks of estrogenic compounds. However, increasing emissions of new emerging compounds may also affect the action of hormonal pathways other than the estrogenic hormonal axis. Recently, a suite of novel CALUX bioassays has become available that enables looking further than estrogenic effects only. By employing these bioassays, we recently showed high glucocorticogenic activity in wastewaters collected at various sites in The Netherlands. However, since bioassays provide an integrated biological response, the identity of the responsible biological compounds remained unknown. Therefore, our current objective was to elucidate the chemical composition of the wastewater extracts used in our previous study by means of LC-high-resolution Orbitrap MS/MS and to determine if the compounds quantified could account for the observed glucocorticoid responsive (GR) CALUX bioassay response. The mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of various glucocorticoids in the range of 13-1900 ng/L. In extracts of hospital wastewater collected prior to sewage treatment several glucocorticoids were identified (cortisol 275-301 ng/L, cortisone 381-472 ng/L, prednisone 117-545 ng/L, prednisolone 315-1918 ng/L, and triamcinolone acetonide 14-41 ng/L) which are used to treat a great number of human pathologies. A potency balance calculation based on the instrumental analyses and relative potencies (REPs) of the individual glucocorticoids supports the conclusion that triamcinolone acetonide (REP = 1.3), dexamethasone (REP = 1), and prednisolone (REP = 0.2) are the main contributors to the glucocorticogenic activity in the investigated wastewater extracts. The action of these compounds is concentration additive and the overall glucocorticogenic activity can be explained to a fairly large extent by their contribution.

AB This study focuses on the removal of 32 selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors and biocides/pesticides) found in an effluent coming from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) based on activated sludge. Dissolved organic matter was present, with an initial total organic carbon of 15.9 mg L-1 and a real global quantity of micropollutants of 29.5 mu g L-1. The treatments tested on the micropollutants removal were: UV-light emitting at 254 nm (UV254) alone, dark Fenton (Fe-2+,Fe-3+/H2O2) and photo-Fenton (Fe-2+,Fe-3+/H2O2/light). Different irradiation sources were used for the photo-Fenton experiences: UV254 and simulated sunlight. Iron and H2O2 concentrations were also changed in photo-Fenton experiences in order to evaluate its influence on the degradation. All the experiments were developed at natural pH, near neutral. Photo-Fenton treatments employing UV254, 50 mg L-1 of H2O2, with and without adding iron (5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ added or 1.48 mg L-1 of total iron already present) gave the best results. Global percentages of micropollutants removal achieved were 98 and a 97% respectively, after 30 mm of treatments. As the H2O2 concentration increased (10, 25 and 50 mg L-1), best degradations were observed. UV254, Fenton, and photo-Fenton under simulated sunlight gave less promising results with lower percentages of removal.
   The highlight of this paper is to point out the possibility of the micropollutants degradation in spite the presence of DOM in much higher concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biosolids from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) are environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which attract great concerns on their efficient treatments. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used for sewage sludge treatment but its effectiveness is limited due to the slow hydrolysis. Ozone and thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment were employed to improve AD efficiency and reduce antibiotic resistant genes in municipal and pharmaceutical waste sludge (MWS and PWS, respectively) in this study. Sludge solubilization achieved 15.75-25.09% and 14.85-33.92% after ozone and thermal hydrolysis, respectively. Both pre-treatments improved cumulative methane production and the enhancements were greater on PWS than MWS. Five tetracycline-resistant genes (tet(A), tet(G), tet(QJ, tet(W), tet(X)) and one mobile element (intI1) were qPCR to assess pre-treatments. AD of pre-treated sludge reduced more tet genes than raw sludge for both ozonation and thermal hydrolysis in PWS and MWS. Thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment was more efficient than ozone for reduction after AD.

AB Recent worldwide surveys have not only established incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by sewage treatment plants, but also their presence in surface waters receiving treated sewage effluent. Those aquatic systems where sewage effluent dominates flow are thought to be at the highest risk for ecosystem level changes. The city of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (population 190,400) treats its sewage at a modern tertiary sewage treatment facility located on Wascana Creek. The Wascana Creek hydrograph is dominated by one major event: spring snow melt. Thereafter, creek flow declines considerably and in winter treated sewage effluent makes up almost 100% of stream flow. Four water surveys conducted on the creek from winter 2005 to spring 2007 indicated that PPCPs were always present, in nanogram and sometimes microgram per liter concentrations downstream of the sewage treatment plant. This mixture included antibiotics, analgesics, antiinflammatories, a lipid regulator, metabolites of caffeine, cocaine and nicotine, and an insect repellent. Not surprisingly, concentrations of some PPCPs were highest in winter. According to hazard quotient calculations and homologue presence, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, triclosan, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole were present in Wascana Creek at concentrations that may present a risk to aquatic organisms. The continual exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals as well as concentrations of un-ionized ammonia that far exceed Canadian and American water quality guidelines suggests that Wascana Creek should be considered an ecosystem at risk. Although the Wascana Creek study is regional in nature, the results highlight the considerable risks posed to aquatic organisms in such effluent-dominated ecosystems. Environ. Toxicol.

AB A new method for the determination of three endocrine disrupters (estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, and bisphenol A) and five pharmaceuticals (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, diclofenac, bezafibrate and miconazole) in raw sewage samples using tandem solid phase extraction (SPE) sorbents and high-performance liquid chromatography-negative and positive electrospray high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) was developed and validated. The SPE procedure used both a strong ion exchange sorbent (SAX) and a modified divinylbenzene-pyrrolidone SPE sorbent to reduce the levels of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) and to concentrate the analytes of interest from the sewage samples. The influence of matrix composition on the ionisation efficiency, the SPE recoveries, and the sensitivity of the method was identified and quantified. The method was successfully applied to the determination of analytes in raw sewage samples collected from the entrance of the Arrudas Sewage Treatment Plant, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

AB We investigated the removal of twelve pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which has emerged as a technology for improving the quality of organic waste materials producing a valuable biochar material.
   In this study, the HTC converted sewage sludge samples to a biochar product within 4 h at a temperature of 210 degrees C and a resulting pressure of about 15 bar. Initial pharmaceutical load of the sewage sludge was investigated as well as the residual concentrations in biochar produced from spiked and eight native sewage sludge samples from three waste water treatment plants. Additionally, the solid contents of source material and product were compared, which showed a considerable increase of the solid content after filtration by HTC.
   All pharmaceuticals except sulfamethoxazole, which remained below the limit of quantification, frequently occurred in the investigated sewage sludges in the mu g/kg dry matter (DM) range. Diclofenac, carbamazepine, metoprolol and propranolol were detected in all sludge samples with a maximum concentration of 800 mu g/kg DM for metoprolol. HTC was investigated regarding its contaminant removal efficiency using spiked sewage sludge. Pharmaceutical concentrations were reduced for seven compounds by 39% (metoprolol) to >= 97% (carbamazepine). In native biochar samples the four compounds phenazone, carbamazepine, metoprolol and propranolol were detected, which confirmed that the HTC process can reduce the load of micropollutants. In contrast to the other investigated compounds phenazone concentration increased, which was further addressed in thermal behaviour studies including three structurally similar potential precursors.

AB Selected pharmaceuticals, among them analgesics, beta-blockers and anti-depressants as well as caffeine, the antibacterial triclosan and the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-3-toluamide (DEET) were determined in different sewage samples (sewage treatment plants, hospital effluents) from Tromso/Norway and in seawater from Tromso-Sound, into which the sewage is discharged. While caffeine, triclosan, ibuprofen and its major metabolites hydroxy- and carboxyibuprofen were present in all sewage samples, additional pharmaceuticals were observed in sewage containing hospital effluents. Concentrations. were in the range of 20-293 mug/l (caffeine), 0.2-2.4 mug/l (triclosan) and 0.1-20 mug/l (Sigmaibuprofen + metabolites). In seawater, only caffeine (7-87 ng/l), DEET (0.4-13 ng/l) and ibuprofen + metabolites (sum concentration < LOQ-7.7 ng/l) were detected. Ibuprofen and its metabolites hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen were quantified individually by use of the respective reference compounds. Relative amounts of the three compounds were determined in different types of water showing characteristic patterns, with hydroxy-ibuprofen being the major component in sewage whereas carboxy-ibuprofen was dominant in seawater samples. The patterns which were compared to those observed in similar samples from Germany indicated different transformation behaviour under limnic and marine conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated the presence and fate of 16 antibiotics belonging to seven groups (beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim and amphenicols) in effluents of sewage plants and receiving waters in Hong Kong. Cefalexin, amoxicillin, ofloxacin and erythromycin-H2O were ubiquitous in sea water throughout Victoria Harbour, indicating continuous discharge to the environment. This is one of the few studies reporting the frequent occurrence of cefalexin and amoxicillin in sewage effluents and sea water (170-5070 and 64-1670 ng/L in sewage; 6.1-493 and 0.64-76 ng/L in sea water, respectively). Mass flows from seven sewage plants discharged an estimated total of 14.4 kg/day to the Harbour. Typhoon shelters also appeared to play an important role as sources of antibiotics, as evidenced by elevated concentrations within their boundaries. Mass balance estimations suggested significant quantities of antibiotics are discharged to the Harbour without passage through treatment plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Staphylococci causing diseases in humans and animals are well described, whereas not very much is known about the staphylococci in natural ecosystems. Due to increased consumption of antibiotics, multiresistant species are released with excrements. Therefore, 1048 staphylococci from raw and treated sewage and from receiving water bodies were isolated, identified and tested for resistance against erythromycin, clindamycin, oxacillin and ciprofloxacin. More resistant staphylococci were present in raw sewage (33.8%) than in treated sewage (24.9%) or river water (10.9%). Of all isolates, 20.2% were resistant against the macrolide erythromycin which can induce cross-resistance against lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics (iMLS(B)). Erythromycin is metabolized to anhydroerythromycin and excreted with urine into sewage. The question arises whether anhydroerythromycin can also induce resistance against MLSB antibiotics in staphylococci. This was investigated with antibiotic susceptibility tests (D-tests) and macrodilution assays. Staphylococci with iMLS(B) phenotype in river water were more numerous (27.8%) than in treated sewage (18.9%). The most common MLSB resistance gene was ermC. Traces of erythromycin and anhydroerythromycin (1ngL(-1)) induced already resistance against clindamycin after only 10min exposure. This is reported for the first time and is relevant for risk assessment.

AB Interest in the presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. in the water of our rivers and, to a lesser extent, in our drinking water, has been growing in recent decades. Many of these substances, currently classified as "emerging pollutants", are biologically active compounds and continuously released in effluents. As sewage treatment plants (STPs) are not adequately equipped to eliminate all of these substances completely, some are discharged directly into rivers. In Spain, as in most of its neighbouring countries, there is an elevated use of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (which are extremely prevalent among the older adult population) and anti-inflammatory medications, which are obtainable over the counter without a medical prescription.
   This study therefore sought to determine to what degree pharmaceuticals with the highest regional prescription and/or use rates, such as cardiovascular and analgesic/anti-inflammatory/antipyretic medications, were present in the principal rivers (pram, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tagus) and tap-water samples of the Madrid Region (MR). Samples were taken downstream the discharge of 10 of the most important region's STPs and the most frequently used drugs in the region were analysed for.
   Of the 24 drugs analysed, 21 were detected at concentrations ranging from 2 ng L-1 to 18 mu g L-1. The highest drug concentrations corresponded to ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, atenolol, frusemide (furosemide), gemfibrozil and hydrochlorthiazide, and in most cases exceeded the amounts reported in the scientific literature. No traces of these groups of pharmaceuticals were detected in the drinking water analysed.
   On the basis of the high concentrations detected, we believe that an environmental surveillance system should be implemented to assess the continuous discharge of these pharmaceuticals and their possible ecotoxicological effects. At the same time, efforts to raise the awareness of the public about responsible use and the proper disposal of such substances at purpose-designated collection points should be increased. Furthermore sewage treatment processes should be suitably adapted to increase the rates of removal of these drugs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose and evaluate a mode-of-action based test battery of low-complexity and in-vitro bioassays that can be used as a routine monitoring tool for sewage treatment efficiency and water quality assessment. The test battery comprises five bioassays covering five different modes of toxic action. The bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri and a growth rate inhibition test with the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are measures of non-specific integrative effects. A second endpoint in the algae test, the specific inhibition of the efficiency of photosynthesis, gives an account of the presence of herbicides. An enzymatic assay covers an important aspect of insecticidal activity, the inhibition of the acetylcholine esterase activity. Estrogenic effects are assessed with the yeast estrogen screen (YES) and genotoxicity with the umuC test. Three field studies, each lasting six to seven consecutive days, were undertaken at a sewage treatment plant (STP) in Switzerland. Samples were collected in summer and late autumn, under dry and rainy conditions. None of the bioassays gave positive results with raw water in whole effluent toxicity testing. Therefore, water samples from various sites during wastewater treatment and from surface water were enriched with solid-phase extraction. The focus was on non-volatile compounds of average to moderate hydrophobicity, a range that includes most pesticides, biocides and pharmaceuticals. Various polar solid phases were evaluated for their extraction efficiency, disturbance by matrix components and overall performance. We finally selected a mixture of a polymeric sorbent and a C18-sorbent, Lichrolut EN and RP-18 or, alternatively, Empore(TM) SDB-RPS disks. All bioassays gave clear and robust responses with the SPE extracts. With the bioassay data the treatment efficiency of the STP can be assessed with respect to different modes of toxic action and accordingly different groups of micropollutants. Furthermore, the data allowed for a comparison between the effluent and the receiving river. In all bioassays the primary effluent had a strong effect and this effect was reduced after passing the STP. Treatment efficiency was high (typically over 90%) but varied from bioassay to bioassay, which is expected because each bioassay detects different types of micropollutants and therefore we cannot expect a common answer.

AB Experiments were conducted to study the role of micro-electrolysis in removing chromaticity and COD and improving the biodegradability of wastewater from pharmaceutical, dye-printing and papermaking plants. Results showed that the use of micro-electrolysis technology could remove more than 90% of chromaticity and more than 50% of COD and greatly improved the biodegradability of pharmaceutical wastewater. Lower initial pH could be advantageous to the removal of chromaticity. A retention time of 30 minutes was recommended for the process design of micro-electrolysis. For the use of micro-electrolysis in treatment of dye-printing wastewater, the removal rates of both chromaticity and COD were increased from neutral condition to acid condition for disperse blue wastewater; more than 90% of chromaticity and more than 50% of COD could be removed in neutral condition for vital red wastewater.

TI Modeling in-sewer transformations at catchment scale - implications on
   drug consumption estimates in wastewater-based epidemiology
SO WATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

   epidemiology; Pharmaceuticals
ID PHARMACEUTICALS; FATE; TRANSPORT; LOADS
AB To which extent illicit drugs are transformed during in-sewer transport, depends on a number of factors: i) substance-specific transformation rates, ii) environmental conditions, iii) point of discharge (location of drug user) and iv) sewer network properties, primarily hydraulic residence time (HRT) and the ratio of biofilm contact area to wastewater volume (A/V-eq).
   Assessing associated uncertainties typically requires numerous simulations. Therefore, we propose a new two-step modeling framework: 1) Quantify hydrodynamic conditions. This computationally demanding step was performed once in SWMM to derive HRT and A/V-eq for each potential point of discharge (node) in three catchments of different size. 2) Estimate biomarker loss. In this step, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for defined scenarios. Depending on assumptions about drug user distribution and prevalence, a number of nodes was sampled. For each node an empirical first-order transformation model was applied with flow-path-corresponding HRT and A/V-eq from step 1. Biotic and abiotic transformation rates were sampled from distributions combining variability of different biofilms.
   In our modeling study, median losses were >30% for amphetamine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and 6-acetylcodeine in all three catchments with high uncertainty (5%-100% loss), which would imply a systematic underestimation of consumption when neglecting in-sewer processes. Median losses for 21 other investigated biomarkers were <10% with different uncertainty ranges - "no substantial transformation" was confirmed for nine substances in a real sewer segment with a 2-h residence time. Transferability of these results must be tested for other catchments. To further reduce uncertainty, mainly additional knowledge on transformation rates, particularly in biofilm, and their distribution across a sewer network is needed to update model input objectively. Our approach allows efficient testing and, furthermore, can be expanded for many other human biomarkers. Accounting for biomarker stability during in-sewer transport will avoid biased estimates and further improve wastewater-based epidemiology. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The electrolytic removal of ethinylestradiol (EE2), the most potent synthetic estrogen, in effluent of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating hospital sewage and in drinking water, was studied at dosed concentrations of about 1 mg EE2 L-1. Removal efficiencies of up to 98% were obtained with supplemental efficient eradications of bacteria (up to 3.4 log units). Residual effects were observed when a treated flow was mixed with an untreated flow. An increasing concentration of NaCl resulted in an enhanced EE2 removal. This effect was more pronounced in MBR effluent than in drinking water. To approach more environmentally realistic concentrations, an experiment with initial concentration of 10 mu g EE2 L-1 drinking water was set up, still resulting in an EE2 removal of 85%.

AB Anthropogenic organohalide contaminants present in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) often remain untreated and can be discharged into the environment. Although organohalide respiring bacteria (OHRB) contribute to the elimination of anthropogenic organohalides in natural anaerobic environments, reductive dehalogenation by OHRB in mainstream WWTPs remains poorly understood. In this study, we quantified OHRB during a long-term operation of a municipal WWTP with short hydraulic and sludge retention times (3 h and 1.5-5 days, respectively). The obligate OHRB were detected at high levels (averaging 2.56 +/- 1.73 x 10(7) and 3.11 +/- 1.16 x 10(7) 16S rRNA gene copies/ml MLSS sludge in anoxic and aerobic zones, respectively) over the entire sampling period and throughout the wastewater treatment train. Microcosms derived from mainstream activated sludge contained an unidentified member of the Dehalococcoides genus that metabolically dechlorinated triclosan, used as a representative emerging organohalide antimicrobial, to diclosan, suggesting the potential of anaerobic degradation of emerging contaminants in WWTPs. To further understand the mechanisms for such antimicrobials' removal, an investigation of dechlorination of triclosan by Dehalococcoides strains was conducted. Dechlorination of environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan to diclosan was observed in Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain CG1, yielding 4.59 +/- 0.34 x 10(8) cells/mu mole Cl- removed at a rate of 0.062 mu M/day and a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Notably, both the tolerance of strain CG1 to triclosan and the rate of triclosan dechlorination increased when CG1 was cultured in the presence of both triclosan and tetrachloroethene. Taken together, our results suggest that anaerobic degradation of organohalide antimicrobials might be more prevalent in mainstream WWTPs than previously speculated, though the low growth yields that are supported by triclosan dechlorination seem to indicate that other organohalide substrates could be necessary to sustain OHRB populations in these systems.

AB The emerging pollutants cover a wide range of synthetic chemicals that are indispensable to modern society but with little known effects for aquatic animals and for people who consume polluted waters with these products. Gels manipulated with hormones are widely used for hormone replacement, muscle growth, among other purposes. However, only a small part of these hormones are absorbed into the skin, and so these can be transferred to the domestic sewage during the washing of exposed body regions. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity levels for the bioindicator Artemia salina L., and cytotoxicity and mutagenicity for the bioindicator Allium cepa L. of gels handled with 1% testosterone and 0.1% estradiol. Data from immobile/dead A. salina numbers after 24 h of exposure showed that the highest concentrations of testosterone (10 and 25 mu g/mL) and the highest concentration of estradiol (15 mu g/mL) were toxic to this bioindicator. For the bioindicator A. cepa, mitotic indices and chromosomal aberrations did not indicate statistical differences between the groups treated with the testosterone gels (1, 10, 50 mu g/mL) and estradiol (0.03, 0.30, 1.5 mu g/mL) and the control group. However, all concentrations of the testosterone-containing gel decreased the percentage of cell division in relation to the time 0 h of each treatment and to the time 24 h of the negative control. Therefore, it is concluded that rivers or aquatic environments can be polluted if wastewater with the toxic concentrations found of these hormonal gels is discarded without previous treatment, compromising the life of organisms that live there. And, it encourages the development of techniques for treating sewage and water to reduce/eliminate the hormones present in them.

Because the surface water contains treated sewage. wastewater residues are present in surface water and groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers, including tritium and helium isotopes (H-3, He-3, He-4), stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and a number of persistent sewage indicators, such as chloride. boron and a selection of pharmaceutical residues (phenazone-type analgesics and their metabolites, carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium, Gd-excess), were used to estimate travel times from the surface water to individual production and observation wells at two sites. The study revealed a strong vertical age stratification throughout the upper aquifer, with travel times varying from a few months to several decades in greater depth. Whereas the shallow bank filtrate is characterized by the reflection of the time-variant tracer input concentrations and young H-3/He-3 ages, the deeper, older bank filtrate displays no tracer seasonality, H-3/He-3 ages of a few years to decades and strongly deviating concentrations of several pharmaceutical residues, reflecting concentrations of the source surface water over time. The phenazone-type pharmaceuticals persist in the aquatic environments for decades. Bank filtration in Berlin is only possible at the sandy lakeshores. In greater water depth, impermeable lacustrine sapropels inhibit infiltration. The young bank filtrate originates from the nearest shore, whereas the older bank filtrate infiltrates at more distant shores. This paper illustrates the importance of using multiple tracer methods, capable of resolving a broad range of residence times, to gain a comprehensive understanding of time-scales and infiltration characteristics in a bank filtration system.

AB The present study reports a precise and simple offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous determination of five representative and commonly present pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), a new class of emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment. The target list of analytes including ciprofloxacin, acetaminophen, caffeine benzophenone and irgasan were separated by a simple HPLC method. The column used was a reversed-phase C18 column, and the mobile phase was 1 % acetic acid and methanol (20: 80 v/v) under isocratic conditions, at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). The analytes were separated and detected within 15 min using the photodiode array detector (PDA). The linearity of the calibration curves were obtained with correlation coefficients 0.98-0.99. The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy and ruggedness demonstrated the reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity of the developed method. Prior to the analysis, the SPE was performed using a C18 cartridge to preconcentrate the targeted analytes from the environmental water samples. The developed method was applied to evaluate and fingerprint PPCPs in sewage collected from a residential engineering college campus, polluted water bodies such as Nag river and Pili river and the influent and effluent samples from a sewage treatment plant (STP) situated at Nagpur city, in the peak summer season. This method is useful for estimation of pollutants present in microquantities in the surface water bodies and treated sewage as compared to nanolevel pollutants detected by mass spectrometry (MS) detectors.

AB Pharmaceuticals are released to the environment after human and animal consumption, which partly comes from accumulation in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment. This paper developed a method for the determination of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and 14 pharmaceuticals belonging to multiple therapeutic classes such as antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, anti-hypertensive, and anticonvulsant in dewatered sludge. Pressurized liquid extraction using methanol/McIlvaine buffer (volume ratio, 1:1), associated with HPLC-MS/MS was proven to be effective for extraction and quantification of pharmaceuticals and DEET in dewatered sludge. Optimization procedures, including extraction method, extraction solvents and clean-up treatment, were carried out by simulating naturally aged samples to provide a more realistic extraction than previous methods, which were often done by spiking the standard solution before extraction without any aging procedures. The internal standard quantification method using six isotopically labelled compounds was applied to improve the poor absolute recoveries induced by severe matrix effects to obtain better relative recoveries (70-120%). Good relative standard deviations (lower than 19.0% for 7 repeats) and the limit of quantification (0.6-19.4 mu g/kg) indicated that the developed method was reliable and sensitive to extract and quantify the studied pharmaceuticals in dewatered sludge. For samples collected from eight sewage treatment plants in Beijing, China, it was found that trimethoprim, caffeine, ketoprofen and ibuprofen were the most prominent contaminants, with the median concentrations reaching 97.6, 179.4, 268.0 and 153.0 mu g/kg, respectively. The level of ketoprofen, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, cabamazepine and diclofenac were similar to results reported from Spain, whilst the levels of other compounds were similar to those found in Germany, Canada and the US.

AB A monitoring program was initiated for two sewage outfalls (OA and OB) with different land uses (mainly residential versus institutional) over the course of a year. Eleven CSO events resulting from fall and summer precipitations and a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation in late winter and early spring were monitored. Median concentrations measured in CSOs were 1.5 x 10(6) Escherichia coli/100 mL, 136.0 mg/L of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 4599.0 ng/L of caffeine (CAF), 158.9 ng/L of carbamazepine (CBZ), in outfall OA and 5.1 x 10(4) E. coli/100 mL, 167.0 mg TSS/L, 300.8 ng CAF/L, 4.1 ng CBZ/L, in outfall OB. Concentration dynamics in CSOs were mostly related to the dilution by stormwater and the time of day of the onset of overflows. Snowmelt was identified as a critical period with regards to the protection of drinking water sources given the high contaminant concentrations and long duration of events in addition to a lack of restrictions on overflows during this period. Correlations among measured parameters reflected the origins and transport pathways of the contaminants, with E. coli being correlated with CBZ. TSS were not correlated with E. coli because E. coli was found to be mostly associated with raw sewage whereas TSS were additionally from the resuspension of in-sewer deposits and surface runoff. In receiving waters, E. coli remained the best indicator of fecal contamination in strongly diluted water samples as compared to WWMPs because WWMPs can be diluted to below their detection limits.

AB The growing concern over the release of pharmaceutically active compounds and personal care products into the environment has prompted the introduction of risk assessment guidelines in both the European Union by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) and in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), details of which are presented herein. Both employ a similar tiered system that compares the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) with the worst-case no effect concentrations estimated from standard toxicity assays. These approaches are compared and contrasted. Results demonstrate room for improvement in areas such as the use of threshold values to trigger investigations, chronic and mechanism specific toxicity screening and mixture toxicity for which possible solutions are proposed.

AB The removal of biological or pharmaceutical compounds through the wastewater treatment becomes relevant. These compounds are present as traces in sewage. In this work, we propose a coupling process which combines the pre-concentration of the pollutant by selective extraction and then degradation of these pollutants by photocatalysis in presence of TiO2. This process is efficient at room temperature by activation of a photocatalyst (TiO2) under UV light. Aromatic amino acids were chosen as model of pharmaceutical pollutants. Their extraction from water, ensured by calixarene derivatives, and their photocatalytic degradation were investigated. It was shown that photodegradation follows a first-order kinetic and that the rate constant enhances with amino acid concentration. The effect of the pH on the rate constant will be discussed.

AB The occurrence of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds and personal care products was followed monthly for 12 months after various stages of treatment in an advanced wastewater reclamation plant in Gwinnett County, GA, U.S.A. Twenty-four hour composite samples were collected after primary clarification, activated sludge biological treatment, membrane filtration, granular media filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, and ozonation in the wastewater reclamation plant. Compounds were identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC MS) after solid-phase extraction. Standard addition methods were employed to compensate for matrix effects. Sixteen of the targeted compounds were detected in the primary effluent; sulfadimethoxine, doxycycline, and iopromide were not found. Caffeine and acetaminophen were found at the highest concentrations (similar to 10(5) ng/L), followed by ibuprofen (similar to 10(4) ng/L), sulfamethoxazole and DEET (similar to 10(3) ng/L). Most of the other compounds were found at concentrations on the order of hundreds of ng/L. After activated sludge treatment and membrane filtration, the concentrations of caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, DEET, tetracycline, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) had decreased by more than 90%. Erythromycin and carbamazepine, which were resistant to biological treatment, were eliminated by 74 and 88%, on average, by GAC. Primidone, DEET, and caffeine were not amenable to adsorption by GAG. Ozonation oxidized most of the remaining compounds by >60%, except for primidone and DEET. Of the initial 16 compounds identified in the primary effluent, only sulfamethoxazole, primidone, caffeine and DEET were frequently detected in the final effluent, but at concentrations on the order of 10-100 ng/L. Removal of the different agents by the various treatment processes was related to the physical chemical properties of the compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) receive industrial effluents from the plant that contain extremely high levels of antibiotics and are regarded as one of the major sources of antibiotics in the environment. Two PWWTPs have been selected in Zhejiang Province, China, to assess the removal mechanisms of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs). PWWTP A uses activated sludge with biocarriers in a moving bed biofilm reactor in anoxic and aerobic units, and PWWTP B uses biological units under anaerobic, aerobic, and anoxic conditions. The wastewater samples and solid samples (sludge and suspended solid matter) were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Ofloxacin (OFX) was detected in each stage of PWWTP A, and enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected in PWWTP B. The concentrations of FQs ranged from 0.32 mu g/L to 5.7 mg/L. Although the FQs were largely removed in the biological units (94.5 to 99.9%), large amounts were still discharged in the final effluent (up to 88.0 +/- 7.0 mu g/L) and dewatered sludge (up to 0.85 +/- 0.24 mg/kg). Mass balance analyses of samples from PWWTP A indicated that biodegradation (93.8%) was the major mechanism responsible for the removal of OFX, whereas the contribution of sorption by sludge (0.79%) was less significant, deviating from the findings of most similar studies. Using linear analysis and correlation analysis, we found that the log(10) values of the FQ concentration in the sludge were positively related with the log(10) values of the equilibrium concentration in water (C (w) ). These relationships can be described by a Freundlich-like equation. However, these relationships were negative when the C (w) values were high. Our preliminary explanation is that the equilibrium C (w) plays an important role in controlling the sorption behavior of FQs in activated sludge.

AB A comprehensive study of spatial and temporal consumption patterns of the selected illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, methamphetamine, cannabis) and therapeutic opioids (codeine, methadone) has been performed in six Croatian cities by applying wastewater-based epidemiology. The investigated cities (Bjelovar, Vinkovci, Varazdin, Karlovac, Zadar and Zagreb) varied widely in the population size (27,000688,000 inhabitants) as well as in the number of registered drug consumers included in compulsory and voluntary medical treatment and rehabilitation programs (30-513 persons/100,000 inhabitants of age 15-64). The most consumed illicit drugs were cannabis (10-70 doses/day/1000 inhabitants), heroin (<0.2-10 doses/day/1000 inhabitants) and cocaine (0.2-8.7 doses/day/1000 inhabitants), while the consumption of amphetamine-type drugs was much lower (<0.01-4.4 doses/day/1000 inhabitants). Enhanced consumption of illegal drugs was generally associated with larger urban centers (Zagreb and Zadar) however comparatively high consumption rate of cocaine, MDMA and methadone was determined in some smaller cities as well. The overall average dose number of 3 major illegal stimulants (cocaine, MDMA, amphetamine) was rather similar to the number of corresponding heroin doses, which is in disagreement with a comparatively much higher proportion of heroin users in the total number of registered drug users in Croatia. Furthermore, the illicit drug consumption pattern in the large continental city (Zagreb) was characterized by a significant enhancement of the consumption of all stimulants during the weekend, which could not be confirmed neither for the coastal city of Zadar nor for the remaining small continental cities. On the other hand, the city of Zadar exhibited a significant increase of stimulant drug usage during summer vacation period, as a result of pronounced seasonal changes of the population composition and lifestyle in coastal tourist centers. The obtained results represent a valuable complementary data source for the optimisation and implementation of strategies to combat drug abuse in Croatia. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Current knowledge shows that residues of human medicinal products at trace quantities are widespread in aquatic systems. The sewage treatment plants are pointed out as the major source discharge of these compounds on the environment. In this context, it has been worldwide recognised that the environmental impact of medicinal products have to be evaluated, according to recent EU legislation and regulatory guidance. The strategy of the global risk assessment includes primarily a pre-screening based on the estimation of exposure concentrations of drugs in the wastewater. The present paper addresses the decision-maker frontier of the ecologically relevant endpoints. Risk management recommendation and reasonable and prudent alternatives are discussed to minimise the possible environmental impact.

AB Indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the rise in drug resistance emphasizes the immediate need for managing pharmaceutical products sensibly. The pharmaceutical products end in wastewater due to the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical industries, misuse of antibiotics and improper disposal of expired drugs, which eventually ends in sewers. In the present study we attempted to degrade fluoroquinolones by the process of mycoremediation. Hospital waste water soil sample was collected and screened for fungi which can tolerate norfloxacin. One fungal isolate was able to withstand 2 g/L of norfloxacin which was chosen for degradation studies. Degradation pattern was checked with HPLC, FTIR and SEM analysis. Kinetics studies were carried out to analyze the degradation pattern. The result confirmed that Ganoderma lucidum JAPC1 strain was capable of degrading norfloxacin successfully but was unable to degrade ciprofloxacin.

AB Spreading of urban wastewater on agricultural land may lead to concomitant input of organic and inorganic pollutants. Such multiple pollution sites offer unique opportunities to study the fate of both heavy metals and pharmaceuticals. We examined the occurrence and fate of selected antibiotics in sandy-textured soils, sampled four years after cessation of 100 years irrigation with urban wastewater from the Paris agglomeration. Previous studies on heavy metal contamination of these soils guided our sampling strategy. Six antibiotics were studied, including quinolones, with a strong affinity for organic and mineral soil components, and sulfonamides, a group of more mobile molecules. Bulk samples were collected from surface horizons in different irrigation fields, but also in subsurface horizons in two selected profiles. In surface horizons, three quinolones (oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, and flumequine) were present in eight samples out of nine. Their contents varied spatially, but were well-correlated one to another. Their distributions showed great similarities regarding spatial distribution of total organic carbon and heavy metal contents, consistent with a common origin by wastewater irrigation. Highest concentrations were observed for sampling sites close to irrigation water outlets, reaching 22 mu g kg(-1) for nalidixic acid. Within soil profiles, the two antibiotic groups demonstrated an opposite behavior: quinolones, found only in surface horizons; sulfamethoxazole, detected in clay-rich subsurface horizons, concomitant with Zn accumulation. Such distribution patterns are consistent with chemical adsorption properties of the two antibiotic groups: immobilization of quinolones in the surface horizons ascribed to strong affinity for organic matter (OM), migration of sulfamethoxazole due to a lower affinity for OM and its interception and retention in electronegative charged clay-rich horizons. Our work suggests that antibiotics may represent a durable contamination of soils, and risks for groundwater contamination, depending on the physicochemical characteristics both of the organic molecules and of soil constituents.

AB Removal of 28 human and veterinary antibiotics was assessed in a conventional (activated sludge) and advanced (microfiltration/reverse osmosis) wastewater treatment plant (VJVvrTP) in Brisbane, Australia. The dominant antibiotics detected in wastewater influents were cephalexin (med. 4.6 gL(,)(-1) freq. 100%), ciprofloxacin (med. 3.8 mu gL(-1) freq. 100%), cefaclor (med. 0.5 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), sulphamethoxazole (med. 0.36 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) and trimethoprim (med. 0.34 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%). Results indicated that both treatment plants significantly reduced antibiotic concentrations with an average removal rate from the liquid phase of 92%. However, antibiotics were still detected in both effluents from the low-to-mid ngL(-1) range. Antibiotics detected in effluent from the activated sludge WWTP included ciprofloxacin (med. 0.6 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), sulphamethoxazole (med. 0.27 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) lincomycin (med. 0.05 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%) and trimethoprim (med. 0.05 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%). Antibiotics identified in microfiltration/reverse osmosis product water included naladixic acid (med. 0.045 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), enrofloxacin (med. 0.01 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), roxithromycin (med. 0.01 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), norfloxacin (med. 0.005 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), oleandomycin (med. 0.005 mu g L-1, freq. 100%), trimethoprim (med. 0.005 mu g L-1, freq. 100%), tylosin (med. 0.001 mu gL(-1), freq. 100%), and lincomycin (med. 0.001 mu gL(-1), freq. 66%). Certain traditional parameters, including nitrate concentration, conductivity and turbidity of the effluent were assessed as predictors of total antibiotic concentration, however only conductivity demonstrated any correlation with total antibiotic concentration (p = 0.018, r = 0.7). There is currently a lack of information concerning the effects of these chemicals to critically assess potential risks for environmental discharge and water recycling. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The common occurrence of human derived contaminants like pharmaceuticals, steroids and hormones in surface waters has raised the awareness of the role played by the release of treated or untreated sewage in the water quality along sensitive coastal ecosystems. South Florida is home of many important protected environments ranging from wetlands to coral reefs which are in close proximity to large metropolitan cities. Because, large portions of South Florida and most of the Florida Keys population are not served by modern sewage treatment plants and rely heavily on the use of septic systems, a comprehensive survey of selected human waste contamination markers was conducted in three areas to assess water quality with respect to non-traditional micro-constituents. This study documents the occurrence and distribution of fifteen hormones and steroids and five commonly detected pharmaceuticals in surface water samples collected from different near shore environments along South Florida between 2004 and 2006. The compounds most frequently detected were: cholesterol, caffeine, estrone, DEET, coprostanol, biphenol-A, beta-estradiol, and triclosan. The concentration detected for estrone and beta-estradiol were up to 5.2 and 1.8 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations of caffeine (5.5-68 ng/L) and DEET (4.8-49 ng/L) were generally higher and more prevalent than were the steroids. Distribution of microconstituents was site specific likely reflecting a diversity of sources. In addition to chemical analysis, the yeast estrogen screen assay was used to screen the samples for estrogen equivalency. Overall, the results show that water collected from inland canals and restricted circulation water bodies adjacent to heavily populated areas had high concentrations of multiple steroids, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products while open bay waters were largely devoid of the target analytes.

AB We examined the utility of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular markers of sewage contamination in riverine, groundwater, and coastal environments. The PPCPs were crotamiton, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, thymol, triclosan, propyphenazone, carbamazopine, diethyftoluamide, ethenzamide, and caffeine. Measurements in 37 Japanese rivers showed positive correlations of riverine flux of crotamiton (r(2) = 0.85), carbamazepine (r(2) = 0.84), ibuprofen (r(2) = 0.73), and mefenamic acid (r(2) = 0.67) with the population in the catchments. In three surveys in the Tamagawa estuary, crotamiton, carbamazepine, and mefenamic acid behaved conservatively across seasons within a salinity range of 0.4-29 parts per thousand, suggesting their utility as molecular markers in coastal environments. Removal of ketoprofen and naproxen in the estuary was ascribed to photodegradation. lbuprofen and thymol were removed from estuarine waters in summer by microbial degradation. Triclosan was removed by a combination of microbial degradation, photodegradation, and adsorption. These results were consistent with those of river water incubated for 8 d at 25 degrees C in the dark in order to examine the effects of biodegradation and photodegradation. Crotamiton was detected in groundwater from the Tokyo metropolitan area (12 out of 14 samples), suggesting wastewater leakage from decrepit sewers. Carbamazepine, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen (5/14), caffeine (4/14), and diethyltoluamide (3/14) were also detected in the groundwater, whereas the other carboxylic and phenolic PPCPs were not detected and were thought to be removed during their passage through soil. All the data demonstrated the utility of crotamiton and carbamazepine as conservative markers in freshwater and coastal environments. We recommend combining these conservative markers with labile PPCPs to detect inputs of poorly treated sewage.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) receives increasing attention because of its specific composition and higher concentrations of some micropollutants. Better knowledge of HWW is needed in order to improve management strategies and to ensure the preservation of wastewater treatment efficiency and freshwater ecosystems. This context pushed forward the development of a pilot study site named Site Pilote de Bellecombe (SIPIBEL), which collects and treats HWW separately from urban wastewater, applying the same conventional treatment process. This particular configuration offers the opportunity for various scientific investigations. It enables to compare hospital and urban wastewater, the efficiency of the two parallel treatment lines, and the composition of the resulting hospital and urban treated effluents, as well as the evaluation of their effects on the environment. The study site takes into account environmental, economic, and social issues and promotes scientific and technical multidisciplinary actions.

AB Removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) is a serious concern in wastewater industry especially for public acceptance of reclaimed water. Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the ubiquitous and detectable plasticizers in municipal wastewater across the globe. Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) has prioritized it for the establishment of discharge regulations. A cost-effective strategy, especially for developing nations, may be the re-engineering of the existing biological process for the simultaneous removal of ECs and conventional pollutants. Wastewater treatment plants are one of the main sources for DEHP occurrence in surface water. In this study, possible role of activated sludge process operational parameters in effective removal of DEHP was assessed. Principal component analysis of occurrence data showed dissimilarity with the organic and nutrient characteristics of sewage. DEHP concentration in more than half (55%) of treated wastewater samples was more than environmental quality standard value for inland and surface water bodies (1.3 mu g/L). At a mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) concentration range of 3461-4972 mg/l, overall removal was 23.9 mu g/gMLSS.d (92 +/- 6%) with biodegraded portion as 22.4 mu g/gMLSS.d (85 +/- 4%) and sorbed portion of 1.5 mu g/gMLSS.d (7 +/- 4%). DEHP removal showed an increasing trend at higher oxygen uptake rates (OUR) of sludge with DEHP removal of 8.1 mu g DEHP/gMLSS.d (70 +/- 6%), in the OUR range of 20-28mgO(2)/L/h. Increase in overall removal of DEHP showed a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.7) with increasing sludge retention time (SRT) and so does the decreasing food to microorganism (F/M) ratio with increasing removal of DEHP (r(2) = 0.8). A temperature decrease of 13 degrees C caused a decrease of 30% in overall removal of DEHP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review is based on 59 papers published between 2002 and 2015, referring to about 450 treatment trains providing data regarding sludge concentrations for 169 compounds, specifically 152 pharmaceuticals and 17 personal care products, grouped into 28 different classes. The rationale of the study is to provide data to evaluate the environmental risk posed by the spreading of treated sludge in agriculture. Following discussion of the legislative scenario governing the final disposal of treated sludge in European countries and the USA, the study provides a snapshot of the occurrence of selected compounds in primary, secondary, mixed, digested, conditioned, composted and dried sludge originating in municipal wastewater treatment plants fed mainly with urban wastewater as well as in sludge-amended soil. Not only are measured values reported, but also predicted concentrations based on K-d values are reported. It emerges that in secondary sludge, the highest concentrations were found for fragrances, antiseptics and antibiotics and an attenuation in their concentrations occurs during treatment, in particular anaerobic digestion and composting. An in-depth literature survey of the (measured and predicted) K-d values for the different compounds and treated sludge are reported and an analysis of the influence of pH, redox conditions, sludge type was carried out The data regarding measured and predicted concentrations of selected compounds in sludge-amended soil is then analyzed. Finally an environmental risk assessment posed by their occurrence in soil in the case of land application of sludge is examined, and the results obtained by different authors are compared. The most critical compounds found in the sludge-amended soil are estradiol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, caffeine, triclosan and triclocarban. The study concludes with a focus on the main issues that should be further investigated in order to refine the environmental risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered the main sources of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic environments, and can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. In this study, WWTP influent, effluent, and sludge, and upstream and downstream waters from the WWTP recipient were investigated at 15 locations for a total of 164 CECs, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and pesticides. In addition, zebrafish (Dania rerio) embryo toxicity tests (ZFET) were applied to WWTP influent and effluent, and upstream and downstream waters from WWTP recipients. A total of 119 CECs were detected in at least one sample, mean concentrations ranging from 0.11 ng/L (propylparaben) to 64,000 ng/L (caffeine), in wastewater samples and from 0.44 ng/L (ciprofloxacin) to 19,000 ng/L (metformin) in surface water samples. Large variations of CEC concentrations were found between the selected WWTPs, which can be explained by differences in CEC composition in influent water and WWTP treatment process. The sludge-water partitioning coefficient (K-d) of CECs showed a significant linear con-elation to octanol/warer partition coefficient (K-ow) (p < 0.001), and thus could be used for predicting their fare in the aqueous and solid phase. The Sigma CEC concentrations in WWTPs declined by on average 60%, based on comparisons of WWTP influent and effluent concentrations. The high concentrations of CECs in WWTP effluent resulted in, on average, 50% higher concentrations of CECs in water downstream of WWTPs compared with upstream. Some WWTP samples showed toxicity in ZFET compared with the respective control group, but no individual CECs or groups of CECs could explain this toxicity. These results could provide a theoretical basis for optimization of existing treatment systems of different designs, and could significantly contribute to protecting recipient waters.

AB The present study aimed to assess removal potential of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total phosphorus (TP) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in synthetic wastewater simulating low-strength sewage by sequencing-batch mode constructed wetlands (CVVs). Six CWs with three substrates (gravel, light expanded clay and clay bricks) and one CW of each substrate was planted with E. crassipes to verify the feasibility of using a floating macrophyte in CWs and verify the best optimized substrate. Results showed that the presence of E. crassipes enhanced the removal of COD for systems with gravel, increasing the removal efficiency from 37% in the unplanted system (CW G u) to 60% in the planted system (CWGP). The vegetated CW with clay bricks (CW B p) presented the best performance for both TKN and TAN removal, with maximum removal efficiencies of 68% and 35%, respectively. Phosphorus was observed to be efficiently removed in systems with clay bricks, both planted (CWBU) and unplanted (CWBP), with mean removal efficiencies of 82% and 87%, respectively, probably via adsorption. It was also observed that after 296 days of operation, no desorption or increase on phosphorus in effluent samples were observed, thus indicating that the material was not yet saturated and phosphorus probably presents a strong binding to the media. ASA removal efficiency varied from 34% to 92% in CWs, probably due to plant uptake through roots and microbial biodegradation. Plant direct uptake varied from 4 to 74% of the total nitrogen and from 26 to 71% of the total phosphorus removed in CVVG_B, CWC-P and CVVB-P. E. crassipes was able to uptake up to 4.19 g of phosphorus in CWC-P and 11.84 g of nitrogen in CWB-P The findings on this study suggest that E. crassipes could be used in CWs and clay bricks could significantly enhance phosphorus removal capacity in CWs.

AB This study investigated the characteristics of 10 subtypes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for sulfonamide, tetracycline, beta-lactam and macrolide resistance and the class 1 integrase gene (intI1). In total, these genes were monitored in 24 samples across each stage of five full-scale pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) using qualitative and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from(2.08 +/- 0.16) x 10(3) to (3.68 +/- 0.27) x 10(6) copies/mL. The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for only 0.6%-59.8% of influents of the five PWWTPs, while the majority of the ARGs were transported to the dewatered sludge with concentrations from (9.38 +/- 0.73) x 10(7) to (4.30 +/- 0.81) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). The total loads of ARGs discharged through dewatered sludge was 7-308 folds higher than that in the rawinfluents and 16-638 folds higher than that in the final effluents. The proliferation of ARGs mainly occurs in the biological treatment processes, such as conventional activated sludge, cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) and membrane bio-reactor (MBR), implying that significant replication of certain subtypes of ARGs may be attributable to microbial growth. High concentrations of antibiotic residues (ranging from 0.14 to 92.2 mg/L) were detected in the influents of selected wastewater treatment systems and they still remain high residues in the effluents. Partial correlation analysis showed significant correlations between the antibiotic concentrations and the associated relative abundance of ARG subtypes in the effluent. Although correlation does not prove causation, this study demonstrates that in addition to bacterial growth, the high antibiotic residues within the pharmaceutical WWTPs may influence the proliferation and fate of the associated ARG subtypes.

AB Incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment can result in their discharge into the aquatic environment. The discharge of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents into rivers, lakes and the oceans has led to detectable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment in many countries. However, to date studies of WWTP discharges into the aquatic environment have largely been confined to areas of relatively high population density, industrial activity or systems impacted on by such areas. In this work, two sites in the far north of Scotland were used to assess whether, and which, pharmaceuticals were being introduced into natural waters in a rural environment with low population density. Samples from two WWTPs (with differing modes of operation), and one receiving water, the River Thurso, were analysed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, clofibric acid, erythromycin, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, tamoxifen, trimethoprim and dextropropoxyphene). Ten of the 12 pharmaceuticals investigated were detected in at least one of the 40 WWTP effluent samples. Maximum concentrations ranged from 7 ng L-1 (sulfamethoxazole) to 22.8 mu g L-1 (paracetamol) with diclofenac and mefenamic acid being present in all of samples analysed at concentrations between 24.2 and 927 ng L-1 and 11.5 and 22.8 mu g L-1, respectively. Additionally, the presence of four pharmaceuticals at ng L-1 levels in the River Thurso, into which one of the WWTPs discharges, shows that such discharges result in measurable levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment. This provides direct evidence that, even in rural areas with low population densities, effluents from WWTPs can produce quantifiable levels of human pharmaceutical in the natural aquatic environment. These observations indicate that human pharmaceuticals may be considered as contaminants, with potential to influence water quality, management and conservation not only in urban and industrial regions but also those more rural in nature.

AB Three horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands and three sand filters (without plants) were set up at the campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Eight pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, ketoprofen, salicylic acid, and clofibric acid were enriched in the wetland inflow. Three factors, namely, with/without the presence of vegetation, operational modes (batch and continuous), and hydraulic residence time were investigated by a polynomial regression model with analysis of variance, including factorial design, to find the relationships between contaminant removal and the affecting factors, as well as to determine the dominant variables and how each of them interact for each parameter. The objective of this study was to compare the removal efficiencies of selected pharmaceuticals under different wetland retention times, planted versus unplanted modes, and feeding strategies.

AB The adsorption of amoxicillin (AMX), ampicillin (AMP), and chloramphenicol (CHLR) from simulated antibiotic-contaminated water using adsorbents prepared from grape slurry waste is studied. Batch adsorption experiments are carried out to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents for AMX, AMP, and CHLR. Adsorption isotherms are described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, while the pseudo-second order kinetics describe the sorption processes. Negative values of the enthalpy change show that the sorption processes are exothermic, and the positive values of the Gibbs free energy change indicates non-spontaneous but feasible nature of the adsorption. The study shows that grape slurry waste could be a good precursor to prepare effective adsorbents for the remediation of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater.

AB Activation of H2O2 (HP) and S2O82- (PS) with zero valent aluminum (ZVA, 1 g/L) nanoparticles was investigated for the treatment of the X-ray contrast medium and micropollutant iopamidol (IOPA; C17H22I3N3O8; approximate to 777 g/mol) at pH 3. IOPA (2.6 mu M) degradation was followed in different water matrices (distilled water, tap water, raw surface water and tertiary treated sewage effluent). Both oxidants could be activated with ZVA resulting in a dramatic enhancement of IOPA degradation due to accelerated hydroxyl and sulfate radical formation. The ZVA/PS (0.5 mM) treatment was more effective than ZVA/HP (0.25 mM) oxidation resulting in 95% IOPA removal after 120 min. IOPA and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) abatements were inhibited when IOPA was treated in real water and wastewater. After 120 min treatment, IOPA removals decreased from 95% (PS/ZVA) and 41% (HP/ZVA) in distilled water to 29% (PS/ZVA) and 13% (HP/ZVA) in surface water, respectively. IOPA could not be removed with the PS/ZVA process in treated sewage, although DOC removal was still substantial (28%). For the HP/ZVA combination, 24% DOC accompanied with 20% IOPA removal was achieved after 120 min in the same wastewater sample. Changes in acute toxicity were followed during PS/ZVA treatment of IOPA in distilled and surface water. These results exhibited a fluctuating trend depending on the sensitivity of the test organism (Vibrio fischeri and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and water matrix. A genotoxic activity analysis was also conducted and the UmuChromo assay indicated that the original and treated IOPA solutions were not genotoxic but cytotoxic. The potentials and differences of PS/ZVA and HP/ZVA treatment of an iodinated contrast medium could be demonstrated in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The contamination by pharmaceuticals products (PPs) in the marine environment is particularly relevant where wastewater treatment of urban areas on land is lacking. However, the number of studies focused on description of sources and fate of PP molecules in the marine environment remains still limited. In this study, the occurrence of 46 PPs was investigated in the marine and coastal-marine system (waters and sediments) of Augusta Bay (central Mediterranean Sea). This area is highly affected by industrial pollution and urban discharges (without wastewater treatment) and thus represents a 'natural laboratory' for exploring dynamics of multi-mixture contaminants in the marine environment. The study area is also part of the sub-region 'Central Mediterranean Sea' of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and therefore offers an important reference site for exploring the distribution modes of PPs in the central Mediterranean Sea.
   In this work, samples of seawater, sediment, untreated wastewater, and marine receiving water were analysed using mass spectrometry with a target analysis for PPs and a suspect screening analysis for the presence of other contaminants. PPs concentration ranges were: 2426-67,155 ng/L for untreated wastewaters, 550-27,889 ng/L for marine receiving waters and 12-281 ng/L for seawaters. The highest concentrations were measured for the antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular and antihypertensive therapeutic classes. Likewise, sediments collected from untreated wastewater sewers resulted more contaminated. Ionic, non-ionic surfactants and personal care products were the most abundant compounds found in waters and sediments by suspect screening analysis. The risk associated with PPs contamination for aquatic organisms was relatively high in samples of marine receiving waters of the bay (with a risk quotient value up to 33,599). The levels of PPs in seawater and sediment compartments were generally not hazardous (RQ < 0.01), except for estrone with a calculated RQ = 2775. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All lights reserved.

AB Concentrations of six endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), were assessed in influents, effluents and excess sludge in ten municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area, Chongqing, China. Three types of activated sludge treatment processes, oxidation ditch (OD), reversed anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (rA(2)/O) technology and sequential batch reactor (SBR), were used in the surveyed WWTPs. These WWTPs were all combined landfill leachate-sewage treatment plants. All analytes were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) in the dissolved phase and by accelerated solvent-based extraction (ASE) in sludge. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed for the analysis of EDCs. Among these EDCs, BPA was the most frequently detected and abundant compound (100.0-10566.7 ng L-1, 15.5-1210.7 ng L-1 and 85.0-2470.4 ng g(-1) with respect to the influents, effluents and excess sludge samples). The greatest levels of steroidal estrogens in municipal influents were observed in E-3 which were all >100 ng L-1, followed by E-1 (42.2-110.7 ng L-1) and E-2 (7.4-32.7 ng L-1), and in the effluents and sludge were E-1 > E-3 > E-2 which were all <31 ng L-1 and 105 ng g(-1), respectively. Regarding synthetic estrogens, EE2 was frequently detected in the influents, occurring below 50 ng L-1, while DES was not detected at all. A high correlation coefficient was observed between the leachate-sludge ratio and concentrations of influent EDCs, and it was statistically significant (i.e., R > 0.65, P < 0.05), but removal efficiency of the EDCs did not show significant differences with OD, rA(2)/O and SBR processes. Furthermore, modification of treatment technology as well as operational parameters, such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), sludge retention time (SRT) and disinfection process (DP), were recommended to further eliminate the residual EDCs.

AB Goals, Scope and Background. From 2005, deposition of organic waste will be banned in Sweden. Likewise, in Germany and Austria, similar bans are being planned, and further countries will probably follow. Thus, there is a need to develop new methods and to refine established techniques for sludge management in the whole of the European Union. For this end, there is also an urgent need for appropriate ecotoxicological approaches to elucidate and assess the hazard potential of sewage sludge. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the capacity of various established sludge treatment methods using different oxygen regimes to degrade recalcitrant nitro-substituted organic compounds and reduce their toxicity. Sewage sludge samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Sweden (Cambrex Karlskoga AB, industrial area Bjorkborn) receiving wastewater from industries manufacturing pharmaceutical substances, chemical intermediates and explosives were processed with different sludge treatment methods. Among other treatment methods, bioreactors (for anaerobic and aerobic sludge treatment) were used. In the present investigation, a battery of in vitro bioassays was employed to compare the cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials of different fractions of sludge samples in order to elucidate whether the treatments were suitable to reduce the toxicity of the sludge.
   Methods. In order to investigate the cytotoxicity of the extracts of treated and untreated sludge samples, the acute cytotoxicity test with the permanent cell line RTL-W1 was used. Genotoxicity was tested by means of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) with RTL-W1 cells, and mutagenicity was assessed with the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA98NR and TA100. Sludge toxicity was tested in different fractions of organic extracts produced by acetone and hexane extractions. The subsequent clean-up procedure (silica gel chromatography and elution with hexane and dichloromethane) resulted in two fractions, a lipophilic hexane-fraction and a semi-lipophilic dichloromethane-fraction. For the genotoxicity and mutagenicity tests, these fractions were reunited at equal ratios. Results and Discussion. The acute cytotoxicity test with RTL-W1 cells revealed a high cytotoxic potential for the semi-lipophilic DM-fractions of all sludge samples with NR50 values (= effective concentration for 50% cell death in the neutral red test) from 8.9 up to 20 mg sludge d.w./ml medium. A low cytotoxic potential for the hexane fractions of the untreated sludge samples (NR50 400 to > 400 mg sludge d.w./ml medium) was observed, whereas the hexane fractions of the treated sludge samples showed elevated cytotoxicity increasing further with treatment in the bioreactors. The comet assay indicated that three out of eight of the reunited fractions had a significant genotoxic potential. Whereas the genotoxic potential of one sample treated anaerobically was very high with an induction factor of 11.6, a similar sample (taken from the same anaerobic reactor four months later) and one untreated sample showed lower potentials. The samples treated in another anaerobic bioreactor as well as the samples treated aerobically showed no genotoxic potential. Results indicate that aerobic treatment was basically adequate for reducing the genotoxicity of the sludge, whereas anaerobic treatment was only partly useful for reduction of genotoxicity. The Ames test revealed a very high mutagenic potential for the reunited fractions of the untreated sludge samples with strain TA98 (maximum induction factors (IFmax) up to 45) and a relatively high potential for one of the samples treated aerobically (S2, IFmax = 18 (TA98, S9-)), thus documenting the suitability of both anaerobic and aerobic treatments to reduce the mutagenicity of the samples, however, with the aerobic treatment being less effective.
   Conclusions. Overall, none of the microbiological treatments for wastewater sludge in bioreactors was found to be ideal for general toxicity reduction of the sludge samples. Whereas cytotoxicity of the sludge increased or levelled off in most cases following either treatment, genotoxicity both increased or decreased after anaerobic treatment, depending on the specific sample. However, mutagenicity could generally be reduced by anaerobic treatment and, to a lesser degree, by aerobic treatment.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The complex modification of the diverse damage potentials of sludge sample extracts by use of an in vitro biotest battery following treatment for toxicity reduction in bioreactors showed that considerations of different toxicological endpoints is essential for an adequate hazard assessment. Whereas in the case of cytotoxicity reduction, the reactors proved ineffective, mutagenicity could be reduced significantly at least in some cases in this case study.

AB Recent studies have shown the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in surface water and sewage samples. A study on rapid removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)-bisphenol AF (BPAF) on multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is significant for understanding how wastewater containing trace recalcitrant or hazardous BPAF was treated. Besides, the sorption behavior and mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, it was found the adsorption kinetics equilibrium followed the pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption isotherms fitted better with Langmuir equation, and the adsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process. The adsorption process was controlled simultaneously by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion, but the external mass transfer processes played an important role in sorption of BPAF. Hydrogen bonds was the main driving force for the adsorption, and pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions were probably extra important mechanisms to the adsorption of BPAF. The MWCNT have higher stability within eight removal-regeneration recycles and up to 95% of recovery could be obtained using ethanol elution. The results of the experiment verified effectiveness for the recovery and removal of BPAF from wastewater samples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of various organic micropollutants (OMPs), including six antibiotics (ERY, ROX, CLA, SMX, SMZ, and TMP), three pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, salicylic acid, and diclofenac), one industrial product (BPA), and one hormone (cholesterol), was investigated in two pilot plants treating the same raw sewage of the Tel-Aviv WWTP. The effluent production by CAS-UF was 45 m(3)/h while that of MBR was 40 L/h. Each system's effluent constituted the feed for its RO, which comprised three RO steps after the CAS/UF and a semi-batch RO system after the MBR. Despite significant molecular differences between the selected OMPs, high removal rates were achieved after the RO stage (>99% for macrolides, pharmaceuticals, cholesterol, and BPA, 95% for diclofenac, and >93% removal of sulfonamides). However, low antibiotics concentrations and 28-223 ng/L residuals of ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, cholesterol, and BPA in the MBR/RO and CAS-UF/RO permeates showed that although RO is an efficient removal solution, it cannot serve as an absolute barrier to OMPs. Therefore, additional treatment techniques should be considered to be incorporated aside the RO to ensure complete removal of such substances. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During 2003/2004, water samples were collected upstream and downstream of two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outlets in order to determine the contribution of urban centres to concentration of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, lipid regulators and carbamazepine) and pesticides into a Mediterranean river basin (Arc river, Aix en Provence, France). Pharmaceutical loads were compared to pesticide ones. They could be nearly regarded as important as pesticide ones at least at one sampling site. The observed pollution patterns differed from pesticides to pharmaceuticals. Pesticide pollution occurred through a high pollution peak in spring while pharmaceuticals were continuously infused into the river via WWTP effluents. Carbamazepine and bezafibrate were detected in almost all samples at concentration levels ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. The major pharmaceutical source could be ascribed to WWTP effluents and pharmaceutical concentrations increased during low flow rate conditions (summer), when municipal wastewater effluents accounted for the majority of the river water flow. Treated wastewaters contributed to a lesser extent to pesticide river water pollution. In an urbanized Mediterranean river basin, a deep understanding of water pollution by organic waste contaminants is required in order to set up an efficient programme of pollution reduction measures.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWIN) and application of biosolids to arable land expose the agro-environment to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) which can be taken up by crops. In this project, we studied the effect of a carrier medium (e.g., biosolids and TWW) on plant (tomato, wheat and lettuce) uptake, translocation and metabolism of carbamazepine as a model for non-ionic PPCPs. Plant uptake and bioconcentration factors were significantly lower in soils amended with biosolids compared to soils irrigated with TWW. In soils amended with biosolids and irrigated with TWW, the bioavailability of carbamazepine for plant uptake was moderately decreased as compared to plants grown in soils irrigated with TWW alone. While TWW acts as a continuous source of PPCPs, biosolids act both as a source and a sink for these compounds. Moreover, it appears that decomposition of the biosolids in the soil after amendment enhances their adsorptive properties, which in turn reduces the bioavailability of PPCPs in the soil environment In-plant metabolism of carbamazepine was found to be independent of environmental factors, such as soil type, carrier medium, and absolute amount implemented to the soil, but was controlled by the total amount taken up by the plant.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is a typical persistent refractory organic industrial wastewater. In this work, a simple, one-step method for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was developed using wet oxidation (WO) in a subcritical water apparatus, with detailed studies on the effects of operating parameters, including the temperature of the system, the ratio of reactants, and pH of the wastewater. Under optimized experimental conditions, efficient treatment of actual pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved, with removal of 100% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 98% nitrate ion, 98% nitrite ion, and 68% ammonium ion. Our results suggest that the WO process, using a subcritical water apparatus, is a promising method of treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Improved endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) removal is desirable in municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) although increased removal does not always translate into reduced biological activity. Suitable methods for determining reduction in biological activity of effluents are needed. In order to determine which MWWTPs are the most effective at removing EDC activities, we operated three configurations of pilot sized biological reactors (conventional activated sludge, CAS; nitrifying activated sludge, NAS; and biological nutrient removal, BNR) receiving the same influent under simulated winter and summer conditions. As frogs are model organisms for the study of thyroid hormone (TH) action, we used the North American species Rana catesbeiana in a cultured tadpole tailfin (C-fin) assay to compare the effluents. TH-responsive (thyroid hormone receptors alpha (thra) and beta (thrb)) and stress-responsive (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and heat shock protein 30) mRNA transcript levels were examined. Effluents infrequently perturbed stress-responsive transcript abundance but thra/thrb levels were significantly altered. In winter conditions, CAS caused frequent TH perturbations while BNR caused none. In summer conditions, however, BNR caused substantial TH perturbations while CAS caused few. Our findings contrast other studies of seasonal variations of EDC removal and accentuate the importance of utilizing appropriate biological readouts for assessing EDC activities.

AB Some emerging pollutants in wastewater sources, urban and hospital, of Mexico City was determined. Solid phase extraction of the selected pollutants from the different matrices and an high performance liquid chromatography analysis technique for their quantification were implemented. Results showed that hospital wastewater contained higher organic matter concentration than urban wastewater. Analgesics and antibiotics were found in all samples. High concentrations of paracetamol, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole and -estradiol were found in hospital wastewater, ranging from 9 to 27 mu gL(-1), showing that, in general, pharmaceutical concentrations in hospital wastewater were higher than those found in urban and in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant, where concentration ranged from 0.18 to 4.79 mu gL(-1). In the effluent of wastewater treatment only the antibiotics were found, sulfamethoxazole, trimethroprim and ofloxacin at 0.63; 0.55 and 0.29 mu gL(-1). It is the first work reporting the presence of pharmaceutical compounds from a hospital and wastewater urban from Mexico City.

AB Simple Treat 3.1 predicts the distribution and elimination of chemicals by sewage treatment. The model is used as the default calculation in EUSES 2.0 to estimate exposure concentration in the receiving water, soil and air. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank input parameters according to their influence on model predictions. Triclosan was selected for the base case. The sewage flow, degradation rates and parameters describing the raw sewage were shown to be the most sensitive inputs. The pH and dissociation constant are very sensitive parameters when working with ionisable compounds. Variation in certain input parameters was propagated through the model to yield greater variation in output parameters with a maximum ratio of 4.0. Simple Treat 3.1 is a steady state model describing a highly non-steady system. A large variability in the most sensitive parameters is expected within a single sewage plant and parameters should therefore be selected to cover this variability.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an established approach for quantifying community drug use and has recently been applied to estimate population exposure to contaminants such as pesticides and phthalate plasticizers. A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating the number of people present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31%. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55% in static normalized data. Mobile device-based population activity patterns allow for dynamic normalization that yields much improved temporal and spatial trend analysis.

AB This study addresses the occurrence of carbamazepine and diazepam and their metabolites in the wastewater of the University Hospital (HUSM) of the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS-Brazil. Samples were collected from three sampling points of the sewage treatment system: point A ('emergency effluent'), point B ('general effluent') and point C ('water course-receptor'). Eight metabolites were identified: carbamazepine-10-11-epoxide, 10-dihydro-carbamazepine, 2-OH-carbamazepine, iminoquinone, acridone, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. The mean concentrations in the emergency, general effluent and water course-receptor were as follows: 433.0 +/- 4.7, 349.0 +/- 5.0 and 485.0 +/- 5.6 ng L-1, for carbamazepine and 550.0 +/- 4.3, 441.0 +/- 7.9 and 586.6 +/- 9.3 ng L-1, for diazepam, respectively. Liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS) proved to be a method fit-to-purpose. The determination of carbamazepine and diazepam, and the identification of active metabolites showing environmental persistence (carbamazepine-10-11-epoxide, nordiazepam and oxazepam) revealed the need for a more effective treatment of the HUSM effluent. As far as we know, no similar study has been carried out on the wastewater of Brazilian hospitals.

AB Electron beam irradiation (EBI) has been considered an advanced technology for the treatment of water and wastewater, whereas very few previous investigations reported its use for removing pharmaceutical pollutants. In this study, the degradation of fluoxetine (FLX), an antidepressant marketed as Prozac (R), was investigated by using EBI at FLX initial concentration of 19.4 +/- 0.2 mg L-1. More than 90 % FLX degradation was achieved at 0.5 kGy, with FLX below the detection limit (0.012 mg L-1) at doses higher than 2.5 kGy. The elucidation of organic byproducts performed using direct injection mass spectrometry, along with the results of ion chromatography, indicated hydroxylation of FLX molecules with release of fluoride and nitrate anions. Nevertheless, about 80 % of the total organic carbon concentration remained even for 7.5 kGy or higher doses. The decreases in acute toxicity achieved 86.8 and 9.6 % for Daphnia similis and Vibrio fischeri after EBI exposure at 5 kGy, respectively. These results suggest that EBI could be an alternative to eliminate FLX and to decrease residual toxicity from wastewater generated in pharmaceutical formulation facilities, although further investigation is needed for correlating the FLX degradation mechanism with the toxicity results.

AB With growing water scarcity worldwide, reclaimed wastewater is an increasingly attractive option for meeting household water demand, especially in urban areas. However, reluctance by households to use treated wastewater persists. In this article, we discuss the 'yuck factor,' health risk concerns, and cost considerations, which are key obstacles to wastewater reuse by households. We then summarize successful and unsuccessful case studies of wastewater reuse around the world. Reasons for the success (or failure) of each case study draws upon unique contextual, historical, and cultural circumstances. Direct potable reuse-where purified wastewater is added to the potable water supply directly-is rare; most successful projects are nonpotable wastewater reuse schemes-where purified water is placed into an environmental buffer before entering a drinking water distribution system. Our review of experiences around the world suggests approaches for improving public acceptability of wastewater reuse schemes. The literature also suggests that there is an urgent need to collect more wastewater treatment and reuse data, to research ways of better assessing and reducing health risk associated with emerging pollutants in reclaimed wastewater, and to better price both drinking water and recycled wastewater.

AB beta-Lactam antibiotics including penicillin G, nafcillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, and oxacilline in water were rapidly removed and degraded by using didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB)montmorillonite (MT) organoclay. Removal of antibiotics increased with increasing the amount of organoclay added and the amount of DDAB sorbed on MT. Extents of organoclay sorption of antibiotics were represented by the binding constants to DDAB molecules and correlated to the aqueous-octanol distribution coefficients. The degradation rate of P-lactam antibiotics was found to significantly increase by the organoclay sorption. Even under the mild conditions (25 degrees C and pH 7), penicillin G (m/z = 335) nearly completely (>98%) degraded into penicilloic acid (m/z = 353) missing P-lactam ring within 2 h. The first-order reaction rate of the primary degradation increased with increasing in temperature. The activation energy estimated from the Arrhenius plot was 49 kJ mol(-1) and lower than the value (83.5 kJ mol(-1)) in water, strongly suggesting catalytic activity of DDAB-MT organoclay. The applicability to wastewater treatment was demonstrated by using secondary effluents of municipal sewage treatment plants and synthesized hospital wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The reuse of sewage water treatment is becothing a priority, especially in arid regions, where water is scarce. However, there is increasing concern about the presence of emerging micropollutants refractory to the conventional treatments in wastewater treatment plants. Solar TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a valuable alternative for the simultaneous oxidation of chemical and inactivation of microorganisms. However, the variability of solar irradiance hinders the study of the process under controlled ultraviolet (UV) irradiance. This work reports the development of an innovative solar simulator and its validation against the use of natural sunlight in photocatalytic disinfection applications with simultaneous removal of emerging contaminants. The significant impact of osmotic and mechanical stress on the viability of E. coli bacteria was confirmed. UV irradiance and total-to-illuminated volume ratio showed no impact on the dependence of the bacteria inactivation kinetics on the energy accumulated in the system, indicating that the possible existence of dark repair mechanisms can be neglected within the studied irradiance range (20-60 W m(-2).). Average results show that after an accumulated energy of 3 kJ L-1, 5 logarithmic units (5-logs) of E. coli bacteria are inactivated, whereas a removal efficiency of >80% is achieved for the micropollutants.

AB Advanced treatment technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals and other organic micropollutants in WWTPs primarily target the removal of parent compounds. Nevertheless, the removal ofmetabolites originating from human- or microbial metabolism during biological treatment needs comparable consideration, as some of them might be present in high concentrations and contribute to toxicity.
   This study was conducted to elucidate the removal of human and microbial metabolites of pharmaceuticals as a function of the specific ozone dose. Ozonation was performed on four sites with two pilot- and two full-scale plants operated downstream of conventional activated sludge plants. The ozone reactivity of all metabolites (expressed as the ozone dose to remove 90% of the compound/decadic ozone dose) was lower than those of their parent compounds. The decadic ozone dose was 1.0, 1.3 and 1.1 mg O-3/mg DOC for Epoxy-carbamazepine, Di-OH-carbamazepine and N-Desmethyl tramadol, respectively. 20-40% of the remainingmetabolites were removed in a polishing sand/BAC-filter (biological activated carbon).
   Similar removal was observed for Epoxy-carbamazepine, Di-OH-carbamazepine and Hydroxy-diclofenac in a constructed wetland. However, the sand/anthracite filter had no effect. All four metabolites were removed in a GAC (granulated activated carbon) filter. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porphyrins are known as effective photosensitizers and can be an interesting key in phototreatment of water contaminated with micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals. They already showed to be efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of dyes, chlorophenols and other pollutants. This work demonstrates the applicability of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TF5PP) as photosensitizer for treatment of water contaminated with metoprolol, a highly prescribed beta-blocker, which is not completely removed in sewage treatment plants. Studies were firstly developed under homogeneous conditions with simulated solar radiation and porphyrin was found to be efficient in the photodegradation of metoprolol, following a pseudo-first order kinetics with ca. 90% metoprolol degradation after 12 h. Experiments in presence of scavengers confirmed the mechanism of degradation via singlet oxygen. Appearance of several new peaks in HPLC chromatograms indicates the formation of products, identified by HPLC-MSn. Furthermore, the porphyrin was immobilized on a silica support and used as heterogeneous photocatalyst in degradation of metoprolol. Experiments using this heterogeneous photocatalyst under real solar irradiation were also performed, and similar results were obtained. Kinetic comparison of metoprolol photodegradation in buffer solution and in real wastewater treatment plant effluent showed that the efficiency of the immobilized porphyrin was not decreased by the complex matrix of the effluent.

AB Micropollutants escaping conventional wastewater treatment processes pose a threat to biota and the environment. Amongst micropollutants, small and ionizable organic compounds are particularly challenging, since their removal depends significantly on prevailing conditions. In this study, anionic cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) were shown to perform as promising adsorbents for an ionizable pharmaceutical, salbutamol. The adsorbents were produced from wood cellulose through succinylation pretreatment in urea-LiCl deep eutectic solvent (DES), followed by a nanofibrillation procedure. The impact of pH, contact time, salbutamol concentration, and adsorbent dose on salbutamol uptake were investigated in batch adsorption studies. Based on the results, the chemical modification of cellulose significantly enhanced the adsorption of salbutamol. The adsorption efficiency was mainly dependent on the charge and colloidal stability of the anionic nanofibril suspension rather than the charge of salbutamol, because the adsorption was considerably improved at pH > 7 due to the de-protonation of the cellulose carboxyl groups. The experimental maximum adsorption capacity was 196 mg/g. This study highlights the potential of cellulose nanomaterial adsorbents and the importance of controlling the charge of the adsorbent material when developing solutions for ionizable micropollutant removal.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and their recipient watersheds. To assess the potential of WWTP effluents to alter fish behaviour, we caged male goldfish (Carassius auratus) for 21-days at three sites along a contamination gradient downstream from a WWTP which discharges into Cootes Paradise Marsh, on the western tip of Lake Ontario. We also included a fourth caging site as an external reference site within Lake Ontario at the Jordan Harbour Conservation Area. We then measured concentrations of PPCPs and monoamine neurotransmitters in caged goldfish plasma, and conducted behavioural assays measuring activity, startle response, and feeding. We detected fifteen different PPCPs in goldfish plasma including six serotonin reuptake inhibitors (amitriptyline, citalopram, fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and diphenhydramine). Plasma concentrations of serotonin were significantly greater in plasma of fish caged closer to the WWTP effluent outfall site. The fish caged near and downstream of the WWTP effluent were bolder, more exploratory, and more active overall than fish caged at the reference site. Taken together, our results suggest that fish downstream of WWTPs are accumulating PPCPs at levels sufficient to alter neurotransmitter concentrations and to also impair ecologically-relevant behaviours.

AB The bacterial community shift on a lab scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater and exposed to 50 mu g L-1 of sulfamethoxazole (SFX) for 2 months was investigated in this study. The impact on biological nutrient removal performance and SEX removal efficiencies were also studied. Satisfactory biological nutrient removal was observed as regards to COD and Nitrogen. SFX removal efficiencies ranged between 20% and 50% throughout the experimental period, enhanced within the aerobic phases of the SBR cycle, with no evident signs of biomass acclimation. Nevertheless, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed significant variance leading to not only the fading, but also the emergence of new species in the bioreactor bacterial community after SFX dosage. According to the phylogenetic analysis, bacteria belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes were the dominant species, among them, the Thiotrix spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) cell number increased due to its tolerance to the antibiotic. On the other hand, the classes Sphingobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Chlorobi were found to be more vulnerable to the antibiotic load and disappeared. The sulphonamide resistance gene sull was also quantified and discussed, as there are very few studies on bacterial resistance in lab-scale treatment reactors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chemical-biological degradation of a widely spread antibacterial (nalidixic acid) was successfully obtained by an integrated membrane bioreactor (MBR)-ozonation process. The composition of the treated solution simulated the wastewater from the production of the target pharmaceutical, featuring high salinity and a relevant concentration of sodium acetate. Aim of treatment integration was to exploit the synergistic effects of chemical oxidation and bioprocesses, by adopting the latter to remove most of the COD and the ozonation biodegradable products. Integration was achieved by placing ozonation in the recirculation stream of the bioreactor effluent. The recirculation flow rate was three-fold the MBR feed. and the performance of the integrated system was compared to the standard polishing configuration (single ozonation step after the MBR). Results showed that the introduction of the ozonation step did not cause relevant drawbacks to both biological and filtration processes. nalidixic acid passed undegraded through the MBR and was completely removed in the ozonation step. Complete degradation of most of the detected ozonation products was better achieved with the integrated MBR-ozonation process than using the sequential treatment configuration, i.e. ozone polishing after MBR, given the same ozone dosage.

AB This paper deals with the removal of two natural estrogens, estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and a synthetic one 17 alpha ethinylestradiol (EE2) from wastewater in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR).
   The effects of both solid retention time (SRT) and hydraulic residence time (HRT) were studied using synthetic wastewater in the MBR. At 35, 45, 60, 75, and 95 days, SRT was studied. The HRT was varied in the range of 7-12 h.
   The results showed that the increases in HRT and SRT enhanced the biodegradation process after adaptation to microorganisms. At HRT of 12 h, the estrogen removals were close to 100% in the MBR. The highest estrogen removals were obtained at SRT of 60 days. Continuous tests showed a linear relationship between nitrification and estrogen removal rates.
   The most biodegradable compound was the E2. The membrane fouling rates increased with the decreased of SRT and HRT. Optimal process conditions in this work was obtained at the SRT and HRT of 60 days and 12 h, respectively, with high efficient of estrogen removal, nitrification efficiencies, as well as a minimum membrane fouling rate.

AB Water samples from four Taiwanese wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) employing secondary treatment processes were evaluated for a sweep of pharmaceuticals, and analysis of the mass loads and removal efficiencies of the compounds identified were conducted. Fifty-seven compounds were detected, including significant amounts of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), psychostimulants (caffeine), antibiotics, and beta-blockers, as well as trace levels of estrogens, vasodilators, psychiatric drugs, and lipid-regulators. Total loads ranged from 10 to 13 and 1.2 to 3.3 g/(d 1000) inhabitants for influents and effluents, respectively. NSAIDs were the main constituent (61-69%) in the water entering three WWTPs. Removal efficiencies varied among WWTPs; high removal rates (72-100%) were generally achieved for NSAIDs, estrogens, and caffeine, but some antibiotics groups (macrolides, penicillin, and imidazole) were not removed at all in many cases. This study also identified 17 mostly detected and persistent pharmaceuticals, of which caffeine, cephalexin, atenolol, and ibuprofen had the highest influent concentrations (up to 17,500, 4367, 2883, and 17,933 ng/L). These medications are used worldwide in significant amounts, and as shown here, the residuals which escape WWTP processing emerge as the primary pollutants for downstream receiving water bodies.

AB A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor was used to treat a model substrate mixture representing pharmaceutical wastewater at an organic loading rate of 2.9 g COD/(Ld). After reaching stable operation the reactor was first exposed to low (1 mg/L) and, subsequently, to high ( 200 mg/L) concentrations of the antibiotic erythromycin. The addition of low levels of erythromycin resulted in a significant but limited reduction of biogas production by 5% and the higher level of erythromycin did not impact biogas production further, suggesting that a substantial fraction of the microbial populations in the ASBR were resistant to the antibiotic. Effluent soluble COD could not be accounted for in measured volatile fatty acids, perhaps suggesting the production of soluble microbial products. In batch tests evaluating the specific methanogenic activity, conversion of the model substrate mixture was only slightly affected by the presence of erythromycin. However, the conversion of butyric acid was inhibited when erythromycin was present. After 47 days of exposure to erythromycin, the conversion of butyric acid was inhibited to a lesser extent, suggesting the development of antibiotic resistance in the biomass. Exposure to antibiotics can affect specific substrate degradation pathways, leading to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids, soluble microbial products, and potentially to overall system instabilities.

AB The use of carbon based materials on the removal of antibiotics with high concentrations has been well studied, however the effect of this removal method is not clear on the actual concentration of environments, such as the hospital wastewater, sewage treatment plants and aquaculture wastewater. In this study, experimental studies on the adsorption of 7 antibiotics in environmental concentration of aqueous solutions by carbon based materials have been observed. Three kinds of carbon materials have shown very fast adsorption to antibiotics by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) detection, and the highest removal efficiency of antibiotics could reach to 100% within the range of detection limit. Surprisedly, the adsorption rate of graphene with small specific surface area was stronger than other two biochar, and adsorption rate of the two biochar which have approximate specific surface and different carbonization degree, was significantly different. The key point to the present observation were the pi-pi interactions between aromatic rings on adsorbed substance and carbon based materials by confocal laser scanning microscope observation. Moreover, adsorption energy markedly increased with increasing number of the pi rings by using the density functional theory (DFT), showing the particular importance of pi-pi interactions in the adsorption process.

AB In the present study a biological "in vivo" assay, with freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus, was used to define and evaluate the potential impact of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) wastewaters on local wildlife. Samples of both untreated and mechanically and biologically treated WWTP wastewater, were tested in the presence and absence of the formulated sediment for their lethal and sublethal effects. Chronic exposures to wastewater samples caused concentration dependent reduced locomotion, body pigmentation and molting frequency in exposed organisms. The observed effects indicate the overall toxicity and endocrine disruption of the wastewater samples. In contrast stimulations of the feeding rate and growth rate of the test organisms during the chronic exposure to sublethal levels of wastewater samples were observed, indicating an improvement in nutritional quality of the wastewater. The most sensitive exposure endpoint was molting frequency of tested organisms, which indicated the presence of estrogenically active endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Raw wastewater caused up to 42% molting frequency reduction of exposed A. aquaticus when exposed to five times diluted untreated wastewater sample, while undiluted treated wastewater caused a 61% molting frequency reduction. The presence of estrogenically active compounds in the wastewater was confirmed with the yeast estrogen screen assay (YES test), which assigned the highest estrogenic activity to a mechanically and biologically treated wastewater sample, and lower estrogenic activity to all other tested samples. The importance of presence of the formulated sediment was determined, as it lessened the effects of all WWTP wastewater samples in all observed exposures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a study conducted by the US Geological Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 water samples were collected at selected locations within a drinking-water-treatment (DWT) facility and from the two streams that serve the facility to evaluate the potential for wastewater-related organic contaminants to survive a conventional treatment process and persist in potable-water supplies. Stream-water samples as well as samples of raw, settled, filtered, and finished water were collected during low-flow conditions, when the discharge of effluent from upstream municipal sewage-treatment plants accounted for 37-67% of flow in stream 1 and 10-20% of flow in stream 2. Each sample was analyzed for 106 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) that represent a diverse group of extensively used chemicals. Forty OWCs were detected in one or more samples of stream water or raw-water supplies in the treatment plant; 34 were detected in more than 10% of these samples. Several of these compounds also were frequently detected in samples of finished water; these compounds include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, fragrance compounds, flame retardants and plasticizers, cosmetic compounds, and a solvent. The detection of these compounds suggests that they resist removal through conventional water-treatment processes. Other compounds that also were frequently detected in samples of stream water and raw-water supplies were not detected in samples of finished water; these include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, disinfectants, detergent metabolites, and plant and animal steroids. The non-detection of these compounds indicates that their concentrations are reduced to levels less than analytical detection limits or that they are transformed to degradates through conventional DWT processes. Concentrations of OWCs detected in finished water generally were low and did not exceed Federal drinking-water standards or lifetime health advisories, although such standards or advisories have not been established for most of these compounds. Also, at least 11 and as many as 17 OWCs were detected in samples of finished water. Drinking-water criteria currently are based on the toxicity of individual compounds and not combinations of compounds. Little is known about potential human-health effects associated with chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple OWCs through routes such as drinking water. The occurrence in drinking-water supplies of many of the OWCs analyzed for during this study is unregulated and most of these compounds have not been routinely monitored for in the Nation's source- or potable-water supplies. This study provides the first documentation that many of these compounds can survive conventional water-treatment processes and occur in potable-water supplies. It thereby provides information that can be used in setting research and regulatory priorities and in designing future monitoring programs. The results of this study also indicate that improvements in water-treatment processes may benefit from consideration of the response of OWCs and other trace organic contaminants to specific physical and chemical treatments.

AB Pharmaceutical substances such as 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the active component of the contraceptive pill, are often not eliminated during wastewater treatment and are persistent in the environment. Using solid-phase extraction and chromatography methods for analyzing low concentrations of EE2 and metabolites, biodegradability of EE2 was studied using four bacteria grown under aerobic conditions in the absence or presence of a readily available carbon source (2.5 g/L of adipic acid or glucose). Preliminary identification of produced metabolites was also completed. In presence of a cosubstrate, Rhodococcus erythropolis removed EE2 up to 47% of its initial concentration (1.4 and 0.5mg/L) in 13 h, while it removed only 10% after 75 h without a cosubstrate. In the presence of a cosubstrate, Rhodococcus equi removed EE2 up to 39% of its initial concentration (1.4mg/L) after 65 h, whereas no significant EE2 removal was observed using Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Rhodococcus zopfii. Preliminary analysis of EE2 transformation products confirmed the presence of phenol and a compound of high molecular weight (331 amu). These results improve our understanding of the effect of common biological wastewater treatment variables such as bacteria strains, acclimation, and presence of cosubstrate, on the removal of EE2.

AB This work is a study on the occurrence of emerging pollutants in the northeast Ecuadorian Amazon. Emerging contaminants (ECs)-caffeine, triclosan, estradiol, acetaminophen, nicotine, and ibuprofen-were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in rivers and streams of the Amazon basin near the city of Tena, Ecuador. For that, a total of 16 natural water samples were taken in 8 locations. Sampling sites included areas impacted by discharges from inefficient sewage networks in urban areas, wastes from fish farming and non-functional landfill, a stream with few threats, tap water, and treated sewage. Caffeine was found in the 38% of the samples studied while trimethoprim and acetaminophen had an occurrence of 13%. Caffeine was detected at two sites receiving untreated sewage and one site receiving treated sewage with mean concentrations that ranged between 19 and 31.5 mu g L-1. Acetaminophen (50.4 mu g L-1) and trimethoprim (2 mu g L-1) were only detected in the river receiving treated sewage effluent. This is the first assessment of emerging contaminants in the upper Ecuadorian Amazon basin, and our observations highlight the need for better sewage treatment and water quality monitoring in Amazonian cities.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including estrogen pharmaceuticals, have been an environmental concern for well more than a decade, but no environmental emissions inventory for Canada has yet been published. Endogenous estrogens cannot be distinguished from the equivalent pharmaceutical estrogens in the environment. Therefore, data were compiled to estimate total environmental emissions of endogenous and retail pharmaceutical estrogens by the Canadian population for year 2007. Approximately 1,700 kg of pharmaceutical estrogens were dispensed through retail pharmacies in Canada in 2007. Of this amount, total environmental emissions were estimated to be approximately 730 kg, half to surface water via municipal sewage outfalls (> 90% via sewage treatment plants providing primary, secondary, or tertiary treatment), and half to the soil vadose zone and (potentially) groundwater via in situ sewage treatment systems. Approximately 960 kg of endogenous estrogens were excreted by the Canadian population, with about 420 kg reaching the environment, again approximately half to each of surface water and soil/groundwater. In situ sewage treatment may deliver an equivalent load of estrogens to the environment as do sewage treatment plants, despite servicing only 22% of the Canadian population.

AB In this study, the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater as predicted by SimpleTreat 4.0 was evaluated. Field data obtained from literature of 43 pharmaceuticals, measured in 51 different activated sludge WWTPs were used. Based on reported influent concentrations, the effluent concentrations were calculated with SimpleTreat 4.0 and compared to measured effluent concentrations. The model predicts effluent concentrations mostly within a factor of 10, using the specific WWTP parameters as well as SimpleTreat default parameters, while it systematically underestimates concentrations in secondary sludge. This may be caused by unexpected sorption, resulting from variability in WWTP operating conditions, andlor QSAR applicability domain mismatch and background concentrations prior to measurements. Moreover, variability in detection techniques and sampling methods can cause uncertainty in measured concentration levels. To find possible structural improvements, we also evaluated SimpleTreat 4.0 using several specific datasets with different degrees of uncertainty and variability. This evaluation verified that the most influencing parameters for water effluent predictions were biodegradation and the hydraulic retention time. Results showed that model performance is highly dependent on the nature and quality, i.e. degree of uncertainty, of the data. The default values for reactor settings in SimpleTreat result in realistic predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bezafibrate (BZF) degradation and mineralization performances of a red mud (RM) catalyst doped with cobalt (i.e. Co/RM) during the ozonation reaction have been evaluated experimentally. The purposes of this study were to study the performance reaction mechanism and intermediate. In a next stage of our study also economic evaluations for a large scale application will be considered. Results of this study showed that catalytic zonation using Co/RM not only led to the successful degradation of BZF, but also mineralized the corresponding intermediates, in ultrapure water as well as the effluent of wastewater. Detoxification was also achieved in this reaction process. The surface and structure properties of Co/RM were characterized by several analytical methods. The leaching of toxic heavy metal from the catalyst used in this process was very low, with the heterogeneous reaction dominating the decomposition of BZF, which made the reuse of the catalyst highly feasible. The enhanced generation of hydroxyl radical was critical to the success of the catalytic activity. Furthermore, 22 of the intermediates generated during this process were identified and several degradation pathways were proposed (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, a distributive environmental input-output model (DEIO) is developed for the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) to provide bases for supporting sustainable development from inter-regional and inter-sectoral perspectives. The discharges and flows of wastewater and related pollutants (i.e., chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (AN)) among sectors and regions are analyzed to providing solid bases for wastewater management within the YREB. The results show that the industrial wastewater mitigation in YREB is desired urgently. The industrial wastewater discharges in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are numerous, while Hunan and Yunnan provinces are more inclined to suffer from serious COD and AN pollution. In addition, the manufacture of food, tobacco, chemical materials, and pharmaceutical are the typical sectors with a large amount of direct wastewater discharge, and the tertiary industry is ranked at the first in indirect wastewater discharge. According to the analysis, the implementation of the "Supply-side Structure Reform" and the "Replace Subsidies with Rewards" policy can benefit the wastewater mitigation in the YREB.

AB beta-blockers are a class of medications widely used to treat cardiovascular disorders, including abnormal heart rhythms, high blood pressure, and angina pectoris. The prevalence of beta-blockers has generated a widespread concern on their potential chronic toxicity on aquatic organisms, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive studies on their environmental distribution, fate, and toxicity. This review summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on the source, global distribution, analytical methods, transformation, and toxicity of beta-blockers. Twelve beta-blockers have been detected in various environmental matrices, displaying significant temporal and spatial variations. beta-blockers can be reduced by 0-99% at wastewater treatment plants, where secondary processes contribute to the majority of removal. Advanced oxidation processes, e.g., photocatalysis and combined UV/persulfate can transform beta-blockers more rapidly and completely than conventional wastewater treatment processes, but the transformation products could be more toxic than the parent compounds. Propranolol, especially its (S)-enantiomer, exhibits the highest toxicity among all beta-blockers. Future research towards improved detection methods, more efficient and cost-effective removal techniques, and more accurate toxicity assessment is needed to prioritize beta-blockers for environmental monitoring and control worldwide.

AB An emissions inventory for top consumed human pharmaceuticals in Sweden was done based on national consumption data, human metabolic rates and wastewater treatment removal rates. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface waters in Swedish river basins were predicted using estimated emissions from the inventory and river discharges. Our findings indicate that the top ten emitted pharmaceuticals in our study set of 54 substances are all emitted in amounts above 0.5 ton/y to both surface waters and soils. The highest emissions to water were in decreasing order for Metformin, Furosemide, Gabapentin, Atenolol and Tramadol. Predicted emissions to soils calculated with the knowledge that in Sweden sludge is mostly disposed to soil, point to the highest emissions among the studied drugs coming from, in decreasing order, Metformin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin and Atenolol. Surface water concentrations in Sweden's largest rivers, all located in low density population zones, were found to be below 10 ng/L for all substances studied. In contrast, concentrations in surface waters in Stockholm's metropolitan area, the most populous in Sweden, surpassed 100 ng/L for four substances: Atenolol, Metformin, Furosemide and Gabapentin.

AB The occurrence of sulfonamide and macrolide antimicrobials, as well as trimethoprim, was investigated in conventional activated sludge treatment. Average daily loads in untreated wastewater correlated well with those estimated from annual consumption data and pharmacokinetic behavior. Considerable variations were found during a day, and seasonal differences seem to occur for the macrolides, probably caused by a higher consumption of these substances in winter. The most predominant macrolide and sulfonamide antimicrobials were clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. In the case of sulfamethoxazole, the main human metabolite, M-acetylsulfamethoxazole, was included as an analyte, accounting for up to 86% of the total load in untreated wastewater. The results obtained illustrate the importance of considering retransformable substances, for example human metabolites, when investigating the behavior and fate of pharmaceuticals. Average concentrations of sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azithromycin, and clarithromycin in activated sludge ranged between 28 and 68 mu g/kg of dry weight. Overall the sorption to activated sludge was shown to be low for the investigated antimicrobials, with estimated sorption constants for activated sludge below 500 L/kg. Elimination in activated sludge treatment was found to be incomplete for all investigated compounds. In final effluents, the median concentrations for sulfa methoxazole and clarithromycin were 290 and 240 ng/L, respectively.

AB Removal of contaminants in the sewage treatment plants (STPs) can be incomplete causing their release to the environment. In this paper, the results of an extensive survey on more than 40 pesticides carried out in 2010 and 2011 in 16 STPs of Ebro, Guadalquivir, Jucar and Llobregat Rivers (Spain) are presented. In 2010, of 43 analytes screened, 29 were detected in influent and 28 in effluent samples, meanwhile in 2011, of 50 analytes, 33 and 34 were detected, respectively. Pesticides were in the range of 0.33 ng L-1 (terbumeton, 2011)-2526.05 ng L-1 (diuron, 2010) for influent and 0.25 ng L-1 (terbumeton, 2011)-2821.12 ng L-1 (carbendazim, 2011) for effluent. Regarding the sludge samples, 11 pesticides were detected in 2010 and 24 in 2011 at concentrations up to 25667.34 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw). Removal efficiencies showed that, in 2010, the elimination ranged from -810% (chlorfenvinphos) to 93% (dimethoate), and in 2011, from -4575% (diazinon) to 97% (chlorfenvinphos). All these data confirm that most of the pesticides are only partially eliminated during the secondary and even tertiary treatments, commonly used in STPs, suggesting that they can be a focal point of contamination to the rivers.

AB High-salinity industrial wastewater is difficult to treat. In this study, an evaporation process for use in cooling towers and seawater desalination was adapted to treating high-salinity wastewater under gentle operating conditions. Real wastewater and simulated wastewater containing sodium chloride and glucose were used in this study. An evaporation unit, with an evaporation rate of 5L/h, was designed and installed in the laboratory. Analysis revealed the effects of operating factors on the quality of condensed water, as well as the relationship between the mass transfer coefficient and wastewater characteristics. The results showed that for the selected system, when the inlet air speed was below 2.5m/s and the wastewater flow rate was below 1.0m(3)/h, the total dissolved solids and the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies could reach up to 99.9%. The most significant difference between the mass transfer coefficients of the clean water and simulated wastewater was 30.9% under identical operating conditions. The equation of the mass transfer coefficient considering the density, viscosity, and saturated vapor pressure of wastewater was built to predict the mass transfer efficiency for this process. A case study using real wastewater from a pharmaceutical factory illustrated that the system performed well in practical situations. The predicted mass transfer coefficient agreed well with the measured value. In summary, the developed evaporation system has good prospects for the treatment of high-salinity industrial wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals constitute a well-known group of emerging contaminants with an increasing significance in water pollution. This study focuses on three pharmaceuticals extensively used in Finland and which can be found in environmental waters: ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Biodegradation experiments were conducted in a full-scale Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and in laboratory-scale Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs). The SBRs were operated at 12 degrees C, with a sludge retention time (SRT) 10-12 d and organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0.17, 0.27 and 0.33 kg BOD7 m(-3)d(-1). Ibuprofen was found to biodegrade up to 99%. The biodegradation rate constants (k(biol)) for ibuprofen were calculated for full-scale and laboratory processes as well as under different laboratory conditions and found to differ from 0.9 up to 5.0 l g(ss)(-1) d(-1). Diclofenac demonstrated an unexpected immediate drop of concentration in three SBRs and partial recovery of the initial concentration in one of the reactors. High fluctuating in diclofenac concentration was presumably caused by removal of this compound under different concentrations of nitrites during development of nitrifying activated sludge. Carbamazepine showed no biodegradation in all the experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The generation of large volumes of waste by industrial processes has become an object of study because of the necessity to characterize the composition of residues in order to suggest appropriate treatments and to minimize adverse environmental impacts. We performed analyses of total fixed and volatile solids, moisture, and chemical oxygen demand (COD). We found high organic matter content. We also measured physicochemical characteristics, including corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Sewage sludge showed levels of chloride and sodium above the maximum allowed limits. These data suggest the potential for anaerobic digestion as a treatment option for sewage sludge and for its use as a biofertilizer.

AB While the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in groundwater has typically been reported in bank filtration sites, irrigated fields, septic tanks, and sewage disposal practices, fewer studies have been conducted in highly urbanized areas, where infiltration of treated or untreated sewage is not supposed to be a source of groundwater recharge. Furthermore, little is known about the occurrence of various kinds of PPCPs in relation to microbial indicators in groundwater from different types of aquifers. Thus, we examined the city-wide occurrence of selected PPCPs (diethyltoluamide, crotamiton, ethenzamide, propyphenazone, carbamazepine, and caffeine) and E. coli in 50 groundwaters from unconfined aquifers (<30 m in depth) and confined aquifers (up to 500 m in depth) in Tokyo, where unintended groundwater contamination could take place due to decrepit sewer networks. PPCPs were detected in unconfined aquifers and springs (23/34 samples, 68%), and in confined aquifers (7/16 samples, 44%). Compared with published results for sewage influents, concentrations of PPCPs, excluding caffeine, were generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower, while in some samples concentrations were quite comparable. The high occurrence rate of PPCPs, even in confined aquifers, indicated that such aquifers are not always protected from pollution by sewage near the land surface. Among the PPCPs analyzed, carbamazepine and crotamiton were most frequently detected, which would appear to be owing to their high persistence, combined with the high concentration of crotamiton in sewage. Crotamiton was detected in all four E. coli-positive groundwaters, and thus may potentially serve as a precautionary indicator of E. coli contamination. Using carbamazepine as a sewage marker, we estimated that 0.8%-1.7% of the dry-weather flow of sewage was leaking out into the unconfined aquifers.

AB The growing water stress both in terms of water scarcity and quality deterioration promotes the development of reclaimed water as a new water resource use. This paper reviewed wastewater reuse practices in China, and the opportunities and challenges of expanding reclaimed water use were analyzed. Rapid urbanization with the increasing of water demand and wastewater discharge provides an opportunity for wastewater reuse. The vast amount of wastewater discharge and low reclaimed water production mean that wastewater reuse still has a great potential in China. Many environmental and economic benefits and successful reclamation technologies also provide opportunities for wastewater reuse. In addition, the overall strategy in China is also encouraging forwastewater reuse. In the beginning stage ofwastewater reclamation and reuse, there aremany significant challenges to expand wastewater reuse in China including slow pace in adopting urban wastewater reuse programs, the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs, incoherent water quality requirements, the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and the strengthening of public awareness and cooperation among stakeholders.

AB We assessed possible ecotoxicological implications of ozone application to secondary treated wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant on Gammarus fossarum, an aquatic leaf shredding amphipod. Our 10-week study exposed G. fossarum populations to ozone-treated, non-ozone treated wastewater, or tap water in replicated outdoor flow-through stream microcosms. Feeding activity, an indicator for organic matter decomposition, of amphipod populations exposed to ozone treated wastewater was significantly higher compared to those exposed to non-ozone treated wastewater (repeated measure ANOVA, p = 0.0002, df = 44). Also the population size was at the end of the experiment with approximately 150% significantly (t-test, p = 0.0059, n = 4) increased in ozone treated wastewater compared to non-ozone treated wastewater. Additionally, chlorophyll-a concentration, an indicator for algal biomass, was significantly higher in ozone treated wastewater (repeated measure ANOVA, p = 0.0404, df = 65). Thus, from an ecotoxicological viewpoint, we conclude that ozonation may improve wastewater quality, which should translate into positive ecological outcomes in the receiving waters. However, because ozonation also can cause toxic transformation products, the process may best be considered on a case-by-case basis.

AB In the present study, the sorption and biodegradation characteristics of five pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), crotamiton (CTMT), diethyltoluamide (DEET) and salicylic acid (SA), were studied in laboratory-batch experiments. Sorption kinetics experimental data showed that sorption systems under this study were more appropriately described by the pseudo second-order kinetics with a correlation coefficient (R-2) > 0.98. Sorption equilibrium data of almost all target compounds onto soil could be better described by the Freundlich sorption isotherm model. The adsorption results showed higher soil affinity for SA, following by ACT. Results also indicated a slight effect of pH on PPCP adsorption with lower pH causing lower adsorption of compounds onto the soil except for SA at pH 12. Moreover, adsorption of PPCPs onto the soil was influenced by natural organic matter (NOM) since the higher amount of NOM caused lower adsorption to the soil. Biodegradation studies of selected PPCPs by indigenous microbial community present in soil appeared that the removal rates of ACT, SA and DEET increased with time while no effect had been observed for the rest. This study suggests that the CBZ and CTMT can be considered as suitable chemical sewage indicators based on their low sorption affinity and high resistance to biodegradation.

AB Many wildlife species forage on sewage-contaminated food, for example, at wastewater treatment plants and on fields fertilized with sewage sludge. The resultant exposure to human pharmaceuticals remains poorly studied for terrestrial species. On the basis of predicted exposure levels in the wild, we administered the common antidepressant fluoxetine (FLUOX) or control treatment via prey to wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) for 22 weeks over winter. To investigate responses to fluoxetine, birds were moved from their group aviaries into individual cages for 2 days. Boldness, exploration and activity levels showed no treatment effects but controls and FLUOX birds habituated differently to isolation in terms of the concentration of corticosterone (CORT) metabolites in faeces. The controls that excreted higher concentrations of CORT metabolites on day 1 lost more body mass by day 2 of isolation than those which excreted lower levels of CORT metabolites. CORT metabolites and mass loss were unrelated in FLUOX birds. When we investigated the movements of birds in their group aviaries, we found the controls made a higher frequency of visits to food trays than FLUOX birds around the important foraging periods of sunrise and sunset, as is optimal for wintering birds. Although individual variability makes interpreting the sub-lethal endpoints measured challenging, our data suggest that fluoxetine at environmentally relevant concentrations can significantly alter behaviour and physiology.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; POLLUTION; MARKETS; SYSTEM
AB Background China's industrial wastewater pollution control policy urgently needs to change from government enforcement to market economy incentive, especially in regions with mature market economic conditions and improved legislative basis like Yangtze River Delta. The economic principles of Water Emissions Trading policy are to achieve a win-win situation in which pollution could be controlled meanwhile abatement costs are minimized. Existing regulations lack rules and restrictions for cross-industrial wastewater emission trading, nevertheless not all wastewater from various industrial sectors are suitable for emissions trading with each other. This study attempted to determine tradable levels of wastewater emissions rights within the selected 10 industries based on the similarity of wastewater composition. Results The result is presented in a tradable level matrix. It shows that of all industrial wastewater, the most suitable for emissions trading are, respectively, Textile and Paper Production, Manufacture of General Purpose Machinery and Manufacture of Transport, and then Chemistry Production and Pharmaceuticals. Conclusion Generally, this paper provides a systematic calculation method according to the similarity analysis to formulate cross-industrial wastewater emissions trading for policy reference. At the end of the article, a rationality analysis of the domestic wastewater emissions trading pilot programs was made. Even though the current wastewater emissions trading situation is not up to expectations, individual enterprises actively achieved emission reductions to play as the supply sides in the wastewater emissions trading under economic incentive from such a policy.

AB The concentrations and behaviour of 105 different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the aqueous phase of sewage water within a municipal sewer collection system have been investigated. Sewage water samples were gathered from seven pump stations (one of which was located within a university hospital) and from sewage water treatment influent and effluent. The targeted APIs were quantified using a multi-residue method based on online solid phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The method was thoroughly validated and complies with EU regulations on sample handling, limits of quantification, quality control and selectivity. 51 APIs, including antibiotics, antidepressants, hypertension drugs, analgesics, NSAIDs and psycholeptics, were found frequently within the sewer collection system. API concentrations and mass flows were evaluated in terms of their frequency of detection, daily variation, median/minimum/maximum/average concentrations, demographic dissimilarities, removal efficiencies, and mass flow profiles relative to municipal sales data. Our results suggest that some APIs are removed from, or introduced to, the aqueous phase of sewage waters within the studied municipal collection system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were analyzed in the influent and effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment plant in Turkey and a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany and the toxicity of these wastewaters were estimated using a toxic unit (TU) approach. A total of 21 and 32 PhACs were detected in the domestic wastewater and the municipal wastewater, respectively. The TUs estimated for PhACs in municipal wastewater were higher than the TUs estimated for PhACs present in domestic wastewater. The levels of the anti-anxiety drug, oxazepam were estimated to be in the high risk category (HQ>10) in both wastewaters. In bench-scale tests with ozonation, the removals of four PhACs in the municipal wastewater were investigated. At a dose of 2mg/L ozone, 97%-98% of diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed. The lowest removal rate at 71% was observed for metoprolol.

AB This paper has endeavoured to produce a technical note on the hazards that humans and the environment face with the burden of wastewater irrigation on crops and the soil. Reports based on past and present issues related to wastewater used in irrigation of crops and the health implications when it is applied in the arable field for irrigating crops have been considered broadly. It is conclusive that wastewater has polluted and contaminated crops and soil when not properly treated before being applied for irrigation purposes. The crop effects and advantages of wastewater reuse in agriculture are of extensive application because of a lack of water in numerous parts of the world. Besides, the impacts of wastewater systems should be assessed not only from the perspective of social, monetary and natural viewpoints, but in addition from the sustainable improvement point of view; thus this paper surveyed the sustainability, benefits, impediments, developments and innovations of using the wastewater in water systems for agriculture. Wastewater treatment must be further advanced to address developing concerns such as amount and quality. More effective decentralized wastewater administration frameworks must be set up to provide the approach to abridge the cost of wastewater treatment. Finally, we require suitable strategies to catch and convey water, secure soil, reuse wastewater and streamline its administration. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Urban watersheds are susceptible to numerous pollutant sources and the identification of source-specific indicators can provide a beneficial tool in the identification and control of input loads, often times needed for a water body to achieve designated beneficial uses. Differentiation of wastewater flows from other urban wet weather flows is needed in order to more adequately address such environmental concerns as water body nutrient impairment and potable source water contamination. Anthropogenic compounds previously suggested as potential wastewater indicators include caffeine, carbamazepine, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), gemfibrozil, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, and TCEP. This paper compares the suitability of a variety of anthropogenic compounds to sucralose, an artificial sweetener, as wastewater indicators by examining occurrence data for 85 trace organic compounds in samples of wastewater effluents, source waters with known wastewater point source inputs, and sources without known wastewater point source inputs. The findings statistically demonstrate the superior performance of sucralose as a potential indicator of domestic wastewater input in the U.S. While several compounds were detected in all of the wastewater effluent samples, only sucralose was consistently detected in the source waters with known wastewater discharges, absent in the sources without wastewater influence, and consistently present in septic samples. All of the other compounds were prone to either false negatives or false positives in the environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The persistence of antibiotics in sewage wastewater treatment plants in recent years has emerged as a serious issue. This study therefore evaluated three types of natural zeolites (i.e., NZ01, NZ02, and NZ03) for the removal of selected antibiotics namely tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from aqueous solution. The physical and chemical properties of the natural zeolites were characterized using various analytical techniques and the antibiotic removal studies were carried out in a batch adsorption experiment evaluated at various experimental conditions. The highest adsorption capacity was 62.5 and 76.3 mu mol/g for TC and OTC, respectively, observed for NZ02 at pH values between 7 and 8. The adsorption of TC and OTC followed the Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models, respectively, whereas the adsorption kinetic data obeyed the Elovich kinetic model. The regeneration study on NZ02 indicated that it can still remove TC and OTC after five adsorption/desorption cycles. The removal efficiency of TC and OTC also improved from approximately 5-39 and 28%, respectively, by addition of NZ02 during the coagulation/flocculation process. These results thus demonstrated the applicability of the natural zeolites, especially NZ02, for the removal of TC and OTC from aqueous solution; hence the potential for the application in sewage treatment process for removal of antibiotics through either conventional adsorption/desorption or adsorptive coagulation/flocculation (ACF) process.

AB Awareness of antibiotics in wastewaters and aquatic ecosystems is growing as investigations into alternate pollutants increase and analytical techniques for detecting these chemicals improve. The presence of three antibiotics (ciproffoxacin, norfloxacin and cephalexin) was evaluated in both sewage effluent and environmental waters downstream from a sewage discharge. Bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor and receiving waters were tested for resistance against six antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin, trimethoprim, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole) and effects of short term exposure (24h) to antibiotics on bacterial denitrification rates were examined. Antibiotics were detected entering the sewage treatment plant with varying levels of removal during the treatment process. Antibiotics were also detected in effluent entering receiving waters and detectable 500m from the source. Among the bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor, resistance was displayed against all six antibiotics tested and bacteria cultured from receiving waters were resistant against two of the antibiotics tested. Rates of denitrification were observed to decrease in response to some antibiotics and not to others, though this was only observed at concentrations exceeding those likely to be found in the environment. Findings from this preliminary research have indicated that antibiotics are entering our aquatic systems and pose a potential threat to ecosystem function and potentially human health.

AB The use of sludge (biosolids) in land application may Contribute to the spread. of organic micro pollutants as wastewater treatments do not completely remove these compounds. Therefore, the development of alternative strategies for sludge treatment is a matter of recent concern. The elimination, of pharmaceuticals at, pre-existent concentrations from sewage sludge was assessed, for the first time, in nonsterile biopiles by Means of fungal bioaugmentation with Trametes versicolor (BTV-systems) and compared with the effect of autochthonous microbiota (NB systems) The Competition between the autochthonous fungal/bacterial communities and T. versicolor was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.(DGGE) and the cloning/sequencing approach. An inhibitory effect exerted by T versicolor over bacterial populations was suggested. However, after 21 days, T. versicolor was no longer the main taxon in the fungal communities. The elimination profiles revealed an enhanced removal of atorvastatin-diclofenac-hydrochlorothiazide (during the whole treatment) and ranitidine-fenofibrate (at short periods) in the BTV biopiles in respect to NB biopiles, coincident with the presence of the fungus. For ibuprofen-clarithromycin-furosemide, the elimination Profiles were similar irrespective of the system, and with carbamazepine no significant degradation was obtained. The results suggest that a fungal treatment with T versicolor could be a promising process for the remediation of some pharmaceuticals in complex matrices such as biosolids.

AB Pharmaceuticals are produced and used in increasingly large Volumes every year. With this growth comes concern about the fate and effects of these compounds in the environment. The discovery of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has stimulated research in the last decade. A wide range of pharmaceuticals has been found in fresh and marine waters, and it has recently been shown that even in small quantities, some of these compounds have the potential to cause harm to aquatic life. The primary pathway into the environment is the use and disposal of medicines; although much of the research in the area currently focuses on the removal of pharmaceuticals during sewage treatment processes, disposal via household waste might be a significant pathway requiring further research. To investigate the household disposal of unused and expired pharmaceuticals as a source of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment, we carried out a survey and interviewed members of 400 households, predominantly from southeastern England. We used the information on when and how they disposed of unfinished pharmaceuticals to construct a conceptual model to assess the pathways of human pharmaceuticals into the environment. The model demonstrated that disposal of unused pharmaceuticals, either by household waste or via the sink or toilet, may be a prominent route that requires greater attention.

AB Removal of two acidic pharmaceuticals, clofibric acid and diclofenac, present in sewage sludge using two kinds of anaerobic digestions was investigated. The effective isolation and purification pretreatment to extract the target compounds from the sewage sludge samples was firstly established, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify and quantify them. Under mesophilic conditions, the removal efficiencies for clofibric acid and diclofenac with the initial concentrations of 5 mu g/dm(3) were up to 95% and 97%. After thermophilic anaerobic digestion, the removal efficiency could be increased to 99.3% for clofibric acid, however, it did not increase for diclofenac. In general, anaerobic digestion could effectively remove the target compounds from the sewage sludge (all above 90%).

AB Two start-up strategies of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated. The results showed that both of them were workable. Compared with the strategy that started up the reactor directly using chloromycetin wastewater, the strategy that started up the reactor first using mixed wastewater and then using chloromycetin wastewater could save time by 23%. When the latter strategy was adopted the development of sludge activity fluctuated more largely and its final activity was lower, but the Sludge grew faster in the course of start-up.

AB The limited availability of natural water resources and dependency on mineral fertilizer challenge agricultural value chains in arid and nutrient-poor areas. Reusing wastewater in agriculture may help and could reduce costs and lead to increased added-value. The objective of this analysis is to assess the economic impact of linking the value chains of wastewater treatment, crop production and the generation of bioenergy by reusing treated municipal wastewater and sludge. The assessment was based on the cost/benefits and the added-value from the reused wastewater by the Braunschweig Wastewater Association (Germany). Benefits were assessed by comparing the costs of wastewater irrigation and sludge application with conventional disposal options, as well as comparing the costs of irrigation and fertilization with treated wastewater to groundwater irrigation and mineral fertilization. The added-value was calculated by ascertaining the remunerations received by the stakeholders in the various value chains. The results indicate that the reuse of wastewater and sludge results in: (a) the development of linked regional value chains; (b) lower costs of wastewater treatment and sludge disposal; (c) higher profitability and added-value in crop production; and (d) a high share (77%) of regional added-value. However, the results also show that the reuse of wastewater and sludge within linked value-chains can restrict actors and lead to crowding out effects on the added-value. Agricultural reuse schemes should provide additional opportunities that enable farmers to increase their scope of possibilities and compensate for missed economic potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND: Sertraline (SER) is a widely used antidepressant persistent in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been studied for degradation of organic contaminants. However, it usually results in poor mineralization efficiency. The effect of H2O2 on ZVI mediated degradation of SER was studied and compared with sole ZVI and the homogeneous Fenton process.
   RESULTS: The effect of ZVI dose on SER degradation was different with 20 and 200 mesh particle sizes. The degradation rate was improved as the dose of larger particle (20 mesh) was increased, while no significant variation was observed with smaller particle (200 mesh). The SER degradation was hindered by the high Fe2(+)/H2O2 ratio as well as the sharp increase of pH when high ZVI doses or small particles were used. The addition of H2O2 (5 mmol L-1) to the ZVI system greatly improved SER degradation and mineralization even at low ZVI dose (0.5 g L-1). SER could be efficiently degraded in a STP effluent mediated by ZVI (20 mesh), especially when H2O2 was employed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The potential of the ZVI/H2O2 process for degradation of SER in effluents from an STP was demonstrated, showing a significant improvement of target contaminant degradation and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs are contaminants that are generally ubiquitous in wastewater treatment plant effluents with their release into the environment being well understood in North America, Europe, and Asia. There is, however, less information on the release of human pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs from regions undergoing rapid land use, economical, and social changes, such as Brazil. This encompasses many areas in the tropical zone where releases of emerging contaminants may impact pristine, bio-diversity rich ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals and the illicit drug cocaine was determined in the Rio Negro and two of its tributaries that receive large amounts of untreated sewage, the Igarape Mindu and the Igarape do 40, passing through the city of Manaus, Brazil. In addition to cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecognine, propranolol, diclofenac, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, carbamazepine-epoxide, citalopram, metoprolol, carisoprolol, and sertraline were all detected in two urban tributaries at low ng/l concentrations similar to those typically found in urban surface waters. Concentrations in the Rio Negro were typically lower than detection limits due to the large level of dilution, although traces of a range of pharmaceuticals were detected in the Rio Negro in proximity of the confluence of the urban streams. The data represent new information on the emissions of pharmaceuticals from a newly industrialized region of Brazil.

AB Six polycyclic musks (PCMs) and five nitro musks (NMs) were analyzed in dewatered sludge samples from 13 municipal, 4 livestock and 1 pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South Korea. 1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-(g)-2-benzopyran (HHCB; Galaxolide (R), Abbalide (R)), and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethy1-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN; Tonalide (R), Fixolide (R)) were the two predominant PCMs in the sludge samples, at concentrations ranging from 0.52 to 82.0 mg/kg dry weight (dw) and 0.12 to 28.8 mg/kg (dw), respectively, suggesting the extensive use of these two PCMs in South Korea. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed the different usage patterns of PCMs between livestock cultivating farm and household. The levels of HHCB and AHTN in the effluent discharged from the WWTPs were lower than the threshold effect levels derived for fish, suggesting low potential risks to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the calculated discharge of synthetic musks (SMs) from sludge in each target WWTP ranged from 36 to 10,961 g/d. These results indicate the necessity of conducting monitoring studies in marine ecosystems due to ocean disposal of sludge, particularly focused on the two prevailing PCMs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of wastewater irrigation on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities of soil mesocosms planted with lettuces was studied over an experiment made of five cultivation campaigns. A limited effect of irrigation with either raw or treated wastewater was observed in both alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of soil bacterial communities. However, the irrigation with wastewater fortified with a complex mixture of fourteen relevant chemicals at 10 mu g/L each, including pharmaceutical, biocide, and pesticide active substances, led to a drift in the composition of soil bacterial community. One hundred operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified as responsible for changes between treated and fortified wastewater irrigation treatments. Our findings indicate that under a realistic agronomical scenario, the irrigation of vegetables with domestic (treated or raw) wastewater has no effect on soil bacterial communities. Nevertheless, under the worst-case scenario tested here (i.e., wastewater fortified with a mixture of chemicals), non-resilient changes were observed suggesting that continuous/repeated irrigation with wastewater could lead to the accumulation of contaminants in soil and induce changes in bacterial communities with unknown functional consequences.

To improve amantadine wastewater biodegradability, the combined advanced oxidation process, such as Fenton/ultrasonic process, was proposed to treat amantadine industrial wastewater. The efficiency comparisons for the treatment of amantadine wastewater using Fenton oxidation, ultrasonic process, and Fenton/ultrasonic process were conducted. The results of wastewater treatment with Fenton/ultrasonic process indicated that the TOC removal reached 65.6 %, showing almost 4 times of the degradation rate by individual oxidizing action of hydrogen peroxide. Kinetic study revealed that degradation of amantadine wastewater fitted first order kinetics for the three processes under investigation. The synergistic index (f) for the combined process was calculated as 2.24, indicating an obvious synergy effect. The energy consumption for hydrodynamic cavitation-based process has been analyzed on the basis of cavitational yield. Fenton and combined processes reduced the toxicity of wastewater by 50 and 55 %, respectively, while ultrasonic process showed no obvious effect on toxicity reduction. The monitoring of treated wastewater by EEM and GC-MS showed that the Fenton/ultrasonic process effectively removed the organic matters in the wastewater, especially the biodegradation-resistant matters containing benzene ring.

AB Sewage effluent application to land is a treatment technology that requires appropriate consideration of various design factors. Soil type, level of sewage pre-treatment and irrigation rate were assessed for their influence on the success of soil treatment in removing pharmaceuticals remaining after conventional sewage treatment. A large scale experimental site was built to assess treatment performance in a realistic environment. Of the factors investigated, soil type had the biggest impact on treatment performance. In particular, carbamazepine was very efficiently removed (>99%) when irrigated onto a volcanic sandy loam soil. This was in contrast to irrigation onto a sandy soil where no carbamazepine removal occurred after irrigation. Differences were likely caused by the presence of allophane in the volcanic soil which is able to accumulate a high level of organic matter. Carbamazepine apparent adsorption distribution coefficients (K-d) for both soils when irrigated with treated sewage effluent were determined as 25 L kg(-1) for the volcanic soil and 0.08 L kg(-1) for the sandy soil. Overall, a volcanic soil was reasonably efficient in removing carbamazepine while soil type was not a major factor for caffeine removal. Removal of caffeine, however, was more efficient when a partially treated rather than fully treated effluent was applied. Based on the investigated pharmaceuticals and given an appropriate design, effluent irrigation onto land, in conjunction with conventional sewage treatment may be considered a beneficial treatment for pharmaceutical removal.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics including chloramphenciol (CAP), oxytetracycline (OTC) and tetracycline (TC) was studied in municipal sewage, river water and sediment. Temporal and spatial variations of antibiotic concentrations in municipal sewage, river water and sediment were evaluated. In municipal sewage, CAP, OTC and TC concentrations were in the range of 5.8-47.4, 0.16-5.7 and 0.7-65.2 mg L-1, respectively, and showed a temporal variation with high antibiotic concentrations appearing in the cold season. Untreated municipal sewage can seriously influence both river water and sediment. Generally, high antibiotic concentrations in river water appeared in winter owing to the low flow condition as well as the high antibiotic concentration in the sewage. However, high CAP and OTC concentrations in sediment were observed in summer most likely because runoff in high flow season can carry wastes from some origins ( e. g. livestock farms in the countryside) into the river. The partitioning of antibiotics in river water and sediment suggests a lower sorption of TCs to the sediment compared to previous studies, which is believed to be caused by the high Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, ionic strength and pH of the river water in the carbonate area.

AB The complex organics, residue pharmaceuticals and high salinity in pharmaceutical wastewater pose great challenges to biological wastewater treatment. In this study, granular sludge process was used for treating pharmaceutical wastewater because of its high pollutant removal efficiency. The results suggested that granules could not form within 90-d cultivation when directly fed with target hypersaline pharmaceutical wastewater (RP) due to suppression of EPS secretion by high concentration of inhibitory organics, while granules were successfully developed with hypersaline synthetic wastewater (RS) and diluted pharmaceutical wastewater (RD), respectively. Further comparison of pollutant removal performance from target pharmaceutical wastewater showed that simultaneous removal of organics (effluent bCOD < 1 mg L-1) and nitrogen (average TN removal efficiency of 70.3%) could be achieved in RD. Nevertheless, long acclimation period (i.e., 20 d) was needed for granules when carbon source was shifted from simple sodium acetate to complex organic pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater, with nitrite significantly accumulated in RS. Analysis of microbial community and nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated the higher abundance of nitrite oxidoreductase than that in the RS to alleviate nitrite accumulation in the RD, and functional strains such as Paracoccus and Mycobacterium played critical roles for high efficiency of organic degradation, nitrification and denitrification.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern are a growing burden for sewage sludge recycling. Pyrolysis of sewage sludge could be a solution. Yet, the product of sewage sludge pyrolysis (biochar) is currently not included on the list of eligible fertilizers in the new EU Fertilising Products Regulation. This was justified by insufficient evidence for organic contaminant removal through pyrolysis. Here I summarize the current evidence on this topic covering 20 studies and more than 100 different organic pollutants. The studies demonstrate that pyrolysis reduces the concentration of well-established contaminants, such as PAHs, PCBs, and dioxins, but also emerging ones, i.e., pharmaceuticals, hormones, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, antimicrobials, microplastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with very high efficacy (>95 to >99% in most cases). After pyrolysis, the levels of organic contaminant in biochar were typically below the limit of detection. Furthermore, modern pyrolysis units prevent environmental release of contaminants that are only vaporized and not decomposed during pyrolysis by internal combustion of pyrolysis liquids and gases. The evidence for effective organic contaminant removal through pyrolysis is comprehensive, covering all relevant groups of compounds. This and its potential as negative emission technology makes pyrolysis of sewage sludge a great opportunity for sustainable and safe nutrient recycling.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceuticals (beta-blockers: acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol and sotalol; antiepileptic: carbamazepine; fluoroquinolone antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin) were assessed in the raw and treated sewage of 12 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Finland. The average concentrations in the raw and treated sewage ranged from 100 to 1060 ng L-1 and from < 24 to 755 ng L-1, respectively. The average daily loads ranged from 36 to 405 mg/1000 inh and from 2 to 302 mg/1000 inh, respectively. In the treatment plants, fluoroquinolones were eliminated by > 80%. Carbamazepine was not eliminated during the treatment and in fact even higher concentrations were frequently found in the treated than in the raw sewages. The increase in concentration was shown to be most likely due to enzymatic cleavage of the glucuronic conjugate of carbamazepine and release of the parent compound in the treatment plant. The beta-blockers were eliminated in average by less than 65% and the elimination varied greatly between the treatment plants. Especially the dilution of raw sewage by rainwater and a consequent decrease in the hydraulic retention time of a treatment plant was found to deteriorate the elimination of the beta-blockers. The work shows that especially carbamazepine and the fl-blockers may reach the recipient waters and there is a need to enhance their elimination in the sewage treatment plants. In this attempt, a denitrifying biofilter as a tertiary treatment could be of minor importance since in this study it did not result in further elimination of the target compounds.

AB Mixed pharmaceutical wastewater contains high levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and high concentrations of toxic and harmful substances. A conventional wastewater treatment process cannot treat this wastewater sufficiently to meet discharge standards. Therefore, mixed pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is a serious challenge to wastewater management. In this study, a full-scale combined anaerobic/oxic (A/O) and biological filtration oxygenated reactor (BIOFOR (R)) process was used to treat the mixed pharmaceutical wastewater. The objectives were to evaluate the removal efficiency of the combined A/O+BIOFOR process on mixed pharmaceutical wastewater and to examine the bacterial community structures in process. The results showed that the effluent concentration of COD, NH4-N, and SS could meet the Chinese mission standard of water pollutants for the pharmaceutical industry mixing/compounding and formulation category (GB21908-2008). MiSeq sequencing data showed that the two systems (A/O and BIOFOR) harbored different bacterial diversity and communities. In phylum level, candidate-division-TM7 was the most predominant phylum in the A/O system, while Proteo bacteria was the most dominant phylum in the BIOFOR reactor. At the genus level, 126 genera were unique in A/O or BIOFOR reactors. The results of this study provided insights into the bacterial community structure and diversity in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment system and can provide reference for the treatment of mixed pharmaceutical wastewater.

The degradation rate of SMX was higher in swine sludge than in sewage sludge. The addition of lactate, citrate, and sucrose had significant effects on SMX degradation, and sucrose addition yielded a higher SMX degradation rate than the other additives. At concentrations of 0.1-10 g/l sucrose, the SMX degradation rates increased in the sludge. The bacterial genera from swine sludge with sucrose exhibited the highest SMX degrading efficiency. Seventeen bacterial genera were found to be the major bacterial community members involved in SMX degradation in the sludge.

The parameters used were the temperature, pharmaceutical wastewater concentration, oxidant concentration and residence time. The results demonstrated that the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) process decreases the TOC up to more than 80% in very short reaction times (at a residence time of 3-12 min). This investigation will provide fundamental method for developing a pretreatment method of pharmaceutical industry wastewater with flexibility, simplicity and high activity.

Final analysis was performed on UPLC-MS/MS using two different chromatographic methods: acid and basic. When analysing all 23 APIs in sewage sludge both extraction methods showed good repeatability. The PHWE method allowed for a more complete extraction of APIs that were more tightly bound to the matrix, as exemplified by much higher concentrations of e.g., ketoconazole, citalopram and ciprofloxacin. In total, 19 out of 23 investigated APIs were quantified in sewage sludge, and with a few exceptions the PHWE method was more exhaustive. Mean absolute recoveries of 7 spiked labelled APIs were lower for the PHWE method than the Espresso method. Under acid chromatographic conditions mean recoveries were 16% and 24%, respectively, but increased to 24% and 37% under basic conditions. The difference between the PHWE method and the Espresso method might be interpreted as the Espresso method giving higher extraction efficiency; however, TIC scans of extracts revealed a much higher matrix co-extraction for the PHWE method. Attempts were made to correlate occurrence of compounds in sewage sludge with chemical properties of the 23 APIs and there are strong indications that both the number of aromatic rings and the presence of a positive charge is important for the sorption processes to sewage sludge.

AB forcing the industry to consider finding new and sustainable methods of wastewater treatment. The valuable information regarding treatment of the wastewater from the edible oil industry is presented in this research. The obtained results confirm a promising application of the third generation membranes, comprised of ceramic material (aluminium oxide), in treatment of wastewater from the edible oil industry. Positive results regarding chemical oxygen demand reduction and turbidity removal were noticed. Permeate flux values were used for process optimization in order to achieve a cost-effective process. Response surface methodology was used for the experimental design. The effects of wastewater temperature, transmembrane pressure, and feed-flow rate on the microfiltration model fit were studied. The experiments showed that microfiltration of this type of wastewater is a convenient technique for a possible large scale industrial application as a secondary step in treating wastewater from the oilseed processing facilities.

AB This study comprehensively analyzed 23 classes of 51 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the two major prongs of Jiulong River and its estuary in southeast China, where the levels of the targeted PPCPs were mostly unknown. For both Jiulong River and its estuary, nine PPCPs were detected with 100% detection frequencies including two anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs (ketoprofen and diclofenac acid), a stimulant (caffeine), a plasticizer (bisphenol A), two preservatives (methyl paraben and propyl paraben), two antimicrobials (triclosan and triclocarban) and a beta-blocks (metoprolol), among which bisphenol A and caffeine accounted for more than 60% in concentrations. PPCPs generally had higher concentrations in dry season than normal season and wet season, while certain PPCPs, such as UV filters, showed higher concentrations in wet season, which were presumed to be related to their usage patterns. The concentrations of PPCPs were significantly correlated to several quality parameters of the surface water. The selected sewage markers were also used to track sewage in the studied river and the ratios of easily removed markers and conservative markers were used to identify the contribution of raw or treated sewage input. From our result, Jiulong River and its estuary were likely polluted by potential discharge of raw sewage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an attractive solution for wastewater treatment due to their potential capacity to treat wastewater and support native species. These dual purpose CWs, however, can attract wildlife and expose them to aquatic environments high in nutrients and harmful contaminants. Although studies indicate tradeoffs between larval anuran growth and long-term adult survival following development in wastewater, it is unclear what specific mechanism is responsible for these effects. We suggest that behavior could be a mediating process that both responds to the environment and contributes to demography. We evaluated the behavioral responses of Southern Leopard Frog (Lithohates sphenocephalus) tadpoles exposed and reared in pond water versus wastewater treatment CWs to identify if behavior was affected by exposure or development in wastewater and to explore two potential causes of behavioral change: increased turbidity and a common contaminant, diphenhydramine. Specifically, we monitored activity, exploration, and predator avoidance. Tadpoles in wastewater were slower to begin moving, traveled shorter distances, and exhibited the shortest burst distances. We did not observe differences between tadpole origin that indicated exposure to wastewater was sufficient to alter behavior independent of developmental processes. Neither of our potential mechanisms for these effects were sufficient to explain the magnitude of behavioral change in treated wastewater. As wastewater can host unique chemical and physical conditions, including contaminant mixtures, learning more about how behavior responds to specific conditions of wastewater may help identify mechanisms to explain why frogs exhibit changes in behavior, growth, and survival following development in wastewater.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is a typical type of wastewater with high concentrations of organic pollutants, but research on this subject is limited. The aeration tanks of three different pharmaceutical wastewater treatment systems were seeded with the same inocula and stably operated for 40 days. Then, aerobic sludge samples from the three aeration tanks were collected to provide insight into the bacterial community composition of the activated sludges. Additionally, we investigated the effects of wastewater characteristics and the type and operation of the technological system on the microbial communities. High-throughput sequencing analysis demonstrated that the communities enriched in the three reactors had differing. The dominant phyla detected were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and candidate division TM7, while the dominant clones were uncultured Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium, uncultured Saprospiraceae bacterium, PHOS-HE51(AF314433.1), uncultured Anaerolineaceae bacterium and Blastocatella, suggesting their importance in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants. According to the wastewater parameters and canonical correspondence analyses, we can conclude that uncultured Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium, uncultured Anaerolineaceae bacterium and Blastocatella contribute to ammonium nitrogen () removal; uncultured Saprospiraceae bacterium plays an important role in treating nitrogen; and chemical oxygen demand and PHOS-HE51 contribute to total phosphorus removal.

AB Sewage-contaminated rivers are ecosystems deeply disturbed by human activity due to the release of heavy metals, organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals as well as faecal and pathogenic micro-organisms, which coexist with the autochthonous microbial population. In this study, we compared the percentage of resistance in faecal and heterotrophic bacteria in rivers with different degrees of sewage pollution. As a matter of fact, no correlation was found neither between the degree of sewage pollution and the percentage of antimicrobial resistant heterotrophic bacteria nor between the number of resistant faecal bacteria and that of resistant heterotrophic bacteria. Most of the resistant isolates from the Zenne river downstream Brussels were multi-resistant and the resistance patterns were similar among the strains of each phylogenetic group. The total microbial community in this polluted river (as evaluated through a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis) appeared to be dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while the phylum TM7 was the third most represented.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micropollutants at the microgram per litre range. During the present work more than 100 substances were analysed through on-site mass balances over 19 municipal wastewater treatment lines. The most relevant substances according to their occurrence in raw wastewater, in treated wastewater and in sludge were identified, and their fate in wastewater treatment processes was assessed. About half of priority substances of WFD were found at concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g/L in wastewater. For 26 substances, potential non-compliance with Environmental Quality Standard of Water Framework Directive has been identified in treated wastewater, depending on river flow. Main concerns are for Cd, DEHP, diuron, alkylphenols, and chloroform. Emerging substances of particular concern are by-products, organic chemicals (e. g. triclosan, benzothiazole) and pharmaceuticals (e. g. ketoprofen, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine). About 80% of the load of micropollutants was removed by conventional activated sludge plants, but about two-thirds of removed substances were mainly transferred to sludge.

AB In this study, a distinct inoculum was investigated as an isolated variable within sequencing batch reactors via a comparison of the 4-fluoroaniline (4-FA) or 2,4-difluoroaniline (2,4-DFA) removal amounts. The inocula were derived from a treatment plant for treating pharmaceutical wastewater plus a small amount of municipal sewage (PMS), a treatment plant for treating fluoridated hydrocarbon wastewater (FHS), and a treatment plant for treating the comprehensive wastewater in an industrial park (CIS). There were slight differences among the degradation patterns of the 4-FA for the three inocula, whether during the enrichment period or the high concentration shock period. In contrast, it was observed that the degradation efficiency of 2,4-DFA initially varied with the inocula. The FHS-derived inoculum was determined to be optimal, exhibiting the earliest degradation reaction only after an acclimation of 7 days had the highest degradation rate constant of 0.519 h(-1), and had the fastest recovery time of three weeks after high concentration shock. Additionally, compared with the PMS-derived inoculum, the CIS-derived inoculum exhibited an earlier degradation reaction within three weeks, and a higher microbial diversity, but a lower shock resistance and degradation rate constant of 0.257 h(-1). High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that each final consortium was different in composition, and the microbial consortia developed well on the inoculum and substrate. In comparison of the similarity among the three 2,4-DFA enrichment cultures, the higher similarity (63.9-70.0%) among three final consortia enriching with 4-FA was observed. The results indicated that the inoculum played an important role in the degradation of FAs and the microbial bacterial communities of final consortia, and the effect extent might well depend on the fluorinated level of FAs.

AB In this paper, we investigated the occurrence of three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin) and three antiretroviral (lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine) drugs in the Nairobi River Basin, Kenya. The analytical procedure involved extraction using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS). In this study, 40 sites were selected for sampling, including 38 sites along the rivers and 2 wastewater treatment effluent sites. All the studied compounds were detected with sulfamethoxazole having the highest detection frequency of 97.5% and ciprofloxacin had the lowest at 60%. The results showed that the concentration of the drugs increased in highly populated regions especially within the informal settlements. The maximum (median) concentrations in the river waters for sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine in ng/L were 13,800 (1800), 2650 (327), 509 (129), 5430 (1000), 4860 (769), and 7680 (660), respectively. The maximum concentrations in the river waters were generally higher than those of the wastewater treatment plant effluents signifying that the rivers are substantially contaminated by domestic wastewater. The environmental risk was evaluated by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) for algae, daphnia and fish based on the maximum and median concentrations of the analytes in the river basin and was expressed as the ratios of measured environmental concentrations (MEC) to predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). The RQs ranged from 0 to 507.8 and apart from lamivudine that had a low RQ all the other analytes had RQ > 1 at maximum and median measured concentrations for at least one taxonomic group. The high RQs are indicative of possible adverse ecological effects and calls for corrective and mitigation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting the input loads of antibiotics to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) using certain input data (e.g. prescriptions) is a reasonable method if no analytical data is available. Besides the spatiotemporal uncertainties of the projection itself, only a few studies exist to confirm the suitability of required excretion data from literature. Prescription data with a comparatively high resolution and a sampling campaign covering 15 months were used to answer the question of applicability of the prediction approach. As a result, macrolides, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were almost fully recovered close to 100% of the expected input loads. Nearly all substances of the beta-lactam family exhibit high elimination rates during the wastewater transport in the sewer system with a low recovery rate at the WWTP. The measured input loads of cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin fluctuated greatly through the year which was not obvious from relatively constant prescribed amounts. The latter substances are an example that available data are not per se sufficient to monitor the actual release into the environment. Furthermore, the extensive data pool of this study was used to calculate the necessary number of samples to determine a representative annual mean load to the WWTP. For antibiotics with low seasonality and low input scattering a minimum of about 10 samples is required. In the case of antibiotics exhibiting fluctuating input loads 30 to 40 evenly distributed samples are necessary for a representative input determination. As a high level estimate, a minimum number of 20-40 samples per year is proposed to reasonably estimate a representative annual input load of antibiotics and other micropollutants.

AB Urban wastewaters (WW) are a major vector of many emerging pollutants (EPs) to aquatic ecosystems, as urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to abate them. New methods are now critically necessary for a more comprehensive analysis of WW samples and for the assessment of the WWTP efficiency in EP removal. To this end, the present study aims to develop a methodology to identify and quantify EPs, especially pharmaceutical residues and pesticides, in the raw and treated wastewater of 10 heterogeneous WWTPs in a highly urbanized territory in France over three sampling campaigns, through the following steps: (1) development and implementation of a suspect screening of EPs in WW samples, based on a solid phase extraction followed by an LC-QToF-MS analysis; (2) confirmation of their identification by reinjection of WW samples spiked with authentic analytical standards; (3) quantification of previously identified compounds by targeted LC-QToF-MS analysis in raw and treated effluents and assessment of their removal efficiency by WWTPs. Forty-one EPs, including 37 pharmaceutical residues (such as anti-depressive, anti-hypertensive, or antipsychotic drugs) and 4 pesticides, were identified by suspect screening. Some of them (e.g. milnacipran) are reported for the first time in urban WWTPs in this study. High variability in detection frequency and concentrations were observed in function of the EP and WWTP. Nevertheless, median removal rates were considered negative or low for more than 50% of the EPs (respectively 4 and 17), leading to a quantification of significant concentrations in treated WW. Their release into receiving streams may thus lead to ecotoxicological risks that should be evaluated in order to prevent any degradation of the exposed ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wastewater treatment plants do not eliminate micropollutants completely and are thus important point sources for these substances. Ozonation and activated carbon treatment might be beneficial for ecosystem health as these techniques provide effective barriers to organic contaminants. However, a toxicity evaluation is required to investigate toxicity reduction and to assess the potential formation of toxic oxidation byproducts during ozonation.
   Therefore a comparative toxicity evaluation of different treated wastewater effluents was performed on site at a half scale treatment plant equipped with an ozonation step and an activated carbon treatment step in parallel subsequent to conventional activated sludge treatment. For this purpose four invertebrate and one higher plant toxicity test were selected to assess potential biological effects on whole organisms.
   The reproduction test with the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum exhibited a decreased reproductive output after advanced treatment compared to conventional treatment. This indicates an effective estrogenicity removal by ozonation and activated carbon treatment and is confirmed by results of the yeast estrogen screen with a reduction of in vitro estrogenic activity by >75%. The Lumbriculus variegatus test revealed a significantly enhanced toxicity after ozonation compared to conventional treatment whereas this effect was reduced following subsequent sand filtration. When ozonation was applied, a significantly increased genotoxicity was observed, detected with the comet assay using haemolymph of the zebra mussel. Again, this effect was removed by subsequent sand filtration to the level of conventional treatment. Activated carbon treatment even resulted in a significant reduction of genotoxicity.
   Adverse effects after the ozone reactor are possibly a result of the formation of toxic oxidation byproducts. Biologically active sand filtration obviously is an effective barrier to such compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Plastisphere; Pharmaceuticals; Adsorption; Antibiotic resistance genes;

AB Microplastics (MPs) and pharmaceuticals are common emerging pollutants in sewage, and their coexistence may have more negative effects on the environments. This study chose tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP) and tridosan (TCS) to investigate the responses of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities on different MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)) biofilms (plastisphere). The adsorption capacity of three pharmaceuticals on PVC and PE decreased in the order of AMP > IC > TCS. PE was more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. MPs led to the increase of the total copies of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the sewage. Importantly, multidrug ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of IC and MPs led to higher risks of spreading ARGs and MGEs. In addition, potential pathogenic bacteria Legionella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria and Arcobacter were more abundant on plastisphere than those in sewage, and these bacteria might be the hosts for ARGs and MGEs. This study showed that plastisphere could be repositories of ARGs and MGEs in sewage and accumulated potential pathogenic bacteria. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycyclic musk compounds (PMC) are used as fragrances in cosmetics and detergents and enter rivers via domestic wastewater and sewage treatment plants. Soils can be contaminated by PMC through application of sewage sludge. Accumulation of PMC occurs in sediments and biota due to their persistence and lipophilicity. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of special relevance for their transport and behavior in the environment as it acts as solubilizer and carrier in aquatic and terrestrial systems. With the distribution coefficient K-DOC, one can predict their affinity to DOM. Different approaches exist to determine K-DOC, resulting in a range of coefficients for a number of organic pollutants. The objective of this study was to determine K-DOC values for PMC using solid-phase microextraction (SPME).
   A method to determine K-DOC was customized and applied to five PMC. Sorption was analyzed using different concentrations of humic acid (HA) solutions and headspace SPME coupled with GC/MS/MS. HA represented DOM. Regarding sorption in soils, sediments, and sewage sludge, a large concentration range of HA solutions up to 660 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was chosen. Simultaneous determination of all components in a mixture was compared to experiments with single compounds. The method was matched using pyrene.
   Determined log K-DOC values were between 3.32 and 3.67. Compared to experiments with single compounds, determination of the components in a mixture showed no significant difference. Verification experiments with pyrene revealed a close match between K-DOC determined in the current study and K-DOC literature data. K-DOC values of most economical and environmental important PMC 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyrane (HHCB) and 1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-ethanone (AHTN) are comparable to but slightly lower than K-OC values recently published. The greater K-DOC for AHTN compared to the one of HHCB corresponds to greater amounts found in sediments. The large range in HA concentrations, allows for an assessment of PMC partitioning behavior in sewage treatment plants and soils contaminated with PMC.
   This method is applicable for semi-volatile substances. Since compounds have varying characteristics, this method has to be verified regarding specific parameters particularly kinetics. Suitability of this method should be tested for relevant PMC metabolites and to determine K-DOC with natural organic matter from soils, rivers, sediments, and sewage sludge. This adapted method can be used to establish K-DOC values for a variety of substances in a short amount of time and is applicable to environmental fate modeling and registration of chemicals.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is considered as an effective tool for monitoring drug consumption, which is often obtained by back-calculation using the influent concentration and other parameters of wastewater treatment plants. Lack of information on the transformation of drugs in municipal wastewater and sewers may lead to inaccurate consumption estimation. Fourteen prescription drugs in four major categories of diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, depression, and asthma) were selected to study their adsorption and biodegradation in wastewater and biofilm sewers under different temperatures, pH and biofilms conditions. The result demonstrated that the decay percentage of drugs in wastewater is increased with temperature. Within 72 h, eleven of these 14 drugs, such as metformin, metoprolol, bezafibrate, etc., have decay percentages below 20% in wastewater, which are considered as stable drugs; and the decay percentages of the other three, monluster, paroxetine, and sertraline, are greater than 20%, which are the most unstable drugs. In lab-scale aerobic and anaerobic sewers, the decay percentages of metformin, glipizide, metoprolol, gemfibrozil, and atorvastatin are less than 20% within 24 h. The decay percentages of venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, salmeterol, and salbutamol within 24 h are 20%-60% and paroxetine and sertraline are close to or even exceed 80% within 6 h. Biodegradation of drugs in sewers with aerobic or anaerobic biofilms is higher than that in wastewater systems without biofilms. The results showed that when the per capita consumption of drugs is estimated by using the WBE method, the stability of drugs in wastewater and different types of sewers will significantly affect their residual concentrations.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds, such as antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants, S-blocker, etc. have emerged as new classes of water pollutants due to their potential or proven adverse effects on human health and the aquatic environment. This paper aims to systematically review the current data available on the global occurrence and removal of 43 pharmaceutical compounds in municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs) in the period from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, this work intends to assess the global daily mass load and emissions of pharmaceuticals in different regions. Nevertheless, the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals in the final effluents of M-WWTPs was also evaluated. Lastly, the guidelines and regulations concerning the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment were summarized and discussed. The findings highlighted that there is significant variation in the concentrations of pharmaceuticals between different regions. Meanwhile, the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the influents of Asian region tend to be higher than those in other monitored regions. In this respect, the highest average daily mass loads were observed for acetaminophen (473 g/1000 in./day) and atenolol (592 g/1000 in./day), while amoxicillin (944 g/day), sulfamethoxazole (688.38 g/day) recorded the highest daily emissions. The environmental risk assessment based on the risk quotient (RO) showed that twelve of the monitored pharmaceuticals pose a high potential risk to the aquatic ecosystems. The emphasized guidelines and regulations laid focus on the measures that can be used to mitigate the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Research needs and future recommendations are also identified and proposed.

AB The occurrence of 25 drug target residues (illicit drugs or pharmaceutically active compounds) was investigated during 85 consecutive days in the influents of a wastewater treatment plant in the Region Centre-Val de Loire, France. This long tracking period allowed a better understanding of the patterns affecting the occurrence of this type of contaminants. Among them, 2 were never detected (i.e. heroin and amphetamine). Concerning illicit drugs two patterns were found. Cocaine and ecstasy median loads varied considerably between weekdays and weekend days (i.e. 18.3 and 35.9% respectively) whereas cannabis and heroin (based on 6-mono-acetylmorphine loads) loads were within the same order of magnitude with a significant statistical correlation with pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen or ketoprofen.
   The consumption of selected drugs was back-calculated from the loads. Among illicit drugs the highest consumption was found for cannabis with a median consumption of 51mg . day(-1) . inhabitant(-1) (inh) whereas the median consumption for cocaine (based on benzoylecgonine loads) and ecstasy was 32 and 6 mg . day(-1) . 10(3) . inh(-1) respectively.
   The highest consumption values of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) were found for acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acidwith 108.8 and 34.1 mg . day(-1) . inh(-1) respectively, in good agreementwith national sales data. A statistically significant weekly pattern was found for several PACs such as metoprolol and trimethoprim, but with the opposite pattern to that of illicit drugs. The variations in daily PAC loads could provide information about themobility of people in the catchment, especially on the basis of daily taken PACs (i.e. to treat chronicle diseases).

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarbon (TCC) are bactericides used in various consumer and personal-care products. Recent studies have revealed considerable levels of these bactericides in wastewater, aquatic wildlife, and human samples. Consequently, in this study we measured TCS and TCC in influent and effluent, sludge, and pond water/sediment samples from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and three major rivers in Savannah, Georgia (USA). Among these treatment plants, the Wilshire plant showed elevated concentrations of TCS (influent, 86,161; effluent, 5370 ng/L), whereas TCC was greater in the Georgetown plant (influent, 36,221) and the Wilshire plant effluent (3045 ng/L). Clearance of TCS and TCC were 95 and 92%, respectively, in the President Street plant, 94 and 85%, respectively, in the Wilshire plant, 99 and 80%, respectively, in the Travis Field plant, and 99 and 99%, respectively, in the Georgetown plant. Based on the mass flow estimate, 138 g/day of TCS and 214 g/day TCC are released into the Savannah River from the President Street, Travis Field, and Wilshire plants and 1.60 g/day TCS and 1.64 g/day TCC are released to the Ogeechee River from the Georgetown plant. Based on the sludge data, the loading estimate can be calculated that 32 and 0.004 g/day TCS and 53 and 0.01 g/day TCC (nonincinerated and incinerated, respectively) are deposited in landfill from the President Street plant alone, whereas 4.6, 26, and 6.8 g/day TCS and 3.8, 23, and 5.9 g/day TCC (wet sludge) were produced and dumped in landfill from the rest of the WWTPs. Incineration of wet sludge can eliminate 99.99% of TCS and TCC. Concentrations of TCS and TCC in water and sediment were greater in the Vernon River, followed by the Savannah River and the Ogeechee River.

AB Background: Estrogenic steroids such as estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are among the most potent endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Compared with North America, Europe and Japan there is no reliable information on the concentration of steroid hormones in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) influents and effluents in Iran. The aim of the present study was to determine the amounts of E1, E2, E3, and EE2 influents and effluents of 7 municipal WWTPs across Tehran, the capital city of Iran, in two seasons, summer and autumn, through solid-phase extraction (SPE) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   Results: The results showed that the concentrations of E1, E2, and EE2 in influents ranged from 6.54-18.76 ng/L, 1.02-8 ng/L and 4.18-11.76 ng/L, respectively. Also, the concentrations of E1, E2, and EE2 in effluents ranged from 1.04-4.99 ng/L, 0.5-2.20 ng/L and 0.5-2.58 ng/L, respectively. The levels of E3 were below the detection limit (0.5 ng/L). The percentage removal rate of E1, E2 and EE2 ranged between 61.76-87.25%, 50.98-82.63%, and 66.3-90.25%, respectively. Results indicated no significant correlation between hormone concentrations and seasons.
   Conclusions: The study showed that WWTP number 7 had significant differences in influent hormone concentrations compared with others. Results only showed a significant relationship between hormones and TSS removal rate, but there was no significant relationship between hormones and COD removal rate. The removal rate of hormone in WWTP number 4 and 7 were significantly different from the others. There was no significant correlation between hormone concentrations and seasons.

AB Organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) were measured in samples collected from monitoring wells located along a 4.5-km transect of a plume of groundwater contaminated by 60 years of continuous rapid infiltration disposal of wastewater treatment plant effluent. Fifteen percent of the 212 OWCs analyzed were detected, including the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SX), the nonionic surfactant degradation product 4-nonylphenol (SX), the solvent tetrachloroethene (PCE), and the disinfectant 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Comparison of the 2005 sampling results to data collected from the same wells in 1985 indicates that PCE and DCB are transported more rapidly in the aquifer than NP, consistent with predictions based on compound hydrophobicity. Natural gradient in situ tracer experiments were conducted to evaluate the subsurface behavior of SX, NP, and the female sex hormone 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in two oxic zones in the aquifer. (1) a downgradient transition zone at the interface between the contamination plume and the overlying uncontaminated. groundwater and (2) a contaminated zone located beneath the infiltration beds, which have not been loaded for 10 years. In both zones, breakthrough curves for the conservative tracer bromide (Br-) and SX were nearly coincident whereas NP and E2 were retarded relative to Br- and showed mass loss. Retardation was greater in the contaminated zone than in the transition zone. Attenuation of NP and E2 in the aquifer was attributed to biotransformation, and oxic laboratory microcosm experiments using sediments from the transition and contaminated zones show that uniform-ring-labeled C-14 4-normal-NP was biodegraded more rapidly (30-60% recovered as (CO2)-C-14 in 13 days) than 4-C-14 E2 (20-90% recovered as (CO2)-C-14 in 54 days). There was little difference in mineralization potential between sites.

AB Herein, a method for the simultaneous determination of the currently prescribed sartan drugs (eprosartan, EPR; olmesartan, OLM; losartan, LOS; candesartan, CAN; telmisartan, TEL; irbesartan, IRB; and valsartan, VAL), and the biodegradation product valsartan acid (VALA), in water samples (raw and treated wastewater, river and tap water) was developed. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed as concentration and determination techniques, respectively. Different sorbents and elution solvents were tested for sample preparation. Under optimized conditions, samples at neutral pH (6-8 units) were concentrated using mixed-mode (reversed-phase and anionic exchange) cartridges. Thereafter, the sorbent was washed with 5 mL of a methanol: water (1:1) solution, dried under a nitrogen stream and compounds were eluted with 2 mL of methanol: NH3 (98:2). The accuracy of the method (accounting for SPE efficiency and matrix effects during electrospray ionization) was investigated using solvent-based calibration standards. Global recoveries, obtained for different water matrices (tap, river, treated and raw wastewater), ranged from 82% to 134%, with standard deviations between 2 and 18%. LOQs varied from 2 to 50 ng L-1. Analysis of un-spiked samples confirmed: (1) the incomplete removal of sartans at sewage treatment plants (STPs), (2) the formation of VALA during municipal water treatment, and (3) the presence of VALA in the processed tap water samples. Additional findings of the current study are the detection of hydroxylated derivatives of the sartan drugs IRB and LOS in wastewater, and the E-Z isomerization of EPR in environmental water samples.

TI Groundwater problems caused by irrigation with sewage effluent
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English

ID CHEMICALS
AB Increasingly, sewage effluent will be used for urban and agricultural irrigation, The main concern is the potential for infectious diseases in farm workers and city dwellers exposed to the effluent, as well as in people who consume crops irrigated with effluent, especially when those crops are eaten ran; or brought raw into the kitchen. Prevention requires adequate disinfection of the effluent. The effluent also must meet normal irrigation water requirements for parameters such as salt content, sodium adsorption ratio, trace elements, and so forth, Unfortunately, little or no attention is paid to long-term effects of sewage irrigation on underlying groundwater. Since most of the water applied for irrigation in dry climates evaporates, the concentrations of non-biodegradable chemicals in the drainage or deep-percolation water going down to the groundwater can be much higher than in the effluent itself (about five times higher for an irrigation efficiency of 80 percent), These chemicals comprise not only the salts, nitrates, and possible pesticide residues normally expected in irrigated agriculture, but also "sewage chemicals" like synthetic organic compounds, disinfection by-products, pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutically active chemicals Like endocrine disrupters, and fulvic and humic acids,These acids are known precursors of disinfection by-products that are formed when the drainage water ends up in drinking-mater supplies that are then chlorinated, Thus, groundwater below sewage-irrigated areas eventually may become unfit for drinking, which raises questions of liability, More research on long term effects of sewage irrigation on groundwater is urgently needed.

AB Efficient biological nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical wastewater has been focused recently. The present study dealt with the treatment of colistin sulfate and kitasamycin manufacturing wastewater through anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX). The biotoxicity assay on luminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum (T3 mutation) showed that the pharmaceutical wastewater imparted severe toxicity with a relative luminosity of 3.46% +/- 0.45%. During long-term operation, the cumulative toxicity from toxic pollutants in wastewater resulted in the performance collapse of conventional ANAMMOX process. A novel ANAMMOX process with sequential biocatalyst (ANAMMOX granules) addition (SBA-ANAMMOX process) was developed by combining high-rate ANAMMOX reactor with sequential biocatalyst addition (SBA). At biocatalyst addition rate of 0.025 g VSS (L wastewater)(-1) day(-1), the nitrogen removal rate of the process reached up to 9.4 kg N m(-3) day(-1) in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The effluent ammonium concentration was lower than 50 mg N L-1, which met the Discharge Standard of Water Pollutants for Pharmaceutical Industry in China (GB 21903-2008). The application of SBA-ANAMMOX process in refractory ammonium-rich wastewater is promising. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A total of 58 samples were collected from hospitals, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a receiving water body (Dagu Drainage Canal, DDC), and adjacent farmland in Tianjin City, China, in May and November 2013 and were analyzed for five common beta-blockers (atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol, and nadolol) to elucidate their source, occurrence and fate in a typical city in China. The profiles of the enantiomers of the beta-blockers in some samples were examined. Sotalol, metoprolol and propranolol were frequently detected, atenolol was less frequently detected, and nadolol was mostly not detected. Generally, the concentrations in hospital waste waters occurred from <LOQto 10 mu g/ L, while concentrations inmunicipal WWTP water samples ranged from <LOQ to 5.2 mu g/ L. Hence, both hospitals and WWTPs acted as sources of beta-blockers in the environment. Sotalol, metoprolol and propranolol were determined in soils adjacent to the DDC with concentrations up to hundreds of ng/kg in the topsoil and declining levels in the subsoil. Seasonal variation was observed with samples obtained in May showing higher concentrations, both in the canal and the adjacent soil, which could be ascribed to greater consumption of these drugs, lower temperature and less precipitation in the spring and the former winter. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of metoprolol and propranolol in soil samples showed a trend of enrichment of E1 (first-eluted) compared to E2 (second-eluted), while sotalol was almost racemic. In the DDC, no significant difference was found for the pair enantiomers of each beta-blocker, while in hospital and WWTP wastewaters, E1 predominated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quality of drinking and recreational water is currently (2005) determined using indicator bacteria. However, the culture tests used to analyze for these bacteria require a long time to complete and do not discriminate between human and animal fecal material sources. One complementary approach is to use chemicals found in human wastewater, which would have the advantages of (1) potentially shorter analysis times than the bacterial culture tests and (2) being selected for human-source specificity. At 10 locations, water samples were collected upstream and at two successive points downstream from a wastewaster treatment plant (WWTP); a treated effluent sample was also collected at each WWTP. This sampling plan was used to determine the persistence of a chemically diverse suite of emerging contaminants in streams. Samples were also collected at two reference locations assumed to have minimal human impacts. Of the 110 chemical analytes investigated in this project, 78 were detected at least once. The number of compounds in a given sample ranged from 3 at a reference location to 50 in a WWTP effluent sample. The total analyte load at each location varied from 0.018 mu g/L at the reference location to 97.7 mu g/L in a separate WWTP effluent sample. Although most of the compound concentrations were in the range of 0.01-1.0 mu g/ L, in some samples, individual concentrations were in the range of 5-38 mu g/L. The concentrations of the majority of the chemicals present in the samples generally followed the expected trend: they were either nonexistent or at trace levels in the upstream samples, had their maximum concentrations in the WWTP effluent samples, and then declined in the two downstream samples. This research suggests that selected chemicals are useful as tracers of human wastewater discharge.

AB Discharging drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) to sewers could be an efficient waste management strategy with the potential to replace chemical dosing for pollutant control. This study for the first time investigated the fate of 28 different organic micropollutants (MPs) due to the dosing of iron-rich and aluminum-rich DWTS in a pilot rising main sewer. Nine MPs had an initial rapid removal within 1-hr (i.e., 10-80%) due to Fe-DWTS dosing. The formation of FeS particles due to Fe-DWTS dosing was responsible for the removal of dissolved sulfides (80% reduction comparing to control sewer). Further particle characterization using SEM-EDS, XRD and ATR-FTIR confirmed that FeS particles formation played an important role in the removal of MPs from wastewater. Adsorption of MPs onto the FeS particles was likely the possible mechanism for their rapid removal. In comparison to iron-rich DWTS, aluminum-rich DWTS had very limited beneficial effects in removing MPs from wastewater. The degradability of degradable MPs, including caffeine, paraxanthine, paracetamol, metformin, cyclamate, cephalexin, and MIAA were not affected by the DWTS dosing. Some non-degradable MPs, including cotinine, hydroxycotinine, tramadol, gabapentin, desvenlafaxine, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, fluconazole, sulfamethoxazole, acesulfame, saccharin and sucralose were also not impacted by the DWTS dosing. This study systematically assessed the additional benefits of discharging Fe-DWTS to the sewer network i.e., the removal of MPs from the liquid phase thereby reducing its load to the treatment plant. The results corroborate the discharge of Fe-rich DWTS in sewers as an effective and beneficial way of managing the waste by-product. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was applied for the determination of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen as well as eight of their known human metabolites in wastewater samples. Extraction time and addition of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) to the liquid membrane were evaluated resulting in a method with an optimal extraction time of 5 h and 5% (w/V) TOPO addition to the membrane liquid (di-n-hexyl ether). With the optimized method, enrichment factors ranged between 778 and 4830. The method was applied for analysis of samples collected from Kallby wastewater treatment plant in the city of Lund, Sweden. Samples were collected from the influent, water entering as well as exiting the conventional activated sludge treatment and the effluent to study the behaviour of these compounds during the treatment process. All twelve substances were found in the influent and for all four drugs, higher concentrations were detected of the metabolites than the parent compounds. Highest concentrations were detected of o-desmethylnaproxen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen (average influent concentrations of 45,35 and 63 mu g/L respectively). The study showed only partial removal during the primary treatment whereas both parent compounds and metabolites were efficiently removed during the activated sludge process. In the effluent all analytes were detected in concentrations below 1 mu g/L thus showing that either the investigated metabolites do not belong to the NSAID transformation products formed during the activated sludge treatment or they are also quickly further transformed within the treatment.

AB The stability of lamotrigine (LMG) and its principal human metabolite, lamotrigine N2-glucuronide (LMG-N2-G), was studied as a function of pH (4-9). While LMG was stable across the entire pH range, under neutral-basic conditions, LMG-N2-G was converted to three transformation products (TPs) which were identified using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The MS fragmentation studies indicated that two TPs were the result of the hydrolysis of the amidine and guanidine moieties. The third TP detected was an intermediate in the guanidine hydrolysis reaction. In order to evaluate the transformation kinetics of the LMG-N2-G degradation, another set of pH-dependent experiments was carried out in hospital effluent, wastewater influent and effluent spiked at 20 and 200 nM after pH adjustment (pH 6.5, 7, 8, 8.5 and 9), demonstrating that, at higher pH, LMG-N2-G is degraded at higher rate. Later, the pH-dependent stability of related compounds with different nitrogen N2-substituents (N2-R) on the 1,2,4-triazine ring was studied. This revealed that because of different imino tautomer equilibrium LMG (N2-H) and LMG-N2-oxide ((+)N2-O-) were stable at all pHs but N2-methyl-LMG (N2-CH3) as well as LMG-N2-G were susceptible to amidine and guanidine hydrolysis at basic pH. Finally, hospital effluent samples collected over the course of one week were monitored for their presence. LMG, LMG-N2-G and two of its TPs were detected with concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 1 mu gL(-1). (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of process models to simulate the fate of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants is constantly growing. However, due to the high workload and cost of measuring campaigns, many simulation studies lack sufficiently long time series representing realistic wastewater influent dynamics. In this paper, the feasibility of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) influent generator is tested to create realistic dynamic influent (micro) pollutant disturbance scenarios. The presented set of models is adjusted to describe the occurrence of three pharmaceutical compounds and one of each of its metabolites with samples taken every 2-4 h: the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBU), the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the psychoactive carbamazepine (CMZ). Information about type of excretion and total consumption rates forms the basis for creating the data-defined profiles used to generate the dynamic time series. In addition, the traditional influent characteristics such as flow rate, ammonium, particulate chemical oxygen demand and temperature are also modelled using the same framework with high frequency data. The calibration is performed semi-automatically with two different methods depending on data availability. The 'traditional' variables are calibrated with the Bootstrap method while the pharmaceutical loads are estimated with a least squares approach. The simulation results demonstrate that the BSM2 influent generator can describe the dynamics of both traditional variables and pharmaceuticals. Lastly, the study is complemented with: 1) the generation of longer time series for IBU following the same catchment principles; 2) the study of the impact of in-sewer SMX biotransformation when estimating the average daily load; and, 3) a critical discussion of the results, and the future opportunities of the presented approach balancing model structure/calibration procedure complexity versus predictive capabilities.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed to have physiological effects on target organisms. Their presence and effect in aquatic ecosystems in the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia is relatively unknown. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are continually introduced to aquatic ecosystems through treated sewage effluent outflows into rivers and other bodies of water. Fouracidic and two neutral pharmaceuticals were monitored in the effluents from nine sewage treatment plants in the Annapolis Valley and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in Nova Scotia. Naproxen and ibuprofen, two highly used OTC drugs, were the most prominent and were detected at high ng/L to low mu g/L levels. Caffeine, salicylic acid (a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid) and cotinine were detected in the ng/L range. Warfarin was not detected above the detection limits. The urban sewage treatment plant in Mill Cove, HRM showed much higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals than rural facilities in the Annapolis Valley, despite the fact that more advanced facilities are used at the urban plant. Receiving waters both downstream and upstream from STP effluent outfalls were also studied, and trace levels of caffeine at several sites indicate some degree of pollution propagation into surrounding aquatic ecosystems.

DE Activated sludge inhibition; Biodegradability; Ciprofloxacin; Ozonation;
   Substrate removal kinetics
AB The main objective of this reported research is to develop an efficient treatment method for pharmaceutical wastewater by combining ozonation and biological treatment. The antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) was used to prepare synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater. The effect of ozonation on wastewater was assessed by antibacterial activity and biodegradability index. The inhibitory effect of raw and ozone pre-treated wastewater on biomass oxygen uptake was examined and compared with that of biodegradable non-inhibitory compound (sodium acetate). The raw and ozone pre-treated wastewater were used in batch bioreactor experiments. It was found that the pre-treatment by ozone increased the biodegradability index from 0.13 to 0.32 and reduced the antibacterial activity of wastewater. The activated sludge inhibition test showed that a total of 77% and 46% inhibition in raw wastewater and ozone pre-treated wastewater, respectively. This result were corroborated by the substrate removal kinetic models, that the ozone-treated wastewater has more biodegradable compounds through the enhanced biomass growth in the batch bioreactor. The combined ozonation and biological treatment removed 82.5% of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), whereas 38% of COD was removed in biological treatment alone. The two-step treatment (ozonation and biological) process was applied to real pharmaceutical wastewater and the treatment efficiency was evaluated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conceptual sewer models are useful tools to assess the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in integrated wastewater systems. However, the definition of their model structure is highly subjective, and obtaining a realistic simulation of the in-sewer hydraulic retention time (HRT) is a major challenge without detailed hydrodynamic information or with limited measurements from the sewer network. This study presents an objective approach for defining the structure of conceptual sewer models in view of modelling MP fate in large urban catchments. The proposed approach relies on GIS-based information and a Gaussian mixture model to identify the model optimal structure, providing a multi-catchment conceptual model that accounts for HRT variability across urban catchment. This approach was tested in a catchment located in a highly urbanized Italian city and it was compared against a traditional single-catchment conceptual model (using a single average HRT) for the fate assessment of reactive MPs. Results showed that the multi-catchment model allows for a successful simulation of dry weather flow patterns and for an improved simulation of MP fate compared to the classical single-catchment model. Specifically, results suggested that a multi-catchment model should be preferred for (i) degradable MPs with half-life lower than the average HRT of the catchment and (ii) MPs undergoing formation from other compounds (e.g. human metabolites); or (iii) assessing MP loads entering the wastewater treatment plant from point sources, depending on their location in the catchment. Overall, the proposed approach is expected to ease the building of conceptual sewer models, allowing to properly account for HRT distribution and consequently improving MP fate estimation.

AB Cabamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic pharmaceutical compound, is a pollutant of aquatic ecosystems entering via wastewater treatment plants that is considered to be persistent to degradation. An isotope exchange technique was employed using radiolabelled CBZ as a model compound, to determine the amount of isotopic exchangeability of CBZ in river sediment. The amount of isotopically exchangeable CBZ was used as an estimate of the extent of desorption hysteresis in solution from river sediment, including a treatment where the sediment was amended with black carbon. The isotopically exchangeable CBZ was measured by equilibrating C-12-CBZ with sediment for 0 to 28 days followed by a 24 hour equilibration with C-14-CBZ at the end of the incubation period. The isotopically exchangeable fraction of CBZ decreased over time in the sediment, particularly following amendment with black carbon. This has important implications for the fate of CBZ, which, apart from being resistant to degradation, is constantly released into aquatic ecosystems from wastewater treatment plants. This study demonstrates the availability of a relatively quick and simple alternative to batch desorption techniques for the assessment of the available fraction of organic compounds in sediments following their release into aquatic ecosystems.

AB In the rapidly urbanizing watersheds and estuaries flowing to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, USA, instream flows are increasingly influenced by point source and nonpoint source discharges. Spatial and temporal tidal influences on water quality, especially for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), is poorly understood in estuaries and coastal systems. We selected Dickinson Bayou, an urban estuary in Galveston County, Texas, for study because it has historically impaired water quality, receives point source discharge from one major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), while also being influenced by high densities of onsite sewage facilities upstream in the watershed. We explored the occurrence and potential hazards of aquatic contaminants, including nutrients, indicator bacteria for pathogens, and CECs, in relation to this point source discharge, across seasons and at high and low tides. Aquatic contaminants and associated hazards varied significantly in relation to the WWTP discharge, and were influenced by onsite systems. In fact, spatiotemporal water quality varied by class of contaminants (e.g., nutrients, indicator bacteria, CECs), which indicates that traditional surface water monitoring activities should account for such environmental complexity. This study provides a diagnostic approach for future studies of emerging water quality challenges across gradients of rapidly urbanizing coastal bays and estuaries. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB TCAs are known to be toxicants and endocrine disrupting agents. Generally, after being used, TCAs are passed through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to be treated. However, still trace amounts (ng/L to mu g/L) of TCAs have been founded even in the treated water. Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the environmental behaviors of TCAs in the sewage water from WWTPs (Jeonju, Korea). For the experiments, seven TCAs (amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, and doxepin) were selected. Hydrolysibility, biodegradability, and adsorbability of the selected seven TCAs were evaluated. Based on the results, it was concluded that TCAs are not readily hydrolyzed in water and also not biodegraded by aerobic sludge. The 60% to 85% of TCAs were adsorbed immediately onto the activated sludge within 1 s via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It was clearly observed that adsorption affinities were dependent on the types of activated sludge (i.e. anaerobic and aerobic sludge). The affinities of aerobic and anaerobic sludge towards the TCAs at trace concentrations e.g., 1 to 10 mu g/L, were estimated to be in the range from 0.021 +/- 0.000 to 0.087 +/- 0.000 L/mu g and from 0.001 +/- 0.000 to 0.108 +/- 0.001 L/mu g, respectively.

AB Ruthenium-based catalysts were prepared by a saturation-dip method. Their catalytic activity was evaluated by a catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) process. The ruthenium-based catalysts were used to purify organic pharmaceutical wastewater with high concentration pyridine and pyridine derivatives that have high chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the CWO process, organic pharmaceutical wastewater was continuously pumped into fixed-bed reactors filled with Ru-based catalysts, while the organic components in wastewater were catalytically degraded by oxygen at high temperatures and pressures (temperature, 170-300 degrees C; pressure, 1.0-10 MPa). The experimental results showed that the prepared catalysts could effectively purify pharmaceutical wastewater with high concentration organic components, which are difficult to degrade biochemically, and that the removal rates of both COD and total nitrogen were over 99%.

AB Incomplete removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) has been reported for conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Microalgae-based treatment has recently gained interest thanks to simultaneous removal capacity of organic and inorganic compounds and potentially CECs. In this study, a lab-scale monoculture of Chlorella vulgaris and mixed micmalgal-bacterial culture were compared in terms of removal of 28 CECs (bisphenols, 2018 EU Watch List substances, including neonicotinoids, pharmaceuticals, selected transformation products). The removal pathways in light and dark abiotic controls were also studied. Batch photobioreactors were run at hydraulic retention times of 11-12 days and CECs spiked at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-20 mu g L-1). The mixed culture was better at removing bisphenols, compared to C. vulgaris. Bisphenols' log K-ow was significant in removal pathways, where bisphenols with high log K-ow were removed abiotically while bisphenols with low log K-ow were mainly biodegraded. The removal degrees and the pathways of pharmaceuticals and EU Watch List substances were comparable between both cultures, showing no impact of log K-ow for most compounds; however, the removal with C. vulgaris was faster for some. High log K-ow was associated with high removal of estradiol in abiotic controls, showing the importance of adsorption onto biomass and suspended matter.

AB Antibiotics and pharmaceuticals related products are used to enhance public health and quality of life. The wastewater that is produced from pharmaceutical industries still contains noticeable amount of antibiotics, and this has remained one of the major environmental problems facing public health. The conventional wastewater remediation approach employed by the pharmaceutical industries for the antibiotics wastewater removal is unable to remove the antibiotics completely. Besides, municipal and livestock wastewater also contain unmetabolized antibiotics released by human and animal, respectively. The antibiotic found in wastewater leads to antibiotic resistance challenges, also emergence of superbugs. Currently, numerous technological approaches have been developed to remove antibiotics from the wastewater. Therefore, it was imperative to critically review the weakness and strength of these current advanced technological approaches in use. Besides, the conventional methods for removal of antibiotics such as Klavaroti et al., Homem and Santos also discussed. Although, membrane treatment is discovered as the ultimate choice of approach, to completely remove the antibiotics, while the filtered antibiotics are still retained on the membrane. This study found, hybrid processes to be the best solution antibiotics removal from wastewater. Nevertheless, real-time monitoring system is also recommended to ascertain that, wastewater is cleared of antibiotics.

AB The influence of industrial (pharmaceutical and chemical) wastewater composition on membrane bioreactor (MBR) performance was investigated in a pilot-scale installation. The study focussed on nitrification performance, which was evaluated based on influent and effluent parameters as well as batch nitrification rate tests. The industrial wastewater was pumped into the MBR in a mixture with municipal wastewater at constant flow rate. The loading of the MBR with industrial wastewater was increased stepwise from 0 to 75% share in the mixed influent to study the adaptation of nitrifying bacteria.
   Stable nitrification performance was observed until the content of industrial wastewater in the influent reached 40%, with effluent values of around 0.56 mg L-1 NH4-N and 98.3% ammonia removal. Breakdown of nitratation was observed at a 40% industrial wastewater dose and breakdown of nitritation at a 50% dose, respectively. However, after several months of adaptation, both processes recovered. No nitrification was observed when the industrial wastewater share exceeded 50%. Adaptation of nitrifying bacteria in the MBR was also confirmed by results of kinetic tests. The inhibition effect of the concentrated industrial wastewater to the MBR sludge decreased substantially after several months of exposure, while the inhibition of referential activated sludge remained constant.

AB Effective and sustainable treatment of hospital wastewater containing high concentration of pharmaceutical compounds presents a pivotal challenge to wastewater and environmental engineers worldwide. In this study, a titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanofiber based wastewater treatment process was assessed as a pre-treatment system to treat and enhance the biodegradability of a representative pharmaceutical compound, 5000 mu g/L of carbamazepine (CBZ), in synthetic hospital wastewater. Results showed that the stand-alone TiO2 pre-treatment system was capable of removing 78% of CBZ, 40% of COD and 23% of PO4 concentrations from the influent wastewater within a 4 h reaction time. High performance size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that a simultaneous biodegradability enhancement of hospital wastewater was observed, whereby an apparent shift in molecular weight from higher fraction (>10-1000 kDa) to a lower fraction (<10 kDa) was induced after 0.5 h of photocatalytic treatment. Eventually, it was found that the photodegradation profile for high concentration CBZ in synthetic hospital wastewater was perfectly fitted to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics model. It is anticipated that this TiO2 pre-treatment process can be further integrated with a biological wastewater treatment process to deliver treated hospital effluent of better quality that can minimise the associated human health and environmental risks.

AB The objective of this study was to study the occurrence, fate, and seasonal variations of pharmaceuticals at two urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in India and compare the results with a similar study conducted in the United States. This is the first study of its kind in comparing occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater of two different countries with the same methodology and analytical techniques. Twelve most relevant pharmaceuticals were selected for seasonal monitoring at two Indian WWTPs based on the comprehensive survey and through literature review. The yearly average influent concentrations of total pharmaceuticals were found to be 537 +/- 5 mu g/L at WWTP-1 and 353 +/- 9 mu g/L at WWTP-2. WWTP-2 exhibited comparatively higher removal efficiency of total pharmaceuticals (85% versus 59%, excluding monsoon season), possibly due to the cyclic activated sludge technology followed by chlorination employed at WWTP-2. Comparison with a similar study conducted in the United States revealed that concentration of most of the pharmaceuticals detected in the U.S. WWTPs were, on an average, more than 50% lower. U.S. WWTPs also exhibited 10-30% higher removal efficiencies for total pharmaceuticals. Our study results show that preliminary treatment and biological treatment alone are not adequate for complete removal of pharmaceuticals and polishing step and tertiary treatment is a necessity if higher removal of pharmaceuticals is desired in Indian WWTPs. Information obtained from this study will not only aid the local utilities but will also benefit understanding of global trends in usage of pharmaceuticals and their distribution in the environment.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (VVVVTPs) dispose of numerous trace organic contaminants in the receiving waters that can impact biological function in aquatic organisms. However, the complex nature of WWTP effluent mixtures and a wide variety of potential mechanisms that can alter physiological and reproductive development of aquatic organisms make it difficult to assess the linkages and severity of the effects associated with trace organic contaminants. This paper describes a surface water quality modeling exercise that was performed to understand the relevant contaminant fate and transport processes necessary to accurately predict the concentrations of trace organic compounds present in the aquatic environment. The target compounds modeled include a known antiandrogenic personal care product (triclosan) and selected pharmaceuticals (venlafaxine, naproxen, and carbamazepine). The WASP 7.5 model was adapted and calibrated to reflect approximately ten kilometers of reach of the Grand River watershed that is highly influenced by a major urban WWTP. Simulation of the fate and transport of the target compounds revealed that flow-driven transport processes (advection and dispersion) greatly influenced the behavior of the target contaminants in the aquatic environment However, fate mechanisms such as photolysis and biodegradation can play an important role in the attenuation of some compounds. The exception was carbamazepine where it was shown to act as a conservative tracer compound for wastewater specific contaminants in the water phase. The calibrated water quality model can now be employed in a number of future applications. Prediction of fate and transport of other trace organic contaminants across the watershed and assessment of the performance of WWTP infrastructure upgrades in the removal of these compounds are just a few examples.

AB In this study, the use of co-occurring discriminators of sewage and manure was assessed as a potential way to disentangle sewage and manure sources. A suite of human and veterinary derived chemical markers, which includes pharmaceuticals and compound such as food additives, has been identified for this purpose. The suite was selected in such a manner as to provide additional source characterisation, e.g. differentiating raw versus treated sewage inputs. An SPE-LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determined suite of chemical markers with a detection limit of up to 50 pg L-1. This represents one of the lowest limits of detection for pharmaceuticals reported in literature. To illustrate the suitability of the proposed method to differentiate sewage and manure inputs to surface water bodies, results from surface water samples collected at monitoring sites corresponding to specific land use types within Ireland are discussed.

AB The treatability of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic was investigated using a single aerobic, a single anaerobic, an anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactor system, a sonicator and a photocatalytic reactor with TiO2 nanoparticles in a raw hospital wastewater in Izmir, Turkey. The effects of increasing organic loading on the performance of all biological systems were investigated, while the effects of power and time on the yields of sonication and photocatalysis were determined. The maximum COD and CIP yields were 95% and 83% in anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactor system at an HRT of 10 days and at an OLR of 0.19 g COD/Lxday after 50 days of incubation, respectively. The maximum CH4 gas production was 580 mL day(-1) at an HRT of 6.7 days. The maximum COD and CIP yields were 95% and 81% after 45 min sonication time at a power of 640W and a frequency of 35kHz while the maximum yield of COD and CIP were 98% and 88% after 45 min UV irradiation time with a UV power of 210W using 0.5gL(-1) TiO2. Among the aforementioned treatment processes, it was found that the highest treatment yields for COD (98%) and CIP (88%) pollutants were obtained with the photocatalytic process due to high OH. radical productions.

AB The overall ecotoxicological effect of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) detected in the effluents of Korean wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to Daphnia magna was investigated using biological and chemical analyses. The bioassay results showed median lethal concentrations and no -observed -effect concentrations ranging from a few to tens of ppm levels for nine PhACs in 48-h acute and 21-d chronic tests. The mixture effects of pharmaceuticals also were examined by other acute and chronic tests, which showed no significant toxicity despite a slightly increased combined effect of approximately twofold. The residual concentrations of nine PhACs were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 89 mu g/L in the influents and from 10 ng/L to 11 mu g/L in the effluents from four metropolitan cities in South Korea between January and November of 2004. Through repeated investigations of the influents and the effluents from different WWTPs, relatively higher removal efficiencies (23.9-91.3%) compared with those of previous surveys performed in other countries were observed for most pharmaceuticals, with the exception of acetaminophen (8.7%). The present Study showed no significant risk effects of the effluents from WWTPs containing pharmaceuticals (i.e., hazard quotient < 1), even at the 95th percentile contamination range, although a risk assessment factor of 1,000 was applied. Therefore, it can be concluded that the potential risk of pharmaceuticals should be monitored carefully with more bioassay data, because many uncertainties still exist in the determination and toxicity of metabolites in water environments. No significant risk was observed, however, from the selected PhACs in the effluents from WWTPs discharged into surface waters.

AB The behaviour and removal efficiency of ibuprofen (IBU), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KPF), and naproxen (NPX) during the real urban wastewater treatment by an experimental full-scale MBR working at high sludge and hydraulic retention time (SRT, HRT) were determined. The MBR worked in denitrification/nitrification conformation at 35.4h of HRT 0.45 m(3)/h), 37 d of SRT and a recirculation flow rate of 4Q The experiments were made under steady-state conditions, reaching a biodegradable organic matter removal higher than 99.5%. The MBR system showed similar removal capacity for IBU, NPX, and KTP (>95%), whose main transformation occurred in the aerobic reactor with a low contribution from the anoxic reactor. The system worked with complete nitrification, also achieving an effective retention of the unbiodegradable organic matter due to recirculation. DCF removal was low with negative removal yields for several samplings. Both removal and increase transformation of DCF also occurred in the aerobic reactor, this not being observed in the anoxic one. DCF tends to accumulate in the system and to be recirculated. Thus, during the sampling in which DCF influent concentration decreases, removal yields turn negative. The increase of DCF concentration in the aerobic bioreactor also contributes to the negative removal yields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted for the transformation products (TPs) of 3 beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) and 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) to assess potential threats to aquatic organisms in effluent-dominated surface waters. To this end, the pharmacokinetic literature, the University of Minnesota's Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database Pathway Prediction System aerobic microbial degradation software, and photolysis literature pertaining to beta-blockers and SSRIs were used to determine their most likely TPs formed via human metabolism, aerobic biodegradation, and photolysis, respectively. Monitoring data from North American and European surface waters receiving human wastewater inputs were the basis of the exposure characterizations of the parent compounds and the TPs, where available. In most cases, where monitoring data for TPs did not exist, we assumed a conservative 1: 1 parent-to-TP production ratio (i.e., 100% of parent converted). The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)'s EPISuite and ECOSAR v1.11 software were used to estimate acute and chronic toxicities to aquatic organisms. Hazard quotients, which were calculated using the 95th percentile of the exposure distributions, ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-3) (i.e., all significantly less than 1). Based on these results, the TPs of interest would be expected to pose little to no environmental risk in surface waters receiving wastewater inputs. Overall, we recommend developing analytical methods that can isolate and quantify human metabolites and TPs at environmentally relevant concentrations to confirm these predictions. Further, we recommend identifying the major species of TPs from classes of pharmaceuticals that could elicit toxic effects via specific modes of action (e.g., norfluoxetine via the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT](1A) receptors) and conducting aquatic toxicity tests to confirm these findings. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative probabilistic ecotoxicological assessment of all of the predicted and probable TPs of these pharmaceuticals, and our approach provides a framework for future such studies with other compound classes as data become available.

AB Emerging pollutants inherent in reclaimed municipal wastewater, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), often have cast uncertainties on the safety of water reuse. We examined the fate and transport behavior of several PPCP and EDC compounds through observations made at experimental turf fields irrigated with naproxen, clofibric acid, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, estrone, 4-tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A, 4-n-nonylphenol, and triclosan latent irrigation water. The potential of the compounds to contaminate underlying groundwater was assessed using three screening protocols that employed the attributes of soils, chemicals, and water fluxes as the estimators. No compound was detected in the leachate draining through the 89-cm profile of a loamy sand soil and a sandy loam soil turf grass field during four months of irrigation according to operations typical of golf courses in southern California (USA). Ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, bisphenol A, clofibric acid, and estrone were detected in the surface to 30-cm soil profiles. Higher irrigation rate and coarser textural soil enhanced the downward movement of chemicals in both soils. The pollution risk screenings identified the same six compounds as having the potential to contaminate groundwater, and under conditions of turf grass irrigation, clofibric acid and ibuprofen would be most prone to cause the pollution.

AB In urban areas, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a major role in the water quality of rivers. The removal efficiency of emerging contaminants by WWTPs is strongly correlated with the type of treatment and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the process, which can vary according to the volumetric influent flow of wastewater and occasional peak flows. This paper aims, for the first time, to assess the daily variation of lipid regulators and personal care products in an urban river impacted by domestic effluents. Samples were collected upstream and downstream of a WWTP. The concentrations downstream of the effluent discharge were higher than upstream, but they varied significantly during the day. Concentration peaks upstream of the WWTP were detected at 07:00, 15:00 and 21:00, while downstream of the effluent discharge, concentration peaks occurred between 13:00 and 19:00 and between 21:00 and 23:00. The highest downstream concentrations of triclosan and methylparaben (420 ng L-1 and 460 ng L-1) were 6.8 and 5.4 times higher than the lowest concentrations detected, respectively. These results show that in WWTP-impacted rivers, the time of the sampling has a great influence on the final results and conclusions of a monitoring study.

AB While the population and therefore the demand for water keep increasing alarmingly, the type and quantity of water source remains the same. This leads the world to water scarcity. In this chapter, the need for wastewater recycling and stringent rules to control water pollution, instigated by water scarcity, is identified as the main driving force for the current and future increase in the use of advanced wastewater treatment systems. The types and sources of wastewater, water pollution, and pollutants along with the available treatment technologies are described. The need to continue to develop new strategies for water management is recommended. In most scenarios water reuse and/or recycling are deemed to be financially feasible approaches and hence are discussed as vital in this chapter. Municipal wastewater represents a large volume of wastewater released from different sources. The wastewater is rich in organic and inorganic compounds with high biodegradability. This chapter discusses Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) process with a special focus on biomass-based MBRs and its suitability for municipal wastewater treatment/reclamation in comparison with the existing conventional treatment technologies. Selected groups of microbes isolated and described in the literature as efficient for use in MBR systems are highlighted. The effort, desire, and market trends on MBR for municipal/domestic wastewater treatment and valorization are commentated by reviewing a wide range of projects funded by EU and other reports. It is also noted that, although there is progressive development and significant rise in the use of MBRs, severe membrane fouling and presence and retention of emerging micropollutants limited its further success. Remark is given to the importance of integrating MBR with emerging membrane operations and the simultaneous use of enzyme membrane reactors and mixed community of microbes to reclaim municipal wastewater with a desirable quality.

AB Concentrations of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated for the first time in sewage effluents and receiving waters of the "Rio de la Plata" estuary and neighboring areas by means of LC-MS/MS. E2 and EE2 were ubiquitous in the evaluated sewage effluent samples showing concentrations ranging between 122-631 and 65-187 ng/L, respectively. In surface waters, these estrogens were only detected in the "Girado" stream (ChascomA(0)s) at 369 and 43 ng/L, respectively. No significant relationship was found among the size of the served population and the concentration of the estrogens in the sewage effluent. The detection of these estrogens in receiving waters was dependent on the dilution capacity of the system. The studied estrogens were undetectable at the La Plata City water supply station. Conversely, concentrations found at the "Girado" stream indicate a potential ecotoxicological risk of these estrogens to the local aquatic biota.

AB The staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (SAFMBR) is effective to remove organic substances with reduced sludge production by minimizing excess waste sludge. This study investigated the removals of four pharmaceuticals present at trace levels in municipal wastewater by using a SAFMBR. The target pharmaceuticals included ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and diclofenac. A pilot-scale SAFMBR with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) from 4.5 to 13.5 hr was established and operated for 450 days with a municipal wastewater spiked with four pharmaceuticals. In the results, the BOD and COD removals were effective and limitedly affected the presence of pharmaceuticals. The BOD removal efficiencies in the anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFBR) and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFMBR) were 63.5 +/- 28.6% and 81.6 +/- 25.1%, respectively. However, the treatment efficiencies of four pharmaceuticals varied. Naproxen that contains electron donating group was treated efficiently (63.8%similar to 72.1%), whereas the removal efficiencies of ibuprofen (25.0%similar to 32.4%), carbamazepine (16.6-18.5%), and diclofenac (non-detected) remained low. Ibuprofen was less efficient to compete with other electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment. For pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine with a high acid dissociation constant (pKa = 13.9) or diclofenac with a high octanol-water partition coefficient (log K-ow = 4.51), sorption onto the sludge could be one critical process affecting their concentrations in the water phase. By being positively charged at neutral pH and/or hydrophobic, the pharmaceuticals were initially adsorbed onto sludge, followed by being desorbed when sludge decayed after long operating hours. Nitrogen balance was analyzed to indicate the decay of the bacteria in the AFMBR. Increasing the HRTs only slightly improved the treatment efficiencies (e.g., the naproxen removal was increased from 63.8% to 72.1% when the HRT was increased from 4.5 to 7.5 h). The different processes responsible for the removals of these pharmaceuticals were more critical and their effects were limitedly changed by HRT adjustment, indicating the importance of knowing the properties of a pharmaceutical for selection of a proper treatment approach.

AB An important component of micropollutants are PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products). This paper contains the results of the monitoring of surface water, groundwater and wastewater in the surrounding area of the Svihov drinking water reservoir. Over the period 2017-2019, over 21,000 water samples were taken and analyzed for 112 pharmaceuticals, their metabolites, and other chemicals. The results are discussed in detail for two streams with the highest observed concentration of PPCPs (Hnevkovice, Dolni Kralovice) and two streams with the highest water inflow into the reservoir, representing also the highest mass flow of PPCPs into the reservoir (Miletin, Kacerov). The overall analysis of the results shows that acesulfame, azithromycin, caffeine, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide, ibuprofen and its metabolites, oxypurinol, paraxanthine, and saccharin (on some profiles up to tens of thousands ng/dm(3)) attain the highest concentration and occur most frequently. The evaluation of raw water and treated drinking water quality showed the significant positive effect of water retention in the reservoir (retention time of 413 days) and also of the treatment process, so that the treated drinking water is of high quality and contains only negligible residues of few PPCPs near the detection limit of the analytical method used.

AB In this work, two pulps, bleached (BP) and raw pulp (RP), derived from the paper production process, were used as precursors of non-activated and activated carbons (ACs). In the case of non-ACs, the production involved either pyrolysis or pyrolysis followed by acid washing. For ACs production, the pulps were impregnated with K2CO3 or H3PO4, and then pyrolysed and acid washed. After production, the materials were physically and chemically characterized. Then, batch adsorption tests on the removal of two pharmaceuticals (the anti-epileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX)) from ultra-pure water and from Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) effluents were performed. In ultra-pure water, non-ACs were not able to adsorb CBZ or SMX while ACs showed good adsorption capacities. In WWTP effluents, although ACs satisfactorily adsorbed CBZ and SMX, they showed lower adsorption capacities for the latter. Tests with WWTP effluents revealed that the best adsorption capacities were achieved by carbons produced from BP and activated with H3PO4: 92 +/- 19 mg g(-1) for CBZ and 13.0 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1) for SMX. These results indicate the potential of paper pulps as precursors for ACs that can be applied in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs was investigated in a representative conventional German WWTP by long-term measurement campaigns along different biological treatment processes. The activated sludge treatment with an elevated SRT of 18 d was the only process which led to a significant removal of certain beta blockers and psycho-active drugs. The removal efficiency was below 60% for all compounds except for the natural opium alkaloids codeine and morphine being removed by more than 80%. Primary biological transformation and sorption onto sludge as the main removal mechanisms were examined in lab-scale batch experiments. Sorption onto activated sludge was found to be negligible (<3%). The biological transformation could be described by pseudo-first order kinetics and the transformation constants k(biol) were used to predict the removal of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in an activated sludge unit with a model. For most compounds the removal efficiencies measured on the full-scale WWTP were within the 95% confidence intervals predicted by the model. The results from full-scale measurements and modeling indicate that biological transformation in the nitrification tank together with parameters such as the sludge retention time and the temperature is crucial regarding the biological transformation of beta blockers and psycho-active drugs in conventional WWTPs.

AB Organic wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, caffeine, and nicotine, have received increased scrutiny because of their detection in water bodies receiving wastewater discharge. Despite recent measurement in United States streams, caffeine's effect on freshwater organisms is not well documented. The present study measured caffeine's lethal and sublethal effects on the freshwater species, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Pimephales promelas, and Chironomus dilutus. These organisms, which are used in standard testing or effluent monitoring, were exposed to aqueous caffeine solutions under static exposure for 48 hours and daily renewed static exposure for 7 days. Averaged responses of 48-hour acute end points indicated that C. dubia was more sensitive to caffeine exposures (LC50 = 60 mg/L) than either P. promelas (LC50 = 100 mg/L) or C. dilutus (LC50 = 1,230 mg/L). Exposure-response slopes confirmed these findings (3% mortality/mg/L for C. dubia; 0.5% mortality/mg/L for P. promelas; and 0.07% mortality/mg/L for C. dilutus). Comparative 7-day responses between C. dubia and P. promelas (LC50 = 46 and 55 mg/L, respectively) were more similar than the broad range of acute values. Sublethal effects measured for caffeine exposure included impaired C. dubia reproduction (IC50 = 44 mg/L) and inhibited P. promelas growth (IC50 = 71 mg/L). According to the results of this study, combined with earlier studies reporting environmental concentrations and product half-lives, caffeine should pose negligible risk for most aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate organisms.

AB In a research project on risk management of harmful substances in water cycles, clindamycin and 12 further antibiotics were determined in different sewage samples. In contrast to other antibiotics, an increase of the clindamycin concentration in the final effluent in comparison to the influent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) was observed. A back transformation from the main metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin during the denitrification process has been discussed. Therefore, the concentration of this metabolite was measured additionally. Clindamycin sulfoxide was stable in the STP and the assumption of back transformation of the metabolite to clindamycin was confuted. To explain the increasing clindamycin concentration in the STP, the ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin was observed. The ratio increased in dry spells with concentrated samples and with long dwell time in the sewer system. A short hydraulic retention in waste water system and diluted samples in periods of extreme rainfall lead to a lower ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin concentration. A plausible explanation of this behavior could be that clindamycin was adsorbed strongly to a component of the sewage during this long residence time and in the STP, clindamycin was released. In the common sample preparation in the lab, clindamycin was not released. Measurements of clindamycin and clindamycin sulfoxide in the influent and effluent of STP is advised for sewage monitoring.

AB Even though Ibuprofen is one of the most studied pharmaceutical in the aquatic environment, there is still a lack of information about its fate and the generation of different transformation products along wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Ibuprofen biotransformation products can be generated by human metabolism or by microorganisms present in WWTPs and in natural waters, soils, and sediments, which increase the probability to find them in environment. In this work, the presence of ibuprofen and its main metabolites: ibuprofen carboxylic acid (CBX IBU), 2-hydroxylated ibuprofen (2-OH IBU) and 1-hydroxylated ibuprofen (1-OH IBU), was monitored quantitatively along the biodegradation processes occurring in different batch activated sludge (BAS) experiments under different working conditions. Total ibuprofen removal, achieved in almost all the experiments, was related in part to the formation of the metabolites mentioned. Another ibuprofen metabolite, 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, was detected in BAS experiments for the first time. The metabolites 2-OH IBU and 1-OH IBU remained in solution at the end of ibuprofen biodegradation experiments whereas CBX IBU disappeared faster than hydroxylated metabolites. In addition, also the biodegradation of 1-OH IBU, 2-OH IBU and CBX IBU was evaluated in batch experiments: CBX IBU removal occurred at the highest rate followed by IBU, 2-OH IBU, and 1-OH IBU, which exhibited the lowest removal rate. Finally, Ibuprofen and ibuprofen metabolites were monitored in sewage and natural water samples, where they were found at higher levels than expected: the maximum concentration in influent wastewater samples were 13.74, 5.8, 38.4, 94.0 mu g/L for IBU, 1-OH IBU, CBX IBU and 2-OH IBU respectively: whereas maximum levels in effluent wastewater samples were 1.9, 1.4, 10.7, 5.9 mu g/L for IBU, 1-OH IBU, CBX IBU and 2-OH IBU respectively. High levels of the compounds were also found in river samples, in particular for CBX IBU, which was detected up to 3.9 mu g/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of anti-inflammatory and analgesic pharmaceuticals (AIAPs) in the effluents of 16 hospitals, influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the contribution and mass load of each hospital to WWTP influent, and the removal efficiencies in WWTP were investigated. Environmental risk was also evaluated by toxicity tests using organisms from three different trophic levels. Acetaminophen had the highest concentration in summer and winter samples, followed by ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. The total daily load of AIAPs detected in influent of WWTP was 1677 mg/day/1000 inhabitants in summer and 5074 mg/day/1000 inhabitants in winter. The contribution of 16 hospitals to the total AIAP load in influent of WWTP was 11.30% in summer and 7.09% in winter. The highest mass loads were calculated as 203 mg/bed.day in general hospital in summer and 300 mg/bed.day in pediatric hospital in winter. The removal efficiencies of AIAPs in WWTP ranged between 13% and 100% in summer and 0.88% and 99% in winter. WWTP is not sufficient to remove all the AIAPs. Diclofenac (in summer), mefenamic acid, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone exhibited poor removal below 50%. The effluents of the WWTP exhibited a low risk for fish and Daphnia magna and an insignificant risk for algae.

AB Purpose The anti-inflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) has been found as a micropollutant in river water downstream the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was exposed to NXP and the uptake and metabolism of the drug was studied.
   Methods Following exposure through intraperitoneal injection (i.p., 0.5 mg NPX/100 g fish biomass) and through water (1.6 mu g L(-1)), the bile was collected and analyzed with various LC-MS/MS methods. The identification of the formed metabolites in i.p. injected fish was based on the exact mass determinations by a time-of-flight mass analyzer (Q-TOF-MS) and on the studies of fragments and fragmentation patterns of precursor ions by an ion trap mass analyzer (IT-MS).
   Results No matter the exposure route, the main metabolites were found to be acyl glucuronides of NPX and of 6-O-desmethylnaproxen. Also, unmetabolized NPX was detected in the bile. The total bioconcentration factors (BCF(total-bile)) of NPX and the metabolites in the bile of fish exposed through water ranged from 500 to 2,300.
   Conclusion The findings suggest that fish living downstream WWTPs may take up NPX and metabolize the compound. Consequently, NPX and its metabolites in bile can be used to monitor the exposure of fish to NPX.

AB In the presented study, the feasibility of using activated carbon and graphene oxide embedded chitosan-poly (vinyl alcohol) (AC/CS-PVA and GO/CS-PVA) biocomposites as adsorbents for removal of ibuprofen from wastewater. The point of zero charge values, effect of AC and GO content in the biocomposites, optimum amount of biocomposites, optimum pH and ibuprofen concentration were considered. When AC and GO were embedded into CS-PVA polymer network, the ibuprofen removal performance increased from 11% to 83% and 94%, respectively. Adsorption isotherms were described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R), Temkin, Halsey, Jovanovic, Elovich, and Harkins-Jura isotherm models. Freundlich, Temkin, Halsey, Elovich, and Harkins-Jura models were fitted to the adsorption better than Langmuir, D-R, and Jovanovic models. Adsorption kinetics was investigated by pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, Weber-Morris, and Bangham models and ibuprofen adsorption onto biocomposites represented by pseudo-second order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameter, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees, and Delta G degrees, values were determined and the enthalpy of ibuprofen adsorption was found positive supporting the endothermic nature of pharmaceutical pollutant adsorption. The influence of various operating variables and optimum process conditions for the ibuprofen adsorption was investigated using central composite design.

AB The efficiency of wastewater ozonation for the abatement of three nitrogen-containing pharmaceuticals, two antihistamine drugs, cetirizine (CTR) and fexofenadine (FXF), and the diuretic drug, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was investigated. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reactions of the molecular, protonated (CTR, FXF) or deprotonated (HCTZ) forms of these compounds with ozone were determined. All three compounds are very reactive with ozone (apparent second order rate constants at pH 7: k(03,pH7) = 1.7.10(5) M(-1)s(-1), 8.5.10(4) M(-1)s(-1) and 9.0.10(3) M(-1)s(-1) for CTR, HCTZ and FXF, respectively). Transformation product (TP) structures were elucidated using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including isotope-labeled standards. For cetirizine and hydrochlorothiazide 8 TPs each and for fexofenadine 7 TPs were identified. The main TPs of cetirizine and fexofenadine are their respective N-oxides, whereas chlorothiazide forms to almost 100% from hydrochlorothiazide. In the bacteria bioluminescence assay the toxicity was slightly increased only during the ozonation of cetirizine at very high cetirizine concentrations. The main TPs detected in bench-scale experiments were also detected in full-scale ozonation of a municipal wastewater, for >90% elimination of the parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB BACKGROUND: The pollution of the aquatic environment by pharmaceuticals has become a serious problem. Conventional technologies applied in water or sewage treatment plants are not effective in drugs removal, therefore there is an urgent need to develop new methods.
   RESULTS: The removal of diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU) and naproxen (NAP) sodium salts in a photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) utilizing direct contact membrane distillation and UV-C radiation from ultrapure water, tap water, primary effluents (PE) and secondary effluents (SE) of municipal wastewater treatment plant is presented. When PE were used as feed and TiO2 loading of 0.5 g dm(-3) was applied, DCF was removed completely, IBU amount decreased for 73% and NAP for 90%. In the case of SE, DCF, IBU and NAP concentrations decreased by 100%, 93% and 94%, respectively (1.5 gTiO(2) dm(-3)). Mineralization was low and did not exceed 14% for PE and 23% for SE. No drugs were found in the distillate, however, it contained high level of N-NH4+, especially in PE.
   CONCLUSION: The hybrid system can be an effective technology for the removal of pharmaceuticals from SE and PE, however, owing to membrane fouling the latter should be pretreated before application in the PMR. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Bio-refractory wastewater treatment is compulsory for a safe discharge into the environment. This paper aims to study the use of membrane processes to concentrate wastewater to be then treated by a hydrothermal process such as wet air oxidation for advanced and intensified wastewater treatment. The work focused on three different synthetic wastewaters of public or industrial interest: pharmaceutical wastewater, grey wastewater, and bilge wastewater. Membrane processes operated at the pilot scale enabled retentions as high as 100% of total organic carbon, more than 99% of turbidity, and 70% of hydrocarbon, respectively. High concentration factors were obtained. Membrane foulings were chemically reversible whatever the type of wastewater or the membrane process. Thanks to membrane filtrations, the volumes to be treated by wet air oxidation were drastically reduced, leading to high energy savings. Membrane retentates were then treated by wet air oxidation (300 degrees C, 15 MPa) and resulted in more than an 83% mineralization rate, regardless of the effluent. The hybrid intensified process presented in this work strongly increased the possibility of discharging into the environment by mixing the process outputs or greatly reducing the discharge volume and ultimately the waste load.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are frequently studied contaminants, their fate in the environment is still not completely clear. During a one year study, a complex approach including water, sediment and fish sampling was used to describe the behaviour of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites (PTMs) in the environment. Eighteen pharmaceuticals and seven of their metabolites were determined in a pond used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was applied to determine the PTMs concentrations in all matrices. Seasonal variations in concentrations were evaluated. The partitioning of contaminants between pond compartments was estimated by means of solid water distribution coefficients (K-d) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for the livers of fish. Ka values were almost stable throughout the year, which may be a sign of the continuous transport of PTMs between water and sediment under the experimental conditions. Almost all of the studied compounds, with exception of sertraline (BAF of 6200), were found to not be bioaccumulative in fish livers. The pond removal efficiency was calculated for all PTMs, and favourable conditions for natural pharmaceutical removal were proposed. Further aspects regarding fish pharmaceutical exposure need to be studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The health of both coral reefs and people are imperiled by a local threat that is widespread across the globe-sewage and the typical components it carries (e.g., nutrients, sediments, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, pathogens, and pharmaceuticals). Despite this common threat, those concerned with human health and those concerned with coral reef health have rarely joined forces. To jump-start an alliance between coral conservation and human health sectors, this article documents the threats that humans and reefs face and identifies threat-abatement strategies that will benefit both people and reefs, highlighting the mitigation of water pollution as a prime example. By joining forces, marine conservationists and human health practitioners can increase the amount and efficiency of both intellectual and financial resources they bring to bear against sewage.

AB In light of the environmental policy orientation of continuous upgrading emission limits, quantitatively understanding the comprehensive cost of wastewater treatment of chemical industrial parks, a common landscape globally, will be vital for facilitating sustainable water management of the parks. This study modeled the economic cost of wastewater treatment in chemical industrial parks from the perspective of life cycle thinking. The full-process cost of wastewater treatment is accounted, including freshwater withdrawal, construction and capital costs of wastewater treatment facilities, operation costs, sludge treatment costs, and 'feed-in tariffs' of wastewater to centralized wastewater treatment plants (CWWTPs) of the park. After applying the model to HSEDA, a typical chemical industrial park, we found the total wastewater treatment cost of the chemical industrial park in 2016 was 654 million Chinese Yuan (about 97 million USD), accounting for 29 % of the tax revenue of the park. Energy, chemicals, and labor costs in the sum accounted for more than 60 % of the full-process cost. The cost of freshwater withdrawal, in-plant treatment cost, and CWWTP cost accounted for 54 %, 33 %, and 13 % of the total cost, respectively. The top two pillar industries the dyestuff manufacturing industry and the pharmaceutical industry, have a cost of 29 CNY and 21 CNY per ton of wastewater, respectively. Moreover, the marginal cost increment associated with a much stricter emission standard by targeting TN control is discussed by employing different technologies. Finally, key measures for improving wastewater treatment in the chemical industrial park are proposed.

AB Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants do not efficiently remove contaminants of emerging concern, and so are primary sources for contaminant release into the aquatic environment. Although these contaminants are present in effluents at ng-mu g/L concentrations (i.e. microcontaminants), many compounds can act as endocrine disrupting compounds or stress-inducing agents at these levels. Chemical fate analyses indicate that additional levels of wastewater treatment reduce but do not always completely remove all microcontaminants. The removal of microcontaminants from wastewater does not necessarily correspond to a reduction in biological activity, as contaminant metabolites or byproducts may still be biologically active. To evaluate the efficacy of conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants to remove biological activity, we examined the performance of a full scale conventional activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. We assessed reductions in levels of conventional wastewater parameters and thyroid hormone disrupting and stress-inducing activities in wastewater at three phases along the treatment train using a C-fin assay. Wastewater treatment was effective at reducing total suspended solids, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, and stress-inducing bioactivity. However, only minimal reduction was observed in thyroid hormone disrupting activities. The present study underscores the importance of examining multiple chemical and biological endpoints in evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of wastewater treatment for removal of microcontaminants.

AB A laboratory scale Hybrid Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (HMBBR) was used to study the removal of five benzotriazoles and one benzothiazole from municipal wastewater. The HMBBR system consisted of two serially connected fully aerated bioreactors that contained activated sludge (AS) and K3-biocarriers and a settling tank. The average removal of target compounds ranged between 41% (4-methyl-1Hbenzotriazole; 4TTR) and 88% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole; OHBTH). Except for 4TTR, degradation mainly occurred in the first bioreactor. Calculation of biodegradation constants in batch experiments and application of a model for describing micropollutants removal in the examined system showed that AS is mainly involved in biodegradation of OHBTH, 1H-benzotriazole (BTR) and xylytriazole (XTR), carriers contribute significantly on 4TTR biodegradation, while both types of biomass participate on elimination of 5-chlorobenzotriazole (CBTR) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5TTR). Comparison of the HMBBR system with MBBR or AS systems from literature showed that the HMBBR system was more efficient for the biodegradation of the investigated chemicals. Biotransformation products of target compounds were identified using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with a quadrupole-time of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC-QToF-MS). Twenty two biotransformation products were tentatively identified, while retention time denoted the formation of more polar transformation products than the parent compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) include a complex mixture of nutrients and pollutants. Nutrients can subsidise autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, while toxic pollutants can act as stressors, depending, for instance, on their concentration and interactions in the environment. Hence, it is difficult to predict the overall effect of WWTP effluents on river ecosystem functioning. We assessed the effects of WWTP effluents on river biofilms and ecosystem metabolism in one river segment upstream from a WWTP and three segments downstream from the WWTP and following a pollution gradient. The photosynthetic capacity and enzymatic activity of biofilms showed no change, with the exception of leucine aminopeptidase, which followed the pollution gradient most likely driven by changes in organic matter availability. The effluent produced mixed effects on ecosystem-scale metabolism. It promoted respiration (subsidy effect), probably as a consequence of enhanced availability of organic matter. On the other hand, and despite enhanced nutrient concentrations, photosynthesis-irradiance relationships showed that the effluent partly decoupled primary production from light availability, thus suggesting a stress effect. Overall, WWTP effluents can alter the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and produce spatial discontinuities in ecosystem functioning along rivers as a consequence of the mixed contribution of stressors and subsidisers.

AB This study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the effluent of the Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria (HUSM). Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of CIP in the hospital wastewater, both before (P1) and after (P2) cesspit/filter system treatment (CFTS), were determined by means of solid phase extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). The MECs (n = 7 daily composed samples) were 19 to 155 mu g L-1 (average: 54 +/- 21 lug L-1) and 32 to 99 mu g L-1 (average: 65 45 lug L-1) in P1 and P2, respectively. No relevant removal was observed from P1 to P2. In a worst case scenario, the final effluent was regarded as MECs of surface water. These MECs were generally 5 to 20,000-fold higher than what was previously known. If the present data is drawn on to form a model of the situation in developing countries, the picture provides a first rough indication that the environmental risk associated with the use and emission of pharmaceuticals into the environment in developing countries might be higher than in developed countries.

AB A monitoring study was carried out for the four seasons over 1-year monitoring period (March 2006-March 2007) to investigate the residues of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to various therapeutic categories. The selected areas of the study were the municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Ioannina city, located in Western Greece. The most common pre-treatment technique for pharmaceuticals, solid-phase extraction (SPE), was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target analytes. The samples were screened using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the monitoring study, showed the occurrence of all target compounds in the wastewater samples. Concentrations in the municipal WWTP ranged between 0.3 and 164.4 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 13.9 mu g/L in the effluent. In the hospital WWTP concentrations ranged between 0.6 and 70.1 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 14.6 mu g/L in the effluent. Mean removal efficiencies ranged between 13% and 97% and between 9% and 87% for municipal and hospital WWTPs, respectively. Removal efficiencies were higher in the municipal WWTP than in the hospital WWTP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are manmade or natural chemicals that have the ability to interfere with the endocrine system of animals. They have not been monitored systematically in the Czech Republic. The goal of the present study was the characterization of aquatic environmental pollution from the Brno (Czech Republic) city agglomeration focusing on EDC. Passive sampling devices, as well as semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), were used for the pilot assessment of EDC. They were deployed for 21- to 28-d periods at nine locations in the Svratka and Svitava Rivers, Brno, Czech Republic, including at the inlet and outlet of Brno's wastewater treatment plant. The SPMDs were used to monitor nonpolar compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorinated pesticides (OCP). The POCIS were used to monitor polar compounds such as pesticides and their metabolites, perfluoro-organic compounds (PFOC), and pharmaceuticals. The passive samplers allowed very low detection limits for soluble (bioavailable) fractions of pollutants. The contribution of PAH, PCB, and HCB in sewage water to pollution of the Svratka River was low. The Brno wastewater treatment plant was identified as the main source of pharmaceuticals, triclosan, methyl triclosan, and some polar pesticides. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29: 550-555.

AB Wastewater irrigation is widely practiced and may cause serious environmental problems. However, current knowledge on the effects of long-term irrigation with wastewater from different sources on the biouptake of trace metals (TMs) in the rhizosphere zone by plants in farmlands is limited. Here, we analyzed wheat rhizosphere soil and wheat roots collected from a typical wastewater irrigation area in North China to evaluate the influence of wastewater irrigation from different sources on the bioavailability of trace metals in soils. Results showed that irrigation with tanning and domestic wastewater helped enhance the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing the active organic carbon content, soil redox potential, and catalase activity, thus enhancing the proportion of the potentially bioavailable part of trace metal speciation. Conversely, irrigation with pharmaceutical wastewater can reduce the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing total soil antibiotics and thus decreasing the proportions of bioavailable and potentially bioavailable parts of trace metal speciation. These findings can provide insights into the migration and transformation of trace metal speciation in soil rhizosphere microenvironments under the context of wastewater irrigation.

AB Unplanned indirect (de facto) wastewater reuse occurs when wastewater is discharged into surface waters upstream of potable drinking water treatment plant intakes. This paper aims to predict percentages and trends of de facto reuse throughout the Yangtze River watershed in order to understand the relative contribution of wastewater discharges into the river and its tributaries towards averting water scarcity concerns. The Yangtze River is the third longest in the world and supports more than 1/15 of the world's population, yet the importance of wastewater on the river remains ill-defined. Municipal wastewater produced in the Yangtze River Basin increased by 41% between 1998 and 2014, from 2580 m(3)/s to 3646 m(3)/s. Under low flow conditions in the Yangtze River near Shanghai, treated wastewater contributions to river flows increased from 8% in 1998 to 14% in 2014. The highest levels of de facto reuse appeared along a major tributary (Han River) of the Yangtze River, where de facto reuse can exceed 20%. While this initial analysis of de facto reuse used water supply and wastewater data from 110 cities in the basin and 11 gauging stations with >50 years of historic streamflow data, the outcome was limited by the lack of gauging stations at more locations (i.e., data had to be predicted using digital elevation mapping) and lack of precise geospatial location of drinking water intakes or wastewater discharges. This limited the predictive capabilityof the model relative to larger datasets available in other countries (e.g., USA). This assessment is the first analysis of de facto wastewater reuse in the Yangtze River Basin. It will help identify sections of the river at higher risk for wastewater-related pollutants due to presence of and reliance on wastewater discharge that could be the focus of field studies and model predictions of higher spatial and temporal resolution.

AB In this study, a novel recyclable Co-doped UiO-66 nanoparticle was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method. A high adsorption capacity of 224.1 mg g(-1) was obtained by the CoUiO-1 nanoparticle, then the adsorbed tetracycline (TC) molecules could be removed more than 94% of initial concentration under simulative sunlight irradiation. The adsorptive ability and photocatalytic performance of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle were about 7.6 and 6.9 times higher than the pristine UiO-66, respectively. The adsorption capacity of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle was sensitive to adsorbent dosage, coexisting ions, solution pH values and initial TC concentrations. Pseudosecond- order and Freundlich models fitted well with the adsorption process. Thermodynamic study indicated the TC adsorption on CoUiO-1 nanoparticle was a spontaneous and exothermic process. TC photodegradation experiment showed that the Co-doped modification expanded light absorption and facilitated charge separation of UiO-66, which was beneficial to enhance photocatalytic performance. The mechanism of TC photodegradation by Co-doped UiO-66 nanoparticle was investigated. Moreover, a plausible degradation pathway for TC was proposed. The high removal efficiencies of CoUiO-1 nanoparticle were obtained towards real samples including tap water, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater. Therefore, the novel Co-doped MOFs photocatalytic adsorbent showed great potential in wastewater treatment.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is considered to be a useful tool for monitoring chemical consumption in the population. However, the lack of information on potential transformation of biomarkers in the sewer system can compromise the accuracy of the consumption estimation. The present study contributes to addressing this issue by investigating the in-sewer stability of biomarkers from a number of commonly used drugs using laboratory sewer reactors that canmimic different sewer conditions. A stable and an unstable chemical (carbamazepine and caffeine) were also used as benchmarking chemicals to reflect the chemical degradation potential in different sewer conditions. The results suggested that ketamine and norketamine were unstable in gravity and rising main sewers, ketamine was unstable in bulk liquid while norketamine was stable under the same condition. Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the rising main sewer. Morphine and codeine glucuronide were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties.

AB The removal of commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim) and a biocide (triclosan) in operating wastewater treatment plants in five EU countries has been studied. Under normal operating conditions the acidic drugs and triclosan were partially removed with removal rates varying from ca. 20 to >95%. The highest removal rate was found for ibuprofen and triclosan (>90%) followed by naproxen (80%), gemfibrozil (55%) and diclofenac (39%). Ibuprofen undergoes an oxidative transformation to corresponding hydroxy- and carboxy-metabolites, which contributes to its high removal rate. Disturbances in the activated sludge process resulted in lower removal rates for all acidic drugs, mostly for diclofenac (<10% removed) but also for ibuprofen (<60% removed). The treatment of wastewaters by activated sludge usually did not result in any practical removal (<10%) of neutral carbamazepine or basic atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim. The removal rates of the investigated drugs and triclosan are discussed in terms of mechanisms responsible for their removal. Discharges of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, triclosan and trimethoprim from WWTPs to the aquatic environment, expressed as the average concentration in the effluent and the daily discharged quantity per person served by WWTPs were assessed.

AB This study deals with the ozonation of amoxicillin in real pharmaceutical wastewater and its efficacy as a pre-treatment, prior to biological degradation by a mixed culture of bacteria in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). An ozone utilization of 0.27 g/g-COD (chemical oxygen demand) lowered the pH of the wastewater to 6.6, reduced the specific ultraviolet absorption by 43% and increased the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration by 37%. The BOD:COD ratio became equal to 0.89, making the ozonated wastewater seemingly suitable for biological treatment; however, when the ozonated effluent was fed to the SBR, the reactor performance degraded, an effect which was attributed to ozonation by-products. In conclusion, ozonation might not be a suitable pre-treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater containing amoxicillin, and biotreatment with properly acclimated biomass may be a better option for treatment of such pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The use of residual biomass to produce potential sorbent for the remediation of water contaminated with persistent pollutants has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to substitute conventional adsorbents over the last years. Biochar with diversified functionalities, excellent physicochemical properties and low-cost has demonstrated its effectiveness as a powerful material for the removal of a wide variety of organic and inorganic sewage pollutants, including organic dyes, phenolic compounds, pesticides, pharmaceutically active products and heavy metals. In this study, biochar from banana Pseudostem fibers was produced at different temperatures through slow pyrolysis and then impregnated with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles via an in-situ method to be utilized for the removal of Amoxicillin antibiotic from wastewater. For the best understanding of prepared biochar behaviors towards the selected pollutant, various characterization techniques have been used to investigate the physical, chemical, and thermal properties, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM and EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Adsorption experiments revealed that the hybrid nanocomposite Co-BP350 was the best adsorbent for amoxicillin antibiotic over a wide pH and temperature range, making it a promising material for the treatment of wastewater.

AB Most conventional wastewater treatment plants hardly remove micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. Here the ability of a submerged nanofiltration flat sheet module to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater is analyzed. The nanofiltration membrane was used at the relatively low pressure of only 0.7 bar; at such low pressure, the membrane does not retain salts to a great extent. This is advantageous in wastewater treatment because no salt concentrate is produced. Carbamazepine was retained only slightly by the nanofiltration membranes, whereas diclofenac was retained by approximately 65%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater indicator is a useful tool for evaluating the wastewater impact on natural water, but there is little information about the suitability of wastewater indicators for different regions. This study aimed to select suitable wastewater indicators in the Pearl River Delta region, south China by screening a range of wastewater related organic compounds. The screening campaign was carried out by investigating the occurrence and removal efficiencies of 93 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 5 artificial sweeteners (ASs) in nine wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the region, and the occurrence of these target compounds in the contaminated and clean surface water of the Pearl River. An ideal wastewater indicator should be hydrophilic, source-specific for domestic wastewater, ubiquitous in contaminated surface water with detection frequency (DF) >80% and absent in background water samples. For liable indicators, high removal rates (>90%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the influent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. For conservative indicators, low removal rates (<50%) should be observed in WWTPs and they should be detected in all the effluent samples at concentrations fifty times higher than their limits of quantification. Based on the above criteria, sucralose and fluconazole were selected as conservative indicators in the region, while cyclamate, saccharin, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben, paracetamol, salicylic acid and caffeine were selected as liable indicators.

AB A critical evaluation of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was performed on 16 of Portugal's most consumed pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents (WWEs), the main route for aquatic contamination. The predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were formulated based on the Guideline, after incorporating several refinements. The best approach was selected by comparing the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) to the PECs in WWEs. Finally, risk was assessed by comparing PECs to predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs).
   The results showed that the default value of the penetration factor (Fpen) used by the EMA (0.01) was surpassed and that national consumption and excretion data were the two most important parameters for PEC calculations. The risk quotient between PECs and PNECs was higher than 1 for 12 pharmaceuticals, indicating a risk to all three trophic levels of aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish).
   To improve the current ERA framework, suggestions were made for incorporating consumption and excretion data, changing the default value of Fpen to 0.04 and adding a safety factor of 10. Moreover, this evaluation should be performed for pharmaceuticals already on the market, and future ERAs should incorporate a risk-benefit analysis, an important risk-management step.

AB The occurrence, removal and ecotoxicological assessment of 21 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antilipidemics and antihypersensitives, were studied at four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Chongqing, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Individual treatment unit effluents, as well as primary and secondary sludge, were sampled and analyzed for the selected PhACs to evaluate their biodegradation, persistence and partitioning behaviors. PhACs were identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. All the 21 analyzed PhACs were detected in wastewater and the target PhACs except acetaminophen, ibuprofen and gemfibrozil, were also found in sludge. The concentrations of the antibiotics and SVT were comparable to or even higher than those reported in developed countries, while the case of other target PhACs was opposite. The elimination of PhACs except acetaminophen was incomplete and a wide range of elimination efficiencies during the treatment were observed, i.e. from "negative removal" to 99.5%. The removal of PhACs was insignificant in primary and disinfection processes, and was mainly achieved during the biological treatment. Based on the mass balance analysis, biodegradation is believed to be the primary removal mechanism, whereas only about 1.5% of the total mass load of the target PhACs was removed by sorption. Experimentally estimated distribution coefficients (<500 L/kg, with a few exceptions) also indicate that biodegradation/transformation was responsible for the removal of the target PhACs. Ecotoxicological assessment indicated that the environment concentrations of single compounds (including sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, azithromycin and erythromycin-H2O) in effluent and sludge, as well as the mixture of the 21 detected PhACs in effluent sludge and receiving water had a significant ecotoxicological risk to algae. Therefore, further control of PhACs in effluent and sludge is required before their discharge and application to prevent their introduction into the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, effects of a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater on activity or acetoclastic methanogens within a lab-scale anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) were investigated. The CSTR was initially fed with glucose and loaded up to an organic loading rate of 6 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) at which 92% soluble COD removal efficiency was achieved. Acetoclastic methanogenic activity was found to be 336 mL CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). The CSTR was then, fed with several dilutions of preaerated wastewater with glucose at 10% wtv(-1), 30% wtv(-1), and 70% wtv(-1) ratios and followed by 100% wtv(-1) preaerated wastewater. In the latter, 71% soluble COD removal efficiency was obtained and a maximum acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 166 mL CH4 gTVS(-1)d(-1). Finally, raw wastewater diluted with preaerated wastewater was fed into the CSTR in increasing ratios of 10-60% wtv(-1). Total failure of anaerobic reactor was observed at 60% wtv(-1) raw wastewater fed. The study was, therefore, discontinued due to poor acetoclastic methanogenic activity of reactor sludge which was totally distorted.

AB The pharmaceutical industry constitutes an important place in terms of health and environment, both in our country and throughout the world. Various complex organic chemicals are present in the wastewater generated by pharmaceutical industries. The accumulation of toxic and persistent organic substances in wastewater is a serious problem for the environment. Therefore, it is important that pharmaceutical industry wastewater is treated before being discharged into receiving waters. Today, anaerobic treatment systems are commonly used for wastewater-containing high organic matter. The first stage of this study statistically investigates the optimization of anaerobic treatment conditions of pharmaceutical industry wastewater in a batch study. In the second stage, continuous treatment processes were planned using data obtained as a result of the batch study. For processing, an upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactor was used for treating substrate mixtures containing 10-100% pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The effects of operating parameters on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and the methane production rate were evaluated. COD removal efficiencies of 93-97% were obtained for the pharmaceutical industry wastewater using a 2.5-4d hydraulic retention time and a 0.6-2.2g CODd(-1) organic loading rate. The overall results suggested that the mixed bacterial and archaeal biomass was able to efficiently treat pharmaceutical industry wastewater under determined anaerobic conditions.

For the studied antibiotic, wastewater ozonation was found to be the most effective among the three tested AOPs.

AB To augment the removal of pharmaceuticals different conventional and alternative wastewater treatment processes and their combinations were investigated. We tested the efficiency of (1) two distinct laboratory scale biological processes: suspended activated sludge and attached-growth biomass, (2) a combined hydrodynamic cavitation hydrogen peroxide process and (3) UV treatment. Five pharmaceuticals were chosen including ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac, and an active metabolite of the lipid regulating agent clofibric acid.
   Biological treatment efficiency was evaluated using lab-scale suspended activated sludge and moving bed biofilm flow-through reactors, which were operated under identical conditions in respect to hydraulic retention time, working volume, concentration of added pharmaceuticals and synthetic wastewater composition. The suspended activated sludge process showed poor and inconsistent removal of clofibric acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac, while ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen yielded over 74% removal. Moving bed biofilm reactors were filled with two different types of carriers i.e. Kaldnes K1 and Mutag BioChip (TM) and resulted in higher removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and diclofenac. Augmentation and consistency in the removal of diclofenac were observed in reactors using Mutag BioChip (TM) carriers (85%+/- 10%) compared to reactors using Kaldnes carriers and suspended activated sludge (74%+/- 22% and 48%+/- 19%, respectively). To enhance the removal of pharmaceuticals hydrodynamic cavitation with hydrogen peroxide process was evaluated and optimal conditions for removal were established regarding the duration of cavitation, amount of added hydrogen peroxide and initial pressure, all of which influence the efficiency of the process. Optimal parameters resulted in removal efficiencies between 3-70%. Coupling the attached-growth biomass biological treatment, hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment resulted in removal efficiencies of >90% for clofibric acid and >98% for carbamazepine and diclofenac, while the remaining compounds were reduced to levels below the LOD. For ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac the highest contribution to overall removal was attributed to biological treatment, for clofibric acid UV treatment was the most efficient, while for carbamazepine hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment were equally efficient.

AB Parabens are preservatives widely used in pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). This study investigated urban water pollution by parabens from a watershed perspective. Water and sediment samples were collected from one of the most polluted urban streams in China. Six parabens and five paraben metabolites were frequently detected in the samples, whereas the overall pollution level was intermediate according to a global comparison. The spatial distributions of the chemical concentrations along the river are influenced by multiple factors, and WWTPs appear to be a major factor. In general, the target pollutants were detected at higher concentrations in the dry season than in the wet season, but extraordinary concentration peaks in water were observed downstream of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), indicating a dominant contribution from combined sewage overflows (CSOs) during rainfall events. In a representative WWTP-influenced reach, CSOs account for its 97.3% of Sigma parabens input and 96.9% of Sigma metabolites input in a typical rainfall event. Converting the existing combined sewer systems to separate stormwater drainage systems could reduce the inputs of Sigma parabens and Sigma metabolites by 86.9-84.5%, respectively. This study highlights the role of urban drainage systems in preventing surface water pollution by PPCPs.
   Capsule: Urban drainage systems play a critical role in controlling pollution by parabens and their metabolites in urban surface water.

AB Extraction and analysis methods have been developed for the detection of the following four antibacterial agents and two natural estrogens in treated municipal wastewater sludge and commercial compost: sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), tetracycline (TET), oxytetracycline (OXY), estrone (E1), and 17 beta-estradiol (E2). The antibiotics and estrogens were extracted from secondary sludge and mixed compost using ultrasonic solvent extraction. Citric acid (pH 4.7) and methanol were used as extraction buffer, followed by tandem-solid-phase extraction cleanup, strong anion exchange + hydrophilic-lipophilic balance for antibiotics and CarboPrep/NAX for estrogens. For quantification, two different methods were employed, using HPLC-MS/MS, with an electrospray ionization source for antibiotics and an atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization source for estrogens. Recoveries were 11-31% for the sulfonamides (SMX and SDM) and tetracyclines (TET and OXY) and 30-59% for the estrogens (E1 and E2) over the entire method. Limits of detection for the extraction method were in the nanogram per gram range for dry weight sludge and compost samples. Neither of the two sulfonamide antibiotics was detected in secondary sludge or mixed compost samples. Estrogens were found in compost in amounts of 160 +/- 65 ng/g (E1) and 21 +/- 3 ng/g (E2), but not in sludge. The tetracyclines, as well as what is believed to be the 4-epimer of OXY, were found in both sludge and compost in amounts of 1.57 +/- 0.67 and 2.95 +/- 0.42 mu g/g (TET), 0.56 +/- 0.12 and 6.51 +/- 0.52 mu g/g (OXY), and 7.60 +/- 1.68 and 1.35 +/- 0.24 mu g/g (4-epi-OXY), respectively. These results indicate that sorption-prone compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and can persist through sludge digestion and that the composting process does not sufficiently eliminate these particular contaminants. Thus, biosolids (even composted) are an additional source of drug residues leaching into the environment, and it must be considered while using biosolids as fertilizer.

AB We optimised the simultaneous analysis of four analytes, namely three anti-influenza drugs (oseltamivir (OS), zanamivir (ZAN) and amantadine (AMN)) and one metabolite of OS (oseltamivir carboxylate (OC)), in sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent by verifying the types and conditions of solid phase extraction (SPE) appropriate for LC-MS/MS analysis. In summary, these target analytes were extracted from aqueous samples (30-50 mL) by using strong cation-exchange SPE cartridges (500 mg adsorbent) under acidic conditions (pH 3-4). After washing of the cartridges with acidified water (pH 3.0, 3 mL) and methanol (3 mL), the analytes were eluted with a mixed solvent (2 mL) of 10% (v/v) triethylamine in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetone and water. Application of this technique to the target compounds should yield a comprehensive understanding of the occurrence and fate of anti-influenza drugs in the water environment.

AB We systematically investigated the occurrence and distribution of 93 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 5 artificial sweeteners (ASs) in surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin in south China. In surface water, 52 compounds were detected with median concentrations ranging from 0.06 ng/L to 504 ng/L, while in groundwater, 33 compounds were detected with concentrations up to 4580 ng/L for acesulfame. PPCPs and ASs were widely detected in the surface water and groundwater samples, which indicated contamination by domestic wastewater in the surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin. Temporal and spatial variations of the detected chemicals were observed in surfacewater. Acesulfame, sucralose and cyclamate can be used as wastewater indicators to imply contamination in groundwater caused by domestic wastewater due to their hydrophilicity, anthropogenic sources and ubiquity in ground water. Moreover, the detection of the readily degradable ASs, cyclamate, was a strong indication of untreated wastewater in groundwater. Sucralose was found to be a suitable wastewater indicator to reflect domestic wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater qualitatively and quantitatively, and it can be used to evaluate wastewater burden in surface water and groundwater of Dongjiang River basin. The wastewater burden data from this survey implied serious contamination in surface water and groundwater by domestic wastewater at Shima River, a tributary of the Dongjiang River. The findings from this study suggest that the selected labile and conservative chemicals can be used as indication of wastewater contamination for aquatic environments qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB Driven by the current development of quantitative structure-properties relationship (QSPR) methods in the environmental science, we proposed an approach based on chemometric tools for selection of appropriate physicochemical parameters of radiopharmaceuticals residuals for predicting of partitioning, hazards and biodegradation of such compounds into the environment or into wastewater treatment plant. The present scheme was successfully applied for prediction of missing values for 24 different physicochemical and assessment response of the environmental fate descriptors for 11 tetrazine derivatives and 12 cyclooctene derivatives. The multivariate statistics was also proved to be useful in the evaluation of the obtained modelling results for identification of the ecological effect of radiopharmaceuticals residuals. The presented approach can be one of the first steps and support tools in the assessment of chemicals in terms of their environmental impact. The problem studies are significant since it allows a special point of view to the underestimated radiopharmaceutical pollutants.

AB Recently, strict standards for ship domestic sewage discharge have been implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The high salinity of ship sewage was considered a key factor influencing the removal efficiency of ship sewage treatment systems. In the present study, the salinity effect on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) from ship domestic sewage was investigated by using a novel air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR). Enzyme activity analysis and wavelet neural network (WNN) models were built to determine the mechanisms of the process. The experimental results indicate that high salinity levels (> 21 g/L) had a negative impact on COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies, and low saline concentrations (<= 21 g/L) caused a negligible effect. The COD and NH4-N removal efficiencies were 84% and 97%, respectively, at a salinity of 21 g/L, which were higher than those at low salinities (i.e., 7 g/L and 14 g/L). Invertase and nitrate reductase had a close relationship with removal performance, and they can be considered important indicators reflecting the operation effort under saline environments. With high predictive accuracies, the constructed WNN models simulated the complex COD and NH4+-N removal processes well under different saline concentrations, ensuring the long-term stable operation of the AMCMBR under different salinities.

AB The present study investigates the biodegradation of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) by active biomass in activated sludge. Active heterotrophs (X-bh) which are known to govern COD removal are suggested as a determining factor for biological PhAC removal as well. Biodegradation kinetics of five polar PhACs were determined in activated sludge of two wastewater treatment plants which differed in size, layout and sludge retention time (SRT).
   Results showed that active fractions of the total suspended solids (TSS) differed significantly between the two sludges, indicating that TSS does not reveal information about heterotrophic activity. Furthermore, PhAC removal was significantly faster in the presence of high numbers of heterotrophs and a low SRI. Pseudo first-order kinetics were modified to include Xbh and used to describe decreasing PhAC elimination with increasing SRT. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were developed to investigate the main removal routes for 6 commonly found quinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pipemidic acid, and piromidic acid), in wastewaters from a wastewater treatment plant, at mu g L-1 levels in an aerobic sludge system from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant. It was demonstrated that sorption and biotransformation were the main removal routes for the target antibiotics over other possible pathways, as volatilization or hydrolysis, under the experimental conditions. Mass balances indicated that sorption on sludge played a dominant role in the elimination of antibiotics from waters. The sorption coefficient K-d depended strongly on temperature and on the quinolone type and were higher at lower temperatures and for piperazinylic quinolones. K-d values were between 516 and 3746 L kg(-1) in the temperature range of 9-38 degrees C. Higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MISS) increased quinolone removal efficiency mainly by sorption. Quinolone biodegradation constituted a secondary pathway, and could be described by first-order kinetics with degradation-rate constants ranging from 8.0x10(-4) h(-1) to 1.4x10(-2) h(-1) within the same temperature range and MISS from 7000 to 15,000 mg L-1. Biodegradation depended on the MISS and temperature, but also on the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD). Higher biodegradation rates were observed at higher MISS and temperature, as well as at low initial COD. Ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin registered the highest biodegradation percentages (52.8% and 47.2%, respectively, at 38 degrees C and 15,000 mg L-1 MLSS), which is evidence that, despite the known persistence of this group of antibiotics and removal from waters mainly by sorption, it was possible to improve their removal by biodegradation, with an appropriate selection of conditions and control of process variables, as a preliminary step towards the elimination of these antibiotics from the environment. Further research is needed on the possibilities of removing sorbed antibiotics from sludge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the spatial extent of a wastewater-influenced water mass (plume) originating from a wastewater treatment plant outlet in Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva) was monitored by two manned submersibles from June to August 2011. The main goal was to assess whether micropollutants in the wastewater mass cause an ecotoxicological risk to the aquatic environment, and to determine how far the zone of risk extends beyond the wastewater outlet. Real-time measurements of elevated electrical conductivity were used as a proxy to indicate the presence of wastewater-influenced water. Conductivity was highest in immediate proximity to the wastewater outlet, though if all measurements obtained over the duration of the sampling campaign were integrated, elevated conductivity extended over an area of at least 1 km(2) surrounding the outlet. Additionally, water samples were collected within and outside Vidy Bay, and were analyzed for 39 micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and corrosion inhibitors). Micropollutant concentrations were generally in the low ng/L range, though for some substances > 100 ng/L was measured. The concentrations of most pharmaceuticals, which are primarily wastewater-derived, decreased with decreasing conductivity and with increasing distance from the wastewater outlet. Pesticide concentrations, in contrast, were homogeneous throughout Vidy Bay and the lake. An ecotoxicological risk assessment based on the cumulative risk exerted by all measured substances indicated that the wastewater caused a zone of potential ecotoxicological risk that extended well into the deep lake and in the direction of a downstream drinking water intake.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment may pose a potential risk for humans and ecosystems. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are recognized as one of the main sources of these chemicals into both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The objectives of the study were to determine the presence of a wide variety of PhACs (n = 45) in sewage-impacted sediments and soils from the Guadalete River basin (SW Spain) by developing and applying an environmentally friendly multi-residue method based on pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE). Different parameters were optimized, including extraction temperature, pH, solvents, and clean-up. Extraction recoveries were analyte dependent, varying between 50% and 140% for most of the analytes when using pure water as extraction solvent at 100 degrees C. Determination of PhACs was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), enabling method detection (mLODs) and quantification (mLOQs) limits between <0.01 and 0.83 ng g(-1) and from 0.02 to 2.75 ng g(-1), respectively. Regarding the sampling area, 14 out of 45 target compounds were detected in soils and sediments. Analgesicianti-inflammatories was the therapeutic group most commonly detected, reaching concentrations up to 20 ng g(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane filtration applications are omnipresent in production processes of the food and beverage industry, in pharmaceutical production and the petrochemical industry but also in water purification for drinking water production and wastewater treatment. The main separation principle in membrane filtration is based on size exclusion which is dependent on the pore size of the membrane. Current developments based on chemical modification of these membranes have the goal to confer an additional chemical selectivity to membranes in order to broaden their areas of application. Here we present two examples of chemical membrane modifications pursued at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) which are based on a) polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM or LbL) coatings and b) coating with stimulus responsive polymer brushes. Applications of such modified filtration membranes are e.g. selectively gated filtration and phosphorous P-recovery from acidic disintegrated sewage sludge.

AB There are a number of reports in the literature which describe the occurrence of so-called emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, in surface water. Few of these studies have reported values fro m large cities in relatively and areas, such as in Spain. The persistence of some pharmaceuticals to usual wastewater treatments allows their discharge into surface waters. It is increasingly evident that mental health problems are of special concern for public health since psychiatric drugs are used in large amounts. Compared to other countries, Spain has a high pharmaceutical consumption rate, and Madrid metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of different psychoactive pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the main rivers of Madrid metropolitan area: Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tajo. Sampling was done downstream of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into these rivers. Control points upstream of STPs discharge points were also sampled. Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites for analysis were selected according to human consumption and prescription rates in Madrid, and the availability of valid techniques for detection. We observed residues of the antidepressants fluoxetine (80% of the sampling sites), citalopram (60%) and venlafaxine (100%). the anxiolytics nordiazepam (90%). oxazepam (80%) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (10%) and the anticonvulsant carabamazepine (70%). Measured concentrations equalled or exceeded those reported for other geographical areas, although there is a pronounced lack of information for the anxiolytics and venlafaxine. This is of special concern given that Wyeth-Ayerst's venlafaxine, Effexor, was the 10th greatest selling pharmaceutical worldwide in 2006. We conclude that the origin of pharmaceutical pollution in the rivers of Madrid is mainly the discharge of sewage treatment plants in Madrid's metropolitan area and a comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented.

AB It is now well established that residues from therapeutic drugs consumed by humans can end up, through the sewage system, in the surface water of populated areas. Given that the global production of major illicit drugs is comparable to that of widely used pharmaceuticals, we tested for the presence of drugs of abuse (cocaine, opioids, amphetamines and cannabis derivatives), some related opioid pharmaceuticals (codeine and methadone) and or their metabolites in Italian and British surface waters. Having identified residues of all major drugs abuse in raw and treated urban wastewater, we now measured their levels in several rivers and lakes by a selective multi-residue assay based on liquid chromatography-tandern mass spectrometry.
   Recoveries in surface water were generally higher than 80%, with overall variability of the method lower than 10%. LODs were generally lower than 0.2 ng/L, and LOQs were lower than 0.6 ng/L, with few exceptions. Many of the tested substances were found in both rivers and lakes, at concentrations ranging from high pg/L to high ng/L, with loads in rivers in the range of tenths to hundreds of grams per day. our data indicate that residues of drugs of abuse have become widespread surface water contaminants in populated areas. Since most of these residues still have potent pharmacological activities, their presence in the aquatic environment may have potential implications for human health and wildlife.

AB The degradation of four pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) by ozonation was studied under a range of experimental conditions, including ozone dosage and concentration of target compounds. The concentration profile of the pharmaceuticals and detection of any by-products formed was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. CBZ, DCF, TMP and SMX at initial concentration of 5mg/L each were degraded to below the method detection limit (1g/L) when they reacted with 1.6, 2.3, 2.8 and 4.5mg/L of ozone, respectively. For each parent compound several by-products were detected after the ozone treatment. A number of these by-products have not been previously reported in the literature. Some of these by-products were founds to be quite resistant to ozone up to applied ozone dosages of 15mg/L.

AB We surveyed four different river systems in the Greater Montreal region, upstream and downstream of entry points of contamination, from April 2007 to January 2009. The studied compounds belong to three different groups: PPCPs (caffeine, carbamazepine, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and trimethoprim), hormones (progesterone, estrone, and estradiol), and triazine herbicides and their metabolites (atrazine, deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, simazine, and cyanazine). In the system A. B, and C having low flow rate and high TOC, we observed the highest detection frequencies and mass flows of PPCPs compared to the other compounds, reflecting discharge of urban contaminations through WWTPs and CSOs. However, in River D, having high flow rate and low TOC, comparable frequency of detection of triazine and their by-products and PPCPs, reflecting cumulative loads of these compounds from the Great Lakes as well as persistency against natural attenuation processes. Considering large differences in the removal efficiencies of caffeine and carbamazepine, a high ratio of caffeine/carbamazepine might be an indicative of a greater proportion of raw sewage versus treated wastewater in surface waters. In addition, caffeine appeared to be a promising indicator of recent urban fecal contaminations, as shown by the significant correlation with FC (R-2 = 0.45), while carbamazepine is a good indicator of cumulative persistence compounds.

AB This work reports the development of an analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of three fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin ( CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL) in soil matrix. The proposed method was performed by using microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE), solid-phase extraction (SPE) for samples purification, and finally the pre-concentrated samples were analyzed by HPLC detector. In this study, various organic solvents were tested to extract the test compounds, and the extraction performance was evaluated by testing various parameters including extraction solvent, solvent volume, extraction time, temperature and number of the extraction cycles. The current method showed a good linearity over the concentration ranging from 1 - 300ng g(-1) with correlation coefficients (r(2) > 0.998) for all test compounds. Good recoveries were also obtained for the test compounds ranged from 89 - 99 %. The relative standard deviation (RSD) from intra-day and inter-day precision was lower than 7%, and the detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits ranged from 0.9 - 2.7ng g(-1). Finally, the proposed method was applied to determine the target compounds in real soil samples irrigated with wastewater. The results confirm the presence of the test compounds in soils with values ranging from 1.9 - 4.6ng g(-1), as well as the suitability of the proposed method to determine the test compounds in real soil matrix as well as the ability of the test compounds to accumulate in soils irrigated with sewage.

AB Soil and sludge are major reservoirs of organic compounds such as fluoroquinolones (FQs) which are broadspectrum antibacterial agents. Hence, we monitored three major FQs, namely, ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR), and ofloxacin (OFL), in surface soil from two major dumpsites and dry and wet sludge from sewage treatment plants in Chennai city. The mean concentration of FQs in soil and sludge samples were 20 mu g/g and 26 mu g/g, respectively. Nearly 50% of the total FQs in dumpsite soil was contributed by CIP followed by NOR (32%) and OFL (13%). Similarly, CIP was the major contributor in sludge samples followed by NOR and OFL. The concentration of FQs was two folds higher in wet sludge than dry sludge most likely indicating that water solubility of these compounds might play an important role for elevated level of FQs in wet sludge. Solid waste from pharmaceutical industries, households, and sludge from wastewater treatment plants were expected to be the major source of FQs in dumpsite soil. Predicted risk assessment using soil to water migration concentrations via surface run off indicated high risk to aquatic organisms. However, risk quotient (RQ) was found less to earthworm in most of the soil samples. The findings from this study might help in future policies on disposal of household antibiotics in the solid waste stream.

AB The occurrence of 43 pharmaceuticals belonging to predominant therapeutic classes and their distribution in surface water, suspended solids and sediments has been investigated in the Ebro river basin in the Northeast of Spain. WWTP effluents were found to be a main source of contamination and the spatial distribution was affected by the river flow at the sampling point and corresponding dilution factor, resulting in higher concentrations and higher loads in small tributary rivers than in the Ebro river. The study showed that some compounds are preferentially found bound to suspended solids and not detected in river water. Generally, compounds with basic characteristics (pKa > 7) showed higher tendency to bind to suspended solids. The sediment samples generally presented lower concentrations than suspended solids.

AB Antineoplastics in excreta from patients have been considered to be one of the origins of cytotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic contaminants in surface water. Recent studies have demonstrated that antineoplastics in clinical wastewater can be detoxified by electrolysis. In this study, to develop a method for the detoxification of antineoplastics in excreta, methotrexate solution in the presence of human urine was electrolyzed and evaluated. We found that urine inhibits detoxification by electrolysis; however, this inhibition decreased by diluting urine. In urine samples, the concentrations of active chlorine generated by anodic oxidation from 0.9% NaCl solution for inactivation of antineoplastics increased in dilution-dependent and time-dependent manner. These results indicate that electrolysis with platinum-based iridium oxide composite electrode is a possible method for the detoxification of a certain antineoplastic in urine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study examined the removal of varying concentrations of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (CIP) over the long-term (120 days) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The results showed that 50-76% CIP was removed with 0.5-1.5 mg CIP/L in the feed, although at 4.7 mg/L its removal efficiency decreased to < 20%. It was found that biological degradation was the main mechanism for removing CIP, while adsorption onto the sludge only contributed a small fraction, and an even smaller fraction was due to the waste sludge discharged. CIP was biodegraded to some degree in the AnMBR, with some intermediate compounds detected using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. This work showed the effectiveness of an AnMBR in removing CIP at low concentrations of < 1.5 mg/L, and hence may be an effective treatment for removing other antibiotics from wastewater.

AB Global water scarcity is driving the need for identifying new water source. Wastewater could be a potential water resource if appropriate treatment technologies could be developed. One of the barriers to obtaining high quality water from wastewater arises from the presence of organic micropollutants, which are biologically active at trace levels. Removal of these compounds from wastewater by current physico-chemical technologies is prohibitively expensive. While biological treatment processes are comparatively cheap, current systems are not capable of degrading the wide range of organic micropollutants present in wastewater. As current wastewater treatment processes were developed for treating conventional pollutants present at mg/L levels, degrading the ng/L levels of micropollutants will require a different approach to system design and operation. In this paper we discuss strategies that could be employed to develop biological wastewater treatment systems capable of degrading organic micropollutants.

AB This work reports the occurrence and the removal of a wide spectrum of pesticides in municipal wastewaters from the Agrinio region, Greece. Analytical determination was carried out by means of solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatography equipped with flame thermionic and mass spectrometric detection. The herbicides atrazine, alachlor, isoproturon, and s-metolachlor and the insecticides diazinon, methidathion, fenthion and chlorpyriphos, were more frequently detected in influent and effluent samples while they were also detected in river samples. Isoproturon and diazinon showed the highest concentrations in influent samples that reached concentrations up to 2,328 and 1,486 ng L(-1), respectively. Secondary treatment and cumulative removal rates for herbicides and insecticides ranged between 23-91%, 21- > 99% and 36- > 99%, 38- > 99%, respectively. The data demonstrate that there are significant levels of pesticides entering river waterways.

AB NPRO membrane filtration processes have been recognized as an important technology to facilitate water recycling. Those processes are well-proven technologies, which can be used to remove a wide range of contaminants including trace contaminants that are of particular concern in water recycling. However, risk implications in association with brine or concentrate and membrane cleaning wastewater disposal have to date not been adequately understood. This study examines the adsorption and release process of several endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during NF/RO filtration processes. Results reported here indicate that the membrane can serve as a large reservoir for EDCs and their release may be possible during membrane cleaning, or erratic pH variation during operation. Treatment of membrane cleaning solution should be carefully considered when EDCs are amongst the target contaminants in NF/RO membrane filtration.

The overall concentration of PPCPs in the River Ganges ranged between Below Detectable Limit (BDL) to 1104.84 ng/L, with higher concentrations at anthropogenically influenced lower reaches of the River Ganges at Haridwar. Acetaminophen, triclosan, N, N diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), tetracycline, and caffeine showed the highest detection frequency (>90-100%) in the river. PPCPs concentration, especially for NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, ketoprofen and acetaminophen), antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and ofloxacin) and metabolite (salicylic acid) was found to be higher in winter compared to summer in the Ganges, possibly due to the lower biodegradation efficiency related to lesser temperatures and inadequate sunlight. While metoprolol (beta-blockers), triclosan (antibacterial), DEET (insect repellent) and caffeine (human indicator) showed a higher load in summer, possibly due to their intense uses during this period. Results of risk quiescent (RQ) revealed higher ecological risk for algae while the moderate risk for river fish biota. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Toxic compounds in sewage or industrial wastewater may inhibit the biological activity of activated sludge impairing the treatment process. This paper evaluates the Inhibition Capacity Index (ICI) for the assessment of activated sludge in the presence of toxicants. In this study, activated sludge was obtained from industrial treatment plants and was also synthetically produced. Continuous respirometric measurements were carried out in a reactor, and the oxygen uptake rate profile obtained was used to evaluate the impact of inhibiting toxicants, such as dissolved copper, phenol, sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate and amoxicillin, on activated sludge. The results indicate that ICI is an efficient tool to quantify the intoxication capacity. The activated sludge from the pharmaceutical industry showed higher resistance than the sludge from other sources, since toxicants are widely discharged in the biological treatment system. The ICI range was from 58 to 81% when compared to the synthetic effluent with no toxic substances.

AB The production of pharmaceuticals has increased rapidly during the last several decades as they have been used for the health of both humans and animals. Routes of environmental exposure include the release of treated wastewater, the land disposal of livestock manures and municipal biosolids (i.e. sewage sludge), as well as the use of medicated aquaculture feed. This study deals with application of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes for removing of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone and febantel) and their mixture. According to the results obtained in this work the use of RO (LFC-1 and XLE) and the tight NF (NF90) membranes are recommended to achieve a high level of retention (>95%) of all selected veterinary antibiotics (VAs). Nanofiltration NF270, NF and HL membranes showed a lower rejection of individual components, but much higher in a mixture solution, due to the synergistic effect.

AB Pharmaceuticals are quite common but very harmful environmental contaminants. Major part of them are non-steroidal compounds. Data on the risk connected with the presence of such contaminants in surface waters are scattered; however, it was confirmed that one of the important sources of these micropollutants are wastewater treatment plants. Because of this preventive action not only monitoring should be recommended. For recommendation, detailed knowledge not only on effects but also on removal efficiencies is necessary. The aim of this study is to describe the possibilities of degradation and removal of 10, the most frequently present in surface waters, non-steroidal pharmaceuticals. Removal effectiveness of pharmaceutical can be in the range from several to even 100% and is affected by properties of individual compounds, treatment technology, and technological parameters. The most effective processes seem to be advanced oxidation processes.

AB In recent years, interest in the presence of chemical and biological pollutants (drugs, pesticides, heavy metals etc.) in sewage water has been permanently increasing and, at the same time, significant effort to eliminate them has been shown. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of ferrates activity on the decomposition of the drug diclofenac (DCF), which is commonly present in sewage water. The main task is to follow the effect of potassium ferrate dosage on DCF degradation and to evaluate the most effective ferrates concentration in solution. Subsequently, real samples of waste water containing a significant amount of various micro-pollutants were treated by the same amount of ferrates as laboratory samples. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for the sample analysis. Ferrates removal effectiveness was determined by comparing the chromatographic peak areas of residual DCF in the treated samples. Removal efficiency of diclofenac is proportional to the concentration of potassium ferrate in the treated solutions.

AB Reusing wastewater in agriculture has attracted increasing attention as a strategy to support the transition towards the circular economy in the water and agriculture sector. As a consequence, there is great interest in solutions for governing the transactions and interdependences between the associated value chains. This paper explores the institutions and governance structures for coordinating transactions and interdependences between actors in linked value chains of wastewater treatment and crop production. It aims to analyze how transactions and interdependences shape the governance structures for reusing wastewater at the local level. A transaction costs analysis based on data from semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire is applied to the agricultural wastewater reuse scheme of the Wastewater Association Braunschweig (Germany). The results show that different governance structures are needed to match with the different properties and requirements of the transactions and activities between linked value chains of wastewater treatment and crop production. Interdependences resulting from transactions between wastewater providers and farmers increase the need for hybrid and hierarchical elements in the governance structures for wastewater reuse. The authors conclude that aligning governance structures with transactions and interdependences is key to efficiently governing transactions and interdependences between linked value chains in a circular economy.

AB Groundwater in urban areas can be affected by numerous wastewater sources. Distinguishing these sources can facilitate better management of urban water resources and wastewater, and protection of urban aquatic environments. A single wastewater tracer, even if ideal (i.e. low background levels, non-reactive, low detection limits, etc.), would be unable to accomplish this task. Here, we investigated the potential advantages of using a suite of anthropogenic chemicals as co-tracers to distinguish wastewater sources that contribute to groundwater contamination at two urban sites. We considered both relatively ubiquitous and non-ubiquitous tracers in wastewater. At the Jasper (Alberta, Canada) site, concentrations of an artificial sweetener, two pharmaceutical compounds, and a degradate of nicotine in groundwater were strongly correlated as co-tracers. This evidence, along with the similar spatial distributions of these co-tracers could be used to delineate and distinguish a single municipal wastewater plume. At the Barrie (Ontario, Canada) site, there was moderate to strong correlation of the wastewater co-tracers, but local differences in their distributions and in the ratios of their concentrations could be used to infer that mixtures of two or more domestic septic plumes were present in the groundwater at this site. This study demonstrates the benefit of applying a suite of tracers to urban groundwater affected by wastewater contamination. This approach should be applicable at other urban sites.

AB A multilayer internal electrolysis reactor treating actual pharmaceutical wastewater was established to evaluate the ecological safety and feasibility of internal electrolysis processes. Our findings showed that about 20 % COD of the pharmaceutical wastewater was removed by the internal electrolysis reactor. The COD removal efficiencies increased initially and then decreased with the increase in influent concentrations. The best COD removal was observed at pH 4. Additionally, injection of air into the reactor can promote COD removal compared with non-aeration conditions. All eta(B/C) and eta(ROUR) values under every condition were positive, which indicated the enhancement effects on the wastewater biodegradability after treatment. The effects of influent COD concentrations on eta(B/C) and eta(ROUR) showed a similar trend with that of COD removal, suggesting that the biodegradability enhancement was mainly caused by COD removal in wastewater. High pH helped to improve the wastewater biodegradability while aeration lowered the biodegradability enhancements.

AB Although conventional wastewater treatment technologies are effective at removing many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from municipal wastewater, some contaminants are not removed efficiently. Ozonation may be a treatment option for reducing the concentrations of recalcitrant CECs in wastewater, but this process may generate toxic transformation products. In the present study, we conducted semibatch experiments to ozonate municipal wastewater effluent spiked with 5 commonly detected CECs. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether ozonation increased or decreased biological responses indicative of sublethal toxicity in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with extracts prepared from ozonated and nonozonated wastewater effluent. Blood, liver, and brain tissues were collected from the fish at 72 h post injection for analysis of a battery of biomarkers. In fish i.p. injected with the extracts from nonozonated wastewater effluent, significant induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) was observed, but ozonation of the municipal wastewater effluent spiked with CECs significantly reduced this estrogenic response. However, in fish injected with extracts from spiked municipal wastewater effluent after ozonation, the balance of hepatic glutathione in its oxidized (glutathione disulfide [ GSSG]) form was altered, indicating oxidative stress. Levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin were significantly elevated in brain tissue from trout injected with the extracts from ozonated spiked municipal wastewater effluent, a biological response that has not been previously reported in fish. Other in vivo biomarkers showed no significant changes across treatments. These results indicate that ozonation reduces the estrogenicity of wastewater, but may increase other sublethal responses. The increase in biomarker responses after ozonation may be because of the formation of biologically active products of transformation of CECs, but further work is needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB Increasing concentration of antibiotics in environment and their subinhibitory concentrations in wastewater may result in increased antibiotic resistance of present bacteria. Therefore, this study was aimed to analyze the efficiency of coagulase-positive staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus inhibition in wastewater by electrochemical methods and addition of ferrates. Advanced electrochemical oxidation by boron doped diamond electrodes in anode; cathode and anode-cathode connection were used for wastewater disinfection. Results showed that the most effective connection was the anodic one, as complete inhibition of coagulasepositive staphylococci as well as of S. aureus was observed after 40 min. Energy consumption was 3.69 kWh/m(3) for effluent wastewater disinfection. The second studied method of wastewater disinfection was the application of powdered ferrates. Addition of 100 mg of ferrates resulted in the inhibition of 84-96 % of coagulasepositive staphylococci and 97-99 % of S. aureus in influent water, while the inhibition of coagulase-positive staphylococci and S. aureus was 61-83 % and 83-86 %, respectively, in effluent wastewater.

AB In many parts of the world, clean water has become increasingly scarce. Irrigation of agricultural land with treated wastewater is commonly used in response to water shortages but there is concern about the environmental fate and transport of contaminants present in the irrigation wastewater. This study aimed to examine the presence of wastewater sourced contaminants in soil and field grown corn (Zea mays) crops spray irrigated with treated wastewater. Soil, corn grain, leaves, and roots were sampled and tested from a long-term wastewater irrigation site as well as a non-irrigated control site in close geographic proximity. Samples were analyzed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) and both targeted and non-targeted analyses were conducted to determine chemical differences between the wastewater irrigated and control samples. Target compounds detected and quantified in the samples include herbicides, phthalates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Non-targeted analysis showed chemical differences between each the wastewater irrigated and control samples. Furthermore, new chloro-dimethyl-benzotriazole compounds, which are suspected to be transformation products created by the chlorine disinfection process of the wastewater treatment plant, were tentatively identified in the wastewater effluent. Twenty of these new benzotriazoles were detected and semi-quantified in the wastewater irrigated soil samples at a maximum concentration of 472 ng/g. Eight of the most abundant benzotriazoles were also detected in the corn roots at concentrations up to 56 ng/g.

AB We analyzed the conjoint effects of sewage inputs and hydrological alteration on the occurrence of teratological forms and on the assemblage composition of stream benthic diatoms. The study was performed in 11 Mediterranean streams which received treated or untreated urban sewage (Impact sites, I), whose composition and morphological anomalies were compared to upstream unaffected (Control, C) sites. The impact sites had high concentrations of ammonium, phosphorus, and pharmaceutical compounds (antibiotics, analgesics, and anti-inflammatories), particularly in those receiving untreated sewage. Impact sites had a higher proportion of teratological forms as well as a prevalence of diatom taxa tolerant to pollution. The differences in the diatom assemblage composition between the paired C and I sites were the largest in the impacted sites that received untreated sewage inputs as well as in the systems with lower dilution capacity. In these sites, the diatom assemblage was composed by a few pollution-tolerant species. Mediterranean river systems facing hydrological stress are highly sensitive to chemical contamination, leading to the homogenization of their diatom assemblages. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB This study was performed to understand the dynamics of the microbial community of submerged membrane bioreactor during the acclimatization process to treat the hospital wastewater. In this regard, three acclimatization phases were examined using a mixture of synthetic wastewater (SWW) and real hospital wastewater (HWW) in the following proportions; In Phase 1: 75:25 v/v (SWW: HWW); Phase 2: 50:50 v/v (SWW: HWW); and Phase 3: 25:75 v/v (SWW: HWW) of wastewater. The microbial community was analyzed using Illumina high throughput sequencing to identify the bacterial and micro-eukaryotes community in SMBR. The acclimatization study clearly demonstrated that shift in microbial community composition with time. The dominance of pathogenic and degrading bacterial communities such as Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Zoogloea was observed at the phase 3 of acclimatization. This study witnessed the major shift in the micro-eukaryotes community, and the proliferation of fungi Basidiomycota was observed in phase 3 of acclimatization.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are generated through complex manufacturing processes that contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents, and are usually characterized by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. Therefore, it must be treated. The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) using the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) method was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The effects of H2O2 dosage, reaction time, temperature, initial COD, and concentration of ethylene glycol on COD removal were studied with laboratory bench-scale experiments. The results indicated that the removal process was more effective under experimental conditions. Adding ethylene glycol accelerates the destruction of pharmaceutical wastewater. The best COD removal of pharmaceutical wastewater reached 97.8%. This investigation will provide a fundamental method for developing a pretreatment method of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater with flexibility, simplicity and high activity.

AB The pyrolysis kinetics of two types of sewage sludge (municipal sludge and pharmaceutical sludge) were studied by thermogravimetry. The collected samples were pretreated and tested with nitrogen as carrier gas at different heating rates (10, 20, 30, and 40 ?C/min) using a thermogravimetric analyzer. Model-free methods and master plots method were used to calculate the pyrolysis kinetic parameters of the samples. TG/DTG results showed that the thermal decomposition of the two types of sewage sludge may be divided into three stages (Dehydration, Decomposition, and Coking stage). The activation energies of the two kinds of sewage sludge were 366.58 KJ/mol (municipal sludge) and 268.36 KJ/mol (pharmaceutical sludge), respectively. The pyrolysis mechanism of two kinds of sewage sludge was discussed by the master plots method. The results showed that under a low conversion rate, the phase interface reaction model can better explain the pyrolysis mechanism of pharmaceutical sludge; under high conversion rate, the nucleation and growth model was more suitable. For municipal sludge, power law model was most suitable in the whole range. The pyrolysis characteristic of the samples was further studied. The results showed that the organic matter in sewage sludge can be decomposed into bio-oil and bio-gas at elevated temperatures and can be used as an attractive energy source. ? 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in industrial parks provide centralized treatment for industrial and domestic wastewater. However, the information on toxicity reduction of wastewater and its correlation with treatment process in industrial park is limited. This study compared the toxicity reduction of wastewater in 12 industrial park WWTPs based on battery of toxicity assays. Nine toxic endpoints involving microorganism, phytoplankton, zooplankton, plant and human cell lines were applied. All the influents of WWTPs induced high toxicities, which were significantly reduced after the treatments from 7 of the studied WWTPs. However, the effluents of five WWTPs induced higher toxicity in one or more toxic endpoints compared to the influents. This study also found that most of anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(2)/O)-based processes had good removal efficiency of wastewater toxicity, while the sequencing batch reactor (SBR)-based processes had the lowest removal efficiency. Moreover, low correlation coefficients were obtained among all toxic endpoints, indicating that battery of toxicity assays was necessary to completely characterize the toxicity and risk of wastewater in industrial parks. This study shed new lights to the toxicity reduction of wastewater and its correlation with treatment process, which is very useful for the design, management and operation of WWTPs in industrial parks.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) belonging to different therapeutic classes (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, antiepileptics, and lipid regulators) in hospital wastewater and surface water samples was investigated for the first time in Vietnam. Analytical results showed that 10 PhACs, including naproxen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, diclofenac, clofibric acid, gemfibrozil, and carbamazepine were detected at least once in the hospital wastewater samples. The detection of these PhACs in hospital wastewater demonstrates that hospital effluents are considered a significant source of pollution of the environment by pharmaceuticals. Our initial results showed that only ibuprofen was removed efficiently by the wastewater treatment plant at sampling site S2. The presence of PhACs in surface water samples may reflect the impacts of wastewater contamination in surface water bodies. The ubiquitous occurrence of carbamazepine in both wastewater and surface water may suggest that carbamazepine can potentially serve as a good molecular marker indicating wastewater contamination in surface water. A tentative assessment of environmental risk of PhACs for surface water has been discussed. Risk quotients higher than one were observed only for carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, suggesting that these compounds seem to show high risk for aquatic ecosystems.

AB Although sewage effluent application to land is a common approach to recycle water and provide nutrients to plants, bioactive pharmaceuticals contained in sewage may change soil quality by affecting soil microbial communities. Establishing causal effects, however, is difficult, because trace levels of pharmaceuticals are confounded with other effluent constituents. Therefore, two originally similar soil microbial communities, one irrigated in situ with sewage effluent for 12 years and another nonirrigated, were exposed to high levels of acetaminophen, aspirin, carbamazepine, chlorpromazine, and tetracycline. The objectives of the current study were to determine the influence of high levels of pharmaceuticals on several soil microbial properties, the effect that prolonged effluent irrigation with ambient levels of pharmaceuticals had on soil microbial function, and how this effect would change in response to pharmaceutical exposure. Several pharmaceuticals, at high exposure levels, imposed stress on the soil microbial community as judged by increased CO(2) respiration, decreased biomass carbon, and altered substrate utilization affinities. Prolonged effluent irrigation, which altered the genetic fingerprint of the microbial community, also mitigated the response that exposure to pharmaceuticals had on the microbial community and enabled degradation of the antimicrobial salicylic acid after aspirin exposure. In conclusion, prolonged irrigation with sewage effluent containing pharmaceuticals at ambient levels influenced the microbial community so that they were able to better cope with sudden exposure to high levels of pharmaceuticals.

AB Treatment with ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide was tested in a laboratory scale reactor for removal of organics from four different industrial wastewaters: wastewaters of a paper-mill and of a biotechnical pharmaceutical process as well as two process waters from soil remediation by supercritical water extraction. Moreover, an aqueous solution of triethyleneglycoldimethylether and humic acid which was a model for a biologically treated oil reclaiming wastewater was also oxidized. The aim of the oxidation of the pharmaceutical wastewater was the removal of the preservative 1.1.1-trichloro-2-methyl-2-propanol (TCMP). Although TCMP could easily be removed from pure aqueous solutions by treatment with ozone/hydrogen peroxide, the oxidation of the wastewater failed to be effective in TCMP degradation because of competitive ozonation of other organic solutes in the wastewater. The ozonation of the paper-mill wastewater and of the soil remediation process waters decreased COD and TOC to some extent. The presence of organic wastewater solutes which contain C-C double bonds (ligninsulfonic acid in the treated paper-mill effluent and humic acid in the oil reclaiming model wastewater) were shown to yield hydrogen peroxide by the reaction with ozone. Therefore, these wastewaters are efficiently ozonated even without addition of hydrogen peroxide. Chemical Oxidation of paper-mill wastewater and of wastewaters resulting from soil remediation did not improve biological degradability of organic wastewater constituents.

AB Effluents from sewage treatment plants contain a mixture of micropollutants with the potential of harming aquatic organisms. Thus, addition of advanced treatment techniques to complement existing conventional methods has been proposed. Some of the advanced techniques could, however, potentially produce additional compounds affecting exposed organisms by unknown modes of action. In the present study the aim was to improve our understanding of how exposure to different sewage effluents affects fish. This was achieved by explorative microarray and quantitative PCR analyses of hepatic gene expression, as well as relative organ sizes of rainbow trout exposed to different sewage effluents (conventionally treated, granular activated carbon, zonation (5 or 15 mg/L), 5 mg/L ozone plus a moving bed biofilm reactor, or UV-light treatment in combination with hydrogen peroxide). Exposure to the conventionally treated effluent caused a significant increase in liver and heart somatic indexes, an effect removed by all other treatments. Genes connected to xenobiotic metabolism, including cytochrome p450 1A, were differentially expressed in the fish exposed to the conventionally treated effluents, though only effluent treatment with granular activated carbon or ozone at 15 mg/L completely removed this response. The mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 kDa was induced in all three groups exposed to ozone-treated effluents, suggesting some form of added stress in these fish. The induction of estrogen-responsive genes in the fish exposed to the conventionally treated effluent was effectively reduced by all investigated advanced treatment technologies, although the moving bed biofilm reactor was least efficient. Taken together, granular activated carbon showed the highest potential of reducing responses in fish induced by exposure to sewage effluents. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change scenarios predict lower flow rates during summer that may lead to higher proportions of wastewater in small and medium sized streams. Moreover, micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals and other contaminants) continuously enter aquatic environments via treated wastewater. However, there is a paucity of knowledge, whether extended exposure to secondary treated wastewater disrupts important ecosystem functions, e.g. leaf breakdown. Therefore, the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum was exposed to natural stream water (n = 34) and secondary treated wastewater (n = 32) for four weeks in a semi-static test system under laboratory conditions. G. fossarum exposed to wastewater showed significant reductions in feeding rate (25%), absolute consumption (35%), food assimilation (50%), dry weight (18%) and lipid content (22%). Thus, high proportions of wastewater in the stream flow may affect both the breakdown rates of leaf material and thus the availability of energy for the aquatic food web as well as the energy budget of G. fossarum.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that can be used as a marker for the cleaning efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. Here, we present the optimization of a fast and easy on-site measurement system based on fluorescence polarization immunoassay and the successful application to wastewater. A new monoclonal highly specific anti-carbamazepine antibody was applied. The automated assay procedure takes 16 min and does not require sample preparation besides filtration. The recovery rates for carbamazepine in wastewater samples were between 60.8 and 104% with good intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variations (less than 15 and 10%, respectively). This automated assay enables for the on site measurement of carbamazepine in wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, concerns about the occurrence and fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients, solvents, intermediates and raw materials that could be present in water and wastewater including pharmaceutical industry wastewater has gained increasing attention. Traditional wastewater treatment methods, such as activated sludge, are not sufficient for the complete removal of active pharmaceutical ingredients and other wastewater constituents from these waters. As a result, complementary treatment methods such as membrane filtration, reverse osmosis and activated carbon are often used in conjunction with the traditional methods for treatment of industrial wastewater. Most of the literature published to date has been on the treatment of municipal wastewater. However, there is a growing body of research that looks at the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in industrial wastewater, the treatment of these wastewaters and the removal rates. This article, reviews these treatment methods and includes both traditional methods and advanced oxidation processes. The paper concludes by showing that the problem of pharmaceuticals in wastewaters cannot be solved merely by adopting end of pipe measures. At source measures, such as replacement of critical chemicals, reduction in raw material consumption should continue to be pursued as the top priority.

AB Pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are continuously introduced into the agroecosystem via reclaimed wastewater irrigation, a common agricultural practice in water-scarce regions. Although reclaimed wastewater irrigated crops are sold and consumed, only limited information is available on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and other CECs in edible produce. Here, we report data on CECs in irrigation water, soils, and crops collected from 445 commercial fields irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in Israel. The following produce were analyzed: leafy greens, carrot, potato, tomato, orange, tangerine, avocado, and banana. Pharmaceuticals and CECs were found in quantifiable levels in all irrigation water, soils, and plants (>99.6%). Leafy greens exhibited the largest number and the highest concentration of pharmaceuticals. Within the same crop, contamination levels varied due to wastewater source and quality of treatment, and soil characteristics. Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and gabapentin) were the most dominant therapeutic group found in the reclaimed wastewater-soil-plant continuum. Antimicrobials were detected in similar to 85% of the water and soil samples, however they exhibited low detection frequencies and concentrations in produce. Irrigation with reclaimed wastewater should be limited to crops where the risk for pharmaceutical transfer to the food chain is minimal.

AB A residential end use model (REUM) which accounts for indoor water demand, outdoor water demand, hot water demand, wastewater flow and the mass of total dissolved substances (TDS) In the wastewater, was earlier described by the authors. The integral relationship between water quality and quantity in the model allows for holistic modelling of different water demand management measures' effects. The model covers 16 independent micro-components of water use and requires numerous model parameters. This paper has the objective to prioritise the 79 parameters which remain after stripping all possible redundancy from the model in terms of their relative impact. Two ranking criteria are used: the elasticity and the sensitivity of each parameter. The results, benchmarked to a typical South African suburban residence, show that household size is the most notable parameter for modelling the indoor water demand, hot water demand and wastewater flow volume. Pan evaporation and a factor describing actual lawn irrigation in relation to theory are most notable for modelling the outdoor demand. Wastewater TDS concentration is dominated by what is added at the toilet rather than pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) added at other entry points to the wastewater system. The methodology developed and results obtained underpin the view that effective water demand management policies can only be rationally formulated with the assistance of a comprehensive water and wastewater model based on micro-components of water use.

AB Persistence of antibiotics in soil and aquatic ecosystem is the primary reason for the emergence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. After consumption, antibiotics are poorly retained in our body, and a major fraction is excreted out. These bioactive compounds end up in wastewater. The routine treatment practiced by the conventional wastewater treatment plants does not remove the entire load of antibiotics. Cost-effective and environment-friendly treatment technologies need to be developed to address this issue. Vetiver system is being adapted throughout the world due to its removal capacity and high tolerance toward several toxic organic and inorganic pollutants. In this study, we investigated the potential of vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides), a fast-growing, perennial grass capable of growing in a hydroponic setup, to remove two widely prescribed antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TTC) from secondary wastewater effluent. Significant (p < 0.05) removal of antibiotics and nutrients (N & P) by vetiver grass from secondary wastewater effluent was observed within 30 days. Vetiver grass removed more than 90% antibiotics from secondary wastewater matrix. In addition to antibiotics, vetiver grass also removed nitrate (>40%), phosphate (>60%), total organic carbon (>50%), and chemical oxygen demand (>40%) from secondary wastewater effluent.

AB Hydroxyquinone compounds, such as 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone and alizarin sulfonate, are widely used in dye manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other industries. However, the treatment of hydroxyquinone-containing wastewater has seldom been examined. This study used a precipitation method with barium salt to treat nano-silver industrial wastewater. The results show that barium chloride was a suitable reagent for significantly degrading COD and color from nano-silver wastewater. When the initial pH value was 10.5, 8 g of BaCl2 center dot 2H2O were added to 100 mL of wastewater. After reaction at 15 degrees C for 1 h, the removal efficiencies of COD and color in the nano-silver wastewater were 85.6% and 97.1%, respectively. Simulated wastewater containing sodium alizarin-3-sulfonate (ARS) or purpurin was used to further investigate the removal mechanism of hydroxyquinone compounds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and some related experiments showed that hydroxyquinone compounds can directly react with barium ions in the solution so as to transfer from wastewater to precipitate. In addition, the newly produced barium sulfate particles have positive surface charges, which can improve the removal efficiency of hydroxyquinone compounds due to electrostatic attraction.

AB Within this study, we were interested in the effects of wastewater on the development of antimicrobial resistance. Microorganisms can relatively promptly adapt to evolutionary pressures of the environment, including antibiotics. Therefore, we tested how the adaptability of the model microorganism Salmonella enterica is affected by wastewater full of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, and other micropollutants. Wastewater samples had been taken from effluent of hospitals and from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Petrzalka influent and effluent. In these samples, presence of 38 substances was monitored. The highest concentration was observed in case of tramadol, citalopram, venlafaxine, cotinine, atenolol, valsartan, carbamazepine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. According to this data, we focused also on individual pharmaceutical compounds presented in wastewater samples in elevated concentrations. Effect on resistance development of two pain relief medications (carbamazepine, tramadol), hypotensive medications (atenolol, valsartan), and the nicotine metabolite (cotinine) was also investigated. For this study, we employed concentrations presented in wastewater as well as in urine of patients and/or users. To determine the frequency of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance, we applied the modified Ames test employing the strain Salmonella Typhimurium. Resistance index increased in the case of all wastewater samples from conventional hospitals where we observed a 1.22-1.69-fold increase of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance. Tested compounds caused rise of resistance index in lower concentrations found in wastewater. The most significant increase of resistance index was detected after carbamazepine treatment.

AB Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater is a promising technology for clean analgin pharmaceutical wastewater utilisation. In this paper, hydrogen production by non-catalytic partial oxidation of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater was systematically investigated in supercritical water (SCW) with a continuous reactor for the first time. The influences of the main operating parameters including residence time, temperature and oxidant equivalent ratio (ER) on the gasification characteristics of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated. The experimental results showed that H-2 yield and carbon gasification efficiency (CE) increased with increasing temperature. CE increased with increasing ER, and H2 yield peaked when ER equaled 0.2. CE increased quickly within 180 s and then tended to be stable between 240 and 300 s.

AB Most conventional wastewater treatment plants remove very small amounts of micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals. Here, the ability of two different types of submerged nanofiltration flat sheet modules to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater is analyzed. The two nanofiltration membranes were used at relatively low pressures of only 0.3 and 0.7 bar. At such low pressures, the membranes did not retain salts to a great extent. This is advantageous in wastewater treatment because no salt concentrate is produced. Carbamazepine was retained only slightly by the nanofiltration membranes, whereas approximately 60% of diclofenac and naproxen were retained by both membranes. This level of effectiveness might not be enough to justify the use of such a system as an additional treatment step in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The study investigates the influence of process parameters on the effectiveness of ozonation in the removal of organic micro-pollutants from wastewater. Primary and secondary municipal wastewater containing phenol was treated. The effect of operating parameters such as initial pH, ozone dosage, and initial contaminant concentration was studied. An increase in contaminant decomposition with pH (3-11) was observed. The contaminant removal efficiencies increased with an increase in ozone dose rate (5.5-36.17 mg L-1 min(-1)). Furthermore, the ultraviolet absorbance (UV 254 nm) of the wastewater decreased during ozonation indicating the breakdown of complex organic compounds into low molecular weight organics. Along the reaction, the pH of wastewater decreased from 11 to around 8.5 due to the formation of intermediate acidic species. Moreover, the biodegradability of wastewaters, measured as biological and chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD), increased from 0.22 to 0.53. High ozone utilization efficiencies of up to 95% were attained thereby increasing the process efficiency; and they were dependent on the ozone dosage and pH of solution. Ozonation of secondary wastewater attained the South African water standards in terms of COD required for wastewater discharge and dissolved organic carbon in drinking water and increased significantly the biodegradability of primary wastewater.

AB Wastewater contains large amounts of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Only a little is known about the dissemination of resistance determinants and changes in soil microbial communities affected by wastewater irrigation. Community DNAs from Mezquital Valley soils under irrigation with untreated wastewater for 0 to 100 years were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for the presence of sul genes, encoding resistance to sulfonamides. Amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from community DNAs from soils irrigated for 0, 8, 10, 85, and 100 years was performed and revealed a 14% increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in rainy season soils and a 26.7% increase in dry season soils for soils irrigated for 100 years with wastewater. In particular, Gammaproteobacteria, including potential pathogens, such as Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter spp., were found in wastewater-irrigated fields. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 96 isolates from soils irrigated with wastewater for 100 years (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) revealed that 46% were affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria (mainly potentially pathogenic Stenotrophomonas strains) and 50% with the Bacilli, whereas all 96 isolates from rain-fed soils (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) were affiliated with the Bacilli. Up to six types of antibiotic resistance were found in isolates from wastewater-irrigated soils; sulfamethoxazole resistance was the most abundant (33.3% of the isolates), followed by oxacillin resistance (21.9% of the isolates). In summary, we detected an increase of potentially harmful bacteria and a larger incidence of resistance determinants in wastewater-irrigated soils, which might result in health risks for farm workers and consumers of wastewater-irrigated crops.

ID REJECTION
AB Considerable concern exists regarding the appearance and effects of trace and ultra trace pollutants in the aquatic environment. In this context, it is necessary to identify relevant hot spot wastewater - such as hospital wastewater - and to implement specific wastewater treatment solutions. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology seems to be a suitable pre-treatment approach for the subsequent advanced treatment by high pressure membrane systems such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). This paper is based upon investigations on the first full scale MBR for separate treatment of hospital wastewater in Germany. In this study an NF as well as an RO module for further treatment of the MBR filtrate were tested. The removal efficiencies were assessed using the following target compounds: bezafibrate, bisoprolol, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, telmisartan and tramadol. In summary, the results of this study confirmed that MBR technology followed by an advanced treatment for trace pollutant removal is an adequate approach for specific treatment of hot spot wastewater such as hospital wastewater. In particular, it was shown that - comparing the tested NF and RO - only (a two stage) RO is appropriate to remove pharmaceutical residues from hospital wastewater entirely. The recommended yield of the 2-stage RO is 70% which results in a retentate sidestream of 9%. Our investigations proved that RO is a very efficient treatment approach for elimination of trace pollutants.

AB Purpose Long-term microscale field experiments established at four sites in the Czech Republic (since 1996) were used for an assessment of the severity of the wide-scale contamination of treated soils by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as a result of the long-term regular pollutant load via sewage sludge and farmyard manure applications and for an estimation of the potential environmental risk caused by long-term pollutant inputs to agricultural soils.
   Material and methods The experimental plots were treated as follows: (i) NPK mineral fertilization (NPK); (ii) sewage sludge (SS1); (iii) sewage sludge applied at three times the rate compared to SS1 (SS2); (iv) farmyard manure (FYM); and (v) untreated control. Except for antibiotics, which showed results for all analyses below the detection limit, all groups of the analyzed compounds showed measurable contents in the treated soils.
   Results and discussion Among the POPs, the levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were detected at two locations at levels exceeding the Czech preventive values for their contents in agricultural soils (7.5 mu g/kg for dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane family, 20 mu g/kg for hexachlorbenzene, and 10 mu g/kg for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane), regardless of the treatment. Similarly, elevated contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were occasionally observed without any substantial relationship to the fertilizer application scenario. Thus, these contaminants are connected with atmospheric deposition in the given areas (PAHs) and their long-term stability (OCPs) even several decades after their ban; the role of the fertilizer composition was negligible.
   Conclusions The levels of per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances, brominated flame retardants, and synthetic musk compounds tended to increase in the sewage sludge-treated plots, indicating that sewage sludge can contribute to the abundance of these compounds in soil, although the contaminant levels determined do not represent a direct environmental risk. The levels of these contaminants in sewage sludge and sludge-treated soils should be regularly monitored in further research.

AB A new photosynthetic bacterium isolate was morphologically identified as a non-motile rod-shape gram-negative bacterium. It produced a dark red culture under phototrophic condition, reproduced by budding and formed a lamellar intracytoplasmic membrane system parallel to cytoplasmic membrane, which contained bacteriochlorophyll a and caratenoids. It's physiological and nutrient requirement tests gave indication that the isolate thrived and multiplied in varied environmental conditions. It was consequently named Z08 and identified as Rhodobacter sphaeroides by 16SrDNA. Adaptation of Z08 to biodegradation of two environmentally concerned wastewaters, i.e. soybean and pharmaceutical wastewaters, attested its potential in wastewater bioremediation. Z08 adaptation in a suspended batch photobioreactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater at 3500lx radiation recorded best result after wastewater dilution of 1: 4 with concomitant chemical oxygen demand reduction, biomass yield and specific growth of 50 %, 780 mg/L and 0.015/h, respectively at the lowest hydraulic retention time of three days. Furthermore, gas chromatography mass spectra analyses of treated and raw pharmaceutical wastewater indicated that high molecular weight recalcitrant compounds found in the pharmaceutical wastewater were transformed to less toxic and acceptable lower molecular weight substances through biodegradation. Whilst Z08 treatment of soybean wastewater under natural light intensity radiation recorded 80 % reduction, 1540 mg/L and 0.025/h for chemical oxygen demand, biomass and specific growth rate respectively regardless of the food to microorganism ratio. This preliminary investigation showed that isolate Z08 has some toxic tolerance level which could detoxify refractory substances with great potential for cell protein recovery in high organic strength wastewater. Therefore, strain Z08 could be employed in biodegradation of contaminated wastewater streams.

AB Nicotine is extensively metabolized in the human body to a number of compounds, which may enter natural waters via discharge of domestic wastewater. However, little is known on exposure of and potential effects on the aquatic environment In this study, two major urinary metabolites, cotinine and 3'-hydroxycotinine, as well as a further tobacco alkaloid, N-formylnornicotine, were measured in wastewater and water from Swiss lakes using an analytical procedure based on SPE and LC-MS/MS SRM with cotinine-d(3) as internal standard (LOQs, 1.0-1.5 ng/L. Typical concentrations of cotinine and 3'-hydroxycotinine were similar to 1-1 mu g/L in untreated wastewater, but clearly less in treated wastewater (similar to 0.01-0.6 mu g/L), corresponding to elimination efficiencies of 90-99%. N-Formylnornicotine, however, was found at similar concentrations in untreated and treated wastewater (0.02-0.15 mu g/L). Its apparent persistence during wastewater treatment was further confirmed by incubation experiments with activated sludge. In lakes, cotinine, 3'-hydroxycotinine, and N-formylnornicotine were detected at concentrations up to 15, 80, and 6 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations in lakes correlated with the expected anthropogenic burden by domestic wastewater (ratio population per water throughflow), demonstrating the suitability of these nicotine derivatives as hydrophilic, anthropogenic markers. In small receiving waters with significant wastewater discharges, concentrations of a few hundred ng/L may be expected. Possible ecotoxicological risks associated with such environmental concentrations, can, however, not be assessed at present as data on effects on aquatic organisms are very limited, in particular on long-term effects.

AB The rapid increase in saline wastewater discharge has severely affected the aquatic environment. Furthermore, the presence of salinity in the wastewater severely limits the performance of many wastewater treatment techniques. In this context, the present review article has reported the sources of saline wastewater and its environmental impacts. Wastewater originating from agricultural fields, and various industries, such as aqua-culture, tannery, petrochemical, pharmaceuticals, etc., contain a high degree of salinity. The performance of different physicochemical, biological, and hybrid systems in terms of treatment of saline wastewater has been investigated. High salinity levels were found to negatively impact the performance of various physicochemical processes (9 +/- 41%) and biological treatment techniques (25 +/- 31%). However, processes such as electrochemical oxidation and biological processes operating in the presence of salt-tolerant bacteria showed excellent performance in high salinity. High salinity showed minimal impact on the performance of hybrid systems, which were designed for treating saline wastewater. In this review, the effects of increased salinity on the controlling parameters of various processes have also been elucidated. Recommendations, such as the incorporation of additional pre-treatment units, augmentation of biological systems by salt-tolerant bacteria such as halophiles, etc., have been proposed, which may help to curb down the detrimental effects of high salinity. The present study circumscribes the different aspects of the treatment of saline wastewater, which may be helpful for environmental engineers and researchers working in this field.

AB The performance of an upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated under various operating conditions. During start-up, the UAF was initially fed by glucose till an organic loading rate (OLR) of approximately 7.5 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) with a hydraulic retention time of 2.3 days. A soluble COD removal efficiency of 98% was achieved before the addition of the wastewater. Initially, the filter inertia was acclimatized to the wastewater by sequential feeding of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v) and 70% (w/v) of the pre-aerated wastewater mixed with glucose followed by a 100% (w/v) pre-aerated wastewater. During the operation, the COD removal efficiency and methane yield decreased to 75% and 0.30 m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved respectively. As the UAF became accustomed to the pre-aerated wastewater, raw wastewater was fed in increasing ratios of 20% (w/v), 60% (w/v) and 80% (w/v) with the pre-aerated wastewater as the remaining part. During this stage of the operation, a COD removal efficiency in a range of 77-86% was achieved and the methane yield decreased to 0.24 m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved. Finally, 100% (w/v) raw wastewater was fed and a COD removal efficiency of 65% was achieved with a methane yield of 0.20m(3) CH(4)kg(-1) CODremoved. At the end of the operation, acetoclastic methanogenic activity was only measured in the bottom section of the UAF, this showed a 90% reduction in comparison with activity of inoculation sludge. Microscopic examinations revealed that rod-shaped methanogens remained as the dominant species whereas Methanosarcina-like species and filaments were present only in insignificant numbers along the UAF.

AB The drug residues of lipid regulators, anti-inflammatories and some drug metabolites have been detected in raw sewage, treated waste water and river water in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. These residues are mainly derived from humans via excretion. The median concentrations in the effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) of most drugs investigated in this study ranged from 0.1 to 1 mu g/l. The removal rates of individual drugs during passage through a Brazilian STP varied from 12 to 90%. As a consequence of the incomplete removal of these residues during passage through a STP, rivers were also found to be contaminated. Median concentrations ranged from between 0.02 and 0.04 mu g/l in river water, whereas the maximum values were observed to be up to 0.5 mu g/l (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unrestricted discharge of domestic and industrial wastewaters along with agricultural runoff water into the environment as mixed-wastewater pose serious threat to freshwater resources in many countries. Mixed-wastewater pollution is a common phenomenon in the developing countries as the technologies to treat the individual waste streams at source are lacking due to high operational and maintenance costs. Therefore, the need to explore the potential of the suspended growth process which is a well-established process technology for biological wastewater treatment is the focus of this paper. Different wastewater constituents: representing domestic, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum, and agricultural runoff were synthesized as a representative of mixed-wastewater and treated in two semi-continuous bioreactors (R1 & R2) operated at constant operating conditions, namely MLSS (mg/L): 4640-R1, 4440-R2, SRT: 21-d, HRT: 48-72 h, and uncontrolled pH. The system attained stable condition in day 97, with average COD, BOD and TSS reduction as 84.5%, 86.2%, and 72.2% for R1; and 85.1%, 87.9%, and 75.1% for R2, respectively. Phosphate removal on average was by 74.3% in R1 and 76.6% in R2, while average nitrification achieved in systems 1 and 2 were 56.8% and 54.7%, respectively. The biological treatment system has shown potential for improving the quality of mixed-wastewater to the state where reuse may be considered and tertiary treatment can be employed to polish the effluent quality.

AB The sorption coefficients of four rarely studied zwitterionic pharmaceuticals (benzimidazoles: fenbendazole, albendazole. thiabendazole and flubendazole) and four metabolites of fenbendazole to various dissolved organic matter surrogates (humic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and liposomes made of 1-palmitoy1-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and sewage sludge) were measured to extend the available sorption coefficients and eventually to evaluate their environmental fate in soil and water environment. For the entire range of dissolved organic matters, the more hydrophobic fenbendazole and albendazole had higher sorption coefficients than thiabendazole and flubendazole, indicating that the traditional hypothesis of hydrophobic interaction holds for zwitterionic benzimidazole anthelmintics. However, the sorption coefficients of a given benzimidazole to selected dissolved organic matters (DOMs) varied within an order of magnitude. The measured Km values decreased in the order of fenbendazole, albendazole, thiabendazole and flubendazole for sewage sludge and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin whereas the orders were different for the other DOM surrogates, implying the hydrophilic nature of sewage sludge. This was also supported by the (N + O)/C elemental ratio of the sewage sludge sample used in this study. The correlations between log K-oc, and log K-ow were weak (r(2) = 0.28-0.64) and the magnitude of the sorption coefficients to the hydrophilic organic matters (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and sewage sludge) were similar to or slightly smaller than those for the hydrophobic organic matters (humic acids and liposome). This suggests that specific hydrophilic interactions also play a significant role in the sorption of moderately hydrophobic benzimidazoles to organic matters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Treated wastewater may be a valuable source of water and/or nutrients for crop production and fish farming. Disinfection of treated wastewater should be performed to protect water resources against pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms, as well as micropollutants contained in effluents. However, in the case of ozonation of treated wastewater, a large portion of contaminants do not undergo complete mineralization and can be transformed into by-products of unknown toxicity. The research performed in this study by culture-dependent and independent methods showed that the inactivation of bacteria in treated wastewater by ozonation does not take place effectively and may depend on the presence of other contaminants that may first react with the disinfectant. Some bacterial cells proved to be damaged by a disinfectant to the extent that they were unable to grow on nutrient media, but they were still viable and potentially posing a sanitary threat. Possible reasons for the disinfection failure were investigated and discussed. Ecotoxicity tests with algae Desmodesmus quadricauda, crustacean Daphnia magna, and bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri showed that by-products may be formed during ozonation of treated wastewater which is toxic to aquatic organisms. The toxicity class of treated wastewater may change from the completely non-toxic to very high hazard category, and there is a clear relationship between the time of ozonation and the increase in ecotoxicity.

AB Raw wastewater from final processing unit of pharmaceutical industry contains high organic loading and obstinate compounds causing treatment of this wastewater a major challenge. In this study a novel approach for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater has been discussed. Anaerobic pretreatment of raw pharmaceutical wastewater was done using microbial fuel cell (MFC), followed by aerobic microalgal treatment with T. indica in photobioreactor in batch mode. Combined MFC and algal treatment process showed potential reduction in heavy metals concentration along with decrease of COD, TOC, nitrate and phosphate content. The observed COD, TOC, nitrate and phosphate in raw wastewater was 90.29, 97.05, 81.60 and 94.87 %, respectively. However, after treatment of raw wastewater in photobioreactor without pretreatment, 66.30 % COD, 67.17 % nitrate, 70.03 phosphate and 78.14 % TOC reduction were observed. T. indica achieved 16.40 and 15.69 mg L-1 d(-1) of lipid productivity in PW1 and PW2 whereas it showed 0.085 and 0.089 g CO2 L -1 d(-1) of CO2 Fixation rate. This study demonstrates combination treatment processes of wastewater improve environmental sustainability and enables greener routes of biofuels production.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants was investigated in 15 diverse biological reactors through short and long-term experiments. Short-term batch experiments were performed with activated sludge from three parallel sequencing batch reactors (25, 40, and 80 d solid retention time, SRT) fed with synthetic wastewater without micropollutants for one year. Despite the minimal micropollutant exposure, the synthetic wastewater sludges were able to degrade several micropollutants present in municipal wastewater. The degradation occurred immediately after spiking (1-5 mu g/L), showed no strong or systematic correlation to the sludge age, and proceeded at rates comparable to those of municipal wastewater sludges. Thus, the results from the batch experiments indicate that degradation of organic micropollutants in biological wastewater treatment is quite insensitive to SRT increases from 25 to 80 days, and not necessarily induced by exposure to micropollutants. Long-term experiments with municipal wastewater were performed to assess the potential for extended biological micropollutant removal under different redox conditions and substrate concentrations (carbon and nitrogen). A total of 31 organic micropollutants were monitored through influent-effluent sampling of twelve municipal wastewater reactors. In accordance with the results from the sludges grown on synthetic wastewater, several compounds such as bezafibrate, atenolol and acyclovir were significantly removed in the activated sludge processes fed with municipal wastewater. Complementary removal of two compounds, diuron and diclofenac, was achieved in an oxic biofilm treatment. A few aerobically persistent micro pollutants such as venlafaxine, diatrizoate and tramadol were removed under anaerobic conditions, but a large number of micropollutants persisted in all biological treatments. Collectively, these results indicate that certain improvements in biological micropollutant removal can be achieved by combining different aerobic and anaerobic treatments, but that these improvements are restricted to a limited number of compounds.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) has been widely found in sewage treatment plants and environmental water bodies, and has attracted worldwide attention. In this paper, the photocatalytic degradation of DCF was investigated using a laboratory-scale simulated solar experimental device. This study focused on exploring the effects of the actual secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants (SE-A and SE-B) on the photocatalytic degradation of DCF and the changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during the photocatalytic degradation process. The results showed when SE-A and SE-B were used as the background water of the DCF solution, they displayed a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of DCF, and the values of k were 0.039 and 0.0113 min(-1), respectively. Among them, DOM played a major inhibitory role in photocatalytic degradation of DCF in sewage. In the photocatalytic process, the biological toxicity of the DCF solution was the least after 30 min of reaction, and then gradually increased. Furthermore, the organic matters in the sewage were greatly degraded after the photocatalytic reaction, including 254 and 365 nm ultraviolet (UV254, UV365) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Moreover, titanium dioxide (TiO2) first catalyzed the degradation of macromolecular organic matters, and then degraded the small molecular organic matters.

AB Wastewater stabilisation ponds are the simplest, and most economical and maintainable way of municipal wastewater treatment. The fate of selected emerging contaminants using algal monocultures has been studied. However, in an actual wastewater treatment plant, it is likely to be different. Accordingly, a need was felt to take up this study. A waste stabilisation pond based wastewater treatment plant having five ponds in an area of approximately 14 hectares and working for 30 years was selected. High removal (> 75%) was observed in the case of paracetamol and carbaryl. Moderate removal efficiencies (50-75%) were found for malathion, erythromycin, clofibric acid and 17beta-estradiol while low (< 50%) removal efficiencies were witnessed in the case of aldrin, endosulfan, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, hexachlorocyclohexane and diclofenac. Results show that most of the removal takes place in initial ponds, with higher efficiencies in summer and lower in winter. Results suggest that waste stabilisation pond based wastewater treatment plant is capable of removing emerging contaminants to some extent.

AB Due to the increasing freshwater deterioration and demand for irrigation, there is pressing need to reclaim and reuse wastewater for agricultural operations. While this practice is gaining significant traction in developed world, it is quite rare in most developing countries with inadequate or no functional sewerage facilities and treatment systems at both municipal and industrial levels occasioned by high investment and operational costs. Consequently, wastewaters generated are in complex heterogenous mix of industrial, domestic, municipal and agricultural runoff wastewater. Biological technologies which utilize the expertise of microorganisms are considered robust, efficient and economically attractive for treatment of wide range of wastewaters and they have high suitability in developing countries. This work therefore assessed the potential of suspended growth biological process (SGBP) for reclamation and reuse of mixed wastewater composed a mixture of domestic effluent, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum discharges and agricultural runoff for irrigation of edible crops (lettuce and beets) with plants phenological parameters as measuring indicators. The germination and phenological characteristics of crops were studied in a hydroponic unit under four irrigation regimes: tap water as control, mixed wastewater, SGBP treated wastewater, and tap water mixed with nutrient solution as upper control, for a duration of 45-d. The results proved that the SGBP treated wastewater had no negative impact on germination responses of the seed crops. However, residual recalcitrant compounds caused early stunted growth in plant root systems with resultant limited access to nutrients. Consequently, plant vegetative growth and phenological development as well as chlorophyll production were reduced. In comparison to nutrients supplemented solution, nutrients deficiency and imbalance in treated wastewater contributed to the poor development in irrigated plants. The outcomes of seed germination and plant growth experiments show a positive indication for reuse of mixed wastewater in agriculture. However, there is need for further research to explore the long-term benefits and limitations of reusing such treated wastewater.

AB Fresh water scarcity has led to increased use of reclaimed wastewater as an alternative and reliable source for crop irrigation. Beyond microbiological safety, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of reclaimed wastewater by xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug which is ubiquitously detected in reclaimed wastewater, highly persistent in soil, and taken up by crops. In a randomized controlled trial we demonstrate that healthy individuals consuming reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce excreted carbamazepine and its metabolites in their urine, while subjects consuming fresh water-irrigated produce excreted undetectable or significantly lower levels of carbamazepine. We also report that the carbamazepine metabolite pattern at this low exposure level differed from that observed at therapeutic doses. This "proof of concept" study demonstrates that human exposure to xenobiotics occurs through ingestion of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce, providing real world data which could guide risk assessments and policy designed to ensure the safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation.

AB Treating penicillin wastewater is receiving more and more attention, because penicillin has strong anti-oxidant, anti-degradation and strong inhibitory effect on microbial growth. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) with stable and superior performance, has been used in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this paper, effects of sulfate on activated sludge and membrane fouling in MBR treating penicillin wastewater were investigated. The results showed MBR could guarantee excellent effluent in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal. However, sulfate reduced the biodegradability of wastewater due to the changes in microbial species and the inhibition of microbial metabolic activity. Difference in the transmembrane pressure (TMP) indicated that sulfate made membrane fouling more serious. Colloids which exacerbated the clogging of the membrane pores and the formation of a dense cake layer, were the major contributor to membrane fouling.

AB The wastewater generated in pharmaceutical process generally contains residual organic solvents (ROSs) which will cause the toxicity and inhibition of the micro-organisms in treating wastewater, thus affecting the treatment effect of wastewater. The aim of this study was to establish a system for the analysis and evaluation of microtoxicity and biodegradability of ROSs in pharmaceutical wastewater. The quantitative structure activity relationship models were used to predict the toxicity and biodegradability; meanwhile, the biological toxicity was tested by the method of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) as well as luminescent bacteria and biodegradability was measured by shaking experiment. The proposed system was applied to predict and evaluate toxicity and biodegradability of toluene, acetone, isopropanol and dichloromethane in pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that the actual measured values fitted well with the calculated values. The microtoxicity of toluene was the highest and the degradation was more difficult. Dichloromethane toxicity was the second highest after toluene and more easily degradable. Acetone and isopropanol were less toxic and had easy degradation. The fact indicated the system was reliable and easy to operate which could be extended to the screening and identification of highly toxic and difficult degradation components in industrial wastewater.

AB A submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used to treat two types of petrochemical wastewater: olefin process wastewater and total petrochemical wastewater. Various operational MBR conditions, such as influent pH and hydraulic retention time (HRT), were tested while these wastewaters were treated. The MBR treatment of olefin process wastewater reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) by around 90% in both cases, and more than 90% of the suspended solids (SS) were removed. When MBR was used, the reduction in COD and TOC was also high for the total petrochemical wastewater, and was compared with the reduction obtained when the conventional activated sludge treatment plant was used (CASP). However, MBR effluent wastewaters showed high conductivity so for some reuse purposes subsequent reverse osmosis (RO) treatment would be needed. We characterized the MBR influent and MBR effluent wastewaters using a sequential solid phase extraction (SSPE) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. The main compounds that were tentatively identified were hydrocarbons, alkyl benzenes, phenols, acidic acids and esters, almost all of which could be partially or completely removed by MBR treatment.

AB Behavior of the antimicrobial triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) was investigated under laboratory chlorination conditions and in a wastewater treatment plant discharging 380 million liters daily to the Delaware River, USA. Reactions of triclosan with chlorine were investigated using concentrations and exposure time typical of municipal wastewater treatment plants, i.e., 1 h contact time and average 1-2 mg/L residual chlorine. In reagent water, triclosan reacted quickly, transforming into mono-and dichlorinated species and further into dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol. However, triclosan remained stable for up to 2 h in wastewater samples chlorinated under these conditions. To confirm observed behavior under field conditions, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based analytical method capable of monitoring triclosan and its transformation products in wastewater was developed. Qualitative and quantitative wastewater characterization before and after chlorination are presented. Triclosan was present at the same concentration (P > 0.05) in pre-chlorination and post-chlorination aqueous wastewater samples (mean 368 ng/L). This finding is consistent with the non-detection of specific triclosan transformation products above sample reporting limits (30.0-100 ng/L), but contrasts markedly with detection of chlorination transformation products reported in reagent water. These data suggest the importance of influent matrix components in chlorination reactions of triclosan in contaminated wastewater under treatment plant conditions.

AB The occurrence of emerging organic micropollutants (OMPs) in sewage sludge has been widely reported; nevertheless, their fate during sludge treatment remains unclear. The objective of this work was to study the fate of OMPs during mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD), the most common processes used for sludge stabilization, by using raw sewage sludge without spiking OMPs. Moreover, the results of analytical chemistry were complemented with biological assays in order to verify the possible adverse effects (estrogenic and genotoxic) on the environment and human health in view of an agricultural (re)use of digested sludge. Musk fragrances (AHTN, HHCB), ibuprofen (IBP) and triclosan (TCS) were the most abundant compounds detected in sewage sludge. In general, the efficiency of the AD process was not dependent on operational parameters but compound-specific: some OMPs were highly biotransformed (e.g. sulfamethoxazole and naproxen), while others were only slightly affected (e.g. IBP and TCS) or even unaltered (e.g. AHTN and HHCB). The MCF-7 assay evidenced that estrogenicity removal was driven by temperature. The Ames test did not show point mutation in Salmonella typhimurium while the Comet test exhibited a genotoxic effect on human leukocytes attenuated by AD. This study highlights the importance of combining chemical analysis and biological activities in order to establish appropriate operational strategies for a safer disposal of sewage sludge. Actually, it was demonstrated that temperature has an insignificant effect on the disappearance of the parent compounds while it is crucial to decrease estrogenicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Municipal wastewater typically contains many drugs and anthropogenic chemicals or biomarkers. The occurrence of these chemicals in wastewater is linked to the socioeconomic characteristics of the contributing population. Based on these relationships, we propose, execute and evaluate a novel model for predicting population socioeconomics. Specifically, we used biomarkers in wastewater to predict 37 socioeconomic characteristics of populations during the Australian Census. The resultant model was further tested on nine other populations separate from the training data set. Prediction performance in the test populations (defined as accuracy +/- SD) fit within 75% and 125% for many features such as catchment median age, and specific measures of educational attainment (e.g., high school completion) and employment (e.g., managerial employment). Considering the relative ease, low cost and high frequency at which wastewater samples can be collected and analyzed, wastewater analysis could be used as a complementary technique for assessing population socioeconomics.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are commonly derived from industrial wastewater, which is often a consequence of an inadequate treatment of the latter. Improperly pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater could cause difficulties in operations of wastewater treatment plants while incomplete elimination of ECs during the processing might result in their appearance in drinking water.
   This paper deals with membrane treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater on a laboratory and a pilot scale as well as with the removal of the following veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, and febantel).
   The pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by means of coagulation and microfiltration (MF) prevented the irreversible fouling of the fine porous structure of the reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes which were used in the final stage of wastewater processing. The percentage of the removal of the selected VPs ranges from 94% to almost 100% in the case of NF and RO membranes in both scales. The recovery percentage concerning the pilot scale amounted to 88%. Membrane cleaning was successfully carried out in both scales.
   The differences in retention between laboratory and pilot tests are due to different raw wastewater quality and different recovery and hydrodynamic of the two systems. Fouling and concentration polarization were more pronounced in laboratory setup (frame-plate module) than in pilot unit (spiral module). The proposed integrated membrane treatment (coagulation, MF, NF, and RO) can be employed for treatment of wastewater originating from pharmaceutical factory. The obtained permeate can be safely discharged to sewer system or could be reused in manufacturing process.

AB The occurrence of clarithromycin in wastewater samples and of the activated sludge bacteria possibly resistant to this pharmaceutical was the object of the study. Samples of wastewater or activated sludge were taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in summer and winter and characterised regarding their clarithromycin concentrations and the presence of nucleic acid fragments (Cla-sequences) known to be responsible for clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori. The concentrations of clarithromycin in raw wastewater were about 1086-2271 ng/L. Around 50-60% less of the pharmaceutical was found in treated wastewater. The concentrations were much higher in winter samples, as compared to summer samples. The clarithromycin resistance markers in H. pylori were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in activated sludge bacterial cells. Cla-sequences were found in all the detected Proteobacteria, independently of the sampling season. Among nitrifying or phosphate or glycogen accumulating bacteria only Nitrosomonas spp. revealed presence of the clarithromycin sequences.

AB Vitamin B-12 wastewater, as a pharmaceutical wastewater, is difficult to treat due to its high concentrations of bioresistant organic matters, salinity, chromaticity, and poor biodegradability. A laboratory-scale microelectrolysis (ME) process with aeration device was designed to treat this wastewater. Our results suggested that, under obtained optimal condition of hydraulic retention time of 80min, initial pH of 3, and air/water ratio of 100:1, the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen (NH3N), and chromaticity in the wastewater by ME process was achieved by 43.9%, 7.9%, and 82.6%, respectively. Organic matter with benzene ring was largely removed or degraded and, therefore, C=C and C=O bonds were destroyed, and substituents of aromatic rings contained more aliphatic chains after treatment by ME process. All wastewater samples were divided into three parallel factor analysis components: one protein-like (component 1 [C1]) and two humic-like components (component 2 [C2] and component 3 [C3]). Fluorescence analysis results demonstrated that humic-like and fulvic-like substances with macromolecular weight and complex structure were decomposed or degraded into smaller molecular weight substances by ME process, in addition to those easily degradable protein-like components. We further demonstrated that biodegradability of vitamin B-12 wastewater after treatment by ME process was increased using biodegradability index, suggesting that the ME process can greatly improve the removal efficiency of contaminants in wastewater by subsequent treatment process.

AB Though decentralized on-site technologies are extensively employed for wastewater treatment around the globe, an understanding of effluent water quality impairments associated with these systems remain less understood than effluent discharges from centralized municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Using a unique experimental facility, a novel comparative, analysis of effluent water quality was performed from model decentralized aerobic (ATS) and septic (STS) on-site wastewater treatment systems and a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant (MTP). The ATS and STS units did not benefit from further soil treatment. Each system received common influent wastewater from the Waco, Texas, USA Metropolitan Area Regional Sewerage System. We tested the hypothesis that MTP effluent would exhibit higher water quality than on-site effluents, based on parameters selected for study. A tiered testing approach was employed to assess the three effluent discharges: select routine water quality parameters (Tier I), whole effluent toxicity (Tier II), and select endocrine-active compounds (Tier III). Contrary to our hypothesis, ATS effluent was not statistically different from MTP effluents, based on Tier I and III parameters, but reproductive responses of Daphnia magna were slightly more sensitive to ATS than MTP effluents. STS effluent water quality was identified as most degraded of the three wastewater treatment systems. Parameters used to assess centralized wastewater treatment plant effluent water quality such as whole effluent toxicity and endocrine active substances appear useful for water quality assessments of decentralized discharges. Aerobic on-site wastewater treatment systems may represent more robust options than traditional septic systems for on-site wastewater treatment in watersheds with appreciable groundwater - surface water exchange.

AB Sewage sludge incineration in a fluidized bed is considered to be one of the most suitable ways of sewage sludge disposal. This process reduces the volume of the waste and causes the destruction of organic contaminants such as POPs, pharmaceuticals, and other compounds with endocrine-disrupting potential. Oxygen-enriched air combustion and oxy-fuel combustion can increase the combustion efficiency, reduce the amount of flue gas, and make possible CO2 capture more effective. However, the influence of incineration medium composition has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the case of sewage sludge incineration. In this paper, the incineration of sewage sludge in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor was studied at oxygen-enriched air conditions, oxy-fuel conditions, and oxy-fuel conditions with zero and nonzero concentrations of steam, CO, NO, N2O, and SO2 in the inlet combustion medium. Consequently, the effects of various operating parameters on pollutants formation were comprehensively described with emphasis on aforementioned sewage sludge incineration processes. An increase in combustion temperature resulted in an increase in NOx and SO2 emissions and in a decrease in N2O emissions. Increase in inlet oxygen concentration led to a decrease in NOx and N2O emissions. N2O and SO2 emissions were higher in CO2-rich atmosphere (oxy-fuel combustion conditions). The presence of water vapor in the inlet combustion medium resulted mainly in the reduction of NOx emissions. The presence of CO, NO, N2O, and SO2 in the dry inlet combustion medium reduced mainly overall nitrogen-to-NOx conversion, while the effect on SO2 removal efficiency was only marginal.

AB To date, little is known about the removal of fluoroquinolones (FQs) in the in-situ sludge ozone-reduction (SOR) process. Hence, this study investigated the behavior of five commonly used FQs, including ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin in the SOR process. Batch experiments indicated that ozonation could effectively eliminate the target FQs present in the sludge, which was accelerated by increasing the initial pH (5.0-9.5). Continuous operation of an anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process coupled with sludge ozonation and phosphorus recovery showed that the SOR process could achieve zero yield of excess sludge. In addition, chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen species were stably removed, with efficiencies comparable to those obtained in the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. However, an increase in the effluent total phosphorus concentration was observed in the SOR process. The effluent FQ concentrations in the SOR process remained quite stable and were close to those in the CAS process, whereas the FQ concentrations in the sludge decreased remarkably after ozonation. Mass balance analysis revealed that the FQs were released to the environment mainly through excess sludge disposal (69.9 +/- 2.3%) in the CAS process, whereas were degraded mainly by ozone in the SOR process (75.8 +/- 2.0%). Therefore, the SOR process was able to minimize the excess sludge and the release of FQs to the environment simultaneously.

AB Recently, the occurrence of antibiotics in sewage treatment plant effluent, as well as drinking water, has raised concern about their potential impacts on the environment and public health. Antibiotics are found in surface and ground waters, which indicate their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have received considerable attention for the removal of antibiotics. This study was conducted to evaluate the degradation and mineralization of antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and chlortetracycline) using an electron beam, ozone and UV, and the change of toxicity. Also, the electrical energy consumption based on the EE/O parameter (the electrical energy required per order of pollutants removal in 1 m(3) wastewater) was used to quantify the energy cost associated with the different AOPs (electron beam, ozone and UV) for the degradation of antibiotics. The results showed that an electron beam effective for the removals of both sulfamethoxazole and chlortetracycline in aqueous solutions. However, degradation of the target compounds by ozone and UV showed different trends. The oxidation efficiency of each organic compound was very dependent upon the AOP used. Algal toxicity was significantly reduced after each treatment. However, based on the electrical energy, the electron beam was more efficient than ozone and UV. Electron beam treatment could be an effective and safe method for the removal of antibiotic compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds have been detected in North America and Europe in groundwater, surface water, wastewater, and drinking water In the province of Quebec in Canada, there has been little data to assess the occurrence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment In August of 2005, samples of surface water were collected at 10 sites along the Yamaska River basin in Quebec, which passes through important agricultural areas and receives wastewater from several urban centers with populations ranging up to 44,000 residents Several acidic drugs (naproxen, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil), neutral drugs (caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine), and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were detected in the majority of the surface water samples The antidepressant fluoxetine (neutral/basic drug) was not detected in any samples, while acetaminophen (acidic drug) was detected at only two sites, and sulfapyridine (sulfonamide antibiotic) was detected at only one site Sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were present at the highest maximum concentrations of 578 ng/L and 106 ng/L, respectively The concentrations of most of the target pharmaceutically active compounds observed in surface water samples within the watershed were generally consistent with the number of people in urban centers near the sampling sites when compared with other studies in urban watersheds However, carbamazepine, naproxen, and sulfamethoxazole were present at surprisingly high concentrations for some of the low density areas Overall, these results demonstrate that pharmaceuticals are distributed in surface waters within a watershed in Quebec at concentrations similar to levels observed in previous studies done in other parts of North America

AB As part of the continuing effort to collect baseline information on the environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in the Nation's water resources, water samples were collected from a network of 47 groundwater sites across 18 states in 2000. All samples collected were analyzed for 65 OWCs representing a wide variety of uses and origins. Site selection focused on areas suspected to be susceptible to contamination from either animal or human wastewaters (i.e. down gradient of a landfill, unsewered residential development, or animal feedlot). Thus, sites sampled were not necessarily used as a source of drinking water but provide a variety of geohydrologic environments with potential sources of OWCs. OWCs were detected in 81% of the sites sampled, with 35 of the 65 OWCs being found at least once. The most frequently detected compounds include N,N-diethyltoluamide (35%, insect repellant), bisphenol A (30%, plasticizer), tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (30%, fire retardant), sulfamethoxazole (23%, veterinary and human antibiotic), and 4-octylphenol monoethoxylate (19%, detergent metabolite). Although sampling procedures were intended to ensure that all groundwater samples analyzed were indicative of aquifer conditions it is possible that detections of some OWCs could have resulted from leaching of well-construction materials and/or other site-specific conditions related to well construction and materials. Future research will be needed to identify those factors that are most important in determining the occurrence and concentrations of OWCs in groundwater. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are widely used in home and personal care products as antimicrobial agents. After these products are used, TCS and TCC enter the terrestrial environment and pose a great risk to humans and animals. In this research, the biodegradation of TCS and TCC was investigated during sewage sludge composting with ventilation rates of 108, 92, and 79 m(3)/min. TCS and TCC were mainly biodegraded in the mesophilic and thermophilic phases, and the biodegradation rates improved with an increase in ventilation. After sewage sludge was composted for 16 days with forced ventilation (108 m(3)/min), the concentration of TCS decreased from 497.4 to 214.5 mu g/kg, and the concentration of TCC decreased from 823.2 to 172.7 mu g/kg. The biodegradation rates of TCS and TCC were 65.2% and 83.1%, respectively. However, after the sewage sludge was stacked for 16 days, the biodegradation rates of TCS and TCC were only 17.0% and 18.2%, respectively. The environmental risks of TCS and TCC in the sewage sludge piles significantly decreased after composting. In the sludge pile with a ventilation rate of 108 m(3)/min, the RQ values of TCS and TCC decreased from 8.29 and 20.58 to 3.58 and 4.32 after composting for 16 days, respectively. There is still a high risk if the sludge compost is directly used as a culture substrate. Nevertheless, the environmental risk could be decreased distinctly if a reasonable quantity of sludge compost is applied to land to ensure an RQ of < 1 for TCS and TCC

AB The aim of this study was to integrally address the uncertainty associated with all the steps used to estimate community drug consumption through the chemical analysis of sewage biomarkers of illicit drugs. Uncertainty has been evaluated for sampling, chemical analysis, stability of drug biomarkers in sewage, back-calculation of drug use (specific case of cocaine), and estimation of population size in a catchment using data collected from a recent Europe-wide investigation and from the available literature. The quality of sampling protocols and analytical measurements has been evaluated by analyzing standardized questionnaires collected from 19 sewage treatments plants (STPs) and the results of an interlaboratory study (ILS), respectively. Extensive reviews of the available literature have been used to evaluate stability of drug biomarkers in sewage and the uncertainty related to back-calculation of cocaine use. Different methods for estimating population size in a catchment have been compared and the variability among the collected data was very high (7-55%). A reasonable strategy to reduce uncertainty was therefore to choose the most reliable estimation case by case. In the other cases, the highest uncertainties are related to the analysis of sewage drug biomarkers (uncertainty as relative standard deviation; RSD: 6-26% from ILS) and to the back-calculation of cocaine use (uncertainty; RSD: 26%). Uncertainty can be kept below 10% in the remaining steps, if specific requirements outlined in this work are considered. For each step, a best practice protocol has been suggested and discussed to reduce and keep to a minimum the uncertainty of the entire procedure and to improve the reliability of the estimates of drug use.

AB In order to explore the effect of hypersaline aniline-containing pharmaceutical wastewater on the structure of activated sludge-derived bacterial community, RAPD-PCR and PCR-DGGE techniques were used to analyze the change of bacterial community diversity and structure during the acclimation to different concentrations of two types of wastewater. Different bacterial community structures and significant shift in the bacterial community diversity were observed during the acclimation of wastewater. The number of bacterial species and the abundance of bacteria acclimated to different concentration of wastewater decreased when the concentration increased. The trends of bacterial community diversity indices revealed by RAPD or DGGE profiles were different. The change of bacterial community diversity might be due to the adaptation and mutation under selection issues in the acclimation of wastewater. The relationship between diversity indices and the content of chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, salinity and aniline based on RAPD and DGGE data indicated that the change of the bacterial community diversity might not be due to a single factor but might be due to the integrated effects of all the contaminants in the wastewater. Phylogenic trees based on RAPD and DGGE fingerprints were different, indicating that the effect of wastewaters A and B on the bacterial community structure was different, which might be due to the characteristics of wastewater.

AB In this study, two hormones 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and three phenolic compounds, bisphenol A (BPA), 4-N-nonylphenol (4-NP) and 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), were determined in surface water in the Cuautla River at the State of Morelos during the dry-season in Mexico. The endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) were extracted from water samples using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with end-capped C-18, and then the extracts were chemically derivatized to TMS (trimethylsylane)-compounds and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCMS). The most abundant compound was BPA (22.46 +/- 30.17 ng L-1), followed by 4-t-OP (11.24 +/- 11.76 ng L-1), 4-NP (7.53 +/- 14.88 ng L-1), EE2 (2.37 +/- 4.36 ng L-1) and E-2 (0.97 +/- 1.82 ng L-1). The residual amounts of target compounds could either reach stream surface water from direct domestic wastewater discharges, conventional wastewater treatment plant or can be a result from the use of agrochemicals in crop areas. The EDCs in Cuautla River exerted a high pressure on the aquatic ecosystem because their presences in surface water caused medium and high potential ecological risk. Besides, it was found that aquatic organisms were exposed to estrogenic activity.

AB Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are released into aquatic ecosystems through discharged sewage wastewater. Antidepressants are among those APIs often detected in wastewater effluent and have been recently reported to cause foot detachment from the substrate in freshwater snails. We tested the effects of four commonly prescribed antidepressants (fluoxetine ("Prozac"), fluvoxamine ("Luvox"), venlafaxine ("Effexor"), and citalopram ("Celexa") on adhesion to the substrate in five species of marine snails, three from the Pacific coast (Chlorostoma funebralis, Nucella ostrina, Urosalpinx cinerea) and two species from the Atlantic coast (Tegula fasciatus and Lithopoma americanum) of North America representing three different gastropod families. All antidepressants tested induced foot detachment from the substrate in all snail species in a mainly dose-dependent manner (p < 0.04-0.00000001). The lowest LOECs (lowest observed effect concentration) for antidepressants and snails were recorded for Lithopoma in 43.4 mu g/L (100 nM) fluvoxamine and Chlorostoma in 157 mu g/L (500 nM) venlafaxine and 217 mu g/L (500 nM) fluvoxamine. The trochids and turbinids were 2-10x more sensitive to the antidepressants than the muricids. Latency to detachment was also dose dependent, with the fastest average times to detach seen in Chlorostoma and Lithopoma (7.33 and 13.16 min respectively in 3.13 mg/L venlafaxine). The possible physiological mechanisms regulating antidepressant-induced foot detachment in marine snails and the possible ecological consequences are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the trace-level contamination of pharmaceuticals in the water environment all over the world. Considering a large number of pharmaceuticals used, it is crucial to establish a priority list of pharmaceuticals that should be monitored and/or treated first. In the present study, we developed a ranking system based on the pharmaceutical consumption, removal performance in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and potential ecological effects, and applied to the situation of China. 39 pharmaceuticals, which had available consumption data and also been reported previously in the WWTPs of China, were selected as candidate pharmaceuticals. Among them, seventeen pharmaceuticals were considered as priority pharmaceuticals, out of which, erythromycin, diclofenac acid and ibuprofen, had the high priority. Compared with other literatures, we found that some pharmaceuticals given concerns to globally should also be included in the priority list in China: while some pharmaceuticals, not mentioned in other literatures, such as cefalexin, ketoconazole, should be also given prior consideration in China. Among all the therapeutic classes, antibiotics, which were grossly abused in China, contributed the most to the priority pharmaceuticals. However, priority antibiotics accounted for only 32% of candidate antibiotics, while 71% and 100% of the candidate anti-inflammatory and anti-lipidemic respectively were identified as the priority pharmaceuticals, indicating that antibiotics might be overanxiously considered in the previous studies on their behaviors in the WWTPs of China.

AB This study reports on the toxic effects of 35-days intragastric perfusion of pharmaceutical wastewater on the male reproductive system of Mus musculus. Flow cytometric analyses and staining with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) were used to assess the toxicity on spermatogenic cells. Significant depletions in the relative percentages of elongated spermatid (HC), diploid spermatogonia (2C), and S-phase cells were observed. These alterations in different germ cell populations were reflected in the various germ cell ratios. The ratios of 1C: 4C and HC: 2C showed a significant decline after pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, while the 4C:2C and 1C:2C ratios increased significantly. FDA and PI staining displayed reduced viability of spen-natogenic cells in wastewater treated group. Statistically significant percentages of sperm abnormalities showed the genotoxic potential of this pharmaceutical wastewater. Testicular histopathological studies of treated animals revealed expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells. Thus, the present study has established the toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater on the reproductive biology of male mice.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics in the environment has raised much concern in recent years. Understanding their release, fate and behaviour in the environment is vital to assess potential risks. In this study, a novel passive water sampler - diffusion gradients in thin-films for organics (o-DGT) - was employed to assess the occurrence and removal of antibiotics in two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) - one in China and the other in the United Kingdom (UK). Of the targeted compounds, 11 of 19 were detected in the Chinese WWTP (ND-200 ng/L) and 10 of 40 were found in the UK plant (ND-1380 ng/L). Florfenicol, lincomycin, ofloxacin and roxithromycin were most abundant in the Chinese WWTP (influent), while anhydrous erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, ofloxacin and sulfapyridine were the most abundant in the UK influent samples. Estimated Chinese and UK consumption data are used to interpret the results. Neither of the WWTPs was very effective at removing antibiotics: similar to 40-50% (overall) was removed by the two plants, with the rest being discharged into the receiving rivers. This is the first study using o-DGT to assess the occurrence and removal of antibiotics in WWTPs. o-DGT is a useful, cost-effective tool to assess WWTP performance and can highlight the effectiveness of treatment steps, which can be applied to wastewater based epidemiology studies.

AB The aim of the present work was to evaluate the sorption capacity of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) to remove mixtures of ibuprofen, carbamazepine and clofibric acid in water and wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained for carbamazepine and ibuprofen while a less satisfactory performance was observed for clofibric acid. In a mixture of the three compounds in water a slight decrease in the sorbed amounts is observed in comparison with solutions of the single compounds, indicating some competitive sorption. In wastewater, the pharmaceuticals mixture also undergoes a slight reduction in the sorbed amounts of carbamazepine and ibuprofen, probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter which increases their solubility These compounds were removed in the following order of efficiencies in all the tested conditions: carbamazepine > ibuprofen > clofibric acid. Two other clay materials - sepiolite and vermiculite - were tested for the removal of the more recalcitrant clofibric acid, and vermiculite exhibited higher removal efficiency than LECA. The sorption is characterized by an initial fast step, with most pharmaceuticals being removed within the first 24h. The results of this study are a first step in the process of selecting an appropriate material or combination of materials to be used as media in SSF-CWs designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters.

AB Acetaminophen (Ace) is a trace pollutant widely found in sewage treatment plant (STP) wastewater. We test the feasibility of coconut shell waste, a low cost adsorbent from coconut industry, for removing Ace from synthetic solution in a fixed-bed column adsorption. To enhance its performance, the surface of granular activated carbon (GAC) was pre-treated with NaOH, HNO3, ozone, and/or chitosan respectively. The results show that the chemical modification of the GAC's surface with various chemicals has enhanced its Ace removal during the column operations. Among the modified adsorbents, the ozone-treated GAC stands out for the highest Ace adsorption capacity (38.2 mg/g) under the following conditions: 40 mg/L of Ace concentration, 2 mL/min of flow rate, 45 cm of bed depth. Both the Thomas and the Yoon-Nelson models are applicable to simulate the experimental results of the column operations with their adsorption capacities: ozone-treated GAC (20.88 mg/g) > chitosancoated GAC (16.67 mg/g) > HNO3-treated GAC (11.09 mg/g) > NaOH-treated GAC (7.57 mg/g) > as-received GAC (2.84 mg/g). This suggests that the ozone-treated GAC is promising and suitable for Ace removal in a fixed-bed reactor.

AB The appearance of pharmaceutical compounds and their bioactive transformation products in aquatic environments is becoming an issue of increasing concern. In this study, the electrochemical oxidation of the widely used antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was investigated using a commercial mixed oxide anode (Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2) and a single compartment filter press-type flow reactor. The kinetics of SMX degradation was determined as a function of electrolyte composition, applied current density, and initial pH. Almost complete (98 %) degradation of SMX could be achieved within 30 min of electrolysis in 0.1 mol L-1 NaCl solution at pH 3 with applied current densities >= 20 mA cm(-2). Nine major intermediates of the reaction were identified by LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS (e.g., C6H9NO2S (m/z = 179), C6H4NOCl (m/z = 141), and C6H6O2 (m/z = 110)). The degradation followed various routes involving cleavage of the oxazole and benzene rings by hydroxyl and/or chlorine radicals, processes that could occur before or after rupture of the N-S bond, followed by oxidation of the remaining moieties. Analysis of the total organic carbon content revealed that the antibiotic was partially mineralized under the conditions employed and some inorganic ions, including NO3- and SO42-, could be identified. The results presented herein demonstrate the efficacy of the electrochemical process using a Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 anode for the remediation of wastewater containing the antibiotic SMX.

AB There is increasing concern about pharmaceuticals entering surface waters and the impacts these compounds may have on aquatic organisms. Many contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, are not completely removed by wastewater treatment. Discharge of effluent into surface waters results in chronic low-concentration exposure of aquatic organisms to these compounds, with unknown impacts. Exposure of virulent bacteria in wastewater to antibiotic residues may also induce resistance, which could threaten human health. The purpose of this study was to provide information on pharmaceutical threats to the environment. A preliminary risk assessment database for common pharmaceuticals was created and put into a web-accessible database named "Pharmaceuticals in the Environment, Information for Assessing Risk" (PEIAR) to help others evaluate potential risks of pharmaceutical contaminants in the environment. Information from PEIAR was used to prioritize compounds that may threaten the environment, with a focus on marine and estuarine environments. The pharmaceuticals were ranked using five different combinations of physical-chemical and toxicological data, which emphasized different risks. The results of the ranking methods differed in the compounds identified as high risk; however, drugs from the central nervous system, cardiovascular, and anti-infective classes were heavily represented within the top 100 drugs in all rankings. Anti-infectives may pose the greatest overall risk based upon our results using a combination of factors that measure environmental transport, fate, and aquatic toxicity. The dataset is also useful for highlighting information that is still needed to assuredly assess risk. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are detected in natural waters at high concentrations relative to other pharmaceuticals due to extensive use in medical diagnostics and high recalcitrance during conventional wastewater treatment. This study examines, for the first time, reductive treatment of ICM in water with hydrogen gas in combination with supported palladium and porous nickel catalysts. Kinetic experiments demonstrate rapid and complete hydrodehalogenation of both ionic (diatrizoate) and neutral (iopromide) ICM. Reaction rates in batch systems (continuous mixing, PH2 = 0.1 MPa, 25 C) appear to be surface-reaction controlled and are dependent upon catalyst identity (e.g., 5 wt % versus 1 wt % Pd/ Al2O3) as well as the concentration of ICM and catalyst. Reaction rates are not markedly affected by ICM structure, pH, or by the presence of many common ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, F-, CI-, Br-, ClO4-, SO42-, HCO3-, and NO3-). In contrast, elevated concentrations of iodide, (bi)sulfide, and dissolved organic matter inhibit hydrodehalogenation of ICM. However, catalyst activity can be regained by washing the catalyst (e.g., with water, NaOCl, or alkaline solution). Catalytic reduction of ICM present in treated wastewater effluent is slower than in deionized water, but similar reaction rates are observed when the effluent is pretreated to reduce the level of dissolved organic matter. The high selectivity of reductive catalytic treatment processes suggest that this is a promising strategy for targeted treatment of ICM present in mixed waste streams and natural water matrices containing much higher concentrations of nontarget Constituents.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) nowadays attract serious attention for the treatment of municipal wastewater, due to recent technical innovations and drastic cost reductions of the employed membranes. Especially the high biomass concentrations and long sludge retention times are favorable for the biodegradation of organic pollutants, resulting in high rate treatment systems. These characteristic features of MBR technology are not merely advantageous for organic matter removal, but also likely promote a higher biodegradation efficiency of refractory organic pollutants. The increasing concern about the potential accumulation of micro-pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the aquatic environment triggered many investigations into their biological degradation or fate in wastewater treatment systems. in this work a short overview is presented on the current knowledge of removal of pharmaceuticals in MBRs compared to their removal in conventional activated sludge treatment system. In general, for slowly degradable pharmaceuticals the removal in MBRs is better due to the relatively long sludge ages, which leads to the development of distinct microbial communities in MBRs compared to activated sludge plants. Nevertheless, from the literature results it could not be concluded that pharmaceutical removal in MBR reactors is better as many other factors have been indicated that may affect biodegradation rates, which are not directly related to the reactor configuration.

AB Phenols pose a risk to the environment and to human health. Phenols found in rivers mainly originate from sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this paper, analytical procedures, based on deconvolution technology and retention time locking technology, were investigated to simultaneously identify and determine the concentrations of fifty different phenols in sewage water and effluents. Seventeen different phenols were found in sewage and five - including two regulated phenols (phenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) and three un-regulated phenols (2-chlorophenol. 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol) - were identified in effluents of five STPs. A number of processes undertaken in five STPs were also investigated. These processes can be used to remove phenols at efficiency levels of between 88.95% and 99.97%. Among the processes tested, a combination of anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A(2)/O), continuous microfiltration (CMF), ozone oxidation (O-3), and chlorination, appeared to be the best option for the removal of key phenols. Among the five phenols identified in effluents, 2,5-dichlorophenol (1.89 mu g/L) and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol (22.6 mu g/L) pose the greatest ecological risk to receiving waters.

AB Eight pharmaceuticals, two polycyclic musk fragrances and nine endocrine disrupting chemicals were analysed in several waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). A membrane bioreactor in pilot scale was operated at different solid retention times (SRTs) and the results obtained are compared to conventional activated sludge plants (CASP) operated at different SRTs. The SRT is an important design parameter and its impact on achievable treatment efficiencies was evaluated. Different behaviours were observed for the different investigated compounds. Some compounds as the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were not removed in any of the sampled treatment facilities and effluent concentrations in the range of influent concentrations were measured. Other compounds as bisphenol-A. the analgesic ibuprofen or the lipid regulator bezafibrate were nearly completely removed (removal rates >90%). The operation of WWTPs with SRTs suitable for nitrogen removal (SRT > 10 days at 10 degrees C) also increases the removal potential regarding selected micropollutants. No differences in treatment efficiencies were detected between the two treatment techniques. As in conventional WWTP also the removal potential of MBRs depends on the SRT. Ultrafiltration membranes do not allow any additional detention of the investigated substances due to size exclusion. However, MBRs achieve a high SRT within a compact reactor. Nonylphenolpolyehtoxylates were removed in higher extend in very low-loaded conventional WWTPs, due to variations of redox conditions, necessary for the degradation of those compounds.

AB Biologically treated wastewater spiked with a mixture of 56 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) was treated with 0-20 mg/L chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution in laboratory-scale experiments. Wastewater effluents were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Sweden, one with extended nitrogen removal (low COD) and one without (high COD). About one third of the tested APIs resisted degradation even at the highest ClO2 dose (20 mg/L), while others were reduced by more than 90% at the lowest ClO2 level (0.5 mg/L). In the low COD effluent, more than half of the APIs were oxidized at 5 mg/L ClO2, while in high COD effluent a significant increase in API oxidation was observed after treatment with 8 mg/L ClO2. This study illustrates the successful degradation of several APIs during treatment of wastewater effluents with chlorine dioxide. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaculture, which is growing 3-5 times faster than terrestrial agriculture, will play an important role to meet future global food production needs. However, over 80% of global sewage production is returned to the environment untreated or poorly treated. In developing nations, these nontraditional waters of diverse quality are being recycled for aquaculture, yet chemical residues are differentially studied. Here, we examined pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and flame retardants in marine bivalves using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and low-pressure gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LP GC-MS/MS). Green-lipped mussels from the field and oysters from aquaculture net pens, which are harvested as food products, were collected adjacent to point source municipal wastewater and landfill leachate effluent discharges, respectively, in Hong Kong, the fourth most densely populated country in the world. Multiple classes of pharmaceutical, pesticides, PAHs, and phosphorus-based flame retardants were detected at low mu g/kg levels. Acceptable servings per week indicated minimal risk for a number of chemicals; however, such calculations could not be performed for other contaminants of emerging concern. Future efforts are needed to better understand contaminant influences on marine bivalve populations and aquaculture product safety, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions of developing countries with limited wastewater infrastructure.

AB A comprehensive screening method for 311 organic compounds with a wide range of physicochemical properties (log Pow -2.2-8.53) in water samples was developed by combining solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography- high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Method optimization using 128 pesticides revealed that tandem extraction with styrene-divinylbenzene polymer and activated carbon solid-phase extraction cartridges at pH 7.0 was optimal. The developed screening method was able to extract 190 model compounds with average recovery of 80.8% and average relative standard deviations (RSD) of 13.5% from spiked reagent water at 0.20 mu g L-1, and 87.1% recovery and 10.8% RSD at 0.05 mu g L-1. Spike-recovery testing (0.20 mu g L-1) using real sewage treatment plant effluents resulted in an average recovery and average RSD of 190 model compounds of 77.4 and 13.1%, respectively. The method was applied to the influent and effluent of five sewage treatment plants in Kitakyushu, Japan, with 29 out of 311 analytes being observed at least once. The results showed that this method can screen for a large number of chemicals with a wide range of physicochemical properties quickly and at low operational cost, something that is difficult to achieve using conventional analytical methods. This method will find utility in target screening of hazardous chemicals with a high risk in environmental waters, and for confirming the safety of water after environmental incidents.

AB Thermocatalytic low temperature conversion (LTC) is a new method for the disposal of sewage sludge. Using this method, sludge is converted into a residual solid (coal) along with reaction water, oil, and non-condensable gases. The oil can be used as an energy source and the coal as a substitute for charcoal. To this end, it is important to determine whether there are any easily available contaminants present in the coal generated by the process. Contaminants that can be strongly sorbed by sewage sludge solids are, e.g., pharmaceuticals and disinfectants. As an example the fate of the persistent and strong adsorbing disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) has been investigated within the LTC process. The sewage sludge was spiked with BAC and then subjected to the LTC process. The resulting coal was extracted and analyzed using LC-LC/ESI-MS/MS (ion trap). BAC could not be detected in the LTC coal, although it could be extracted from the spiked sludge before the LTC treatment. It can thus be concluded that the investigated compound is not easily available in the coal, and hence that its use does not present a risk.

AB The idea of wastewater application on soils, returned to Western Hemisphere during 1950-60. Modern living requires an increased per capita use of water for coverage of individual needs. Nowadays, two main principles related to water management seem to gain the attention of both the scientific communities and the stakeholders: 1. water saving in irrigation of agricultural crops without the reduction of food production, and 2. water saving during human use and industrial activity can only be promoted through water recycling. The increasing water demands at the level of Mediterranean countries are continuously intensified, because of the influence of a number of factors such as agricultural use and industrial consumption. The reuse of municipal wastewater in Mediterranean countries is now considered a useful practice. Countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Italy, Spain, France, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Greece, reuse the treated wastewater to a greater or a lesser extent in agriculture. There are several advantages and disadvantages in the proposed practice. However, existing technologies can help overcome such problems as for example the degradation and thus, the removal of pharmaceutical and xenobiotic compounds.

AB This paper aims to understand enantioselective transformation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) and MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters. In order to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the processes occurring, stereoselective transformation of amphetamine-like compounds was studied, for the first time, in controlled laboratory experiments: receiving water and activated sludge simulating microcosm systems. The results demonstrated that stereoselective degradation, via microbial metabolic processes favouring S-(+)-enantiomer, occurred in all studied amphetamine-based compounds in activated sludge simulating microcosms. R-(-)-enantiomers were not degraded (or their degradation was limited) which proves their more recalcitrant nature. Out of all four amphetamine-like compounds studied, amphetamine was the most susceptible to biodegradation. It was followed by MDMA and methamphetamine. Photochemical processes facilitated degradation of MDMA and methamphetamine but they were not, as expected, stereoselective. Preferential biodegradation of S-(+)-methamphetamine led to the formation of S-(+)-amphetamine. Racemic MDMA was stereoselectively biodegraded by activated sludge which led to its enrichment with R-(-)-enantiomer and formation of S-(+)-MDA. Interestingly, there was only mild stereoselectivity observed during MDMA degradation in rivers. This might be due to different microbial communities utilised during activated sludge treatment and those present in the environment. Kinetic studies confirmed the recalcitrant nature of MDMA.

AB Progestagens discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have increasingly gained attention due to their potential risks to the aquatic organisms. However, limited information is available on the occurrence and removal of various progestagens in WWTPs in different cities of China. This work investigated the occurrence and removal of 11 progestagens in 21 WWTPs from 19 Chinese cities. Results showed that progestagens are widely distributed in the investigated WWTPs, with higher influent concentrations of total progestagens in northern WWTPs. The concentration of progestagens in WWTP influent were closely correlated with influent quality, service population and daily service volume of the WWTPs. Additionally, progesterone (PGT) and dydrogesterone (DDT) were two predominant progestagens in influent, effluent and excess sludge. Up to 5 of 11 progestagens showed high aqueous removal efficiencies (median removal efficiency >90%), whereas megestrol acetate (MTA), chlormadinone acetate (CMA), drospirenone (DSP) and levonorgestrel (LNG) had a removal efficiency of below 50%. Specially, the behaviors of progestagens along the anaerobicanoxic-oxic of a WWTP were further explored and the aerobic tank is the main contributor to the removal of progestagens. Finally, in the effluent of these 21 WWTPs, daily mass loadings of the total progestagens ranged from 0.51 to 10.4 g d(-1) Notably, LNG exhibited high potential risk to the fish base on risk quotient.

AB The quality and safety of reverse osmosis (RO)-treated secondary wastewater (WW), for indirect potable re-use, was assessed using a dataset of 375 chemicals measured in RO-treated WW. A screening health risk assessment indicated that four N-nitrosamines were of potential concern, although median concentrations of these chemicals were always below health values. The most frequently detected chemicals in RO-treated water were disinfection by-products, volatile organic compounds, metals and complexing agents, in contrast to many monitoring programmes that focus on pharmaceuticals, personal care products and hormones. Frequent detections in RO-treated WW were most related to high concentrations in secondary WW, relative to limit of reporting, and the potential for chemicals to form or be added during the treatment process, rather than poor rejection by RO membranes. Between 3.7 and 10.7 mu g/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in RO permeate could be attributed from chemicals detected on at least one occasion, with the majority of this total attributed to chemicals detected in less than 25% of samples. While chemicals below detection may contribute a significant component of DOC, it is likely that natural organic matter and soluble microbial products still contribute the majority of DOC to RO permeate. A high degree of safety is demonstrated for the use of RO-treated WW as an indirect source of potable water.

AB Many pharmaceuticals along with their metabolites have been detected in environmental water samples in the recent decades. The analgesic diclofenac is widely used and thus enters the aquatic environment. Already at realistic environmental concentration levels harmful effects to different organisms have been demonstrated. As this could also be expected for its metabolites, their fate was examined. Six wastewater treatment plant effluents collected throughout Germany were analyzed for the drug and two of its hydroxylated metabolites, 4'-hydroxy diclofenac (4'-OHD) and 5-hydroxy diclofenac (5-OHD), together with the lactam of 4'-OHD, 4'-hydroxy diclofenac dehydrate (4'-OHDD). A quantitative analytical method has been developed using solid-phase extraction followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) in sewage effluent were 0.06 mu g/l for diclofenac and its hydroxyl metabolites and 0.07 mu g/l for 4'-OHDD. Recoveries ranged from 62 to 81%. The metabolites were detected in the samples in median concentration ranges of <LOQ to 0.71 mu g/l, <LOQ to 0.45 mu g/l, and <LOQ to 0.42 mu g/l for 4'-OHD, 5-OHD, and 4'-OHDD, respectively, while median diclofenac concentrations ranged from 1.3 to 3.3 mu g/l. The wide occurrence of its metabolites is highly relevant on account of their structural similarity and the toxicological properties of diclofenac and needs further examination of both toxicity and environmental concentrations of the metabolites.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the secondary effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are of great concern in the process of water reuse. Ozonation has been reported as a powerful oxidation technology to eliminate rnicropollutants in water treatment. Due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix, orthogonal experiments and single factor experiments were conducted to study the influence of operational parameters on the degradation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the synthetic secondary effluent. The results of the orthogonal experiments indicated that the initial ozone and natural organic matter (NOM) concentration significantly affected EE2 degradation efficiency, which was further validated by the single factor confirmation experiments. EE2 was shown to be effectively degraded by ozonation in the conditions of low pH (6), NOM (10 mg/L), carbonate (50 mg/L), but high suspended solid (20 mg/L) and initial ozone concentration (9 mg/L). The study firstly revealed that the lower pH resulted in higher degradation of EE2 in the synthetic secondary effluent, which differed from EDCs ozonation behavior in pure water. EE2 degradation by ozone molecule instead of hydroxyl radical was proposed to play a key role in the degradation of EDCs by ozonation in the secondary effluent. The ratio between O-3 and TOC was identified as an appropriate index to assess the degradation of EE2 by ozonation in the synthetic secondary effluent.

AB Utilization of relatively low-cost modification of Fenton reaction for the elimination of selected antibiotics and resistant coliforms in different part of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was studied. The concentration of antibiotics and occurrence of resistant gems in different stages of WWTP in the capital city of Slovakia - Bratislava was analyzed by LC-MS/MS technique. Consequently, Fenton-like reaction was applied for the elimination of chemical and biological contaminants. Comparative study with classical Fenton reaction was also done. Very high concentrations of clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin in influent water were found. Coliform bacteria were predominantly resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. After the mechanical stage, the concentration of antibiotics in water was significantly decreased because of the sorption during this step. Biological step degraded 12 types of antibiotics. Analyses of effluent water showed very bad elimination of azithromycin (919 ng/L) and clarithromycin (684 ng/L). Contrary, ciprofloxacin was removed with very high efficiency (95%). The number of resistant bacteria was also significantly decreased in effluent water. In the case of Escherichia coil only ampicillin and gentamicin resistance bacteria were detected. Our results show that antibiotics as well as resistant bacteria were eliminated by the modification of classical Fenton reaction with high efficiency. The modification of the Fenton reaction can decrease the process wages, environmental impact. Moreover, the degradation process was easily controlled, monitored and tuned. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals, nonylphenol ethoxylate metabolites, and other wastewater-derived contaminants in surface waters is a potential environmental concern, especially since the discovery of contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties. The present study investigated the discharge of emerging contaminants into the Santa Ana River (CA, USA) and their attenuation during river transport and passage through a constructed wetland. Contaminants studied included pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and carbamazepine) and their metabolites, hormones, the metabolites of alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEMs), N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (NBBS), and chlorinated tris-propylphosphates (TCPPs). The APEMs included alkylphenols (APs), short-chain AP polyethoxylates (APEOs), AP polyethoxycarboxylates (APECs), and carboxylated APECs (CAPECs). In wastewater treatment plant effluent, APECs and CAPECs represented the dominant APEM fraction (1.8-18.7 mug/L), whereas APEOs and APs contributed only small amounts to the overall APEM concentrations (0.10-0.92 and less than or equal to 0.1 mug/L, respectively) except where the effluent was infiltrated into soil (5.2 mug/L). In effluents, ibuprofen and its metabolites TCPPs, and NBBS were detected regularly (<0.5 mug/L), and the other pharmaceuticals were detected occasionally. Transport in the Santa Ana River for 11 km resulted in the significant attenuation of all contaminants, from 67% for gemfibrozil to 100% for others. Wetland treatment (residence time, 2-4 d) resulted in partial removal of ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and TCPPs and transformed APEOs to APECs.

AB The consumption of methylphenidate, a nootropic drug used to improve mental performance, is becoming increasingly serious. Methylphenidate is metabolized in human liver to ritalinic acid, which has been commonly detected in sewage and surface waters. Additionally, ritalinic acid serves as a biomarker in sewage epidemiology studies. Thus knowledge of the stability and microbial degradation pathways of ritalinic acid is essential for proper estimation of methylphenidate consumption. In the study reported here, we describe the fast formation of a previously unknown, dead-end metabolite of ritalinic acid by Nocardioides sp. strain MW5. HRMS and 2D NMR analyses allowed precisely identification of the compound as an imidazole-based alkaloid cation with chemical formula 11-[3-(formylamino)propyl]-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octahydrodipyrido [1,2-a:1',2'-dimidazole-5-ium. In experiments, Nocardioides sp. strain MW5 transformed 34% of ritalinic acid into this metabolite, while 52% was mineralized into CO2. Alkaloid was not biodegraded during the OECD 301 F test. This study provides new insight into the environmental fate of methylphenidate and its metabolites. The data collected are essential for assessing nootropic drug consumption by sewage epidemiology and should lead to a better understanding of microbial degradation of ritalinic acid.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are carried into aquatic bodies along with domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural wastewater discharges. Psychotropic drugs, which can be toxic to the biota, have been detected in natural waters in different parts of the world. Conventional water treatments, such as activated sludge, do not properly remove these recalcitrant substances, so the development of processes able to eliminate these compounds becomes very important. Advanced oxidation processes are considered clean technologies, capable of achieving high rates of organic compounds degradation, and can be an efficient alternative to conventional treatments. In this study, the degradation of alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and carbamazepine was evaluated through TiO2/UV-A, H2O2/UV-A, and TiO2/H2O2/UV-A, using sunlight and artificial irradiation. While using TiO2 in suspension, best results were found at [TiO2] = 0.1 g L-1. H2O2/UV-A displayed better results under acidic conditions, achieving from 60 to 80% of removal. When WWTP was used, degradation decreased around 50% for both processes, TiO2/UV-A and H2O2/UV-A, indicating a strong matrix effect. The combination of both processes was shown to be an adequate approach, since removal increased up to 90%. H2O2/UV-A was used for disinfecting the aqueous matrices, while mineralization was obtained by TiO2-photocatalysis.

AB Pretreatment technologies prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) have been developed with the aim of enhancing bio-gas productivity and reducing the presence of pathogens in digested sludge. Among them, thermal hydrolysis (TH) appears as the most promising one. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) sludge is the end point of many organic micropollutants (OMPs), which was proved to lead to important environmental and human risks since sludge is commonly used in agriculture. The objective of this work is to determine the fate OMPs in TH and subsequent AD. Sewage sludge was pretreated in a TH pilot plant at 170 degrees C for 20 min. Afterwards, two anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 14 L fed with fresh and pretreated sludge were operated in parallel in mesophilic conditions. TH proved to be an effective technology to partially or totally remove the dissolved fraction of OMPs as well as the fraction sorbed into those suspended solids that are solubilised after this pretreatment. However, it did not affect the OMPs sorbed concentration into solids that are not solubilised. Globally, the OMPs removal efficiency during TH appears to be linked to the solids solubilisation during this process. Afterwards, the OMPs biotransformation efficiency in AD of fresh and pretreated sludge was determined. Noticeable differences between the microbiome of both reactors was determined, but the anaerobic biotransformation was not substantially different for most of the OMPs. However, it affected musk fragrances, which presented considerably lower biotransformation efficiency in the reactor fed with pretreated sludge. Therefore, TH was proved effective in partially removing OMPs but not in enhancing their bioavailability and subsequent anaerobic biotransformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enantiomeric profiling was used in this study to investigate the consumption of amphetamine and methamphetamine in regional and urban Southeast Queensland, Australia over a period of seven years. S(+) methamphetamine was predominantly consumed in both urban and regional areas, showing a two and three fold increase in urban and regional catchments respectively between 2011 and 2017. The ratio of amphetamine to methamphetamine (AMP/METH) in waste water reflected the expected excretion profile of methamphetamine consumption indicating the presence of amphetamine in this study was primarily the result of methamphetamine metabolism. However, the occasional occurrence of R(-) amphetamine in samples containing higher AMP/METH ratios, suggested the consumption of racemic amphetamine. The R(-) methamphetamine enantiomer was also identified in several samples, possibly indicative that the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) synthesis process rather than the more typical reduction of ephedrines was also being used to manufacture methamphetamine. Furthermore, we identified two samples with a significantly different enantiomer ratio for the METH and AMP as well as a much lower AMP/METH concentration ratio suggesting contribution from direct disposal of methamphetamine into the sewer. This study demonstrated that enantiomeric profiling in waste water-based epidemiology can provide valuable information for evaluating the origin of amphetamine in waste water as either a metabolite of methamphetamine consumption or amphetamine itself.

AB A comprehensive monitoring of a broad set of antibiotics in the final effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of 7 European countries (Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Germany, Finland, and Norway) was carried out in two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). This is the first study of this kind performed at an international level. Within the 53 antibiotics monitored 17 were detected at least once in the final effluent of the WWTPs, i.e.: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, cefalexin, clindamycin, metronidazole, ampicillin, and tetracycline. The countries exhibiting the highest effluent average concentrations of antibiotics were Ireland and the southern countries Portugal and Spain, whereas the northern countries (Norway, Finland and Germany) and Cyprus exhibited lower total concentration. The antibiotic occurrence data in the final effluents were used for the assessment of their impact on the aquatic environment. Both, environmental predicted no effect concentration (PNEC-ENVs) and the PNECs based on minimal inhibitory concentrations (PNEC-MICs) were considered for the evaluation of the impact on microbial communities in aquatic systems and on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, respectively. Based on this analysis, three compounds, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and cefalexin are proposed as markers of antibiotic pollution, as they could occasionally pose a risk to the environment. Integrated studies like this are crucial to map the impact of antibiotic pollution and to provide the basis for designing water quality and environmental risk in regular water monitoring programs.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. After their application, they are excreted in unchanged as well as in metabolized form. Due to incomplete elimination in wastewater treatment plants, they can be emitted into surface water. The environmental fate of both parent compounds and metabolites is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the biodegradation potential of river sediment for the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its two major human metabolites N-4-acetyl-SMX and SMX-Ni-glucuronide using a water sediment test system. Each compound was tested in a separate series together with sterile and "water only" controls. All three compounds were efficiently removed from the test system by biodegradation in the sediment. Only for SMX-Ni-glucuronide, a substantial removal in the absence of sediment was determined. Dissipation times from the aqueous phase (DT50) between 8.5 and 17.2 days were measured. Sorption to sediment was of minor importance due to the slightly basic pH of the test system. By the application of a mathematical model, biodegradation half-lives in sediment between 3.3 and 25.6 h were calculated for SMX and its metabolites. The results of this study highlight the capability of native river sediment for degrading sulfonamide antibiotics, but also the potential of human metabolites to retransform into parent SMX under environmental conditions. Based on this study, it is unlikely that SMX or its metabolites will persist or accumulate in river sediments under PH conditions where sorption is of minor importance.

AB The photochemical fate of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) found in the environment has been studied under controlled laboratory conditions applying a sunlight simulator. Aqueous samples containing PPCPs at environmentally relevant concentrations were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) after irradiation. The exposed extracts were subsequently analysed by liquid chromatography combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for studying the kinetics of photolytic transformations. Almost all exposed PPCPs appeared to react with a half-life time (tau (1/2)) of less than 30 min. For ranitidine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, tau(1/2) was found to be even less than 5 min. The structures of major photolysis products were determined using quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QToF) and spectroscopic data reported in the literature. For diclofenac, the transformation products carbazol-1-yl-acidic acid and 8-chloro-9H-carbazol-1-yl-acetic acid were identified based on the mass/charge ratio of protonated ions and their fragmentation pattern in negative electrospray ionization (ESI--QTOF). Irradiation of carbamazepine resulted in three known products: acridine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, whereas acetaminophen was photolytically transformed to 1-(2-amino-5 hydroxyphenyl) ethenone. These photochemical products were subsequently identified in seawater or fish samples collected at sites exposed to wastewater effluents on the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea.

AB The presence of residual pharmaceuticals and environmental endocrine disrupters (EEDs) is increasingly significant due to their impact on human health and wildlife. Of the compounds implicated as EEDs, the most potent in their oestrogenic effect are the natural and synthetic oestrogens. As these compounds will be present in the sewage matrix, it is necessary to establish their fate during sewage treatment with a view of removal and safe disposal to avoid unnecessary exposure. Using methodology developed by the author this paper describes the results of a study undertaken to determine both the K,,, and the adsorption characteristics of these oestrogens. The experimental values obtained were compared to a computational default model. However, there was disparity between the default model and the values determined experimentally. This was especially the case in the determination of the K., which impacts directly on the sludge adsorbance potential. The calculated results ranged from log 4.21 for beta-oestradiol to log 4.68 for 17 alpha-EE-3-ME, the experimental results were higher log(5.04-log5.83), respectively. The implications of the findings in terms of water recycling and sewage sludge disposal are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Septic systems, a common type of onsite wastewater treatment systems, can be an important source of micropollutants in the environment. We investigated the fate and mass balance of 17 micropollutants, including wastewater markers, hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the drainfield of a septic system. Drainfields were replicated in lysimeters (1.5 m length, 0.9 m width, 0.9 m height) and managed similar to the field practice. In each lysimeter, a drip line dispersed 9 L of septic tank effluent (STE) per day (equivalent to 32.29 L/m(2) per day). Fourteen micropollutants in the STE and 12 in the leachate from drainfields were detected over eight months. Concentrations of most micropollutants in the leachate were low (<200 ng/L) when compared to STE because >85% of the added micropollutants except for sucralose were attenuated in the drainfield. We discovered that sorption was the key mechanism for retention of carbamazepine and partially for sulfamethoxazole, whereas microbial degradation likely attenuated acetaminophen in the drainfield. This data suggests that sorption and microbial degradation limited transport of micropollutants from the drainfields. However, the leaching of small amounts of micropollutants indicate that septic systems are hot-spots of micropollutants in the environment and a better understanding of micropollutants in septic systems is needed to protect groundwater quality.

AB The conventional parameters and acute toxicities of antibiotic wastewater collected from each treatment unit of an antibiotic wastewater treatment plant have been investigated. The investigation of the conventional parameters indicated that the antibiotic wastewater treatment plant performed well under the significant fluctuation in influent water quality. The results of acute toxicity indicated that the toxicity of antibiotic wastewater could be reduced by 94.3 percent on average after treatment. However, treated antibiotic effluents were still toxic to Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity of antibiotic production wastewater could be attributed to the joint effects of toxic compound mixtures in wastewater. Moreover, aerobic biological treatment processes, including sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and aerobic biofilm reactor, played the most important role in reducing toxicity by 92.4 percent. Pearson's correlation coefficients revealed that toxicity had a strong and positive linear correlation with organic substances, nitrogenous compounds, S2-, volatile phenol, cyanide, As, Zn, Cd, Ni and Fe. Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) was the greatest contributor to toxicity according to the stepwise regression method. The multiple regression model was a good fit for [TU50-15 min] as a function of [NH4+] with the determination coefficient of 0.981. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The composition of wastewater produced in industrial processes can vary dynamically and often randomly. immediate intervention is necessary to preserve the water quality before any parameter of the wastewater exceeds the threshold limit; therefore, the parameters of the wastewater must he determined in real time. Direct laboratory methods have long lead times; indirect methods (refraction, pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc.) would be suitable as they measure indirect values, so correlations must be found between the measured values and the component(s) for analysis. These correlations are often stochastic in nature having a standard deviation of the same magnitude as the measured values. This paper deals with pharmaceutical wastewater with a high sucrose content, the online measurement of its organic material content characterised by chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), refraction and resistance. It finds a correlation between the CODcr and resistance-corrected refraction (r*). To reduce the standard deviation, the concept of cumulative CODcr is introduced. Concentration limit values could be determined to compare with the cumulative CODcr values calculated continuously during the fill up of the wastewater tank. This means that the treatment with the wastewater (into the drain, dilution and transfer) can be decided. The validity of the model is checked by trial calculations based on a high number of measurements.

AB The identification and quantification of effluent toxicity plays an important role in the evaluation of harmful impacts on the aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the advantages of using the 'whole-effluent' toxicity approach compared to prediction of toxicity using key toxic compounds. An underestimation of 'whole-effluent' toxicity was always observed using bacteria, but in some cases the sum of individual toxic units was more accurate using daphnids. Good agreement was found in testing the wastewater from a chemical factory. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of using the 'whole-effluent' toxicity approach for the reliable assessment of wastewater quality.

AB Ten nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). two blood lipid regulators (BLRs), and two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were analyzed in the Pearl River system in China (i.e., Liuxi, Zhujiang. and Shijing Rivers) and four sewage effluents during the dry and wet seasons, and the environmental risks they posed were assessed. Eight pharmaceuticals were detected in the rivers and effluents, including five NSAIDs (salicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, and naproxen), two BLRs (clofibric acid and gemfibrozil), and one AED (carbamazepine). The median concentrations for the eight pharmaceuticals ranged from 11.2 to 102 ng/L. Seasonal variations were not obvious for most pharmaceuticals in the three rivers, except for salicylic acid and clolibric acid in the Zhujiting River, and diclofenac in the Zhujiang and Shijing Rivers. However, spatially considerable variations in the concentrations were observed for the eight pharmaceuticals in all three rivers. For most of the pharmaceuticals, the effluents from the four wastewater treatment plants and Shijing River water were found to be the major discharge sources for the Zhujiang River, but with additional discharge sources front some small urban streams in the wet season. Diclofenac in the Shijing River was the only pharmaceutical that had a risk quotient (RQ) >1, indicating a high risk to aquatic organisms in the river. Although higher RQs were calculated for the mixture of the pharmaceuticals in each river, the risk rating remained the same for the three rivers with the RQ being >1 only in Shijing River.

AB This study investigates the occurrence of all priority substances (n = 41) listed in the Water Framework Directive and additional substances (n = 47) in raw sewage, as well as the removal performance of lamella clarification and biofiltration techniques. Once the efficiency of both types of techniques has been assessed for typical wastewater parameters, the differences in each technique's ability to remove pollutants becomes obvious; nevertheless, pollutant removal in quantitative terms still depends on the physicochemical properties of the compounds used and operating conditions within the selected facility. For lamella clarification, the removal of organic chemicals was found to be primarily correlated with their sorption potential and, hence, strongly dependent upon log K-ow of the compound under study. Compounds with a strong hydrophobic character (log K-ow > 4.5) are removed to a significant extent (approx. 85%), while hydrophilic compounds (log K-ow < 3.5) are poorly removed (<20%). For biofiltration, the removal of chemicals appears to be compound-dependent, although this outcome involves several mechanisms, namely: i) physical filtration of total suspended solids, ii) volatilisation, iii) sorption, and iv) biotransformation of substances. Even if the complex processes within a biofilter system do not yield an accurate prediction of pollutant removal, two groups of chemicals can still be clearly identified: i) hydrophobic or volatile compounds, for which moderate to high removal rates are observed (from 50% to over 80%); and ii) hydrophilic, non-volatile and refractory compounds for which a low removal rate would be expected (<20%).

AB Advanced oxidation technologies such as ozonation have been proposed to improve removal efficiency of micropollutants during wastewater treatment. In a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature, we found no ecotoxicological effects of wastewater ozonation on invertebrates (n = 82), but significant adverse effects on bacteria (n = 24) and fish (n = 5). As information on functional endpoints or trophic interactions is lacking, we applied a bioassay relating to leaf litter decomposition to fill this gap. Leaf discs exposed to ozone-treated wastewater with a high (1.04 mg O(3) (mg DOC)(-1), n = 49) ozone concentration were significantly preferred by an aquatic detritivore, Gammarus fossarum, over discs conditioned in wastewater not treated with ozone. This effect might have been mediated by reduced bacterial and elevated fungal biomass, and appears to be the first demonstration of wastewater ozonation impacts on invertebrates and an associated ecosystem process. In accordance with the food-choice trials, chemical analyses revealed significantly decreased concentrations of organic micropollutants in wastewater treated with ozone at high concentrations. Thus, food-choice trials as applied here hold promise to assess environmental effects of advanced oxidation technologies in wastewater treatment and appear to be a valuable complement to the ecotoxicological toolbox in general.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a potential solution for wastewater treatment due to their capacity to support native species and provide tertiary wastewater treatment. However, CWs can expose wildlife communities to excess nutrients and harmful contaminants, affecting their development, morphology, and behavior. To examine how wastewater CWs may affect wildlife, we raised Southern leopard frogs, Lithobates sphenocephalus, in wastewater from conventional secondary lagoon and tertiary CW treatments for comparison with pondwater along with the presence and absence of a common plant invader to these systems ? common duckweed (Lemna minor) - and monitored their juvenile development for potential carryover effects into the terrestrial environment. The tertiary CW treatment did not change demographic or morphological outcomes relative to conventional wastewater treatment in our study. Individuals emerging from both wastewater treatments demonstrated lower terrestrial survival rates than those emerging from pondwater throughout the experiment though experiment-wide survival rates were equivalent among treatments. Individuals from wastewater treatments transformed at larger sizes relative to those in pondwater, but this advantage was minimized in the terrestrial environment. Individuals that developed with duckweed had consistent but marginally better performance in both environments. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between short-term benefits of development in treated effluent and long-term consequences on overall fitness. Overall, we demonstrate that CWs for the purpose of wastewater treatment may not be suitable replicates for wildlife habitat and could have consequences for local population dynamics.

AB In this work, two analytical methodologies based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were developed for quantification of emerging pollutants identified in sewage sludge after a previous wide-scope screening. The target list included 13 emerging contaminants (EC): thiabendazole, acesulfame, fenofibric acid, valsartan, irbesartan, salicylic acid, diclofenac, carbamazepine, 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AA), 4-acetyl aminoantipyrine (4-AAA), 4-formyl aminoantipyrine (4-FAA), venlafaxine and benzoylecgonine. The aqueous and solid phases of the sewage sludge were analyzed making use of Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and UltraSonic Extraction (USE) for sample treatment, respectively. The methods were validated at three concentration levels: 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g L-1 for the aqueous phase, and 50, 500 and 2000 mu g kg(-1) for the solid phase of the sludge. In general, the method was satisfactorily validated, showing good recoveries (70-120%) and precision (RSD < 20%). Regarding the limit of quantification (LOQ), it was below 0.1 mu g L-1 in the aqueous phase and below 50 mu g kg(-1) in the solid phase for the majority of the analytes. The method applicability was tested by analysis of samples from a wider study on degradation of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge under anaerobic digestion. The key benefits of these methodologies are:
   SPE and USE are appropriate sample procedures to extract selected emerging contaminants from the aqueous phase of the sewage sludge and the solid residue.
   LC-MS/MS is highly suitable for determining emerging contaminants in both sludge phases.
   Up to our knowledge, the main metabolites of dipyrone had not been studied before in sewage sludge. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

AB This study evaluated the performance of five different sorbents (granular activated carbon (GAC), GAC + Polonite((R)) (GAC + P), Xylit, lignite and sand) for a set of 83 micropollutants (MPs) (pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), personal care products, artificial sweeteners, parabens, pesticide, stimulants), together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties. Treatment with GAC and GAC + P provided the highest removal efficiencies, with average values above 97%. Removal rates were generally lower for Xylit (on average 74%) and lignite (on average 68%), although they proved to be highly efficient for a few individual MPs. The average removal efficiency for sand was only 47%. It was observed that the MPs behaved differently depending on their physicochemical properties. The physicochemical properties of PFASs (i.e. molecular weight, topological molecular surface area, log octanol water partition coefficient (K-ow) and distribution coefficient between octanol and water (log D)) were positively correlated to observed removal efficiency for the sorbents Xylit, lignite and sand (p <0.05), indicating a strong influence of perfluorocarbon chain length and associated hydrophobic characteristics. In contrast, for the other MPs the ratio between apolar and polar surface area (SA/SP) was positively correlated with the removal efficiency, indicating that hydrophobic adsorption may be a key feature of their sorption mechanisms. GAC showed to be the most promising filter medium to improve the removal of MPs in on-site sewage treatment facilities. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of MPs in field trials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the practical implementation and validation of advanced control strategies, designed using model based techniques, at an industrial wastewater treatment plant is demonstrated. The plant under study is treating the wastewater of a large pharmaceutical production facility. The process characteristics of the wastewater treatment were quantified by means of tracer tests, intensive measurement campaigns and the use of on-line sensors. In parallel, a dynamical model of the complete wastewater plant was developed according to the specific kinetic characteristics of the sludge and the highly varying composition of the industrial wastewater. Based on real-time data and dynamic models, control strategies for the equalisation system, the polymer dosing and phosphorus addition were established. The control strategies are being integrated in the existing SCADA system combining traditional PLC technology with robust PC based control calculations. The use of intelligent control in wastewater treatment offers a wide spectrum of possibilities to upgrade existing plants, to increase the capacity of the plant and to eliminate peaks. This can result in a more stable and secure overall performance and, finally, in cost savings. The use of on-line sensors has a potential not only for monitoring concentrations, but also for manipulating flows and concentrations. This way the performance of the plant can be secured.

AB Environmental occurrence of CECs poses a great threat to both aquatic life and human health. The aim of this study was to optimize and validate SPE/LC-(ESI) MS-MS method for simultaneous quantitative monitoring of two sub-classes of CECs (pharmaceuticals and hormones) and to estimate the concentrations of select CECs in environmental water samples. For all the tested analytes, recoveries in laboratory reagent water were greater than 81%. Average percent (relative standard deviation) RSD of the analytes in recovery, repeatability, and reproducibility experiments were <= 10%. Determination coefficients (r(2)) of primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were estimated to be 0.9979, 0.9972, 0.9968, and 0.9962, respectively. Limits of detection (LOD) for primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were 4.63 ng/L, 5.36 ng/L, 0.55 ng/L, and 0.88 ng/L, respectively. Limits of quantification (LOQ) for primidone, diclofenac, testosterone, and progesterone were 14.72 ng/L, 17.06 ng/L, 1.766 ng/L, and 2.813 ng/L, respectively. Average recoveries in environmental water and wastewater samples were greater than 74% and RSD were <= 7%. Trace levels (68.33-125.70 ng/L) of primidone were detected in four environmental water samples, whereas diclofenac was not detected in any of the tested sample. Trace levels of progesterone were observed in two environmental samples (16.64-203.73 ng/L), whereas testosterone was detected in STP inlet sample (178.16 ng/L).

AB This study was undertaken to develop an extraction method for seven acidic pharmaceuticals and five steroidal estrogens from wastewater, treated wastewater and sludge samples. The temperature and time of sample derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was optimized. Our results show that pretreatment combined with solid phase extraction (SPE) for wastewater samples (using an ENVI-C18 cartridge) and liquid-solid extraction combined with SPE (using an HLB cartridge) for sludge samples increased the analytical efficiency for acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogenic hormones using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The derivatization conditions were optimized at 40 degrees C for 2h. In addition, the derivatized samples were stable at ambient temperature. The new method was validated and applied to the analysis of real wastewater and discharged sludge samples from a local wastewater treatment plant. Except for 17-ethinylestradiol, all acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogens were detected in the influent, effluent and discharged sludge samples. The concentrations of these compounds were particularly high in the discharged sludge samples.

AB Resistant pollutants like oil, grease, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and plastics in wastewater are difficult to be degraded by traditional activated sludge methods. These pollutants are prevalent, posing a great threat to aquatic environments and organisms since they are toxic, resistant to natural biodegradation, and create other serious problems. As a high-efficiency biocatalyst, enzymes are proposed for the treatment of these resistant pollutants. This review focused on the roles and applications of enzymes in wastewater treatment. It discusses the influence of enzyme types and their sources, enzymatic processes in resistant pollutants remediation, identification and ecotoxicity assay of enzymatic transformation products, and typically employed enzymatic wastewater treatment systems. Perspectives on the major challenges and feasible future research directions of enzyme-based wastewater treatment are also proposed.

AB Traces of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other chemicals are demonstrated in effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) and they may affect quality of surface water and eventually drinking water. Treatment of effluents with granular activated carbon (GAC) or ozone to improve removal of APIs and other contaminants was evaluated at two Swedish STPs, Kappala and Uppsala (88 and 103 APIs analyzed). Biomarker responses in rainbow trout exposed to regular and additionally treated effluents were determined. GAC and ozone treatment removed 87-95% of the total concentrations of APIs detected. In Kappala, GAC removed 20 and ozonation (7 g O-3/m(3)) 21 of 24 APIs detected in regular effluent. In Uppsala, GAC removed 25 and ozonation (5.4 g O-3/m(3)) 15 of 25 APIs detected in effluent. GAC and ozonation also reduced biomarker responses caused by unidentified pollutants in STP effluent water. Elevated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in gills was observed in fish exposed to effluent in both STPs. Gene expression analysis carried out in Kappala showed increased concentrations of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A5 and CYP1C3) transcripts in gills and of CYP1As in liver of fish exposed to effluent. In fish exposed to GAC- or ozone-treated effluent water, gill EROD activity and expression of CYP1As and CYP1C3 in gills and liver were generally equal to or below levels in fish held in tap water. The joint application of chemical analysis and sensitive biomarkers proved useful for evaluating contaminant removal in STPs with new technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage sludge (SS) is a complex organic by-product of wastewater treatment plants. Deposition of large amounts of SS can increase the risk of soil contamination. Therefore, there is an increasing need for fast and accurate assessment of SS toxic potential. Toxic effects of SS were tested on earthworm Eisenia fetida tissue, at the subcellular and biochemical level. Earthworms were exposed to depot sludge (DS) concentration ratio of 30 or 70 %, to undiluted and to 100 and 10 times diluted active sludge (AS). The exposure to DS lasted for 24/48 h (acute exposure), 96 h (semi-acute exposure) and 7/14/28 days (sub-chronic exposure) and 48 h for AS. Toxic effects were tested by the measurements of multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR) activity and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the observation of morphological alterations and behavioural changes. Biochemical markers confirmed the presence of MXR inhibitors in the tested AS and DS and highlighted the presence of SS-induced oxidative stress. The MXR inhibition and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentration in the whole earthworm's body were higher after the exposition to lower concentration of the DS. Furthermore, histopathological changes revealed damage to earthworm body wall tissue layers as well as to the epithelial and chloragogen cells in the typhlosole region. These changes were proportional to SS concentration in tested soils and to exposure duration. Obtained results may contribute to the understanding of SS-induced toxic effects on terrestrial invertebrates exposed through soil contact and to identify defence mechanisms of earthworms.

TI WASTEWATER REUSE IN THE INDUSTRY: AN ECO-GENOTOXICOLOGICAL APPROACH
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN

DE Industrial wastewater; bioassays; microbiological parameters; Medical
   Devices; wastewater reuse; genotoxicity
AB The treatment and reuse of industrial wastewater is an important key practice for a sustainable water resources management. Waste-water reuse is a goal to be achieved to tackle and manage the scarcity of water resources caused also by the climate changes in particular in the Mediterranean area. This study aims to identify a set of suitable tools needed to assess the potential reuse of treated wastewater from medical devices (MDs) and pharmaceutical manufacturers taking into account ecogenotoxicological and microbiological parameters. The microbiological parameters investigated were Bacterial Total Count (BTC), E. coli, Enterococci, Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. A set of ecotoxicological assays was selected for this study: the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the alga P. subcapitata, the crustacean Daphnia magna, the fish Danio rerio and the plant Sorghum saccharatum. Seeds of Vicia faba were used for the assessment of the genotoxic effects of wastewater using the Micronucleus test (MN-test). The sampling was performed at three MDs manufacturers and were collected at the inlet and outlet of water treatment plants. The results show a significant decrease in treated wastewater samples of the microbiological parameters and the absence of E. coli. The ecotoxicological assays highlight a significant toxicity of the wastewater before the treatment, while a decrease has been recorded after the treatment for some samples. Genotoxic and sublethal effects were reported in some samples for Vicia faba's micronucleus frequencies and fish embryos respectively. Even though preliminary, this approach can be considered a useful tool in the context of the wastewater industrial reuse management and a possible support to the legislation.

This study reports comparative pollutants removal from hospital wastewater using Constructed Wetlands and associated tubesettler dosed with Hospital wastewater. A pilot scale CW system was used for treating 10m(3)/day of hospital wastewater. The system was tested for 3 Months to evaluate its performance for removing pollutants from the wastewater. The HSFCW coupled with tubesettler achieved over all removal efficiency of 94% (COD), MLSS (97%), TSS (98%), BOD5 (96%), Phosphate (79%). However, process of nitrification was not observed and accumulation of Nitrate up to 197% was observed. The study concluded that it may be due to the presence of pharmaceuticals and other elements present in hospital wastewater. This conclusion was based on the fact that Alkalinity increased by 52% in effluent and pH value also exhibited an average increase of 12%. Further research studies are required to investigate effect of pharmaceutical originating from hospital on treatment efficiency, to incorporate anaerobic setup to complete denitrification-nitrification process and also to determine efficiency of thermophilic, mesophilic, and psychmphilic bacteria with respect to climate and temperature.

AB A suite of benzothiazoles and benzotriazoles was analysed by comprehensive multi-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry in four different wastewater treatment systems. The selected wastewater treatment systems include one conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and for the first time, two constructed wetlands. Although benzothiazole (BT), 2-(methylthio) benzothiazole (MTBT), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OHBT) and benzotriazole (BTri) occurred in all the raw wastewater samples, 4- and 5-methylbenzotriazoles (4- and 5-TTri) were only detected in the industrially impacted wastewater. Concentrations of benzothiazoles and benzotriazoles in raw wastewater ranged from 0.2 to 2.2 mu gL(-1) and from 0.06 to 36.2 mu gL(-1), respectively. The benzothiazoles removal efficiencies ranged from zero to up to 80% in the conventional WWTP and from 83 to 90% in constructed wetlands. For BTri, removal efficiencies ranged from 65 to 70% and from 89 to 93% in conventional WWTP and constructed wetlands, respectively. The higher performance of CWs in the removal of these compounds might be attributed to the contribution of biodegradation, photodegradation and plant uptake.

AB This paper first reports the occurrence of six glucocorticoids (prednisone, prednisolone, cortisone, cortisol, dexamethasone, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone) in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and receiving rivers by establishing a method for analyzing glucocorticoids in complex environmental waters. For the various types of aqueous matrices considered, the absolute recoveries were from 73 to 99%, and limits of quantification were below 0.2 ng/L. Among the seven STPs studied, the average concentrations of prednisone, prednisolone, cortisone, cortisol, dexamethasone, and 6 alpha-methylprednisolone in influents were, respectively, 2.6 +/- 2.1, 3.0 +/- 1.6, 30 +/- 21, 39 +/- 26, 1.2 +/- 0.70, and 0.62 +/- 0.65 ng/L, and their percent removals were 99 +/- 3.1, 78 +/- 8.8, 99 +/- 1.2, 98 +/- 2.5, 99 +/- 1.8, and 100 +/- 0%, respectively. The lower removal of prednisolone was found to be due to its relatively low efficiency of biodegradation, especially in anoxic and aerobic units. The frequently detected glucocorticoids in effluents were prednisolone, cortisol, and cortisone with average concentrations 0.56 +/- 0.06, 0.50 +/- 0.33, and 0.26 +/- 0.10 ng/L. In the receiving waters, the Tonghui and Qing Rivers, the concentrations of these compounds in some samples were much higher than those in their corresponding STP effluents; these differences depended on the sampling date, suggesting that there was random discharging of untreated wastewaters into these rivers. In addition, the ratio between the combined concentrations of two natural glucocorticoids (cortisol and cortisone) and the concentration of one synthetic glucocorticoid, prednisolone, was found to be a potential index to reflect the wastewater discharging.

AB Guadiamar River is located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula and connects two protected areas in the South of Spain: Sierra Morena and Doana National Park. It is sited in an area affected by urban, industrial and agriculture sewage pollution and with tradition on intensive mining activities. Most of the studies performed in this area have been mainly focused on the presence of heavy metals and, until now, little is known about the occurrence of other contaminants such as emerging organic pollutants (EOPs). In this work, an analytical method has been optimized and validated for monitoring of forty-seven EOPs in surface water. The analytical method has been applied to study the distribution and environmental risk of these pollutants in Guadiamar River basin. The analytical method was based on solid-phase extraction and determination by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry. The 60 % of the target compounds were found in the analyzed samples. The highest concentrations were found for two plasticizers (bisphenol A and di(2-ethyhexyl)phthalate, mean concentration up to 930 ng/L) and two pharmaceutical compounds (caffeine (up to 623 ng/L) and salicylic acid (up to 318 ng/L)). This study allowed to evaluate the potential sources (industrial or urban) of the studied compounds and the spatial distribution of their concentrations along the river. Environmental risk assessment showed a major risk on the south of the river, mainly due to discharges of wastewater effluents.

AB An intense campaign was carried out over a 14 month period to characterize concentrations and loads of 7 well-known Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), during dry and wet weather conditions, in an urban combined catchment in the northwest of Spain, a geographical zone with an average annual rainfall over 1500 mm. The main objective was to gather more in-depth knowledge of the mobilization of these "micropollutants" in an urban combined sewer and the possible pressures on water receiving bodies due to combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Hydrographs and pollutographs of these substances in dry weather flows (DWF), on weekdays and weekends, and wet weather flows (WWF) during 10 rain events have been characterized to obtain data that are sufficiently representative for statistical analysis. The research findings show that there is a considerable mobilization of these substances during rain events, mainly in the first part of the hydrographs, especially HHCB galaxolide, ibuprofen and paracetamol with maximum concentrations of 9.76, 8.51 and 5.71 mu g/L respectively, whereas these concentrations in dry weather only reached 2.57, 2.11 and 0.72 mu g/L respectively. There is a good correlation between the degree of mobilization in wet weather flows and the percentage of dry weather particulate phase of each studied substance, indicating that such mobilization may be associated with adsorption on the sediments deposited on the collectors during the antecedent dry period. These results are in good agreement with removal in conventional WWTP, especially for compounds that tend to adsorb onto sewage sludge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a commonly-prescribed antibiotic that is largely excreted by the body, and is often found at elevated concentrations in treated sewage sludge (biosolids) at municipal wastewater treatment plants. When biosolids are applied to soils, they could release CIP to surface runoff, which could adversely affect growth of aquatic organisms that inhabit receiving water bodies. The hazard risk largely depends on the amount of antibiotic in the solid phase that can be released to solution (labile CIP), its diffusion coefficient, and sorption/desorption exchange rates in biosolids particles. In this study, these processes were evaluated in a Class A Exceptional Quality Biosolids using a diffusion gradient in thin films (DGT) sampler that continuously removed CIP from solution, which induced desorption and diffusion in biosolids. Mass accumulation of antibiotic in the sampler over time was fit by a diffusion transport and exchange model available in the software tool 2D-DIFS to derive the distribution coefficient of labile CIP (K-dl) and sorption/desorption rate constants in the biosolids. The K-dl was 13 mL g(-1), which equated to 16% of total CIP in the labile pool. Although the proportion of labile CIP was considerable, release rates to solution were constrained by slow desorption kinetics (desorption rate constant = 4 x 10(-6) s(-1)) and diffusion rate (effective diffusion coefficient = 6 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1). Studies are needed to investigate how changes in temperature, water content, pH and other physical and chemical characteristics can influence antibiotic release kinetics and availability and mobility in biosolid-amended soils.

AB The photolysis of two antibacterial compounds, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, was studied in wastewater effluent. The rate of loss of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced in wastewater effluent due to indirect photolysis reactions, specifically reactions with hydroxyl radicals and triplet excited state effluent organic matter. Photolysis in the presence of natural organic matter, however, did not lead to enhanced degradation of sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim was also found to be susceptible to indirect photolysis in wastewater effluents, with hydroxyl radical and triplet excited effluent organic matter being the responsible species. Deoxygenation of solutions led to more rapid direct photolysis of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, indicating that direct photolysis proceeds through a triplet excited state, which was verified by demonstrating that trimethoprim is a singlet oxygen sensitizer. In the wastewater effluents tested, photolysis could be apportioned into direct photolysis (48% for sulfamethoxazole, 18% for trimethoprim), reaction with hydroxyl radicals (36% and 62%, respectively) and reaction with triplet excited effluent organic matter (16% and 20%, respectively). These results indicate that allowing photolysis in wastewater stabilization ponds or wastewater treatment wetlands may lead to enhanced pharmaceutical removal prior to discharge and that effluent organic matter has different photoreactivity than natural organic matter.

After excretion, substantial amounts of unchanged pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are discharged into domestic wastewaters. The absence of data on the environmental exposure in Eastern Europe is significant, since use patterns and volumes differ from country to country. In Romania, the majority of wastewater, from highly populated cities and industrial complex zones, is still discharged into surface waters without proper treatment or after inefficient treatment. In respect to this, it is important to determine the environmental occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewaters and surface waters. The objective of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of selected PPCPs during the transport in the Somes River by mass flow analysis before and after upgrading a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Cluj-Napoca, which serves 350,000 inhabitants and is the largest plant discharging into the Somes River. The concentrations of PPCPs at Cluj-Napoca can be correlated with the high population and a high number of hospitals located in the catchment area leading to higher mass flows. The results of this study are expected to provide information, with respect to the Romanian conditions, for environmental scientists, WWTP operators, and legal authorities. The data should support the improvement of existing WWTPs and implementation of new ones where necessary and, therefore, minimize the input of contaminants into ambient waters.
   Materials and methods The PPCPs were selected on the basis of consumption at the regional scale, reported aquatic toxicity, and the suitability of the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method for the determination of the compounds at trace levels. The studied PPCPs, caffeine ( stimulant), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), pentoxifylline ( anticoagulant), cyclophosphamide ( cytostatic), ibuprofen ( analgesic), and galaxolide ( musk fragrance), were determined in samples of the Somes River. The analytes were enriched by solid-phase extraction and subsequently determined by GC/MS. Caffeine, pentoxifylline, and galaxolide were determined underivatized, whereas the acidic pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, and ibuprofen were determined after derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide.
   Results and discussion The concentrations in the Somes River varied from below 10 ng/L up to 10 mu g/L. A substantial decrease of the exposure in the Somes River could be observed due to the upgrade of the municipal WWTP in Cluj-Napoca. The loads in the river stretch between Cluj-Napoca and Dej ( Somes Mic) varied strongly: caffeine (400-2,000 g/day), carbamazepine (78-213 g/day), galaxolide (140-684 g/day), ibuprofen (84-108 g/day). After the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca, the concentrations in the Somes of caffeine, pentoxifylline, cyclophosphamide, galaxolide, and tonalide were significantly reduced (over 75%). One might be cautious comparing both studies because the relative efficiency of the WWTP's removal of PPCP was not evaluated. However, the significantly lower concentrations of most compounds after the upgrade of the WWTP Cluj-Napoca allow one to infer that the technical measures at the source substantially reduced inputs of contaminants to the receiving river. Dej loads of the poorly biodegradable substance carbamazepine increased by a factor of 2-3 as a result of wastewater discharges into the river. The disproportionate increase in caffeine loads by a factor of 4 below Cluj-Napoca indicates inputs of untreated wastewater from the Somes Mare due to the discharge of untreated wastewater derived from Bistrita, Nasaud, and Beclean ( 115,000 inhabitants).
   Conclusions The relative contribution of treated and untreated wastewater in surface water might be assessed by measuring chemical markers. Recalcitrant pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine are suitable as chemical markers for estimating the relative contribution of wastewater in surface water. The easily degradable caffeine might be a good indicator for raw sewage and hardly treated wastewaters.
   Recommendations and perspectives Municipal WWTPs have the potential of a significant contribution in reducing the load of contaminants to ambient waters. The efficiency of the wastewater treatment in Cluj-Napoca improved considerably after the upgrade of the WWTP. Therefore, it is crucial that several WWTPs must be implemented or improved in the Somes Valley Watershed in order to reduce the discharge of contaminants in the Somes River from these point sources.

AB The removal of organic matter and etodolac (an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical) from a real process wastewater by using powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption before and after Fenton oxidation has been studied. The wastewater sample is collected from the final stage of chemical synthesis of a pharmaceutical (etodolac). Fenton oxidation resulted with decrease in chemical oxygen demand (84% removal) and etodolac concentration was reduced to 0.7 mg L-1. Optimum adsorption equilibrium conditions were found as t = 16 hours, and m = 10 g L-1. The Freundlich model showed the best fit for the adsorption of both wastewater with R-2 values of 0.89 and 0.99. Lower pseudo-second-order rate constant (k(2)) (0.067 < 2.62) obtained from the adsorption of raw wastewater with higher organic matter concentration confirms the chemisorption of the adsorbates onto the PAC. Pore surface mass diffusion with R-2 value of 0.92 was found as rate-controlling step for adsorption process with Fenton pre-treated wastewater.

AB Membrane separations are finding greater use in wastewater treatment because of their efficiency. In order to prove the effectiveness of membrane filtration an applicability study is carried out. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are tested under quite different conditions to reduce the chemical oxygen demands (COD) of wastewaters to meet the Council Directive 76/464/EEC release limit. Two kinds of real wastewaters were selected for the investigation. The wastewaters represent extreme different circumstances since the difference between their COD is two orders of magnitude. All of the membranes tested can be applied either to the treatment of wastewater of high COD (pharmaceutical wastewater) or wastewater of low COD (dumpsite leachate), since the different conditions do not change the membrane characteristics. The experimental data show that none of the membranes can decrease the COD to the release limit in one step. However, if two-stage filtrations (nanofiltration followed by reverse osmosis) are accomplished for both of the wastewaters, a total COD reduction of 94% can be achieved. With the application of the two-stage filtration the COD of the wastewater of low COD can be decreased below the release limit but in case of wastewater of the high COD further treatment will be required.

AB Wastewater discharges from publicly owned treatment works are a significant source of endocrine disruptors and other contaminants to the aquatic environment in the US. Although remaining pollutants in wastewater pose environmental risks, treated wastewater is also a primary source of stream flow, which in turn is critical in maintaining many aquatic and riparian wildlife habitats. Here we calculate the dilution factor-the ratio of flow in the stream receiving discharge to the flow of wastewater discharge-for over 14,000 receiving streams in the continental US using streamflow observations and a spatially explicit watershed-scale hydraulic model. We found that wastewater discharges make up more than 50% of in-stream flow for over 900 streams. However, in 1,049 streams that experienced exceptional low-flow conditions, the dilution factors in 635 of those streams fell so low during those conditions that the safety threshold for concentrations of one endocrine disrupting compound was exceeded, and in roughly a third of those streams, the threshold was exceeded for two compounds. We suggest that streams are vulnerable to public wastewater discharge of contaminants under low-flow conditions, at a time when wastewater discharges are likely to be most important for maintaining stream flow for smaller sized river systems.

AB The present study provides a model-based characterization of the long-term transport behavior of five psychoactive compounds (meprobamate, pyrithyldione, primidone, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide) introduced into groundwater via sewage irrigation in Berlin, Germany. Compounds are still present in the groundwater despite the sewage farm closure in the year 1980. Due to the limited information on (i) compound concentrations in the source water and (ii) substance properties, a total of 180 cross-sectional model realizations for each compound were carried out, covering a large range of possible parameter combinations. Results were compared with the present-day contamination patterns in the aquifer and the most likely scenarios were identified based on a number of model performance criteria. The simulation results show that (i) compounds are highly persistent under the present field conditions, and (ii) sorption is insignificant. Thus, back-diffusion from low permeability zones appears as the main reason for the compound retardation.

AB The incidence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle impose a growing concern for the future reuse of treated water. Because of the recurrent global use of drugs such as Acetaminophen (APAP), an analgesic and antipyretic drug, they are often detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, receiving surface waters and drinking water resources. In this study, the removal of APAP has been demonstrated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with APAP as the sole carbon source. After 16 days of operation, at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 days, more than 99.9% removal was obtained when supplying a synthetic WWTP effluent with 100 mu g APAP L-1. Batch experiments indicated no sorption of APAP to the biomass, no influence of the WWTP effluent matrix, and the capability of the microbial consortium to remove APAP at environmentally relevant concentrations (8.3 mu g APAP L-1). Incubation with allylthiourea, an ammonia monooxygenase inhibitor, demonstrated that the APAP removal was mainly associated with heterotrophic bacteria and not with the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Two APAP degrading strains were isolated from the MBR biomass and identified as Delftia tsuruhatensis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During incubation of the isolates, hydroquinone - a potentially toxic transformation product - was temporarily formed but further degraded and/or metabolized. These results suggest that the specific enrichment of a microbial consortium in an MBR operated at a high sludge age might be a promising strategy for post-treatment of WWTP effluents containing pharmaceuticals.

AB The occurrence of nine different types of pharmaceuticals and caffeine were analyzed in various units of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving rivers in Beijing, China. Analyte concentrations were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatograph-tandem quadruple mass spectrometers (UPLC-MS/MS) and multiple-reaction monitoring. The studied pharmaceuticals and caffeine were found in all the WWTPs and receiving rivers. Their concentrations in the WWTP influents varied from 38 ng/L of sulpiride to 89.5 mu g/L of caffeine, and those in the effluents ranged from 27 ng/L of sulpiride to 2.7 mu g/L of erythromycin. Typically, the biological treatment appeared more effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals and caffeine than primary treatment in a WWTP. For an individual compound, the overall removal efficiency varied from one WWTP to the next. Mean values ranged from no removal of carbamazepine to 99.8% removal of caffeine. Most of the compounds in the receiving rivers were present at similar or higher concentrations compared to those in the WWTP effluents. The data set for this study does not include variations in concentrations along receiving waters because there were other point and nonpoint sources discharging to these rivers. The preliminary aquatic environmental risk assessment showed that carbamazepine, erythromycin, and trimethoprim is a potential chronic environmental risk in water bodies in Beijing, China, and is worth further investigation.

AB Industrial drying techniques are successfully used processes.  They are usually used for the production of base materials for industries such as food, chemical and pharmaceutical.  These processes can be transferred without any difficulty for the drying of sewage sludge.
   Thermal drying as a process for the purpose of water removal is an important link in waste management between sludge production and sludge disposal.
   Two systems, convection and contact drying, are here compared.
   Contact drying in the thin film evaporation process is explained.
   Explanation and proposed uses of the single-and two-stage drying systems will be discussed.
   Finally a short review of incurred expenses will be given.

DT Article

ID PRETREATMENT
AB Actual pharmaceutical wastewater was treated using a combined ultrasonic irradiation (US) and iron/coke internal electrolysis (Fe/C) technology. A significant synergetic effect was observed, showing that ultrasonic irradiation dramatically enhanced the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies by internal electrolysis. The effects of primary operating factors on COD removal were evaluated systematically. Higher ultrasonic frequency and lower pH values as well as longer reaction time were favorable to COD removal. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) of the wastewater increased from 0.21 to 0.32 after US-Fe/C treatment. An acute biotoxicity assay measuring the inhibition of bioluminescence indicated that the wastewater with overall toxicity of 4.3 mg-Zn2+center dot L-1 was reduced to 0.5 mg-Zn2+center dot L-1 after treatment. Both the raw and the treated wastewater samples were separated and identified. The types of compounds suggested that the increased biodegradability and reduced biotoxicity resulted mainly from the destruction of N,N-2 dimethyl formamide and aromatic compounds in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Removal efficiency and elimination rates of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in two subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands (SSFs) characterized by different water depths (i.e. 0.3 and 0.5 m) in a 2-year study. Dissolved and particulate phases of wastewater and gravel samples were collected and analyzed. The PPCP influent concentration ranged from 1 to 25 mu g L-1. The best removal efficiency was found in the shallower bed SSF due to its less negative redox potential. PPCPs were classified in four groups according to their removal behavior: (i) the efficiently removed (> 80%) namely caffeine, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, and carboxy-ibuprofen, (ii) the moderately removed (50-80%) namely ibuprofren, hydroxy-ibuprofen, and naproxen, (iii) the recalcitrant to the elimination namely ketoprofen and diclofenac, and, finally, (iv) compounds that were eliminated by hydrophobic interactions namely polycyclic musks (i.e. galaxolide and tonalide). These compounds were removed more than 80% from the effluent but occurred at high concentrations (up to 824 mu g kg(-1)) in the gravel bed. Accordingly, their elimination by sorption onto the organic matter retained is the predominant removal mechanism. Furthermore, the constructed wetland clogging appears to induce a negative effect in the PPCP degradation in the SSF evaluated. The PPCP elimination classified as efficiently and moderately removed through the shallow bed fitted to either zero- or a first-order areal kinetics. Finally, the apparent distribution coefficients between suspended solids (Kd'(ss)) or gravel bed (Kd'(gb)) and water were determined in the different sampling points of the wetland obtaining values comparable to the described previously for sewage sludge.

AB BACKGROUND Pharmaceutical industrial wastewater represents a challenge for biological treatment due to its complex composition. This research investigates the bioaugmentation effect of indigenous bacterial strains on the kinetics of the activated sludge process in the treatment of real high-strength pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. RESULTS Two bacterial strains were isolated from pharmaceutical effluent and identified as Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas putida. The highest removal efficiency of dissolved organic matter from pharmaceutical wastewater was 71.43% within 24 h, obtained by bioaugmented activated sludge with P. putida, at the initial concentration of activated sludge 4.39 +/- 0.37 g L-1. The biokinetic parameters of the biodegradation process were calculated using the Endo-Haldane model, where bioaugmented activated sludge showed higher affinity to pharmaceutical wastewater. CONCLUSION The biodegradation process of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater showed enhancement through bioaugmentation of activated sludge with indigenous bacterial isolates. Considering the increasingly demand for pharmaceuticals on a global scale, the bioaugmentation potential of A. hydrophila and P. putida could contribute to enhancement of biodegradation through reduction in process time and environmental impact.

AB Contamination levels of antibiotics, namely ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), oxytetracycline (OTC), and doxycycline (DOX), were quantified in wastewater, soil, plants, and underground water of surrounding areas of the pharmaceutical industry in Lahore. HPLC with a DAD detector, C-18 column, and solid-phase cartridges were used to analyze antibiotic residues. In wastewater CIP was 3.0-5.25 mg/L, LEV was 0-6.20 mg/L, OFL was 2.45-4.12 mg/L, OTC was 0-9.40 mg/L, and DOX was 1.58-6.75 mg/L. From wastewater, antibiotics accumulate in environmental segments and impact human health. From wastewater, antibiotics accumulate in soil and plants and percolate to groundwater. The contamination level was 1,000 times higher in wastewater samples than other samples, as it is the primary source of antibiotics entering the environment. After wastewater, soil was the most contaminated environmental segment and groundwater was least contaminated by these residues, but water is very important as it is source of accumulation of antibiotics for human and animal bodies as well as to plants.

AB This study evaluated the use of particles of molecularly imprinted and non-imprinted polymers (MIP and NIP) as a wastewater treatment method for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). MIP and NIP remove EDCs through adsorption and therefore do not result in the formation of partially degraded products. The results show that both MIP and NIP particles are effective for removal of EDCs, and NIP have the advantage of not being as compound-specific as the MIP and hence can remove a diverse range of compounds including 17-beta-estradiol (E2), atrazine, bisphenol A, and diethylstilbestrol. Removal of E2 from wastewater was also tested to determine the effectiveness of NIP in the presence of interfering substances and natural organic matter. Removal of E2 from wastewater samples was high and increased with increasing NIP. NIP represent an effective way of removing a wide variety of EDCs from wastewater.

AB Wastewaters are considered a remarkable source of micropollutants capable of influencing the environment both directly and indirectly. Here we tested porous ecological carbon (Biochar), an effective sorbent material for removing pharmaceuticals, drugs, and their metabolites found in wastewaters. The tested Biochar type was first characterised and used for adsorption experiments of selected micropollutants from a municipal WWTP (wastewater treatment plant) effluent sample. The sorption efficiency was studied on selected pharmaceuticals due to their common presence in aquatic ecosystems. The results show that the studied Biochar type removed the pharmaceuticals with high efficiency (above 90%), so this material can potentially be applied in wastewater treatment. We achieved greater than 99% efficiency in total RNA removal from wastewater. Wastewater might contain infectious RNA fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, Biochar can be used as a sorbent in wastewater treatment to remove antibiotic resistance genes. We have also observed a total DNA removal ability of Biochar. On the other hand, the total number and antibiotic-resistant coliform bacteria and enterococci were not changed after Biochar wastewater treatment.

AB On-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs) are an international wastewater management strategy for rural and semi-rural communities without access to centralized sewage treatment. These systems are a suspected source of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) that may be responsible for endocrine disrupting effects to resident fish species in Minnesota Lakes. This study assessed localized pore water concentrations of TOrCs in near-shore environments across five Minnesota Lakes. Sampling sites were designated as either likely (HOME) or unlikely (REF) to receive OWTS discharges based on their proximity to shoreline households. Sampling sites also served as sunfish spawning habitats concurrently studied for biological impacts to resident adult males. Two-group hypothesis tests demonstrated significantly (p = .02) higher total TOrC concentrations in HOME (Mean = 841 ng/L) versus REF (Mean = 222 ng/L) sites. HOME sites also contained a wider suite of TOrC detections relative to REF sites. The distance to the nearest household (most proximal distance; MPD) negatively correlated (r = -0.62) with total TOrC concentrations. However, 2,4-D and DEET were major contributors to these total concentrations, suggesting that anthropogenic influence from households may not be exclusively attributed to OWTS discharges. Further, TOrC presence and elevated nitrogen concentrations in REF site pore water suggest additional, non-household TOrC discharges to these lakes. Significantly higher blood concentrations of vitellogenin (p = .03) and 11-ketotestosterone (p = .01) were observed in adultmale sunfish captured from HOME versus REF sites. Comparisons between chemical and biological data indicate enhanced bioactive effects of co-contaminants. The findings from this study demonstrate multiple diffuse transport pathways contribute to the presence of biologically active TOrC mixtures in Minnesota Lakes, and mitigation efforts should consider minimizing residential inputs of chemicals associated with both outdoor and OWTS activity.

AB The growing awareness of the relevance of organic microcontaminants on the environment has led to a growing number of studies on attenuation of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rivers. However, the effects of the sampling strategies (frequency and duration of composite samples) on the attenuation estimates are largely unknown. Our goal was to assess how frequency and duration of composite samples influence uncertainty of the attenuation estimates in WWTPs and rivers. Furthermore, we also assessed how compound consumption rate and degradability influence uncertainty. The assessment was conducted through simulating the integrated wastewater system of Puigcerda (NE Iberian Peninsula) using a sewer pattern generator and a coupled model of WWTP and river. Results showed that the sampling strategy is especially critical at the influent of WWTP, particularly when the number of toilet flushes containing the compound of interest is small (<= 100 toilet flushes with compound day(-1)), and less critical at the effluent of the WWTP and in the river due to the mixing effects of the WWTP. For example, at the WWTP, when evaluating a compound that is present in 50 pulses d(-1) using a sampling frequency of 15-min to collect a 24-h composite sample, the attenuation uncertainty can range from 94% (0% degradability) to 9% (90% degradability). The estimation of attenuation in rivers is less critical than in WWTPs, as the attenuation uncertainty was lower than 10% for all evaluated scenarios. Interestingly, the errors in the estimates of attenuation are usually lower than those of loads for most sampling strategies and compound characteristics (e.g. consumption and degradability), although the opposite occurs for compounds with low consumption and inappropriate sampling strategies at the WWTP. Hence, when designing a sampling campaign, one should consider the influence of compounds' consumption and degradability as well as the desired level of accuracy in attenuation estimations.

AB This study aims at evaluating occurrence and treatment efficiency of five estrogenic hormones and ten beta blockers in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The use of consistent sampling procedures, analytical techniques and data processing enabled to achieve an accurate comparison of the performances of the different treatment processes. First, the occurrence of molecules was evaluated in fourteen rural and urban WWTP located in France. Free and total estrogens were analyzed showing that more than 84% of estrogens in the dissolved phase of influent samples are in the free form. In effluent samples, comparable mean values but higher variation are underlined (RSD from 13 to 54% depending on the estrogen, compared to 11-21% for influents). Most of the target molecules are quantified in 30 influent and 31 effluent samples. Similar occurrence frequencies are obtained for influents from rural (6 WWTP) and urban areas (8 WWTP), except for betaxolol which is only quantified in urban wastewaters. Removal efficiencies of 8 biological treatments were studied: suspended growth biomass (activated sludge) and attached growth systems (biofilter, rotating biological contactor, reed-bed filter, trickling filter). Biological treatments are efficient to remove estrogens from the dissolved phase, with removal rate around 90%. For beta blockers, acebutolol and nadolol are efficiently removed (mean removal rate of 80%), whereas sotalol and propranolol are hardly impacted by biological treatments (removal rate below 20%). Finally, 9 tertiary treatment processes were evaluated. Ozonation, reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration prove a high removal efficiency for beta blockers (above 80%). On the contrary, high speed chemical settler, sand filtration, silex filtration, microfiltration and UV present generally removal rates below 30% for all beta blockers. The polishing pond studied presents variable removal performances depending on the molecules (up to 75% for propranolol). The role of the hydraulic retention time on the removal efficiencies is confirmed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new photoelectrochemical (PEC) system by means of adding sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) was developed to treat sewage. The PEC system simultaneously promoted pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) degradation, H-2 evolution and E. roll disinfection using an optimized, visible-light driven BiVO4 photoanode. The PEC reactions were first carried out in 1.5 mM Na2SO3 electrolyte. 92.3% of 2 ppm benzophenone-3 (BZP) was degraded, and 115.36 kimol of H-2 was produced in 90 mM at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was a significant improvement over cases where the electrolyte was either Na2SO4 or NaCl. The sulfite ions were first activated by holes and then converted into sulfate radicals, which played a dominant role in the degradation of BZP. As the holes were caught by the sulfite, charge separation was also enhanced, increasing H-2 evolution. The PEC reactions were also used to treat real sewage, in which case an 82% improvement in the rate constant of BZP degradation, 60% increase of H-2 evolution, and 0.78 log enhancement of E. roll disinfection were achieved by adding 1.5 mM Na2SO3. The system was also feasible to degrade various PPCPs, and showed excellent reusability and stability, proving its great potential in sewage treatment.

AB Concern over steroid estrogens has increased rapidly in recent years due to their adverse health effects. Effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is the main pollutant source for environmental water. To understand the pollutant level and fate of steroid estrogens in WWTPs, the occurrence of estrone (E1), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17-beta-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was investigated in the Gaobeidian WWTP in Beijing, China. Water samples from influent as well as effluent from second sedimentation tanks and advanced treatment processes were taken monthly during 2006 to 2007. In influent, steroid estrogen concentrations varied from 11.6 to 1.1 x 10(2) ng/l, 3.7 to 1.4 x 10(2) ng/l, no detection (nd) to 7.6x10(2) ng/l and nd to 3.3 x 10(2) ng/l for E1, E2, E3, and EE2, respectively. Compared with documented values, the higher steroid estrogen concentrations in the WWTP influent may be due to higher population density, higher birthrate, less dilution, and different sampling time. Results revealed that a municipal WWTP with an activated sludge system incorporating anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic processes could eliminate natural and synthetic estrogens effectively. The mean elimination efficiencies were 83.2%, 96.4%, 98.8%, and 93.0% for E1, E2, E3, and EE2, respectively. The major removal mechanism for natural estrogens and synthetic estrogen EE2 were biodegradation and sorption on the basis of mass balance in water, suspension particles, and sludge. In the WWTP effluent, however, the highest concentrations of E1, E2, E3, and EE2 attained were 74.2, 3.9, 5.1, and 4.6 ng/l, respectively. This is concerning as residual steroid estrogens in WWTP effluent could lead to pollution of the receiving water. Advanced flocculation treatment was applied in the WWTP and transformed the residual estrogen conjugates to free species, which were reduced further by filtration with removal shifting from 32% to 57% for natural estrogen, although no EE2 was removed.

AB The pharmaceutical industry is a highly water-dependent economic sector and requires different degrees of water purity. The study presents an overview of the current water quality requirements, as well as limitations and safety considerations for water re-use in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Several principles for implementing circular economy elements into pharmaceutical wastewater treatment procedures are described: the use of recovered solvents as an easily degradable carbon source for the denitrification process, the use of phosphorus-containing wastewater as a nutrient source for activated sludge microorganisms, the use of inorganic acids and bases for pH control in wastewater treatment processes, and the use of Al3+ containing wastewater as a coagulant. The case study indicates that specific wastewater streams can be reused as secondary materials if the chemical composition of wastewater from pharmaceutical batch processing is well constrained and separate collection is ensured.

AB The presence of 28 antibiotics in three hospital effluents, five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), six rivers and a drinking water storage catchment were investigated within watersheds of South-East Queensland, Australia. All antibiotics were detected at least once, with the exception of the polypeptide bacitracin which was not detected at all. Antibiotics were found in hospital effluent ranging from 0.01-14.5 mu g L-1, dominated by the beta-lactam, quinolone and sulphonamide groups. Antibiotics were found in WWTP influent up to 64 mu g L-1, dominated by the beta-lactam, quinolone and sulphonamide groups. Investigated WWTPs were highly effective in removing antibiotics from the water phase, with an average removal rate of greater than 80% for all targeted antibiotics. However, antibiotics were still detected in WWTP effluents in the low ng L-1 range up to a maximum of 3.4 mu g L-1, with the macrolide, quinolone and sulphonamide antibiotics most prevalent. Similarly, antibiotics were detected quite frequently in the low ng L-1 range, up to 2 mu g L-1 in the surface waters of six investigated rivers including freshwater, estuarine and marine samples. The total investigated antibiotic concentration (TIAC) within the Nerang River was significantly lower (p<0.05) than all other rivers sampled. The absence of WWTP discharge to this river is a likely explanation for the significantly lower TIAC and suggests that WWTP discharges are a dominant source of antibiotics to investigated surface waters. A significant difference (p<0.001) was identified between TIACs at surface water sites with WWTP discharge compared to sites with no WWTP discharge, providing further evidence that WWTPs are an important source of antibiotics to streams. Despite the presence of antibiotics in surface waters used for drinking water extraction, no targeted antibiotics were detected in any drinking water samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Photochemical systems are an alternative to reduce the biological and chemical contaminants persistent in hospital wastewater treatment. Although the photochemical systems are currently used in wastewater treatments, the efficiency of these systems still needs to be studied. In this work, a broadband method to evaluate the efficiency of photochemical systems: UV/H2O2, UV/O-3, and UV/H2O2/O-3, for hospital wastewater treatments is presented. The method is based on the analysis of the broadband changes in the UV-Vis absorption spectra with the real-time radiation exposure. The results presented indicate that the UV/H2O2/O-3 system has a higher percentage of decontaminated water and decontamination speed than the UV/H2O2 and UV/O-3 systems. In this regard, the proposed method provides a good alternative to evaluate the efficiency of photochemical systems used in hospital wastewater treatments.

AB Anaerobic biodegradability of wastewater discharged from a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical company was evaluated using two up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors with or without activated carbon addition to the seeding sludge. The wastewater had an anaerobic biodegradability of 86.1% and biogas yield of 52.9%. The addition of activated carbon improved the quality of the granular sludge, resulting in a strong anti-strike performance and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of around 75% at the organic loading rate of 7 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1). MiSeq PE300 analysis showed both reactors were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Microbial diversity was reduced in the pharmaceutical wastewater compared to the seeding sludge. The abundance of dominant Levilinea, Desulfovibrio, and Methanosaeta, which are the functional microorganism in treating this chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, significantly increased with the addition of activated carbon.

AB Seasonal and diurnal fluctuations in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) concentrations in residential sewage water were ascertained in an area with no businesses industry (e.g., plants or offices) upstream. PPCPs with high detection rates included ibuprofen, acetaminophen and indomethacin (antipyretic analgesics), atenolol and disopyramide (antiarrhythmics), clarithromycin (antibiotic), levofloxacin (synthetic antimicrobial agent) and triclosan (disinfectant). In summer, the concentration of triclosan was the highest, while in winter, the concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were higher than the others. Moreover, three types of diurnal fluctuations were observed: no marked diurnal changes (triclosan), high daytime concentrations (disopyramide) and high nighttime concentrations (acetaminophen).

DE pharmaceutical wastewater; internal micro-electrolysis; coagulation;

AB Treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by the combined process of internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation, biological treatment and activated carbon adsorption was studied. Internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation served as the pretreatment for the wastewater before biological treatment to reduce the contaminants' toxicity to microbes and improve the biodegradability of wastewater to guarantee the smooth operation of the biological process. Biological treatment was the main body of the whole process which took an unparalleled role in removing COD (chemical oxygen demand). Activated carbon adsorption was adopted as the post-treatment process to further remove the remaining non-biodegradable particles. Results showed that the removal rates of COD and S2- (sulphide ion) by pretreatment were 66.9% and 98.9%, respectively, and the biodegradability, as measured by the ratio of biodegradable COD to initial COD, of the wastewater was greatly improved from 0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.02. The overall removal rate of COD in the wastewater achieved by this combined treatment process was up to 96%, and the effluent COD met the Chinese tertiary discharge standard (GB 8978-1996).

AB Sewage sludge application to soil is of great interest, due to required organic matter and the wide spectra of nutrients it provides. However, the presence of unpredictable content of emerging contaminants may turn this valuable raw material into a hazardous substance. In this study, three selected sewage sludges derived micro pollutants from different origins; that is, one each under persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were considered. The effect of each micropollutant on the feeding activity of free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was analysed. The analysis was performed in model soil solution using a larval feeding inhibition assay. The results showed no significant effects from selected POP-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl either and pharmaceutical-chlortetracycline on the feeding activity of tested nematodes. On the contrary, feeding activity was inhibited by PPCP-galaxolide (HHCB) with an effective concentration of 12.2 +/- 2.2 mg.l-1. The calculated risk quotient for galaxolide (RQ = 0.14) demonstrated a medium ecological risk to the nematodes. Based on our findings, concentrations of micropollutants in sewage sludge treated soil pose negligible risk to feeding activity of soil nematode. However, the potential impact of musk compounds on free-living soil biota requires detailed evaluation in further research.

AB Th anti-seizure medication carbamazepine is often found in treated sewage effluent and environmental samples. Carbamazepine has been shown to be very persistent in sewage treatment, as well as ground water. Due to environmental persistence, irrigation with sewage effluent could result in carbamazepine contamination of surface and ground water. To determine the potential for leaching of carbamazepine, a series of adsorption and desorption batch equilibrium experiments were conducted on irrigated soils. It was found that carbamazepine adsorption to biosolid-amended (T) soils had a K-D of 19.8 vs. 12.6 for unamended soil. Based on adsorption, carbamazepine leaching potential would be categorized as low. During desorption significant hysteresis was observed and K-D increased for both soils. Desorption isotherms also indicate a potential for irreversibly bound carbamazepine in the T soil. Results indicate that initial removal of carbamazepine via adsorption from irrigation water is significant and that desorption characteristics would further limit the mobility of carbamazepine through the soil profile indicating that carbamazepine found in sewage effluent used for irrigation has a low leaching potential.

AB This paper investigates the performance of AD in the presence of high-risk pharmaceuticals found in sewage sludge and its removal capacity. The digestion process of synthetic sewage sludge was observed in two 7L glass reactors (D1 and D2) at 38 degrees C (OLR 1.3 gVS L-1 d(-1) and HRT 43 d). Environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals (clarithromycin, clotrimazole, erythromycin, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, sertraline, simvastatin and tamoxifen) were added in D2 at predicted environmental (sludge) conditions.
   The results demonstrated that long-term presence of pharmaceuticals can affect AD and induce instability resulting in an accumulation of VFAs. This study showed a concurrent effect on AD microbial composition, increasing the percentage of Firmicutes (> 70%) and decreasing the percentages of Bacteroidetes and Euryarchaeota (< 5%), which seems to be the cause of VFA accumulation and resultant the decrease in the biogas production.
   However, it seems that anaerobic microorganisms offer enhanced removal of the antibiotics clarithromycin and erythromycin over aerobic techniques.

AB Tertiary treatment methods, like ozonation, are currently under discussion to improve removal efficiencies of micropollutants by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In order to assess the effects of a full-scale wastewater ozonation at WWTP Wueri, Switzerland, on the receiving stream, a total of seven in situ bioassays with Gammarus fossarum that lasted 7-days were conducted during an overall period of 33 months. Caged gammarids were exposed between 150 m up- and 400 m downstream of a WWTP effluent before, during and following the operation of the full-scale wastewater ozonation. During the release of nonozone treated wastewater, gammarid feeding was significantly reduced by up to 90 parts per thousand 50 and 150 m downstream of the WWTP effluent. In contrast, during the operation period of the ozonation, no significant alterations in feeding were observed downstream. The results of these bioassays were incorporated into a mathematical simulation of the release of nonozone treated wastewater in a Central European region, suggesting a 40 parts per thousand reduction in leaf litter breakdown and hence in energy provision for the remaining aquatic food web downstream of WWTP effluents, while the release of ozone treated wastewater did not affect this important ecosystem function.

AB The present work provides a multi-residue analytical method for determining a selection of 20 pharmaceuticals from diverse therapeutical classes in hospital effluent wastewater. The method is based on the simultaneous extraction of the target compounds by solid phase extraction (SPE), followed by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) analysis. Using TOF-MS, accurate mass measurements within 2 ppm error were obtained for most of the pharmaceuticals studied. Empirical formula information can be obtained by this method, allowing the unequivocal identification of the target compounds in the samples. Validation studies showed that LC-TOF-MS analysis is a valuable new tool for identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Recoveries, using Oasis HLB cartridges at pH 7, were higher than 75% for all pharmaceuticals, except for ranitidine, 4-methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAA), cefotaxime and omeprazole, which needed specific pH conditions for their extraction. Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression of the response were observed. For most of the compounds ion suppression was less than 39 %, except for metronidazole, carbarnazepine 10, 11-epoxide, naproxen and erythromycin, where the signal suppression was 42%, 59%, 46% and 95%, respectively. A simple and effective approach to minimize or avoid matrix interferences was the I : 4 dilution of the SPE extracts. Method detection limits (MDLs) and quantification limits (MQLs) ranged between 4-115 ng l(-1) and 14-384 ng l(-1); respectively. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), ranged from 1.1-19.8% and 1.7-21.7% for intra- and inter-day, respectively. The developed analytical method was applied to the analysis of hospital effluent wastewater during a survey study. 18 of the 20 pharmaceuticals studied were detected at concentration levels of mu g l(-1), reaching in some cases concentrations over 100 mu g l(-1), and in the case of the analgesic and antipyretic dipyrone metabolite, higher than 1000 mu g l(-1).

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants (PCs) have been recognized as emerging contaminants causing unexpected consequences to environment and humans. There is an urgent need for development of efficient technologies to treat these PCs from water. The current study has investigated the removal capacity of a green microalgal species, Scenedesmus obliquus, for doxylamine, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and nutrients from real wastewater. Results have indicated that S. obliquus can grow well in the doxylamine-polluted wastewater with the achievement of 56, 78.5, 100, and 89% removal of doxylamine, COD, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Addition of 2 g L-1 bicarbonate enhanced the removal of doxylamine up to 63% and slightly inhibited the removal of COD. Decreased carbohydrate (28-26%) and increased protein content (30-33%) of the harvested biomass have been observed after cultivation in the wastewater. The current study has shown the feasibility of using microalgae-based biotechnologies for PC-contaminated wastewater.

AB Additional treatment of wastewater, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), is a possible solution to reduce the discharge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from households and industry to the environment. This study aims to investigate the occurrence and removal of antibiotics and ARGs by two full scale CWs operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRT), namely 1 day and 3 days. Both CWs were receiving the same waste-water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Temporally and spatially distributed sampling of water and sediment was conducted for one year and samples were analyzed for antibiotics and ARGs by using LC-MS/MS and qPCR. Results showed that both CWs removed antibiotics significantly with a comparable overall removal of 28%-100%, depending on the type of antibiotics. However, some of the antibiotics showed higher concentration after the CW treatment. Five antibiotics (tiamulin, tylosin, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were the most abundant (>1500 ng/l on average) in winter. Meanwhile, ermB was the most abundant (average of 5.0 log) in winter compared to summer (average of 3.5 log). Other ARGs did not show a significant increase or decrease between winter and summer. ARGs were removed from the wastewater by 0.8 to 1.5 log. The HRT did not influence the removal of either the antibiotics or the ARGs. A strong correlation was found between sul genes and Mill. The results also revealed a positive and a negative relationship from sampling point 1 to sampling point 5: a positive relation between abundance of antibiotics, ARGs, and of NO3-N, NH4-N, TP, COD and a negative relation between antibiotics, ARGs and temperature. This relationship showed the effect between antibiotics and ARGs concentrations with physicochemical parameters and nutrients. The ability of CWs to reduce the input of micropollutants into the environment makes CWs a potential post treatment to WWTP. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Incomplete removal during wastewater treatment leads to frequent detection of compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in municipal effluents. A fixed standard dilution factor of 10 for effluents entering receiving water bodies is used during the exposure assessment of several chemical risk assessments. However, the dilution potential of German receiving waters under low flow conditions is largely unknown and information is sparse for other European countries. We calculated dilution factors for two datasets differing in spatial extent and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) size: a national dataset comprising 1225 large WWTPs in Central and Northern Germany and a federal dataset for 678 WWTPs of a single state in Southwest Germany. We found that the fixed factor approach overestimates the dilution potential of 60% and 40% of receiving waters in the national and the federal dataset, with median dilution factors of 5 and 14.5, respectively. Under mean flow conditions, 8% of calculated dilution factors were below 10, with a median dilution factor of 106. We also calculated regional dilution factors that accounted for effluent inputs from upstream WVVTPs. For the national and the federal dataset, 70% and 60% of calculated regional dilution factors fell below 10 under mean low flow conditions, respectively. Decrease of regional dilution potential in small receiving streams was mainly driven by the next VVVVTP upstream with a 25 fold drop of median regional dilution factors. Our results show that using the standard dilution factor of 10 would result in the underestimation of environmental concentrations for authorised chemicals by a factor of 3-5 for about 10% of WWTPs, especially during low flow conditions. Consequently, measured environmental concentrations might exceed predicted environmental concentrations and ecological risks posed by effluents could be much higher, suggesting that a revision of current risk assessment practices may be required.

AB Due to the very limited number of studies dealing with the chemical composition of industrial wastewaters, many industrial organic contaminants still escape our view and consequently also our control. We present here the chemical characterization of wastewaters from different units of a chemical complex, thereby contributing to the characterization of industrial pollution sources. The chemicals produced in the investigated complex are widely and intensively used and the synthesis processes are common and applied worldwide. The chemical composition of untreated and treated wastewaters from the chemical complex was investigated by applying a non- target screening which allowed for the identification of 39 organic contaminants. According to their application most of them belonged to four groups: ( i) unspecific educts or intermediates of industrial syntheses, ( ii) chemicals for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, ( iii) educts for the synthesis of polymers and resins, and ( iv) compounds known as typical constituents of municipal sewage. A number of halogenated compounds with unknown toxicity and with very high molecular diversity belonged to the second group. Although these compounds were completely removed or degraded during wastewater treatment, they could be useful as " alarm indicators" for industrial accidents in pharmaceutical manufacturing units or for malfunctions of wastewater treatment plants. Three potential branch- specific indicators for polymer manufacturing were found in the outflow of the complex. Among all compounds, bisphenol A, which was present in the leachate water of the on- site waste deposit, occurred in the highest concentrations of up to 20 000 mg L-1. The comparison of contaminant loads in the inflow and outflow of the on- site wastewater treatment facility showed that most contaminants were completely or at least significantly removed or degraded during the treatment, except two alkylthiols, which were enriched during the treatment process. The chemical composition of the inflow samples showed a very heterogenic composition and strongly varied, reflecting that large scale industrial synthesis is carried out in batches. The outflow contained mainly unspecific chlorinated educts or intermediates of industrial syntheses as well as compounds which are known as typical constituents of municipal wastewaters.

AB The Biological Nitrogen Removal (BNR) process of some pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants has important operational problems. This study shows that, in order to solve these problems, the design of industrial BNR processes start by analysing three key parameters: the characteristics of the wastewater load, the determination of the maximum TXN removal rate and the detection of toxic or inhibitory compounds in the wastewater. A case study of this analysis in pharmaceutical wastewater is presented here. In this case, the conventional TKN analytical method does not make an accurate characterisation of the wastewater load because it measures a concentration of 100 mg TKN l(-1) whereas the real concentration, determined with a modified TKN analytical method, is 150-500 mg TKN l(-1). Also, the TXN removal of the treatment system is insufficient in some periods because it falls below legal requirements. This problem might be a consequence of the wrong characterisation of wastewater during the design process. The maximum TKN removal at 27 degreesC (24 mg N g VSS-1 l(-1) or 197 mg N l(-1) d(-1)) was evaluated in a pilot-scale plant. This value is six times greater than the Ave. NLR applied in the full-scale plant. Finally, some of the components of the wastewater, such as p-phenylenediamine X have inhibitory or toxic effects on the biological process. P-phenylenediamine causes a large decrease in the nitrification rate. This effect was determined by respirometry. This methodology shows that the effect is mainly inhibitory with a contact time of 30 min and if the contact time is longer, 14 hours, a toxic effect is observed.

AB The effect of mixing regimes and residence time distribution (RTD) on solute transport in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is well understood in environmental engineering. Nevertheless, it is frequently neglected in sampling design and data analysis for the investigation of polar xenobiotic removal efficiencies in WWTPs. Most studies on the latter use 24-h composite samples in influent and effluent. The effluent sampling period is often shifted by the mean hydraulic retention time assuming that this allows a total coverage of the influent load. However, this assumption disregards mixing regime characteristics as well as flow and concentration variability in evaluating xenobiotic removal performances and may consequently lead to biased estimates or even negative elimination efficiencies.
   The present study aims at developing a modeling approach to estimate xenobiotic removal efficiencies from monitoring data taking the hydraulic RTD in WWTPs into consideration. For this purpose, completely mixed tanks-in-series were applied to address hydraulic mixing regimes in a Luxembourg WWTP. Hydraulic calibration for this WWTP was performed using wastewater conductivity as a tracer. The RTD mixing approach was coupled with first-order biodegradation kinetics for xenobiotics covering three classes of biodegradability during aerobic treatment.
   Model simulations showed that a daily influent load is distributed over more than one day in the effluent. A 24-h sampling period with an optimal time offset between influent and effluent covers less than the half of the influent load in a dry weather scenario. According to RTD calculations, an optimized sampling strategy covering four consecutive measuring days in the influent would be necessary to estimate the full-scale elimination efficiencies with sufficient accuracy. Daily variations of influent flow and concentrations can substantially affect the reliability of these sampling results. Commonly reported negative removal efficiencies for xenobiotics might therefore be a consequence of biased sampling schemes. In this regard, the present study aims at contributing to bridge the gap between environmental chemistry and engineering practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of loading frequency (1 pulse per day and 4 pulses per day) and vegetation (monoculture of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta') on the removal and transformation of a mixture of pharmaceuticals diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in lab-scale unsaturated vertical-flow constructed wetlands. Additionally, the system performance, the ecotoxicity of the wastewater (Microtox bioassay), and the microbial community structure and diversity in the top layer of the system were assessed. In the experiment, elevated concentrations of the pharmaceuticals (0.5 mg/L) were used to reflect the quality of wastewater from single houses or small settlements. The removal of DCF and SMX was deteriorated by the presence of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta'. The lower loading frequency enhanced the removal of DCF and SMX only in the planted columns, suggesting combined effect of the two factors. For the unplanted systems no significant effect of the loading frequency was observed. The observed removal efficiency of SMX and DCF in the experiment was in the range 52.8-91.2% and 47.3-74.2%, respectively. The pharmaceuticals did not affect markedly the removal of DOC, TKN and N-NH4, but they reduced the bacterial diversity within the rhizosphere and in the adjacent substrate of the systems. The main transformations of SMX were (mono-, di-, tri-)hydroxylation, demethylation, deamination and formation of glutathione conjugates, whereas for DCF only trihydroxylation was observed. The toxicity of the raw and treated wastewater containing the pharmaceuticals was at a level comparable with the control samples. This study showed that vertical-flow constructed wetlands can be efficient in the removal of DCF and SMX. Given that the constructed wetlands are inherently planted systems, it is suggested that the loading frequency is the operational variable that could be adjusted to enhance the removal of these pharmaceuticals.

AB Five estrogenic hormones (unconjugated + conjugated fractions) and 10 beta blockers were analyzed in three wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and receiving river waters in the area of Lyon, France. In the different samples, only two estrogens were quantified: estrone and estriol. Some beta blockers, such as atenolol, acebutolol, and sotalol, were almost always quantified, but others, e.g., betaxolol, nadolol, and oxprenolol were rarely quantified. Concentrations measured in river waters were in the nanogram per liter range for estrogens and between 0.3 and 210 ng/L for beta blockers depending on the substance and the distance from the WWTP outfall. The impact of the WWTP on the receiving rivers was studied and showed a clear increase in concentrations near the WWTP outfall. For estrogens, the persistence in surface waters was not evaluated given the low concentrations levels (around 1 ng/L). For beta blockers, concentrations measured downstream of the WWTP outfall were up to 16 times higher than those measured upstream. Also, the persistence of metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol was noted even 2 km downstream of the WWTP outfall. The comparison of beta blocker fingerprints in the samples collected in effluent and in the river also showed the impact of WWTP outfall on surface waters. Finally, a tentative environmental risk evaluation was performed on 15 sites by calculating the ratio of receiving water concentrations to predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). For estrogens, a total PNEC of 5 ng/L was considered and these substances were not linked to any potential environmental risk (only one site showed an environmental risk ratio above 1). Unfortunately, few PNECs are available and risk evaluation was only possible for 4 of the 10 beta blockers studied: acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol. Only propranolol presented a ratio near or above 1, showing a possible environmental risk for 4 receiving waters out of 15.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the co-occurrence of caffeine and the extent of its influence front to other traditional water quality parameters ( microbiological indicator data) in way to characterize it as an efficient pollution indicator of anthropogenic origin in urban aquatic environments. Caffeine is a constituent of a variety of beverages ( coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks) and of numerous food products ( chocolate, pastries and dairy desserts). Although the human body is efficient at metabolising this stimulant, between 0.5 - 10% is excreted, mostly in urine. In addition, caffeine from domestic use may find its way directly into the sewer system due to the disposal of unconsumed drinks. The analysis of samples from Leopoldina Hydrographic Basin and Guanabara Bay revealed a significant difference areas not commonly affected by nutrient enrichment or sewage inputs versus areas chronically influenced by sewage discharges. Monitoring caffeine will be fundamental in urban-stressed aquatic environments where frequent accidental ruptures of sewage lines, pump station overflows or elevated numbers of inefficient septic tank systems are common.

AB The current literature about pharmaceutical and personal care compounds (PPCPs) focuses on identifying their concentration and toxicological risk both in surface water and in wastewater. However, the influence of urban areas (population ageing, income level, hospitals and others) has not yet been analysed. Knowing how a population (and its facilities) affects PPCPs' presence in wastewater is important to identify the conditions that are responsible for their presence. In this work, the influence of water consumption, population ageing, income level, hospitals and nursing homes on the anti-inflammatory concentration have been analysed. To fill the gap between the quantitative data on PPCPs' concentration and the qualitative reasoning of the influence of urban areas on the anti-inflammatory concentration, the use of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is proposed. The fsQCA results are presented as recipes that show the different causal combinations of conditions that explain the presence of anti-inflammatories in wastewater. Using fsQCA for urban wastewater management with the aim of explaining the presence of anti-inflammatories in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a novelty in the literature. The results obtained here show the influence of water consumption (WATCON), hospitals (HOSP) and population ageing (POPAG) as the main conditions for the anti-inflammatory concentration in Valencian wastewater. Specifically, these conditions are present in all the recipes obtained with consistency of 99%. Through the results obtained, it would be possible to identify that HOSP are the main facilities that discharge anti-inflammatories into urban wastewater. Hence, the necessity of preventive measures to avoid the anti-inflammatory discharge into water bodies has been showed. Furthermore, under a methodological point of view, this work highlights the eligibility of fsQCA as a wastewater cycle management tool. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous studies have shown that a variety of manufactured and natural organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals, steroids, surfactants, flame retardants, fragrances, plasticizers and other chemicals often associated with wastewaters have been detected in the vicinity of municipal wastewater discharges and livestock agricultural facilities. To provide new data and insights about the environmental presence of some of these chemicals in untreated sources of drinking water in the United States targeted sites were sampled and analyzed for 100 analytes with sub-parts per billion detection capabilities. The sites included 25 ground- and 49 surface-water sources of drinking water serving populations ranging from one family to over 8 million people. Sixty-three of the 100 targeted chemicals were detected in at least one water sample. Interestingly, in spite of the low detection levels 60% of the 36 pharmaceuticals (including prescription drugs and antibiotics) analyzed were not detected in any water sample. The five most frequently detected chemicals targeted in surface water were: cholesterol (59%, natural sterol), metolachlor (53%, herbicide), cotinine (51%, nicotine metabolite), beta-sitosterol (37%, natural plant sterol), and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (27%, caffeine metabolite); and in groundwater: tetrachloroethylene (24%, solvent), carbamazepine (20%, pharmaceutical), bisphenol-A (20%, plasticizer), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (16%, caffeine metabolite), and tri (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (12%, fire retardant). A median of 4 compounds were detected per site indicating that the targeted chemicals generally occur in mixtures (commonly near detection levels) in the environment and likely originate from a variety of animal and human uses and waste Sources. These data will help prioritize and determine the need, if any, for future occurrence, fate and transport, and health-effects research for subsets of these chemicals and their degradates most likely to be found in water resources used for drinking water in the United States.

AB We investigated the occurrence, removal and mass balance of 8 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethinylestradiol (EE2), triclosan (TCS), triclocarbon (TCC), 4-n-nonyl phenol (NP) and 4 n octyl phenol (OP), along with 5 of their transformation products (TPs), including 4-hydroxy estrone (4-OH El), 4-hydroxy estradiol (4-OH E2), methyl triclosan (MeTCS), carbanilide (NCC), dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) in a wastewater treatment plant. Generally, E3 showed the highest concentrations in wastewater with median value of 514 ng/L in influent, while TCS and TCC showed highest level in sludge and suspended solids (SS) with median value of 960 and 724 mu g/kg, respectively. Spatial variations were observed along each unit of the wastewater treatment processes for dissolved analytes in wastewater and adsorbed analytes in suspended solids and sludge. Special emphasis was placed to understand the mass load of EDCs and their TPs to the wastewater treatment unit and mass loss during the wastewater treatment processes. Mass loss based on both aqueous and suspended phase concentration revealed that majority of these chemicals were significantly removed during the treatment process except for TCS, TCC, and three of their TPs (MeTCS, NCC, DCC), which were released or generated during the treatment process. Mass load results showed that 42.4 g of these EDCs and their TPs entered this wastewater treatment system daily via influent, whereas 6.15 g and 7.60 g were discharged through effluent and sludge.

AB A UVC-assisted photo-Fenton process was applied to hospital wastewater that had been submitted to anaerobic treatment. Low iron (10 mu M; 0.56 mg L-1) and H2O2 (500 mu M; 17 mg L-1) concentrations were used at the natural pH of the effluent (pH approximate to 7.4). Citric acid was employed as a complexation agent, at a 1:1 ratio, in order to maintain Fe3+ soluble at this pH, avoiding extra procedures and costs associated with acidification/basification of the final effluent. The anaerobic process quantitatively reduced the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC), with low removal of antibiotics present in the wastewater. Degradation of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, sulfathiazole, and sulfamethazine was studied by spiking the anaerobic effluent at initial concentrations of 200 mu g L-1. The antibiotics were efficiently degraded (80-95%) using UVC radiation alone, although under this condition, no DOC removal was observed after 90 min. Further additions of H2O2 and iron citrate increased the degradation rate constant (k(obs)), and 8% of DOC was removed. A lower pH resulted in higher k(obs), although this was not essential for application of the photo-Fenton process. Irradiation with a germicidal lamp resulted in greater degradation of the antibiotics, compared to use of a black light lamp or sunlight, since the overall degradation was influenced by photolysis of the antibiotics, photolysis of H2O2, and the Fenton reaction. The photo-Fenton treatment could also be applied directly to the raw hospital wastewater, since no significant difference in degradation of the antibiotics was observed, compared to the anaerobic effluent. The photo-Fenton process under UVA and solar radiation reduced total coliforms and E. coli after 90 min. However, quantitative disinfection of these bacteria present in the Hospital effluent was only accomplished under UVC radiation.

AB In the present work, an extensive study on the presence of eighteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Greece has been conducted. The study covered four sampling periods over 1-year, where samples (influents; effluents) from eight WWTPs of various cities in Greece were taken. All WWTPs investigated are equipped with conventional activated sludge treatment. A common pre-concentration step based on SPE was applied, followed by LC-UV/Vis-ESI-MS. Further confirmation of positive findings was accomplished by using LC coupled to a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The results showed the occurrence of all target compounds in the wastewater samples with concentrations up to 96.65 mu g/L. Paracetamol, caffeine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and salicylic acid were the dominant compounds, while tolfenamic acid, fenofibrate and simvastatin were the less frequently detected compounds with concentrations in effluents below the LOQ. The removal efficiencies showed that many WWTPs were unable to effectively remove most of the PPCPs investigated. Finally, the study provides an assessment of the environmental risk posed by their presence in wastewaters by means of the risk quotient (RQ). RQs were more than unity for various compounds in the effluents expressing possible threat for the aquatic environment. Tridosan was found to be the most critical compound in terms of contribution and environmental risk, concluding that it should be seriously considered as a candidate for regulatory monitoring and prioritization on a European scale on the basis of realistic PNECs. The results of the extensive monitoring study contributed to a better insight on PPCPs in Greece and their presence in influent and effluent wastewaters. Furthermore, the unequivocal identification of two transformation products of trimethoprim in real wastewaters by using the advantages of the LTQ Orbitrap capabilities provides information that should be taken into consideration in future PPCP monitoring studies in wastewaters.

AB In this study, photo-Fenton oxidation was applied to degradation of sulfamonomethoxine sodium (SMMS) in aqueous solution. The operation parameters of pH, temperature, and concentrations of H2O2, Fe2+ and SMMS were investigated. The optimum conditions for the photo-Fenton process were determined as follows: [SMMS]=4.53 mg/L, pH 4.0, [H2O2]=0.49 mmol/L, [Fe2+]=19.51 mu mol/L and T=25 degrees C. Under these conditions 98.5% of the SMMS degraded. The kinetics were also studied, and degradation of SMMS by the photo-Fenton process could be described by first-order kinetics. The apparent activation energy was calculated as 23.95 kJ/mol. Mineralization of the process was investigated by measuring the chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the COD decreased by 99% after 120 min. This process could be used as a pretreatment method for wastewater containing sulfamonomethoxine sodium.

AB A valuable method for the efficient removal of sulphonamides from wastewater using protein powder extracted from the seeds of Moringa stenopetala is presented in this study. The surface morphology, crystallinity and functional groups of protein powder were characterised by SEM, XRD, FTIR and Raman spectrometry. Parameters that affect the removal of sulphonamides, such as concentration, the adsorbent dosage and pH, were optimised. The method was applied to a real wastewater sample collected from the Daspoort Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Pretoria, South Africa. The percentage removal under optimum conditions was observed to be 86.4 to 95.1% for the aqueous solution of a mixture of standards and from 83.0 to 90.5% and 75.2 to 87.7 % for the effluent and influent wastewater samples respectively. Therefore, proteins extracted from Moringa stenopetala seeds demonstrated to be effective and environmentally friendly material for possible application in water treatment in general and wastewater treatment in particular.

AB Biologically treated cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater is a complex industrial wastewater that is toxic and refractory for further biological treatment. For this purpose, a novel sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation-driven process using a nanocoated electrode has been developed to treat such wastewater. In the process, the synergy and mechanism of the sonoelectrochemistry using ultrasound enhancement of the nanocoated electrode activity to treat the wastewater was studied. The nanocoated electrode generated more radicals than the traditional coated electrode did; in the presence of ultrasonic waves, the mass-transfer effects on the nanocoated electrode surface were enhanced, resulting in rapid diffusion of the generated hydroxyl radicals into the solution, and quickly reacted with organic pollutants. Compared with the traditional coated electrode, the effect of the nanocoated electrode used on the wastewater treatment process was more enhanced by ultrasound under the same conditions. The biotoxicity of the wastewater in the sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation process was monitored and shown as having first increased and then decreased. The optimum operating conditions resulted in a 94% removal efficiency for COD and consisted of a current of density 8 mA/cm(2) and an ultrasound frequency of 45 kHz. All of the results showed that the sonoelectrochemical catalytic oxidation-driven process was found to be a very efficient method for the treatment of non-biodegradable cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The study was designed to simultaneously evaluate the influence of high doses (512-1024 & micro;g/g) the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials on the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, qualitative and quantitative changes in microbial consortia responsible for the fermentation process, the presence of methanogenic microorganisms, and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The efficiency of antibiotic degradation during anaerobic treatment was also determined. Metronidazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin exerted the greatest effect on methane fermentation by decreasing its efficiency. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, cefuroxime and sulfamethoxazole were degraded in 100%, whereas ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were least susceptible to degradation. The most extensive changes in the structure of digestate microbiota were observed in sewage sludge exposed to metronidazole, where a decrease in the percentage of bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes led to an increase in the proportions of bacteria of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The results of the analysis examining changes in the concentration of the functional methanogen gene (mcrA) did not reflect the actual efficiency of methane fermentation. In sewage sludge exposed to antimicrobials, a significant increase was noted in the concentrations of beta-lactam, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone ARGs and integrase genes, but selective pressure was not specific to the corresponding ARGs.

AB BACKGROUNDThe environmental and health effects caused by oxytetracycline (OTC) contamination of aquatic systems are a serious problem throughout the world. The OTC-contaminated wastewater cannot be treated effectively by conventional anaerobic and aerobic biological treatments. Few studies have investigated the systematic treatment of OTC-contaminated wastewater.
   RESULTSA system including micro-electrolysis (ME), an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and an anoxic/oxic activated sludge process (A/O) could treat OTC production wastewater effectively. First, a ME reactor packed with new ceramic-corrosion-cell fillers, serving as a pretreatment step, was effective in removing residual OTC and enhancing biodegradability of the wastewater. Second, EGSB and A/O reactors played the main role in removing chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and chroma (color of the wastewater). After reaching steady state, the coupled ME-EGSB-A/O system removed more than 95.0% of COD, 90.0% of NH3-N and 80.0% of color, and the final effluent met the requirements of the national discharge standard (COD 500 mg L-1, NH3-N 45 mg L-1 and chroma 70; CJ 343-2010, China).
   CONCLUSIONThe coupled ME-EGSB-A/O system could treat the OTC production wastewater effectively. These findings have significant implications for a cost-efficient system in OTC production systematic treatment. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In the current study, sequential nitrification and anoxic experiments in synthetic municipal wastewater were exposed to 0.5 to 100 mg/L of chlortetracycline for 24 h to evaluate acute impact on the nitrification, and denitrification processes of biological treatment. Both processes were significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited at >50 mg/L of chlortetracycline, and the results revealed that nitrification was adversely affected by chlortetracycline compared with the anoxic process. In nitrification, chemical oxygen removal (COD) and ammonia oxidation kinetics were 50% inhibited at 10 mg chlortetracycline/L, and nitrite oxidation kinetics at 0.5 mg chlortetracycline/L. Likewise, in the anoxic process, 14 and 10 mg/L of chlortetracycline inhibited 50% of COD removal and nitrate reduction kinetics, respectively. in nitrification and denitrification, 90% of chlortetracycline was removed by adsorbing onto sludge suspended solids. In addition, a higher chlortetracycline concentration in anoxic effluent, compared with aerobic effluents, indicated a dissimilarity in the composition of sludge solids, pH, and biomass production for both processes.

AB This study investigated chlorinated transformation products (TPs) and their parent micropollutants, aromatic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the urban water bodies of two metropolitan cities. Nine PPCPs and 16 TPs were quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determined using isotope dilution techniques and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. TPs and most PPCPs were effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatments in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Chlorinated parabens and all PPCPs (at concentrations below 1000 ng/L) were present in the waters receiving treated wastewater. By contrast, the waters receiving untreated wastewater contained higher levels of PPCPs (up to 9400 ng/L) and more species of chlorinated TPs including chlorinated parabens, triclosan, diclofenac, and bisphenol A. The very different chemical profiles between the water bodies of the two cities of similar geographical and climatic properties may be attributed to their respective uses of chemicals and policies of wastewater management. No apparent increase in the number of species or abundances of TPs was observed in either the chlorinated wastewater or the seawater rich in halogens. This is the first study to elucidate and compare the profiles of multiple TPs and their parent PPCPs in the water bodies of coastal cities from tropical islands. Our findings suggest that chlorinated derivatives of bisphenol A, diclofenac, triclosan, and parabens in the surface water originate from sources other than wastewater disinfection or marine chlorination. Although further studies are needed to identify the origins, conventional wastewater treatments may protect natural water bodies against contamination by those chlorinated substances.

AB This study identified transformation products of doxycycline that formed during chlorine disinfection and evaluated the antibacterial properties of the products. Samples were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS to identify the products. Antibacterial activity assays were used to determine the antibacterial properties of the products that formed during chlorine disinfection. Samples were run in both ultrapure water and final effluent collected from a local wastewater treatment facility. The ultrapure water experiments allowed the products to be easily detected, and the identified products were compared to those found in the wastewater matrix. Wastewater effluent was used as a realistic background matrix for a full-scale wastewater chlorination process. Products with antibiotic properties formed in ultrapure water. In the wastewater effluent, antibacterially active products did not form to a measurable extent. Five transformation products were seen in ultrapure and wastewater effluent samples. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated transformation products were observed. While the same products were found in both matrices, their relative abundance was different; the non-chlorinated product forming preferentially in the wastewater matrix and chlorinated products forming in greater abundance in the ultrapure water matrix. This can be attributed to the competition for chlorine with the wastewater background, inhibiting the formation of active products. Furthermore, bromide was added at concentrations of 0.5-5 mg L-1 to both ultrapure water and wastewater matrices to assess the antibacterial activity of brominated products. The brominated products were observed, although none of them exhibited antibacterial activity. The results suggest that not only trace antibiotics but also their products could be the source of antibiotic resistance in the environment. The fate of other common antibiotics in water chlorination should be examined.

AB In this study, environmental risks of selected pharmaceuticals were investigated to assess potential hazards. Ciprofloxacin, Clarithromycin, Cefuroxime axetil, antibiotics, Benzalkoniuman antiseptic, Paracetamol, an analgesic, and Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory, were selected due to their high rate of usage in Turkey. Ciprofloxacin was found to have the highest risk due to its high PEC/PNEC ratio (28.636). Benzalkonium, Paracetamol and Clarithromycin have a potential to cause environmental hazards. The biodegradation and biological concentration factors (BCF) of the drugs were also determined using EP.A/STWIN and EPA/BCFVVIN programs. The results illustrated that these pharmaceuticals are nonbiodegradable in wastewater treatment plants. The BCFs of Benzalkonium and Clarithromycin were found to be very high, 70.79011kg and 56.490 L/kg, respectively. It was suggested that alternative treatment methods other than biological ones should be investigated for these pharmaceuticals because of their low biodegradability. Also, unnecessary use of antibiotics is supposed to be discouraged to reduce environmental hazards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of 21 antibiotics in six different groups was investigated in coastal water of the Bohai Bay. Meantime, to illuminate the potential effects caused by the river discharge and aquaculture activities, wastewater from three breeding plants and surface water from six rivers flowing into the Bohai Bay were also analyzed for the selected antibiotics. The result revealed that measured antibiotics in the North Bobai Bay were generally higher than those in the South, highlighting the remarkable effects of high density of human activities on the exposure of antibiotics in environment. The antibiotics found in the six rivers were generally higher than those in the Bohai Bay reflecting the important antibiotics source of river discharge. This study reveals that the high consumption of some antibiotics in aquaculture activities may pose high ecological risk to the bay. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of contaminants of emerging concern from urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remains a challenge to promote safe wastewater reuse practices. Macrolides are the most abundant antibiotics detected in untreated wastewater and their concentration in WWTPs effluents is only partially reduced by conventional treatments. Among several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), photocatalysis has demonstrated the capability to effectively remove pharmaceuticals from different aqueous matrices. Recently, ZnO has emerged as an efficient, promising, and less expensive alternative to TiO2, due to its photocatalytic capability and attitude to exploit better the solar spectrum than TiO2. In this study, the behaviors of ZnO photocatalysis were evaluated using a representative macrolide antibiotic, spiramycin (SPY), in aqueous solutions and urban wastewater. After 80 min of photocatalysis, 95-99% removal of SPY was achieved at 1 g L-1 ZnO concentrations in aqueous solutions and wastewater, respectively. After treatment, the effluent toxicity, evaluated using the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri, the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, and the crustacean Daphnia magna ranged between slight acute and high acute hazard. Filterable and ultrafilterable Zn concentrations were quantified in treated effluents and shown to be high enough to contribute to the observed toxicity.

AB A test battery for identifying ecotoxicological hazards was applied to six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole), to their mixtures, and to urine spiked with pharmaceuticals to test the suitability of biotests for screening urine and wastewater and for monitoring the efficiency of wastewater treatment. The test battery comprised the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri, the yeast estrogen screen, and a photosynthesis inhibition assay in algae based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Mixture and additional experiments with a cocktail of pharmaceuticals added to urine confirmed the applicability of the test systems as an integrated measure of the overall micropollutant burden. Because the concentration of pharmaceuticals in wastewater is low and the nutrients and salts may have a negative impact on the bioassays, urine and wastewater samples were cleaned and concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The compounds of interest ranged from polar to nonpolar and from positively charged to neutral and negatively charged. Consequently, the SPE method was optimized for universality rather than for specificity. Results of preliminary experiments with raw and treated urine and wastewater indicate the suitability of the proposed test battery for screening urine and wastewater.

AB The removal efficiency of diclofenac and ketoprofen for five fungal strains was examined. The synergistic effect between selected fungal strains using synthetic wastewater media was studied using both individual and mixed strains. The mixed cultures had no additional effect in reducing diclofenac and ketoprofen. In contrary, fungi removed pharmaceutical substances faster when growing individually. The results showed that T. versicolor monoculture removed diclofenac completely (> 99.9 %) in non-sterile municipal wastewater within three hours of incubation and continued to show complete reduction within 14 days using fungal biofilm carriers. The mechanism of removal was proposed based on the laccase enzyme production and biosorption study which revealed that T. versicolor could used in both processes. Additionally, this study demonstrated that T. versicolor could be stable in the biofilm carriers, and thus able to compete with other microorganisms in wastewater to be a promising candidate to remove diclofenac from municipal wastewater during the treatment process.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important point sources for micropollutants, which are harmful to freshwater organisms. Ozonation of wastewater is a powerful option to abate micropollutants, but may result in the formation of the potentially toxic oxidation by-product bromate in bromide containing wastewaters. This study investigates options to reduce bromate formation during wastewater ozonation by (i) reducing the bromide concentration of the wastewater, (ii) lowering the ozone dose during wastewater treatment and (iii) adding hydrogen peroxide to limit the lifetime of ozone and quench the intermediates of the bromate formation pathway. Two examples demonstrate that a high share of bromide in wastewater can originate from single point sources (e.g., municipal waste incinerators or landfills). The identification of major point sources requires laborious sampling campaigns, but may facilitate the reduction of the bromide load significantly. To reduce the bromate formation by lowering the ozone dose interferes with the aim to abate micropollutants. Therefore, an additional treatment is necessary to ensure the elimination of micropollutants. Experiments at a pilot-plant illustrate that a combined treatment (ozone/powdered activated carbon) allows to eliminate micropollutants with low bromate yields. Furthermore, the addition of hydrogen peroxide was investigated at bench scale. The bromate yields could be reduced by similar to 50% and 65% for a hydrogen peroxide dose of 5 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. In conclusion, there are options to reduce the bromate formation during wastewater ozonation, however, they are not simple with sometimes limited efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB De facto wastewater reuse is the incidental presence of treated wastewater in a water supply source. In 1980 the EPA identified drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) impacted by upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges and found the top 25 most impacted DWTPs contained between 2% and 16% wastewater discharges from upstream locations (i.e., de facto reuse) under average streamflow conditions. This study is the first to provide an update to the 1980 EPA analysis. An ArcGIS model of DWTPs and WWTPs across the U.S. was created to quantify de facto reuse for the top 25 cities in the 1980 EPA study. From 1980 to 2008, de facto reuse increased for 17 of the 25 DWTPs, as municipal flows upstream of the sites increased by 68%. Under low streamflow conditions, de facto reuse in DWTP supplies ranged from 7% to 100%, illustrating the importance of wastewater in sustainable water supplies. Case studies were performed on four cities to analyze the reasons for changes in de facto reuse over time. Three of the four sites have greater than 20% treated wastewater effluent within their drinking water source for streamflow less than the 25th percentile historic flow.

AB Nursing home (NH) wastewater was pretreated in an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor (MBR) and subsequently ozonated in a pilot plant in order to evaluate the elimination of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Dosing of the pre-treated wastewater with 5 mg ozone (O-3) L-1 led to the elimination of >50% for nearly all investigated PhACs in the ozonation plant, whereas dosing 10 mg O-3 L-1 increased elimination to >80%. A total hydraulic retention time of 12.8 min proved sufficient for PhAC elimination. Specific ozone consumption and influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (8.2-9.5 mg L-1) were in similar ranges for all three performed trials. Combining the MBR with subsequent ozonation at a dosage of 5 mg O-3 L-1 achieved elimination of >90% and effluent concentrations below 250 ng L-1 for nearly all the investigated PhACs. Influent concentrations of the MBR were comparable to those found in municipal wastewater. Thus, the recommended dosage for PhAC elimination of 5 mg O-3 L-1 (i.e. a specific consumption of 0.6 g O-3 *(g DOC)(-1)) is in the same range as for municipal wastewater. However, due to a smaller plant size, the specific costs for treating NH wastewater would significantly exceed those of treating municipal wastewater.

AB For detoxification and improving the biodegradability of pharmaceutical wastewater, fenton process is an attractive method for detoxification of pharmaceutical wastewater, especially when the reaction can be conducted at neutral pH values. In this study, activated alumina supported CoMnAl composite metal oxides (CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3) were prepared and employed in Fenton-like reaction for detoxification of pharmaceutical wastewater, and the catalysts were characterized by N-2-BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results of catalyst activity experiment indicated that Co and Mn on the surface of CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3 present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of HO%, and CoMnAl-CMO-Al2O3/H2O2 Fenton-like system was very effective for pharmaceutical wastewater detoxification at a wide pH range. Typically, pharmaceutical wastewater was disposed under the coexistence of 30 g L-1 of catalyst and 9 g L-1 of H2O2 within 3 h at 25 degrees C, about 35% total organic carbon (TOC) was removed and the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (B/C) increased from 0.173 to 0.464.

AB This is the first report of the detection of two new anti-influenza drugs, peramivir (PER) and laninamivir (LAN), in Japanese sewage effluent and river waters. Over about 1 year from October 2013 to July 2014, including the influenza prevalence season in January and February 2014, we monitored for five anti-influenza drugs-oseltamivir (OS), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), zanamivir (ZAN), PER, and LAN-in river waters and in sewage effluent flowing into urban rivers of the Yodo River system in Japan. The dynamic profiles of these anti-influenza drugs were synchronized well with that of the numbers of influenza patients treated with the drugs. The highest levels in sewage effluents and river waters were, respectively, 82 and 41 ng/L (OS), 347 and 125 ng/L (OC), 110 and 35 ng/L (ZAN), 64 and 11 ng/L (PER), and 21 and 9 ng/L (LAN). However, application of ozone treatment before discharge from sewage treatment plants was effective in reducing the levels of these anti-influenza drugs in effluent. The effectiveness of the ozone treatment and the drug dependent difference in susceptibility against ozone were further evidenced by ozonation of a STP effluent in a batch reactor. These findings should help to promote further environmental risk assessment of the generation of drug-resistant influenza viruses in aquatic environments.

AB A method for the analysis of the artificial sweetener sucralose in sewage water and recipient water was developed. Extraction and clean up was performed with solid-phase extraction utilising Oasis HLB columns. Detection was made by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. However, 'pseudo MRM' was used, a technique where the two quadrupoles monitor the same m/z. The sodium adduct of sucralose was used for quantification, since lower detection limits were obtained as compared to the sucralose quasi-molecular ion in negative ion mode. The two ions with highest intensity in the chlorine isotope pattern were monitored. The reduction of matrix effects with this approach is discussed. The method limit of quantification (MLOQ) for sewage water was 0.2 mu g L-1, whereas for recipient water MLOQ was 0.02 mu g L-1. The method was used to analyse effluent samples from an experimental sewage treatment plant (STP) to assess the efficiency of tertiary treatment techniques for removal of sucralose. Filtration through activated carbon was shown to be efficient, while ozonation, advanced oxidation techniques and membrane bioreactors were less efficient. Analyses of receiving waters showed low dilution of sucralose emitted from the STPs.

AB In this work, the usefulness of Conductive Diamond Electrochemical Oxidation (CDEO) to degrade caffeine in real urban wastewater matrixes was assessed. The oxidation of actual wastewater intensified with caffeine (from 1 to 100 mg L-1) was studied, paying particular attention to the influence of the initial load of caffeine and the differences observed during the treatment of caffeine in synthetic wastewater. The results showed that CDEO is a technology that is capable of efficiently degrading this compound even at very low concentrations and that it can even be completely depleted. Profiles of the ionic species of S (SO42-), N (NH4+, NO3-) and Cl (ClO-, ClO3- and ClO4-) were monitored and explained for plausible oxidation mechanisms. It was observed that the efficiency achieved is higher in the treatment of real wastewater than in the oxidation of synthetic wastewater because of the contribution of electrogenerated oxidant species such as hypochlorite. The formation of chlorate and perchlorate during electrochemical processes was observed, and a combined strategy to prevent this important drawback was successfully tested based on the application of low current densities with the simultaneous dosing of hydrogen peroxide.

AB To preserve environmental and human health, improved treatment processes are needed to reduce nutrients, microbes, and emerging chemical contaminants from domestic wastewater prior to discharge into the environment. Electrocoagulation (EC) treatment is increasingly used to treat industrial wastewater; however, this technology has not yet been thoroughly assessed for its potential to reduce concentrations of nutrients, a variety of microbial surrogates, and personal care products found in domestic wastewater. This investigation's objective was to determine the efficiency of a benchtop EC unit with aluminum sacrificial electrodes to reduce concentrations of the aforementioned biological and chemical pollutants from raw and tertiary-treated domestic wastewater. EC treatment resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.05, alpha = 0.05) in phosphate, all microbial surrogates, and several personal care products from raw and tertiary-treated domestic wastewater. When wastewater was augmented with microbial surrogates representing bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens to measure the extent of reduction, EC treatment resulted in up to 7-log(10) reduction of microbial surrogates. Future pilot and full-scale investigations are needed to optimize EC treatment for the following: reducing nitrogen species, personal care products, and energy consumption; elucidating the mechanisms behind microbial reductions; and performing life cycle analyses to determine the appropriateness of implementation.

AB A treatability study of pharmaceutical wastewater from El-Nasr Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company, South-East of Cairo, was carried out. The company discharges both industrial (6000 m(3)/d) and municipal wastewater (128 m(3)/d) into a nearby evaporation pond without any treatment. The generated raw wastewater is characterized by high values of COD (4100-13,023), TSS (20-330 mg/L), and oil grease (17.4-600 mg/L). In addition, the presence of refractory compounds decreases BOD/COD ratio (0.25-0.30). Analysis of raw wastewater confirmed that pre-treatment is required prior to discharge into public sewers to comply with the Egyptian Environmental laws and regulations. The obtained results indicated that the refractory compounds and their by-products cannot be readily removed by biological treatment and always remain in the treated effluent or adsorbed on the sludge flocs. The application of Fenton oxidation process as a pre-treatment improved the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater and appears to be an affective solution to achieve compliance with the law legislation with respect to discharge in a determined receptor medium.

AB Classification and regression-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) as well as three-dimensional (3D) toxicophore models were developed for toxicity prediction of 104 organic chemicals causing bioluminescent repression of the bacterium genus Pseudomonas isolated from industrial wastewater. Statistically significant and interpretable in silico models were obtained using linear discriminant analysis (classification), genetic partial least-squares (regression), and 3D toxicophore models. The QSAR and toxicophore models were scrupulously validated internally as well as externally along with the randomization test to avoid the possibilities of chance correlation. Features such as octanol water partition coefficient, third-order branching, =CH2 fragment or unsaturation, and the presence of a higher number of electronegative atoms (specifically halogen atoms) and their contribution toward hydrophobicity have been identified as major responsible structural attributes for higher toxicity from the developed in silico models. The present approaches can provide rich information in the context of virtual screening of relevant chemical libraries for aquatic toxicity prediction.

AB A newly developed analytical method was used to measure concentrations of nine pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in samples from two surface water bodies, a sewage treatment plant effluent and various stages of a drinking water treatment plant in Louisiana, USA, and from one surface water body, a drinking water treatment plant and a pilot plant in Ontario, Canada. The analytical method provides for simultaneous extraction and quantification of the following broad range of PPCPs and endocrine-disrupting chemicals: naproxen; ibuprofen; estrone; 17beta-estradiol; bisphenol A; clorophene; triclosan; fluoxetine; and clofibric acid. Naproxen was detected in Louisiana sewage treatment plant effluent at 81-106 ng/l and Louisiana and Ontario surface waters at 22-107 ng/l. Triclosan was detected in Louisiana sewage treatment plant effluent at 10-21 ng/l. Of the three surface waters sampled, clofibric acid was detected in Detroit River water at 103 ng/l, but not in Mississippi River or Lake Pontchartrain waters. None of the other target analytes were detected above their method detection limits. Based on results at various stages of treatment, conventional drinking-water treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation) plus continuous addition of powdered activated carbon at a dosage of 2 mg/l did not remove naproxen from Mississippi River waters. However, chlorination, ozonation and dual media filtration processes reduced the concentration of naproxen below detection in Mississippi River and Detroit River waters and reduced clofibric acid in Detroit River waters. Results of this study demonstrate that existing water treatment technologies can effectively remove certain PPCPs. In addition, our study demonstrates the importance of obtaining data on removal mechanisms and byproducts associated with PPCPs and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals in drinking water and sewage treatment processes.

The wastewater used in this work was collected from the Bhagwanpur Sewage Treatment Plant, Varanasi, India. Results of this experiment showed that 10 mg O-3/L O-3 for 5 min exposure was found most suitable dose for highest degradation of COD, TOC, UV254, color, turbidity and total nitrogen parameters. The inactivation range of microbial biomass range was found in between 95% and 98%. Experiment revealed the fact that aldehydes and carboxylic acid formation were significantly related with the ozone dose and exposure time and ozone might enhance the treatment efficiency of secondary effluent treatment.

AB In course of past few years, pharmaceutical industries have huge contribution in the economic development of the country, but concurrently the pharmaceutical pollutants can also be responsible for severe hazards to the environment. Traditional methods of wastewater treatment cannot erase these pollutants from the water due to their hostile behavior. The advent of the pharmaceutical pollutants leads a demand for assessment and depiction of the wastewater discharged from the pharmaceutical industry as per the norms recommended by the official agency (Pollution Control Board). Vast number of treatment strategies are adapted by the pharmaceutical industries to reuse wastewater and regulate environmental pollution. In this chapter, we mainly focus on the finest membrane based methodologies to abolish the pharmaceutical compounds. At present, no individual technology has the potential to expel out the pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater. Merging of traditional methods with membrane reactors leads to the best hybrid wastewater treatment technology.

AB The degradation of sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) in the aqueous environment by the combination of UV illumination and Oxone has been studied. Experimental results indicated that the UV illumination can effectively activate Oxone to produce sulfate-free radicals (SO4 (-aEuro cent)). When 10 mmol L-1 Oxone was added, 96.78 % removal of SMM (5 mg L-1) was achieved within 90 min. Mineralization of SMM was investigated by measuring the total organic carbon, which decreased by 89.01 % after 90 min reaction. Six intermediate compounds generated during the SMM degradation were identified with the aid of liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, combined with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A general reaction pathway for the degradation of SMM was proposed, where the presence of SO4 (-aEuro cent) remained crucial during the degradation process.

AB This study evaluated three types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (methylparaben, ibuprofen and triclosan) at concentration levels of 300, 500, 1000 and 2000 mu g/L by implementing batch tests using anaerobic processes and granular biomass. The study aimed to identify the mechanisms of biodegradation and sorption in the degradation of these compounds. The inoculum was granular sludge from a laboratory-scale anaerobic reactor. The characterization results of the inoculum showed an anaerobic biomass with high activity, good sedimentation and a high percentage of organic matter. The results of the removal of the pollutants showed high degradation percentages for methylparaben (close to 99%), with negligible sorption in the sludge. The results also showed insignificant ibuprofen sorption but removal close to 0%. Triclosan showed high biomass sorption and low biodegradation. In addition, at the concentrations tested, none of the compounds had a negative or inhibitory effect on the microbial populations of the system.

AB Wastewater treatment by deactivated and activated sludge was investigated to evaluate the removal of estrogens [estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)] via adsorption and degradation. Different treatment conditions were used, including three mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (MLVSS) concentrations, three methanol concentrations (carbon source) and three types of aqueous media (water, synthetic solution, and supernatant). The E2 was degraded the fastest by the bacterial community. In all cases the removal rate increased when the initial MLVSS and methanol concentrations increased and when the macro-and micronutrients were present in the solution. In the experiments with deactivated sludge, the synthetic compound EE2 was more easily removed via sorption. The bacterial communities of the activated sludge were studied, which indicated a similarity of more than 75% between the different samples. A similarity of only 50% was found between the activated and deactivated sludges.

AB The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the environment is of increasing concern due to the endocrine disruption of aquatic organisms. Incomplete removal from wastewater (WW) is one of the main sources of EE2 in aquatic ecosystems, thus improving processes like biological WW treatment/activated sludge (AS) is becoming significantly important. There are opposing results regarding EE2 biodegradability by AS; one discrepancy is the efficacy of heterotrophic bacteria. This research demonstrated the ability of heterotrophs commonly present in AS (B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, R. equi, R. erythropolis, R. rhodochrous, R. zopfii) to remove EE2. R. rhodochrous was the most successful with no detectable EE2 after 48 h; the other bacteria achieved 21%-61% EE2 removal. No additive or synergistic effects were observed due to the combination of the bacterial cultures with maximum EE2 removals of 43% after 300 h. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mass emission rate of 12 pollutants from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) secondary effluent into a small tributary of the River Besos (northeastern Spain) was determined. The pollutants tested included pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and herbicides. Furthermore, a 1-ha surface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) was evaluated for pollution removal. Whereas the low concentration values (ngL(-1)) of PPCP discharge into the tributary was comparable to inter- and intra-campaigns, herbicides and a veterinary drug (flunixin) exhibited a high variability in concentrations (mu gL(-1)). Moreover, removal efficiencies were often higher than 90% for all compounds, with the exception of carbamazepine and clofibric acid (ca. 30-47%). As expected, a seasonal trend of pollutant removal in the wetland was observed for compounds with low biodegradation and moderate photodegradation rates (i.e. naproxen and diclofenac).

AB Here, we presented a novel industrial application for membrane distillation (MD) in a pharmaceutical production facility's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Two semicommercial air gap MD module designs (Xzero and Eldr500) were studied for comparison, with experimental results of product yield and heat demand up-scaled for inclusion in system simulations. District heating was considered to drive the 3 m(3)/h capacity MD process, with heat recovery employed in various process streams and for heating purposes in offices. The selected configurations show a high degree of thermal integration with an increase of yearly district heating purchases of 2-13%. Economic assessments of the full-scale MD system indicate that unit costs of purification would be $1.3/m(3) and $7/m(3) for Elixier500 and Xzero MD modules, respectively. Module heat losses should be considered in the future design of MD systems since the heat demand contributed to up to 77% of the specific costs.

AB Pharmaceuticals are common chemical contaminants in estuaries receiving effluent from wastewater and sewage treatment facilities. The purpose of this research was to examine benthic microalgal (BMA) community responses to sublethal exposures to tylosin, a common and environmentally persistent antibiotic. Bioassays, using concentrations of 0.011-218 mu mol tylosin l(-1), were performed on intertidal muddy sediments from North Inlet Estuary, SC. Exposure to tylosin resulted in a reduction in total BMA biomass and primary productivity. Furthermore, exposure seemed to retard diatom growth while having a minimal effect on cyanobacteria biomass. Estuarine systems receiving chronic inputs of trace concentrations of tylosin, as well as other antibiotics, may experience significant reductions in BMA biomass and primary productivity. Given the well-documented role of BMA in the trophodynamics of estuaries, these impacts will likely be manifested in higher trophic levels with possible impairments of the structure and function of these sensitive systems.

AB Hospital effluents are an important source of residual drugs and other classes of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The raw wastewater from the studied hospital exhibited acute toxicity to vertebrate organisms, and Cyprinus carpi was the most sensitive organism tested. A mixture of 19 commonly used pharmaceuticals caused acute toxicity to C. carpio with an LC50 value of 60.68 mg L-1 after 96 h. This study demonstrated that irradiation for 1-5 days significantly increased the acute toxicity of the pharmaceuticals to fish, leading to increased mortality after a 2-h exposure and approximately 40% of the surviving fish died within 28 days. The pre-irradiated pharmaceutical mixture also induced strange behaviors in the fish that survived the test. The synergistic increase in toxicity caused by the photolysis and mixing of pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored and warrants further examination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents the results of the degradation of clofibric acid by ozonation. Furthermore, results of the toxic effect of clofibric acid and its intermediate compound, 4-chlorophene generated during the oxidation process, to alga Selenastrum capricornium, are also discussed. The degradation and mineralization of the compound are studied according to the optimized operating conditions. These variables include pH, conductivity, hydraulic retention time and the use of a mixing maze. All the trials are conducted in a purpose-built pilot-scale reactor. Working under the optimal operating conditions (pH=9, HRT=12.5min and ozone dose=14 +/- 2 gN/m(3)), a degradation value of 98% was obtained, although mineralization of the compound did not occur. Results show that clofibric acid and its intermediate are toxic during the first 10min of treatment for concentrations equal to or greater than 1mg/L. Under optimal conditions toxicity is not observed for any concentrations.

TI Differentiation of nitrate sources: an environmental forensics approach
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Environmental forensics; Sewage; Manure; Pharmaceuticals; Nitrates
ID QUALITY; WATERS
AB The field of environmental science is currently undergoing a shift from environmental measurement to environmental forensics. This is largely attributed to the Environmental Liability Directive 2004/35/EC, which lays down the framework for the application of the 'polluter pays principle'. The adoption of environmental forensics approaches for nitrate source determination is one of the areas receiving the greatest interest. Current methods used for nitrate source differentiation do not successfully distinguish between sewage and manure sources. Nevertheless, achieving this specific differentiation is of great importance due to different health risks arising from the two sources. This science career contribution discusses emerging efforts in using chemical markers for differentiating and characterising point and diffuse inputs of sewage and manure into surface waters.

AB Stereoisomeric compositions can provide insights into sources, fate, and ecological risks of contaminants in the environment. In this study, stereoisomeric profiles of ibuprofen and iopromide were investigated in wastewater and receiving surface water of the Pearl River Delta, south China. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of ibuprofen was 0.108-0.188 and 0.480, whereas the isomer ratio (IR) of iopromide was 1.426-1.673 and 1.737-1.898 in the influent and final effluent, respectively, suggesting stereoselective degradation occurred for both pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment. Ibuprofen showed enantioselective degradation in the anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic conditions, whereas iopromide displayed isomer-selective degradation only under the aerobic condition. In the river waters, the EF of ibuprofen was 0.130-0.327 and the IR of iopromide was 1.500-2.531. The results suggested that pharmaceuticals in the mainstream Pearl River were mainly from discharge of treated wastewater, whereas in the tributary rivers and urban canals, direct discharge of untreated wastewater represented a significant contribution. The IR of iopromide can be an applicable and efficient tracer for wastewater discharge in the environment.

AB Owing to advanced analytical procedures an increasing number of organic micropollutants have been identified within the aquatic environment. Results from field investigations evidenced the attenuation of various organic micropollutants to be impacted by the predominant hydrochemical conditions. In the course of this study, column experiments were performed to examine the influence of redox conditions and temperature on the attenuation of 20 wastewater derived organic micropollutants. For this purpose, the degradation behavior of these compounds were investigated under oxic, nitrate reducing, iron/manganese reducing and sulfidic conditions at 21 8C in sandy aquifer sediments. Redox dependent degradation was observed for the pharmaceutically active compounds atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, iopromide, phenazone, propyphenazone, acesulfame and trimethoprim as well as for two phenazone type metabolites. In order to identify temperature dependencies, oxic columns were in addition operated at 6 degrees C, indicating the removal of several compounds to be influenced by the prevalent temperature.

SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN

DE pharmaceutical wastewater; internal micro-electrolysis; coagulation; COD
   removal; chrominance removal
AB Pharmaceutical wastewater from hypo soda production is characterized by high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), chrominance, as well as poor biodegradability and microbial toxicity. Therefore, it is not suitable to be treated directly with biological processes. In this study, internal micro-electrolysis combined with coagulation was used to pretreat the wastewater before the biological processes. Primarily, the optimal operational conditions for iron-carbon internal micro-electrolysis were determined. With these parameters, continuous tests were then developed and polyacrylamide (PAM) was added in a concentration of 5 mg/L wastewater as coagulant to study the efficiency of internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation treating COD, S(2-), chrominance and total nitrogen (TN). The results showed that the best operational parameters of the internal micro-electrolysis to remove COD and chrominance were pHs of 2.0 similar to 3.0, mass ratio of Fe/C = 30/1, reaction time of 120 min, and 0.1 mm diameter of scrap iron. The pretreatment averagely removed up to 66.6% COD, 98.3% S(2-), 85.1% chrominance and 25.6% TN from the wastewater, respectively, and enhanced the biodegradability of wastewater from 0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.02. Moreover, microbial toxicity of contaminants was eradicated, which made sure the stable operation of subsequent biological processes. This pretreatment method was put into effect in a pharmaceutical plant. Long-term monitoring results from the full-scale application supported that iron-carbon internal micro-electrolysis and coagulation was applicable to pretreat pharmaceutical wastewater from hypo-soda production.

AB Narragansett Bay is an urban estuary that historically has been impacted by long-term discharge of sanitary wastewater (WW) effluents. High-density water sampling was conducted in Narragansett Bay, RI, USA, in an effort to understand the distribution and behavior of sucralose, an artificial sweetener that has shown utility as a sanitary wastewater tracer. Water samples were collected at sixty-seven sites and analyzed for sucralose, whose performance was compared to other tracers present in wastewater effluents. Concentrations of sucralose were much higher than the other tracers measured, carbamazepine and caffeine, ranging from 18 to 3180 ng/L and corresponded well with salinity (r(2) = 0.88), demonstrating conservative behavior throughout the Bay. Mapped interpolation data using an empirical bayesian kriging model clearly show the spatial trends of WW and how estuarine processes influence dilution and dispersion throughout the Bay. These findings provide further evidence of the efficacy of sucralose as a wastewater tracer in large urban estuaries where continuous high-volume discharge of WW occur.

AB Antibiotics and nanoparticles, emerging contaminants, present great environmental risks and human health concerns. Sludge adsorption, a biological wastewater treatment removal mechanism, targets ciprofloxacin (Cip) antibiotics, C-60, and ZnO, leaving complex pollution in sludge anaerobic digestion. This study investigated the mechanisms through which individual and combined ZnO, Cip, and C-60 affect sludge anaerobic digestion by studying their effects on CH4 production, metabolism, and microbial community. ZnO was generally more toxic to CH4 production than Cip. The ZnO + Cip complex was more influential (> 29%) than ZnO or ZnO + C-60, with short-lasting acute and additive toxicity effects on methanogenesis and degradation of protein and carbohydrate. ZnO + C-60 and ZnO + Cip exerted apparent additional complex effects on Firmicutes, Aminicenantes, Chloroflexi, and Parcubacteria. These results would potentially aid toxicity control related to complex pollution, and improve energy production and reduce pollution risks when used in land applications.

AB Sewage sludge, fish waste, and mixtures of the two were pyrolized at 650 and 950 degrees C in order to convert them into stable adsorbents. To test their performance in the removal of pharmaceuticals from water, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) were chosen as model adsorbates. Adsorption isotherms were measured in batch adsorption tests at room temperature. The adsorbents prepared at 950 degrees C were more effective than those obtained at 650 degrees C. Even though both pharmaceuticals were adsorbed in the highest amount on the material composed of pyrolized fish waste, for TMP removal the composite obtained from 90% sewage sludge and 10% fish waste was equally effective. To elucidate the adsorption mechanism, detailed surface analyses by TA-MS, XRD and potentiometric titration were carried out. Favorable surface chemistry seems to be the factor governing the performance of these adsorbents as media for the pharmaceuticals' removal from an aqueous phase. The main adsorption mechanism is based on chelation, acid-base interactions and polar interactions with the inorganic phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage effluent effects on the biochemical parameters ofAstyanax bimaculatusorgans were investigateted. Treated sewage was collected in a treatment plant; 43 compounds, among them, pharmaceuticals and hormones, were investigated. Caffeine, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, ofloxacin, oxytetracycline, paracetamol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and tylosin waste was detected in the collected material. Fish were divided into four groups: control, TSE (treated sewage effluent), TSE + P (TSE with increased concentration of five pharmaceuticals) and PTSE (TSE + P post-treated with O-3/H2O2/UV). Biochemical parameters were evaluated in different organs after 14-day exposure. TBARS levels increased significantly in the brain of animals in the TSE and TSE + P groups in comparison to the control. There was significant reduction in TBARS levels recorded for the liver, muscle and gills of animals in the PTSE group in comparison to those of animals in the other groups. AChE activity reduced in the muscle of animals in the groups showing the highest pharmaceutical concentrations. CAT activity in the liver of animals in groups exposed to pharmaceutical effluent was inhibited. GST activity increased in brain of animals in the TSE + P and PTSE groups, whereas reduced levels of this activity were observed in liver of animals in the TSE group. Increased GST activity was observed in the brain of animals in TSE + P and PTSE groups. Based on integrated biomarker response values, the TSE + P group presented greater changes in the analyzed parameters. Results point out that pharmaceutical waste can cause oxidative stress, as well as affect biochemical and enzymatic parameters inAstyanaxsp. Post-treatment can also reduce damages caused to fish, even in case of the likely formation of metabolites. Based on these results, these metabolites can be less toxic than the original compounds; however, they were not able to fully degrade the pharmaceutical waste found in the sewage, which can interfere in fish metabolism.

AB People typically discard pharmaceutical products into the trash, or garbage or sewage systems to ultimately ending up in municipal wastewater treatment plants, which traditionally use non-photochemical ozonation to decompose contaminants, but often failing to completely eliminate them. Accordingly, photochemical advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed to remedy such situations. Unfortunately, these remain at the developmental stages and have yet to be implemented in practical applications. This review describes UV/ozonation, UV/peroxidation, UV/ozonation/peroxidation, photo-Fenton processes, and photo-catalytic oxidation processes (e.g. UV/TiO2) all of which depend on generating highly reactive oxygen species (e.g., center dot OH radicals, hydroperoxy radicals, superoxide anion radicals) to dispose of emerging aquatic contaminants. Albeit non-exhaustive, the review explores the progress made in the last 2-3 years by focusing on light-driven degradation processes to eliminate such pharmaceutical contaminants as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics and hormones, many of which have been detected in aqueous ecosystems.

AB Pharmaceutical manufacturing industries produce a vast range of substances by using organic and inorganic compounds as raw material thereby gives rise to huge volume of toxic and complex organic liquid effluents comprised of high levels of dissolved solids. High and low strength wastewater streams originating from manufacturing unit often contains different types of contaminants, including organic compounds which can be difficult to treat with conventional methods of treatment. In this study, the sequential treatment process of coagulation, electron beam (E-beam) irradiation and biological treatment was employed on real pharmaceutical industrial wastewater to study the impact of combined treatment on remediation and detoxification of the wastewater. Combined treatment was performed on low (L-OSW) and high (H-OSW) organic strength wastewater collected from representative pharmaceutical industry. Operational parameters like pH, absorbed dose and use of oxidants were systematically investigated to achieve the enhanced treatment of wastewater streams using E-beam irradiation. Biological treatment was carried out using activated sludge process at laboratory-scale reactor by utilizing acclimatized consortia in the experiments. Sequential hybrid coagulation, E-beam irradiation and biological treatment lead to synergistic degradation and detoxification of both the recalcitrant wastewater streams with overall chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 94% and 89% for LOSW and HOSW, respectively. Cytotoxicity assessment revealed that the combined treatment of wastewater was effective in eliminating the toxicity when tested against the selected microorganisms. The treatment cost of E-beam radiolysis alone, biological treatment alone and E-beam thorn biological treatment for LOSW was found to be 0.50, 2.35 and 2.85 USD m(-3); whereas, for HOSW, it was found to be 0.67, 0.7 and 1.37 USD m(-3), respectively. The overall cost of the set-up of an E-beam unit and the treatment cost for real pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated to establish the applicability of the E-beam technology at industrial scale. The feasibility of E-beam irradiation for wastewater remediation may ensure future smart cities with sustainable resource management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of ozone for the treatment of organics contaminated wastewater is limited by its slow dissolution rate and rapid decomposition in the aqueous phase. Micro-nano-bubbles (MNBs) are a novel method to prolong the reactivity of the ozone in the aqueous phase, thereby accelerating the treatment of the contaminant. In this study, the effects of pH and salinity on the treatment efficiency of ozone MNBs were examined. The highest efficiency was observed in weak acidic conditions and an increase in salinity enhanced the treatment efficiency significantly. Furthermore, the treatment of highly saline industrial wastewater as well as multi-contaminant groundwater containing persistent organics were also investigated. Treatment using ozone MNBs had a considerable effect on wastewaters that are otherwise difficult to treat using other methods; hence, it is a promising technology for wastewater treatment.

AB Ozone has been shown to be effective in the transformation of several chemicals of emerging concern that escape the wastewater treatment process, but there is concern whether toxic transformation products are formed. Two parallel biofilter columns with granular activated carbon (GAC) and filter sand following a pilot-scale ozone unit to treat secondary treated municipal wastewater were studied. Results show reduced wastewater genotoxicity following ozonation and further reduction following biofiltration. The BAC biofilter outperformed the sand biofilter in terms of reduction in both organics and genotoxicity. Biofilter performance correlated with biological indicators (dissolved oxygen reduction and effluent E. coli counts) but not with ATP bioactivity measurements. Limited bacterial (E. coli) regrowth was observed in treated effluent from both biofilters.

AB Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) are a general indicator for the total amount of compounds containing organically bonded halogens. AOX concentrations and components were investigated along the wastewater treatment process in four large-scale pharmaceutical factories of China, and genotoxicity based on the SOS/umu test was also evaluated. The results showed that AOX concentrations in wastewater of four factories ranged from 4.6 to 619.4 mg/L, which were high but greatly different owing to differences in the raw materials and products. The wastewater treatment process removed 50.0%-89.9% of AOX, leaving 1.3-302.5 mg/L AOX in the effluents. Genotoxicity levels ranged between 2.1 and 68.0 mu g 4-NQO/L in the raw wastewater and decreased to 1.2-41.2 mu g 4-NQO/L in the effluents of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). One of the main products of factory I, ciprofloxacin, was identified as the predominant contributor to its genotoxicity. However, for the other three factories, no significant relationship was observed between genotoxicity and detected AOX compounds.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) can be used to reduce various pollutants present in livestock wastewater, such as organic matter, nutrients and metals. Very recently these systems have also been used to remove the so called emergent pollutants. These pollutants can be harmful for both microorganisms and plants, two key players in CWs removal processes. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to assess the influence of emergent pollutants, namely antibiotics, on the removal of pollutants from livestock wastewaters, as antibiotics might decrease CWs performance for the treatment of this type of wastewater.
   Microcosms (0.4m x 0.3 m x 0.3 m), simulating CWs, were assembled with Phragmites australis to treat livestock wastewater not doped or doped with 100 mu g/L of enrofloxacin and/or of ceftiofur, two antibiotics commonly used in livestock industry. Four different treatments (Control, Enr, Cef and Mix) were tested, each in triplicate. Wastewater was treated during one-week cycle, after which it was removed and replaced by new wastewater (doped or not), in a total of 8 cycles. At weeks 1,2,4 and 8 treated wastewater was collected and analysed to determine removal rates of nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate), organic matter (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD)), and solids (including total suspended solids (TSS)), as well as, veterinary antibiotics (enrofloxacin and ceftiofur).
   High removal rates (up to 90% depending of the parameter) were observed independently of the presence of the veterinary antibiotics, which were also significantly removed from the wastewater. Generally, measured parameters presented values lower than those expressed in the legislation for wastewater discharge into the aquatic environment.
   Present results indicate that, in tested conditions, the presence of veterinary antibiotics, namely enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, did not influence significantly the biochemical removal processes that occur naturally in CWs during treatment of livestock wastewater, the systems maintaining their performance. Therefore, CWs are a valuable alternative to remove pollutants, including antibiotics, from livestock wastewaters, reducing the impact of this type of effluents into the environment. In addition, this technology can be an efficient/economically viable technology to meet the current wastewater reuse challenges. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals previously identified in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Montreal discharging into the St. Lawrence river, were tested for acute and chronic toxicity using the cnidarian Hydra attenuata. Acute toxicity was based on the established technique looking at morphological changes in the Hydra, while recently developed endpoints of feeding behaviour, attachment and growth (hydranth number) were used to measure chronic effects. The compounds under investigation (ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, trimethoprim and caffeine) were tested individually in controlled laboratory exposures with LC50 and EC50 results calculated. All compounds tested had relatively high LC50 values with gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen having the lowest at 22.36 mg/L and EC50 values based on morphology of 1.18 to 2.62 mg/L (all concentrations are nominal). The EC50 values based on feeding were similar to those based on morphology but with increased sensitivity for carbamazepine, bezafibrate and novobiocin. A trend of a reduction in feeding with deterioration in morphology was observed in the Hydra, with the exception of novobiocin, where a lower than expected EC50 of 13.53 mg/L was found with no negative effect on morphology. Significant reductions in attachment and hydranth number were seen at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/L for gemfibrozil and ibuprofen respectively. A toxicity threshold (TT) of 320 mu g/L was calculated for ibuprofen, only a factor of 102 or 10 higher than the concentration found in the effluent in the present study (1.19 mu g/L) and in other Canadian effluents studied (22 mu g/L [Brun GL, Bernier M, Losier R, Doe K, Jackman P, Lee HB, Pharmaceutically active compounds in Atlantic Canadian sewage treatment plant effluents and receiving waters and potential for environmental effects as measured by acute and chronic aquatic toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2006; 25(8): 2163-2176.] respectively. Using EU directive 93/67/EEC the pharmaceuticals under investigation can be classified as toxic (gemibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen), harmful (carbamazepine, bezafibrate, sulfapyridine, oxytetracycline and novobiocin) and non-toxic (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and caffeine) and their potential toxicity for the aquatic environment is discussed.

TI Fate and Occurrence of Pharmaceutically Active Organic Compounds during
   Typical Pharmaceutical Wastewater Treatment
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The chemical composition, distribution, and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) present in typical pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants were investigated with the aim of effectively removing these pollutants while minimizing waste of resources and energy. The results of this study indicate that the relative content of an organic compound class is unrelated to the number of organic compounds in the influent and effluent, yet it is directly proportional to the pollution contribution in pharmaceutical wastewater. In wastewater influent, the organic compound classes with the highest relative contents and pollution contributions were acids (relative content=63.65%, contribution to pollution=67.22%), esters (44.96%, 41.24%), and heterocyclic compounds (30.24%, 35.23%); in wastewater effluent, these classes were organic acids (62.54%, 65.13%), esters (52.66%, 59.02%), and organosilicon compounds (42.46%, 37.45%). The different physicochemical characteristics of these pollutants result in different removal efficiencies. For example, N,N-dimethylformamide, 4-methyloctane, N-ethylmorpholine, and 4-amino-N,N- and N,N-diethylbenzamide are refractory and are not degraded by microorganisms; thus, these compounds are discharged into the aquatic environment. Other organic compound classes including organosilicon compounds, acids, esters, heterocycles, and alcohols are mostly biodegraded, which leads to high concentrations of hydrocarbons in the wastewater effluent. The results of this study provide a foundation for the improvement of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Psychoactive compounds-meprobamate, pyrithyldione, primidone, and its metabolites, phenobarbital, and phenylethylmalonamide-were detected in groundwater within the catchment area of a drinking water treatment plant located downgradient of a former sewage farm in Berlin, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of the psychoactive compounds in anoxic groundwater and to assess the risk of drinking water contamination. Groundwater age was determined to achieve a better understanding of present hydrogeological conditions.
   A large number of observation and production wells were sampled. Samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Groundwater age was estimated using the helium-tritium (He-3-H-3) dating method.
   Concentrations of psychoactive compounds up to 1 mu g/L were encountered in the contamination plume. Generally, concentrations of phenobarbital and meprobamate were the highest. Elevated concentrations of the analytes were also detected in raw water from abstraction wells located approximately 2.5 km downgradient of the former sewage farm. Concentrations in the final drinking water were below the limit of quantification owing to dilution. The age of shallow groundwater samples ranged from years to a decade, whereas groundwater was up to four decades old at 40 m below ground. Concentrations of the compounds increased with groundwater age.
   Elevated concentrations of psychoactive drugs indicate a strong persistence of these compounds in the environment under anoxic aquifer conditions. Results suggest that the heritage of sewage irrigation will affect raw water quality in the area for decades. Therefore, further monitoring of raw and final drinking water is recommended to ensure that contaminant concentrations remain below the health-based precautionary value.

AB In this study a process for biological treatment of toxic wastewater from a pharmaceutical company was developed. By simulations on a laboratory scale, the contribution of organic material and toxicity in wastewater from different sources was determined and the degradability of specific compounds were studied. The information obtained from these tests was used to improve the treatability of the wastewater at the sources. As an example a persistent organic phosphorous compound could be degraded after pre-treatment with chemical hydrolysis. By further simulations on a laboratory scale it was possible to screen through a large number of process configurations to determine the best working biological treatment. A combination of fungal and bacterial treatment was found to remove toxicity from the wastewater more than a conventional bacterial treatment. The results from the laboratory studies were confirmed in pilot tests. A full scale treatment plant, which design is based on the results from these studies are presently under construction.

AB The presence of amoxicillin, a widely used antibiotic, has been documented in Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) effluents. As for other pharmaceuticals, ozonation is proposed as a process for its abatement from these effluents. The results of ozonation experiments on amoxicillin containing aqueous solutions indicate that ozone attack is mainly directed towards the phenolic ring of the studied molecule leading to the formation of hydroxyderivative intermediates. No direct evidences of attack on sulfur atom with sulfoxide formation are found. A kinetic investigation is carried out allowing the assessment of the kinetics of direct ozone attack and that of OH radicals to amoxicillin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and groundwater recharge can counteract water scarcity and reduce pollution of surface waters, but assessing its environmental risk should likewise consider effects associated to the soil. The present study therefore aimed at determining the impact of wastewater irrigation on the habitat quality of water after soil passage and of soil after percolation by applying bioassays and chemical analysis. Lab-scale columns of four different soils encompassing standard European soil and three field soils of varying characteristics and pre-contamination were continuously percolated with treated wastewater to simulate long-term irrigation. Wastewater and its percolates were tested for immobilization of Daphnia magna and growth inhibition of green algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and water lentils (Lemna minor). The observed phytotoxicity of the treated wastewater was mostly reduced by soil passage, but in some percolates also increased for green algae. Chemical analysis covering an extensive set of wastewater-born organic pollutants demonstrated that many of them were considerably reduced by soil passage, particularly through peaty soils. Taken together, these results indicated that wastewater-born phytotoxic substances may be removed by soil passage, while existing soil pollutants (e.g. metals) may leach and impair percolate quality. Soils with and without wastewater irrigation were tested for growth of plants (Avena sativa, Brassica napus) and soil bacteria (Arthrobacter globiformis) and reproduction of collembolans (Folsomia candida) and oligochaetes (Enchytraeus crypticus, Eisenia fetida). The habitat quality of the standard and two field soils appeared to be deteriorated by wastewater percolation for at least one organism (enchytraeids, plants or bacteria), while for two precontaminated field soils it also was improved (for plants and/or enchytraeids). Wastewater percolation did not seem to raise soil concentrations of classical organic pollutants and priority substances, while a significant retention was found for zinc and several organic micropollutants, particularly in the peaty soils, thus matching these soils' observed higher removal efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that benefits of wastewater irrigation can come with the cost of deteriorating soil habitat quality and depend on the respective soil and considered test organism. The approach employed here represents a feasible tool to assess these integrated effects at lab-scale while being predictive for scenarios at field-scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot-scale experiment is carried out for treating mixed wastewater containing pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) and domestic wastewater (DW), by a process that is a combination of hydrolysis acidification-ozone-modified anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic-ozone (A(2)/O) (pre-ozone) or hydrolysis acidification-modified A(2)/O-ozone (post-ozone). The effects of different mixing ratios of PW and DW and pre-ozone treatment or post-ozone treatment on the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand (COD) are compared and studied. The optimal ratio of PW in mixing wastewater is 30%, which has the optimal COD removal efficiency and minimum biotoxicity to biological treatment. The pre-ozone treatment shows more advantages in removing nitrogen and phosphate but the post-ozone treatment shows more advantages in COD removal. Analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) demonstrates that post-ozone treatment has a more significant effect on the removal of fulvic acid and humic acid than the effect from the pre-ozone treatment, so the COD removal is better. Overall DOM degradation efficiency by post-ozone treatment is 55%, which is much higher than the pre-ozone treatment efficiency of 38%. Microbial community analysis reveals that the genus Thauera and the genus Parasegetibacter take great responsibility for the degradation of phenolics in this process. All the results show that the post-ozone treatment is more efficient for the mixed wastewater treatment in refractory organics removal.

AB The behavior and fate of three fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin), one sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole), and trimethoprim were investigated at a sewage treatment plant in Umea, Sweden, in 2004. This plant uses conventional mechanical, chemical, and activated sludge methods to treat the sewage water and digest the sludge; the dewatered digested sludge is pelleted (dry weight > 90% of total weight). Raw sewage water and particles as well as effluents and sludge from specific treatment areas within the plant were sampled. In addition to quantifying the antibiotics within the plant, we characterized the sample matrixes to facilitate evaluation of the results. Of the five substances examined, only norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim were present in concentrations higher than their limits of quantification. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin sorbed to sludge in a manner that was independent of changes in pH during sewage treatment, and more than 70% of the total amount of these compounds passing through the plant was ultimately found in the digested sludge. The results suggest that fluoroquinolones undergo thermal degradation during pelleting, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Trimethoprim was found in the final effluent at approximately the same concentration and mass flow as in the raw sewage, and could not be quantified in any solid sample. Predicted environmental concentrations, based on consumption data for Umea municipality, correlated well with the results obtained, especially when the predicted concentrations were corrected to account for the amount of each active substance excreted in urine. The results obtained were compared to those of previous studies of these three substances' behavior and fate and were found to be similar, although some of the other plants studied employed the various treatment steps in different orders.

AB Sewage sludge was excluded from the list of component materials for the production of EU fertilizing products and it was banned as feedstock to produce pyrolysis & gasification materials in European Commission's technical proposals for selected new fertilizing materials under the Regulation 2019/1009 (STRUBIAS report). This exclusion of pyrolysis as a viable way to treat sewage sludge was mainly due to the lack of data on the fate of organic pollutants at pyrolysis conditions. In this work, we are addressing this knowledge gap. We studied slow pyrolysis as a potential process to efficiently treat organic pollutants present in stabilized sewage sludge. Sewage sludge was pyrolyzed in a quartz fixed bed reactor at temperatures of 400-800 degrees C for 2 h and the sludge and resulting sludge-chars were analyzed for the presence of four groups of organic pollutants, namely (i) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), (ii) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), (iii) pharmaceuticals, and (iv) endocrine-disrupting and hormonal compounds. Pyrolysis at >= 400 degrees C effectively removed pharmaceuticals (group iii) to below detection limits, whereas pyrolysis at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C was required to remove more than 99.8% of the compounds from groups i, ii and iv. Based on these findings, we propose, that high temperature (>600 degrees C) slow pyrolysis can satisfactory remove organic pollutants from the resulting sludge-char, which could be safely applied as soil improver.

AB Cootes Paradise is a coastal wetland, at the western end of Lake Ontario. The marsh, which is an important spawning ground for fish and a crucial habitat for other species, has been considerably degraded by excessive contaminant inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), marsh tributaries, and Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs). These discharges are not only major sources of nutrients (e.g., phosphorus) to the marsh, but are also the main contributors of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other wastewater contaminants. Studies have shown that many of these compounds are toxic and have estrogenic effects on organisms living in the vicinity of these sources. This study investigates dispersal of contaminants from nearby point sources, as determined from sediment contamination, both spatially and stratigraphically. This was accomplished by establishing the trends and utilizing the relationship's between limiting nutrient phosphorus, estrogenic alkylphenols, and fecal sterols, specifically, coprostanol. High levels of phosphorus (1,655-1,987 mg TP kg(-1)) and alkylphenolics (2.51-4.89 mg kg(-1)) were measured in sediments near the discharge outlets. Statistical analysis revealed a close relationship between investigated pollutants and the molecular marker coprostanol, and provides evidence of significant sediment contamination near the discharge points, suggesting deposition of most contaminants within a short distance from the points of entry and limited dispersal of pollutants within the wetland. The stratigraphic distribution of pollutants, which reflects the historical trends, reveals major spikes in pollutant concentrations near point sources that could be attributed to episodic events of major significance and shows a long persistence of the investigated contaminants in sedimentary environments.

AB Biotransformation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants ultimately depends on the enzymatic activities developed in each biological process. However, few research efforts have been made to clarify and identify the role of enzymes on the removal of OMPs, which is an essential knowledge to determine the biotransformation potential of treatment technologies. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the enzymatic transformation of 35 OMPs under anaerobic conditions, which have been even less studied than aerobic systems. Initially, 13 OMPs were identified to be significantly biotransformed (>20%) by anaerobic sludge obtained from a full-scale anaerobic digester, predestining them as potential targets of anaerobic enzymes. Native enzymes were extracted from this anaerobic sludge to perform transformation assays with the OMPs. In addition, the effect of detergents to recover membrane enzymes, as well as the effects of cofactors and inhibitors to promote and suppress specific enzymatic activities were evaluated. In total, it was possible to recover enzymatic activities towards 10 out of these 13 target OMPs (acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and its transformation product sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, atenolol, clarithromycin, citalopram, climbazole, erythromycin, and terbutryn, venlafaxine) as well as towards 8 non-target OMPs (diclofenac, iopamidol, acyclovir, acesulfame, and 4 different hydroxylated metabolites of carbamazepine). Some enzymatic activities likely involved in the anaerobic biotransformation of these OMPs were identified. Thereby, this study is a starting point to unravel the still enigmatic biotransformation of OMPs in wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic contamination of aqueous environment due to pharmaceutical sewage may lead to development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strain. In this research, elimination of antibiotics from synthetic wastewater was investigated. For this purpose, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were treated by a pilot scale of net-like rotating biological contactor with three compartments, 48 plastic discs with total volume of 78.75 L. This system was continuously operated for about one year at various organic loading rates with different antibiotic dosages. The obtained results indicated that by increasing hydraulic retention time, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was gradually increased. The optimal hydraulic retention time for desired rate of COD removal was 36 h. In addition, the effect of hydraulic retention time, organic load rate and sulfamethoxazole concentration in the removal of sulfamethoxazole and organic matter was assessed. Moreover, the results demonstrated that with increasing in organic load rate, sulfamethoxazole elimination was enhanced. In the next step, simultaneous removal of both antibiotics for constant inlet COD concentration of 8000 mg/L at optimum hydraulic retention time was analysed. The results showed that trimethoprim removal efficiency was approximately 100%, even at high concentration of trimethoprim (50 mg/L). For observation of dominant microorganism, samples of the developed biofilm on rotating biological contactor discs were scanned by scanning electron microscopy. In the first compartment where biomass was exposed to highest concentration of antibiotics, fungus strains were the dominant organism. In the second and third compartment antibiotic-resistant bacteria were the dominant attached living organisms.

AB Ozonation as final wastewater (WW) polishing step, following conventional activated sludge treatment is increasingly implemented in sewage treatment for contaminant degradation to prevent surface water pollution. While the oxidative degradation of chemicals has been extensively investigated, the in vivo toxicological characteristics of ozonated whole effluents are rarely a matter of research.
   In the present study, whole effluents were toxicologically evaluated with an in vivo test battery before and after full-scale ozonation and subsequent sand filtration on site at a treatment plant. One aquatic plant (duckweed, Lemna minor) and five invertebrate species of different systematic groups (Lumbriculus variegatus, Chironomus riparius, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Daphnia magna) were exposed to the effluents in a flow-through-designed test system with a test duration of 7-28 d.
   None of the considered toxicity endpoints correlated with the pollutant elimination. A tendency towards an increased toxicity after ozonation was apparent in three of the test systems showing [statistically] significant adverse effects in the L. variegatus toxicity test (decrease in reproduction and biomass). After sand filtration, adverse effects were reduced to a similar level like after conventional treatment. Solely the Daphnia reproduction test revealed beneficial effects after ozonation in combination with sand filtration.
   Results of the test battery indicate the formation of adverse oxidation products during WW ozonation. L. variegatus appeared to be the most sensitive of the five test species. Sand filtration effectively removes or detoxifies toxic oxidation products, as toxic effects were subsequently reduced to the level after conventional treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The performance of an aerated horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetland was investigated before, during and after a simulated aeration failure. Conventional wastewater parameters (e.g., carbonaceous biological oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and Escherichia coli) as well as selected micropollutants (caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame, and carbamazepine) were investigated. Furthermore, the removal of biological effects was investigated using in vitro bioassays. The six bioassays selected covered environmentally relevant endpoints (indicative of activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor, AhR; binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR gamma; activation of estrogen receptor alpha, ER alpha; activation of glucocorticoid receptor, GR; oxidative stress response, AREc32; combined algae test, CAT). During the aeration interruption phase, the water quality deteriorated to a degree comparable to that of a conventional (non-aerated) horizontal subsurface flow wetland. After the end of the aeration interruption, the analytical and biological parameters investigated recovered at different time periods until their initial treatment performance. Treatment efficacy for conventional parameters was recovered within a few days, but no complete recovery of treatment efficacy could be observed for bioassays AhR, AREc32 and CAT in the 21 days following re-start of the aeration system. Furthermore, the removal efficacy along the flow path for most of the chemicals and bioassays recovered as it was observed in the baseline phase. Only for the activation of AhR and AREc32 there was a shift of the internal treatment profile from 12.5% to 25% (AhR) and 50% (AREc32) of the fractional length.

AB The occurrence and multi-phase distribution of five pharmaceutical compounds were investigated in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) receiving river by analysis of pharmaceuticals in sediment, particulate matter, conventional dissolved phase (>0.7 mu m), colloidal phase (5 kDa to 0.7 mu m), and truly dissolved phase (<5 kDa) water. Diclofenac was found in all samples, followed by clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen with the decreasing detection frequency. All targets in WWTP outfall site were higher than those in the upstream and downstream, indicating that the WWTP is an important input source of pharmaceuticals in the river. The colloidal phase contributed 10-14% of ketoprofen, 8-26% of naproxen, 17-36% of clofibric acid, 22-33% of diclofenac, and 9-28% of ibuprofen in the aquatic system, suggesting the colloids will play an important role as carrier to contaminants in the aquatic environment. Based on truly dissolved concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water, only the risk quotient (RQ) value for diclofenac towards fish was higher than 1, indicating it poses a potential risk to aquatic organisms. Finally, a Level III fugacity model was used to further assess the environmental fate of the selected pharmaceuticals (exemplified for clofibric acid and diclofenac). Both clofibric acid and diclofenac tend to accumulate in water compartment with the percentage of 99.7% and 60.6%, respectively. Advection in river is a significant loss process for clofibric acid (56.4%) and diclofenac (54.4%). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A detailed investigation was carried out to evaluate the occurrence, persistence and fate of a range of micropollutants at different processing points at a full-scale water recycling plant (WRP) in Queensland, Australia. The WRP, which combines an advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) with a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), produces high quality recycled water for industrial users. The concentrations of 11 pharmaceuticals from various therapeutic categories and two endocrine disrupting chemicals were examined in full -scale microfiltration and reverse osmosis membrane facilities. Salicylic acid was the most abundant analyte in the WWTP influent, with a concentration range of 11-38 mu g/L, followed by bisphenol A with concentrations ranging from 6 to 23 mu g/L The concentration of all analytes decreased on average by one order of magnitude following primary and secondary treatment. Gemfibrozil, primidone and carbamazepine were found to have lower removal efficiencies (74-78%) than other compounds during these stages, which could indicate lower biodegradability. The microfiltration and reverse osmosis systems were found to further lower the pollutant concentrations by an order of magnitude. The overall removal efficiencies in the final recycled water were above 97%, resulting in product water concentrations of lower than 0.1 mu g/L for most compounds. An exception to this finding was observed for bisphenol A, which was detected in concentrations up to 0.5 mu g/L in the final recycled water. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are usually characterised by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. Therefore, it must be treated. The treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by CuO/TiO2 was investigated. The effect of reaction time, catalyst dosage, aeration and pH on decolorisation efficiency was investigated. The results indicated that CuO/TiO2 photocatalytic can decolorise pharmaceutical wastewater effectively. Decolorisation efficiency increased with reaction time prolonging, aeration and catalyst dosage increasing. But excessive catalyst and aeration decreased decolorisation efficiency, and decolorisation efficiency under acidic conditions was superior to alkaline conditions.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in treated wastewater is gaining attention due to their potential environmental impact. An analytical method was developed to quantify estrogen compounds in samples from a concentrated wastewater matrix typical of water recycling systems used in space. The method employed conventional HPLC with UV detection. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to isolate the compounds of interest from wastewater. Spike-recovery tests in clean and wastewater matrices were used to test the extraction process. The results of these experiments suggest that deconjugation is the most predominant reaction occurring in the systems, as effluent concentrations of free estrogens typically exceeded influent concentrations. Despite the long retention times of the system or the near infinite solids retention time, free estrogens were not removed from graywater representative of space waste streams. For a closed-loop wastewater treatment system, these compounds may accumulate to levels requiring other removal mechanisms (i.e., reverse osmosis).

AB The presence of pesticides in municipal wastewater and aquatic environments is showing an increasing trend and leading to adverse environmental and health effects. The present study investigated the occurrence of pyrethroids in the municipal wastewater of Tabriz, a city in northwestern Iran. The performance of a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of pyrethroids was also investigated. For this purpose, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant in summer and fall seasons were measured. The toxicity of target pesticides on rainbow trout and Daphnia Magna was also investigated by a new modified index of environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants. The results show that permethrin was the dominant pesticide in the samples in both seasons with the highest detected concentration in the influent wastewater of 1838 ng/L. Furthermore, cypermethrin was among the highly-detected pesticides with concentration as high as 1742 ng/L. It was also found that 77% and 85% of permethrin, as the dominant pesticide, was removed in summer and fall seasons, respectively. Investigation of the risk of pesticides presence in the effluent presents a very high risk to the aquatic environment which was obtained by calculating the proposed index. Although there is a high removal efficiency of pesticides in wastewater treatment plant, higher toxicity and detection frequency of permethrin in the collected samples is the main reason of high risk to the aquatic environment.

AB Clofibric acid (CFA) was selected as an example of the widespread micropollutants in municipal wastewater to investigate the feasibility of the application of an iron-activated persullate (Fe-PS) system for selective micropollutants removal prior to biological wastewater treatment. In pure CFA solution, the CFA degradation rate was accelerated with an increase in oxidant dosage and 2.15 mg . L-1 (0.01 mM) CFA could be completed removed within 30 min with 270 mg . L-1 (1 mM) potassium persullate (PS) activated by 56 mg . L-1 iron powder (Fe). Although both sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) were generated in the Fe-PS system, SO4 center dot- was identified as the dominant oxidant for CFA degradation. To investigate the interference from model compounds in the municipal wastewater. CIA degradation indifferent concentrations of ammonia or/and glucose solutions, the synthetic municipal wastewater, and real municipal wastewater systems were investigated. A complete removal of CFA was achieved with ammonia or/and glucose interferences. Less than 3% ammonia was removed due to the formation of aminopropyl radicals. About 15% degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was mainly attributed to the oxidation of glucose by HO center dot, Indicating the excellent selective oxidation ability of the Fe-PS system targeting at CFA over glucose. Even though the alkalinity significantly hindered the oxidation of CFA in both synthetic and real municipal wastewater system, the removal efficiency of CFA was significantly higher than that of DOC. The decrease of CFA removal efficiency in municipal wastewater system comparing to the other tests was due to the slow degradation of PS in the system and further hindered the SO4 center dot- generation. Therefore, the impacts of other impurities in municipal wastewater on the oxidation activities of Fe-PS system should be further investigated. In general, this study confirmed the feasibility of using the FePS system for selective degrading resistant CFA in municipal wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The valorification of the marine biomass is an important resource for many industries like pharmaceutical, supplying raw material for the extraction of bioactive substances (vitamins, sterols and collagen), cosmetics, biofertilizers and wastewater treatment. In the last years a special attention has been given to the use of macroalgae. The aim of this study was to emphasize the capacity of two representative green algae species frequent presents on the Romanian shore, Ulva lactuca (L.) and Cladophora vagabunda (L.) Hoek, to remove two usual detergents from wastewater. The green algae washed, dried at room temperature, macerated to powder were introduced into different filter paper for comparison, then immersed in waste water treated with different concentrations of detergents. Tap water was used for the experiment. The results show that Ulva lactuca (L.) species is suitable than Cladophora vagabunda (L.) Hoek species, for wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceuticals find their way to the aquatic environment via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Biotransformation plays an important role in mitigating environmental risks; however, a mechanistic understanding of involved processes is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential relationships between first-order biotransformation rate constants (k(b)) of nine pharmaceuticals and initial concentration of the selected compounds, and sampling season of the used activated sludge inocula. Four-day bottle experiments were performed with activated sludge from WWTP Groesbeek (The Netherlands) of two different seasons, summer and winter, spiked with two environmentally relevant concentrations (3 and 30 nM) of pharmaceuticals. Concentrations of the compounds were measured by LC-MS/MS, microbial community composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and k(b) values were calculated. The biodegradable pharmaceuticals were acetaminophen, metformin, metoprolol, terbutaline, and phenazone (ranked from high to low biotransformation rates). Carbamazepine, diatrizoic acid, diclofenac, and fluoxetine were not converted. Summer and winter inocula did not show significant differences in microbial community composition, but resulted in a slightly different k(b) for some pharmaceuticals. Likely microbial activity was responsible instead of community composition. In the same inoculum, different k(b) values were measured, depending on initial concentration. In general, biodegradable compounds had a higher k(b) when the initial concentration was higher. This demonstrates that Michealis-Menten kinetic theory has shortcomings for some pharmaceuticals at low, environmentally relevant concentrations and that the pharmaceutical concentration should be taken into account when measuring the k(b) in order to reliably predict the fate of pharmaceuticals in the WWTP.

AB The fate of beta blockers (atenolol, acebutolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, and sotalol) was studied in surface water-sediment systems. A new analytical method was developed to determine the beta blockers; in sediments by LC-ESI-tandem MS detection. The relative recoveries in sediments ranged from 89 +/- 7% (acebutolol) to 102 +/- 3% (nadolol) using deuterated surrogate standards. Beta blockers were present with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in the sediments of small German streams containing an elevated percentage of treated wastewater. Biotransformation studies and sorption isotherms of the beta blockers; were performed with two natural river sediments ("Burgen", "Dausenau") differing in organic carbon content and particle size distribution. Biotransformation of beta blockers in the surface water-sediment systems exhibited a low to high persistence with 90% disappearance (DT90) ranging from 0.4-10 d (pindolol, atenolol) to > 100 d (sotalol, propranolol or celiprolol). For sorption studies neither NaN3 addition nor autoclavation led to a complete mass balance of the beta blockers, probably due to biotransformation. Isotherms at 6 h (apparent equilibrium, measuring aqueous and sediment phase) fitted by the Freundlich equation show that sorption of all beta blockers to the Burgen sediment were linear or close to it (i.e., n-values between 0.93 and 1.13), while in the Dausenau sediment the sorptions were slightly non linear (i.e., n-values 0.77-0.91). In river water the sorbed fraction is negligible in comparison to the dissolved fraction. Nevertheless, beta blockers can be detected with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in sediments of small streams containing more than 50% treated wastewater.

AB A nitrification study was conducted in continuous flow stirred tank reactors using high strength nitrogenous wastewater (concentrated stream from a urea plant mixed with pharmaceutical wastewater). The reactors were operated at different solids retention times (SRT = 10-62.5 d) and hydraulic retention times (HRT = 1.5-2.1 d). Pharmaceutical wastewater was used as an organic carbon source to maintain a COD/TKN ratio of 1. The nitrification achieved at different SRTs varied from 87 to 99%. The nitrogen balance data show that ammonia assimilation and denitrification accounted for 4-53% of the total nitrogen removed. The yield coefficients and decay coefficients were Y-b = 0.5 (COD basis), k(db) = 0.07 d(-1) (COD basis) for heterotrophs and Y-n = 0.15 (TKN basis), k(dn) = 0.06 d(-1) (TKN basis) for nitrifiers respectively.

AB Pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in wastewater pose a new challenge to wastewater professionals as well as to the pharmaceutical industry. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning the possible detrimental effects on the aquatic ecosystems, the precautionary principle - or possibly new scientific evidence - may give rise to more stringent demands on wastewater treatment in the future. In conventional wastewater treatment plants, a combination of biological treatment with high sludge residence times and ozonation of the effluent seems to be the most promising technology. Ozonation, however, is an energy-intensive technology. Moreover, in conventional end-of-pipe systems a large part of the pollutants will always be lost to the environment due to leaking, primarily during rain. In the long term, source separation offers the more sustainable solution to the entire wastewater problem, including organic micropollutants. Urine source separation is an elegant solution to the problems of nutrients and pharmaceuticals alike and losses of untreated pollutants to the environment can be minimized. Although few technologies for the separate treatment of urine have been developed to date, the 100-500 times higher concentrations of micropollutants promise more efficient conditions for all removal technologies known from conventional wastewater treatment.

AB The use of sewage sludge and wastewater in agricultural lands provide contaminants to soils. As a result, a large number of contaminants can be present in soils. Among others, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are two of the most studied families of emerging contaminants in wastewater. However, there is scarce information about their behaviour in soils. Occurrence, fate and behaviour in soils of metabolites are even less known. In this work, the degradation of most recurrent PPCPs in the environment and their main metabolites has been evaluated using batch experiments in three typical Mediterranean soils. Batch experiments were carried out in a climatic chamber using spiked soils under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The studied compounds were five pharmaceutically active compounds (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac), two parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben) and twelve of their main metabolites. Studied PPCPs and metabolites showed different adsorption capacity onto the studied soils. As results, despite of the compounds were spiked at the same concentrations, different contents were measured at the beginning of the batch experiments. The soil 3 showed the lowest degradation rate for all studied compounds what could be related with the higher adsorption capacity of this soil. A decrease of the measured contents was observed for all studied compounds, except in the case of CBZ and EP-CBZ. No transformations of parent compounds into their metabolites or vice versa were observed, except in the case of Ibuprofen and its metabolites. Although the results showed overall short degradation times for the most of the compounds studied, the evaluation of the environmental risks of the PPCPs and their metabolites should not be underestimated.

AB Direct linkages between endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) from municipal and industrial wastewaters and impacts on wild fish assemblages are rare. The levels of plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) and Vtg messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to wastewater effluents and dilutions of 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estrogen activity, and fish assemblages in 10 receiving streams were assessed to improve understanding of important interrelations. Results from 4-d laboratory assays indicate that EE2, plasma Vtg concentration, and Vtg gene expression in fathead minnows, and 17-estradiol equivalents (E2Eq values) were highly related to each other (R-2=0.98-1.00). Concentrations of E2Eq in most effluents did not exceed 2.0ng/L, which was possibly a short-term exposure threshold for Vtg gene expression in male fathead minnows. Plasma Vtg in fathead minnows only increased significantly (up to 1136g/mL) in 2 wastewater effluents. Fish assemblages were generally unaffected at 8 of 10 study sites, yet the density and biomass of 79% to 89% of species populations were reduced (63-68% were reduced significantly) in the downstream reach of 1 receiving stream. These results, and moderate to high E2Eq concentrations (up to 16.1ng/L) observed in effluents during a companion study, suggest that estrogenic wastewaters can potentially affect individual fish, their populations, and entire fish communities in comparable systems across New York, USA.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous water contaminants that may have subtle detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, and possibly also on human health. The risks of pharmaceuticals, or pharmaceutically active compounds, remain poorly understood. Awareness of the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, coupled with evidence of effects such as fish feminization, however, suggest that precautionary management action to reduce the release of pharmaceuticals to the environment should be considered. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the scope of the issue and possible management strategies from the perspectives of expert stakeholders, drawn from government, academia, and the pharmaceutical and consulting industries, involved in scientific research or policy and management activity, from Canada, the United States, and Europe. Twenty-seven interviewees were asked about their views on management strategies such as pharmaceutical-return programs and incentives for the development of "green'' pharmaceuticals. Interviewees generally believed that pharmaceuticals in the environment represented a concern for both human and ecosystem health, although they were more concerned about impacts on aquatic ecosystems. They believed that advanced wastewater treatment technology, education of medical professionals to reduce overprescription, pharmaceutical-return programs coupled with public education, and requirements for all municipalities to have a minimum of secondary wastewater treatment were the most effective management strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals. These strategies should be considered by governments interested in managing the risks of human pharmaceuticals in the environment. Combinations of management strategies will likely be most effective in mitigating the risks presented by pharmaceuticals.

AB Fenton oxidation was used to treat the berberine finished mother liquor wastewater in pilot scale. To evaluate berberine and COD removal efficiency, the main factors, including pH, H2O2 dosage, Fe2+/H2O2 mass ratio and the water flow (Q), were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that under the optimal conditions, pH 3, H2O2/COD molar ratio of 1.25, Fe2+/H2O2 molar ratio of 0.1, Q 100 L/h [with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 h], the COD and berberine removal efficiencies were 35.6 and 91.4 % at initial COD concentration of 4061 mg/L and berberine concentration of 709 mg/L, respectively. The (BOD5)/(COD) ratio (B/C) of the wastewater increased from 0 to 0.3, indicating significantly improved biodegradability of wastewater.

AB A comparative understanding of effluent quality of decentralized on-site wastewater treatment systems, particularly for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), remains less understood than effluent quality from centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants. Using a novel experimental facility with common influent wastewater, effluent water quality from a decentralized advanced aerobic treatment system (ATS) and a typical septic treatment system (STS) coupled to a subsurface flow constructed wetland (WET) were compared to effluent from a centralized municipal treatment plant (MTP). The STS did not include soil treatment, which may represent a system not functioning properly. Occurrence and discharge of a range of CECs were examined using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry during fall and winter seasons. Conventional parameters, including total suspended solids, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand and nutrients were also evaluated from each treatment system. Water quality of these effluents was further examined using a therapeutic hazard modeling approach. Of 19 CECs targeted for study, the benzodiazepine pharmaceutical diazepam was the only CEC not detected in all wastewater influent and effluent samples over two sampling seasons. Diphenhydramine, codeine, diltiazem, atenolol, and diclofenac exhibited significant (p < 0.05) seasonal differences in wastewater influent concentrations. Removal of CECs by these wastewater treatment systems was generally not influenced by season. However, significant differences (p < 0.05) for a range of water quality indicators were observed among the various treatment technologies. For example, removal of most CECs by ATS was generally comparable to MW. Lowest removal of most CECs was observed for STS; however, removal was improved when coupling the STS to a WET. Across the treatment systems examined, the majority of pharmaceuticals observed in on-site and municipal effluent discharges were predicted to potentially present therapeutic hazards to fish.

AB A monitoring programme was carried out on wastewater, surface and drinking water on the NW area of Spain during the four seasons of a year period (November 2007-September 2008). This study covered a series of emerging pollutants of different classes, including pharmaceuticals, neutral and acidic organophosphorus flame retardant/plasticizers (OPs), triclosan, phenoxy-herbicides, insect repellents and UV filters. From the total set of 53 compounds, 19 were found in raw wastewater with median concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g L-1. Among them, salicylic acid, ibuprofen and the UV filter benzophenone-4 (BP-4) were the most concentrated, exceeding the 1 mu g L-1 median value. Subsequently, 11 of these contaminants are not efficiently enough removed in the small WWTPs tested and their median concentrations in effluents still surpassed the 0.1 mu g L-1, so that they can spread through surface water. These chemicals are the pharmaceuticals naproxen, diclofenac and atenolol; the OPs tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tri(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) and diethylhexyl phosphate (DEHP); and the sulphonate UV filters BP-4 and 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulphonic acid (PBSA). These OPs were then the dominant emerging pollutants occurring in surface and drinking water, where they are detected in the 20-200 ng L-1 range. Pharmaceuticals and UV filters are typically below the 10 ng L-1 level. Finally, herbicides were only detected in the last sampling campaign under the 100 ng L-1 drinking water European Union limit.

AB Continuous exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is a critical concern given potential toxicity impacts on aquatic environments and human health, although concentrations of PPCPs in the environment are low. While several studies have focused on the fate and toxicity of organic micropollutants in wastewater, the environmental impacts of life cycle assessment induced by these organic micropollutants in advanced wastewater treatment processes are still unknown. To address this need, an environmental evaluation of three representative advanced wastewater treatment processes (ozonation, granular activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis) involving PPCPs removal was conducted using life cycle assessment and USEtox model in this study. Although a large amount of PPCPs can be eliminated during conventional waste highest characterization factors for freshwater toxicity, while 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, sertraline, and 17 beta-estradiol had the highest human toxicity characterization factors. From the perspective of LCA, reverse osmosis appeared to have the greatest environmental burden due to the high energy and material consumption during the treatment process. After involving 126 PPCPs in life cycle inventory, the ecotoxicity impact results were increased significantly in three advanced wastewater treatment processes. The contribution of effluent was improved in toxicity impact category, accounting more than 25% for the three processes. The effluent (including PPCPs) as the key factor was next only to electricity and chemicals in eutrophication, ecotoxicity and human toxicity impacts category particularly. Therefore, PPCPs should not be ignored in life cycle assessment of advanced wastewater treatment processes, although they are not typically monitored in wastewater. These results are valuable for conducting a comprehensive environmental evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment processes considering micro-pollutants removal. The identified PPCPs with high freshwater and human toxicity can be considered as the priority control index of organic micropollutants for wastewater treatment plants.

AB Effluent from the Pasakoy Wastewater Treatment Plant was oxidized by using O3 and O3/H2O2. DOC, COD, UV254, total coliform, dissolved ozone and some endocrine disrupting compounds were monitored during oxidation. Results showed that O3 provided superior disinfection, however, lower reductions in DOC, COD and endocrine disrupting compounds were exhibited compared to O3/H2O2. The highest removal efficiency of DOC, COD and endocrine disrupting compounds were achieved at 0.5 molar ratio of O3/H2O2. The benefit of H2O2 addition for advanced oxidation reduced significantly when the mole ratio was increased to 2. Therefore, the mole ratio of H2O2 to O3 is a critical parameter for the design of wastewater oxidation by O3/H2O2.

AB Carbamazepine is a psychiatric pharmaceutical widely detected in aquatic environments. Due to its generalized occurrence and environmental persistence it might be considered as an anthropogenic pollution indicator. In this research, a previously developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on a commercial monoclonal antibody, was applied to the quantification of carbamazepine in ground, surface and wastewaters and results were validated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   The performance of the applied ELISA methodology was tested in the presence of high concentrations of sodium chloride and dissolved organic matter. The method was not significantly affected by matrix effects, being adequate for the quantification of carbamazepine in environmental samples, even without sample pre-treatment. This method allows the quantification of carbamazepine in the range of 0.03-10 mu g L(-1), with a relative error lower than 30%. Due to a pH dependent cross-reactivity with cetirizine, an antihistaminic drug, the assay also enabled the quantification of cetirizine in the samples.
   The application of the developed method to the quantification of carbamazepine was performed by using environmental samples with very different matrices, collected in the geographical area of Ria de Aveiro, an estuarine system located in the North of Portugal. Carbamazepine was detected in all analyzed wastewater samples and in one surface water with concentrations between 0.1 and 0.7 mu g L(-1). Validation with LC-MS/MS revealed that results obtained by ELISA are 2-28% overestimated, which was considered highly satisfactory due to the absence of sample pre-treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) can be incorporated into ecosystems and pose potential environmental and health hazards. These pollutants are becoming omnipresent in the environment because they are introduced by several sources, being particularly important the contribution of human-derived pharmaceuticals. The presence of PPCPs in waters has received increasing attention in recent years, resulting in great concern regarding their occurrence, transformation, fate and environmental risk. For that reason, the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DIC), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET) and naproxen (NPX) were measured in the waters and sludge of several parts of a double step activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) from Murcia (Spain). With these results, the biological degradation constant, the sorption coefficient and the pharmaceutical removal were calculated. Possible risks to humans and ecosystems were also evaluated.
   These showed good degradation of IBU and NPX (74.4 and 84.9%, respectively), while CBZ didn't display any degradation. DIC was the compound most likely to be sorbed into the sludge (3.09 L kg(-1)). The PPCPs removal in this double stage WWTP was compared to a previous data obtained in a WWTP of the same region with an activated sludge (single biological batch reactor). The results showed a decrease in the removal of the double stage plant, probably due to the lower hydraulic retention time employed. The study of the human and ecological risk quotients indicates a low risk of the selected pharmaceuticals (RQ < 0.1).

AB Analysis of drugs and pharmaceuticals in the environment is typically performed with non-chiral chromatographic techniques. The environmental risks posed by chiral compounds analysed in this way must therefore be assumed to be independent of chirality, meaning that each enantiomer is equally potent in toxicity and long-lived in stability. This manuscript examines the degradation of each of the four isomers of ephedrine in river simulating microcosms and links this to toxicity data obtained by exposing three different organisms (D. magna, P. subcapitata and T. thermophila) to each of the isomers individually. Microcosms showed that significant degradation only occurred in biotic conditions and that only two isomers (1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine, 1S,2S-(+)-pseudoephedrine) degraded significantly over a period of fourteen days. This is concerning because at least one of the non-degraded isomers (1S,2R-( +)-ephedrine) has been observed in wastewater effluent, which discharges directly into rivers, meaning these isomers could be persistent in the environment. We also observed formation of 1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine in single isomer 1R,2S-(-)-ephedrine river simulating microcosms. Human liver microsome assays and mass spectrometry based data mining revealed that 1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine is not human derived but it could be formed as a results of microbial metabolic processes. Across all three organisms tested the persistent isomers (1S,2R-(+)-ephedrine and 1R,2R-(-)-pseudoephedrine) were more toxic than those that undergo degradation; meaning that if these isomers are entering or formed in the environment they might represent a potentially hazardous contaminant.

AB In this study, an integrated approach named the '333' strategy was applied to pollution control in the Jialu River, in northern China, which is heavily burdened with anthropogenic pollution. Due to a deficiency of the natural ecological inflow, the Jialu River receives predominantly industrial and municipal effluent. The '333' strategy is composed of three steps of pollution control including industrial point-source pollution control, advanced treatment of municipal wastewater, and ecological restoration; three increased stringency emission standards; and three stages of reclamation. Phase 1 of the '333' strategy focuses on industrial point-source pollution control; phase 2 aims to harness municipal wastewater and minimize sewage effluents using novel techniques for advanced water purification; phase 3 of the '333' strategy focuses on the further purification of effluents flowing into Jialu River with the employment of an engineering-based ecological restoration project. The application of the '333' strategy resulted in the development of novel techniques for water purification including modified magnetic resins (NDMP resin), a two-stage internal circulation anaerobic reactor (IC reactor) and an ecological restoration system. The results indicate that water quality in the river was significantly improved, with increased concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), as well as reduction of COD by 42.8% and NH3-N by 61.4%. In addition, it was observed that the total population of phytoplankton in treated river water notably increased from only one prior to restoration to 8 following restoration. This system also provides a tool for pollution control of other similar industrial and anthropogenic source polluted rivers.

AB The fate and removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has received great attention during the last decade. Numerous data concerning concentrations in the water phase can be found in the literature, however corresponding data from sludge as well as associated mass balance calculations are very limited. In the present study, the adsorbed and dissolved concentrations of 9 PPCPs were investigated in each unit of a WWTP in Beijing, China. Based on the calculation of mass balance, the relative mass distribution and removal efficiency of each target compound was obtained at each process. The amount of PPCPs entering into the WWTP ranged from 12 g.d(-1) to 3848 g.d(-1). Five target compounds (caffeine, chloramphenicol, bezafibrate, clofibric acid, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) were effectively removed, with rates of 57%-100%. Negative removal efficiencies were obtained for sulpiride, metoprolol, nalidixic acid, and carbamazepine, ranging from -19% to -79%. PPCPs mainly existed in dissolved form (>= 92%) in both the raw influent and the final effluent. The sludge cake carried a much lower amount of PPCPs (17 g.d(-1)) compared with the discharged effluent (402 g.d(-1)). In A(2)/O treatment tanks, the anaerobic and anoxic tanks showed good performance for PPCPs removal, and the amount of adsorbed PPCPs was increased. The results reveal that both the dissolved and the adsorbed phases should be considered when assessing the removal capacity of each A(2)/O tank.

AB The adverse effects of micropollutant residues in water on the environment and public could take place under a very low range of concentrations; from several g/L to ng/L. Since there is no efficient unit process to remove these pollutants, efficient technologies are sought to treat them. Ferrate(VI) exhibits high oxidation/reduction potentials and has many advantages because of its dual functions of oxidation and coagulation. Removal of micropollutants by ferrate(VI) was pH dependant and this was in coordinate with the chemical/physical properties of the pollutants and ferrate(VI) speciation. Promising performance of ferrate(VI) in the treatment of real wastewater was observed. It is important to determine whether the ferrate(VI)-treated water contains any toxic or mutagenic substances as this should relieve public health concerns when a new chemical is employed for water treatment. The toxicity studies on the ferrate(VI)-treated effluent were carried out initially via Ames tests and recently via zebrafish embryos tests conducted at author's group. These results suggest that ferrate(VI) reagents do not produce mutagenic by-products for study conditions. However, a recent study showed the formation of adsorbable organic haloids as by-products in the ferrate(VI)-treated wastewater effluents. Obviously, more researches are needed to investigate the potential formation of harmful by-products during ferrate(VI) treatment. Other future work is suggested in order to implement ferrate(VI) into full-scale water treatment and other environmental remediation requirements.

AB The occurrence of 21 selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in river water was examined; meanwhile the presence and removal of these PhACs at different water treatment steps in two conventional drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) were evaluated. Monitoring results showed that of all 21 target PhACs, twelve PhACs were ubiquitously detected in water samples from the Yangtze river and its two tributaries (Jialing River and Huaxi stream), whereas alodipine was not found in any river water sample. The concentrations of PhACs detected in Huaxi stream were statistically significantly higher than those found in the Jialing River and the Yangzi River because of the direct discharges of uncontrolled domestic sewage and poultry wastewater and the abuse of PhACs in the rural areas served by the Huaxi stream. An environmental risk assessment of PhACs based on the risk quotient value approach indicated that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin and dehydrated erythromycin and clofibric acid had a medium risk, and the mixture of the studied PhACs showed high risk for the aquatic ecosystems. Fourteen out of 21 target PhACs were found in the raw water of the two studied DWTPs with azithromycin having the highest concentration (about 20 ng/ L). Following the conventional water treatment processes, the studied PhACs were found to be removed by an average of 54 and 48% in DWTP A andDWTP B, respectively. Among the targetPhACs, sixandthreePhACswere detectedinfinished water ofDWTP B andDWTPA, respectively. This is the first study in southwestern China reporting the presence of PhACs in surface water and drinking water.

AB Ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was commonly found in treated wastewater due to its incomplete removal during sewage treatment plant processes. As treated wastewater is increasingly used for landscape irrigation, it is imperative to understand the leaching potential for ketoprofen in receiving soils. In this study, adsorption and degradation experiments were conducted in four U.S. soils with different physicochemical characteristics. Ketoprofen was not strongly adsorbed to the four soils with K-d values ranging from 1.26 to 8.24 L kg(-1), suggesting its potential to move downward with percolating water. The adsorption was positively related to the soil organic matter (OM) content (R-2 = 0.890). Degradation experiment showed that half-lives (t(1/2)) of ketoprofen were 4.58 d in Arlington sandy loam (ASL, coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Haplic Durixeralfs), 8.04 d in Hanford loamy sand (HLS, coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorrhents), 15.37 d in Imperial silty clay (ISC, fine, semectitc, calcareous, hyperthermic Vertic Torrifluvents), and 27.61 d in Palouse silt loam (PSL) soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls), respectively. Degradation of ketoprofen in soils appeared to be influenced by the soil OM content. The prolonged t(1/2) by sterilization indicated that microbial degradation was the dominant pathway for ketoprofen degradation in soils, while photodegradation only contributed a small portion to the ketoprofen degradation. The t(1/2) and K-oc values were fitted to screening models to predict the leaching potential of ketoprofen in soils. It appeared that relatively high leaching potential of ketoprofen existed in ISC and PSL soils.

AB Residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in surface waters. Incomplete removal of these compounds by wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) results in their presence in effluents and finally in surface waters. The occurrence and removal of four PPCPs was investigated in three WWTPs in Mississippi, USA, during a period of 1 year. Influent and effluent were sampled from the three WWTPs. Upstream and downstream samples of the WWTPs were also collected. All four PPCPs were detected in all influents where sulfamethoxazole showed the highest concentration levels with a median concentration of 1,640 ng/L, and carbamazepine was detected at the lowest level with a median concentration of 132 ng/L. Different PPCPs were removed to different extents varying from 99 to 100 %. Gemfibrozil showed the highest removal rates (73-100 %), whereas carbamazepine showed the lowest (-99 to -30 %). Secondary activated sludge in oxidation-ditch process showed remarkable PPCP-specific removal rates. Galaxolide was removed more than the other PPCPs, and sulfamethoxazole showed the least removal. Galaxolide was found to be a predominant PPCP in effluent among the PPCPs studied, and it was detected in all downstream (14.1-428.2 ng/L) and upstream (4.1-60.0 ng/L) samples. Sulfamethoxazole was removed more during the summer than the winter season. A clear increase of PPCP concentrations was observed in most downstream samples compared with upstream samples suggesting that discharges from WWTPs are the major source of PPCPs in surface waters.

AB Aquaculture in treated wastewater (TWW) has been practiced around the world, yet this field of research is backed with only scant scientific data, especially the aspect of the bioaccumulation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate how fish culture in tertiary TWW (TTWW) affects commercially important traits, such as fish survival, growth rate and health, and to assess the potential risks associated with food safety and consumer protection. Cyprinus carpio juveniles were raised in 0%, 50% and 100% Trww, for five months. Fish performance and health parameters were not affected by exposure to TTWW. The levels of heavy metals in the fish muscle were below the FAO and EU maximal permitted levels in edible fish. Seven out of 40 screened OMPs were detected in the TTWW samples at least once. Out of the 19 analyzed OMPs in fish tissues, four were detected in exposed fish. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were detected in the muscles and livers of fish grown in 50% and 100% TTWW at measurable concentrations. Carbamazepine-epoxide and diphenhydramine concentrations were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the muscle of the exposed fish, while diphenhydramine was detected above the LOQ level in two liver samples of fish grown in 100% TTWW. Based on the presented findings, TTWW can be successfully used for growing fish, and TTWW-grown fish met all the existing standards for heavy metals accumulation. However, the issue of OMP's bioaccumulation needs to be further studied in different fish species and culture conditions to broaden the perspective of the findings.

AB The goal of this work was to investigate the occurrence of emerging contaminants in drinking water of the city of Campinas, Brazil. Tap water samples were analyzed using SPE-GC-MS for 11 contaminants of recent environmental concern. Six emerging contaminants (stigmasterol, cholesterol, bisphenol A, caffeine, estrone, and 17 beta-estradiol) were found in the samples. The latter two were detected only during the dry season, with concentrations below quantification limits. Stigmasterol showed the highest average concentration (0.34 +/- 0.13 A mu g L-1), followed by cholesterol (0.27 A +/- 0.07 A mu g L-1), caffeine (0.22 A +/- 0.06 A mu g L-1), and bisphenol A (0.16 A +/- 0.03 A mu g L-1). In Campinas, where surface drinking water supplies receive large amounts of raw sewage inputs, the emerging contaminants levels in drinking waters were higher than median values compiled for drinking and finished water samples around the world.

AB In Europe, approximately 40% of sludge yearly produced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is applied in agricultural lands as organic amendment, especially in arid regions. Sludge tends to concentrate wastewater pollutants. Many of them are not removed by sludge stabilization treatments and, as a result, they could originate adverse effects on soils, vegetation, animals, and humans. Although sludge stabilization treatments play an important role in removal contaminants from sludge and, therefore, in preventing contaminant discharges onto soils, there is scarce information about the occurrence of these compounds in these treatments. This fact is especially acute for emerging pollutants and, particularly, their metabolites. In this work, seven pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and their main metabolites, have been monitored in five different stabilization treatments: anaerobic and aerobic digestion, dehydration, composting, and lagooning. Sixteen compounds were measured in the analysed samples. Their distribution was similar in primary sludge, in spite of the different geographic locations of the WWTPs, The distribution was in accordance with the metabolic ratios of most of the studied compounds. Different behaviour was observed depending on the compound, for example, CBZ, 3-OH-CBZ, DIC, and 4-OH-DIC were highly persistent in all studied stabilization technologies whereas CAF, PX showed high degradability. Most of the studied compounds were measured in the final product of the sludge stabilization processes evaluated. This fact shows the necessity to improve the knowledge about the presence of these compounds in sludge intended to be applied onto soil and about the potential ecotoxicological risks of these compounds.

AB Pharmaceuticals and domestic-use chemicals (PDCs) are classes of emerging chemical contaminants thought to enter the aquatic environment primarily through wastewater treatment plant (WTP) discharges. The intent of this study was to quantify loadings of PDCs in an urban watershed. The watershed has two major branches but with wastewater discharge occurring in only one of the two major branches. Surface water from the Anacostia River (Washington, DC) was collected in base-flow and storm-flow regimes. Surface water was filtered to separate water and particles, and the PDCs were extracted from water with Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges and extracted from sediments using microwave-assisted extraction. The PDCs in the extracts were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the form of the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. The most frequently detected PDC with the highest concentration was bisphenol-A in both branches of the Anacostia River watershed and the least frequently detected PDC was diclofenac. The overall median concentrations for all measured PDCs in surface water ranged from nondetectable to 54.9 ng/l. Alternatively, in the collected WTPs samples, naproxen was observed, with the highest concentration and the median concentrations in WTP effluent ranging from nondetectable to 276 ng/l. Estimates of PDC loadings for February 2006 from WTP effluent showed that < 2% of the downstream load in the NE Branch was derived from WTP discharge. PDC sources other than WTP effluent appear to influence surface water concentrations in the urban Anacostia River watershed.

AB The presence of micropollutants in the environment and their toxic impacts on the aquatic environment have raised concern about their inefficient removal in wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the fate of micropollutants of four different classes was simulated in a conventional activated sludge plant using a bioreactor micropollutant fate model coupled to a settler model. The latter was based on the Burger-Diehl model extended for the first time to include micropollutant fate processes. Calibration of model parameters was completed by matching modelling results with full-scale measurements (i.e. including aqueous and particulate phase concentrations of micropollutants) obtained from a 4-day sampling campaign. Modelling results showed that further biodegradation takes place in the sludge blanket of the settler for the highly biodegradable caffeine, underlining the need for a reactive settler model. The adopted Monte Carlo based calibration approach also provided an overview of the model's global sensitivity to the parameters. This analysis showed that for each micropollutant and according to the dominant fate process, a different set of one or more parameters had a significant impact on the model fit, justifying the selection of parameter subsets for model calibration. A dynamic local sensitivity analysis was also performed with the calibrated parameters. This analysis supported the conclusions from the global sensitivity and provided guidance for future sampling campaigns. This study expands the understanding of micropollutant fate models when applied to different micropollutants, in terms of global and local sensitivity to model parameters, as well as the identifiability of the parameters.

AB Currently, the world is faced with major challenges of water scarcity and water quality, thus the coupling of wastewater treatment technologies for reuse of reclaimed water is a very attractive option. In this study, polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) nanocomposite membranes containing carboxylic functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNTs) were fabricated via the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The membranes were fabricated using polyethylene (PEG) 400 as an additive. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of the nanocomposite membranes showed that the membranes had porous crosssectional morphologies and improved porosity with increased PEG 400 content. These membranes were used as an advanced treatment step for the purification of beauty hair salon wastewater. The membrane containing 8.5 wt% PEG achieved 80.84%, 77.51% and 94.51% turbidity removal of the rapid granular multimedia prefiltered beauty hair salon wastewater, municipal effluent and influent wastewater samples, respectively. Poor rejection of most organics in the wastewater samples by the modified membranes was observed. In addition, significant reduction in organic content by the modified membrane in municipal influent sample was confirmed by quadruple time-of-flight liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (QTOF LC-MS) which indicated reduced peaks intensity. The higher the PEG 400 dosage, the larger the pore sizes and the lower the contact angle values and thus, enhanced pure water flux and lower rejection of organics was observed. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of fouled membrane surfaces indicated that metal ions played a role in cake formation. Pressure had no influence on the fouling mechanism of the membrane containing 8.5 wt% PEG and 100% relative wastewater flux restoration was obtained after chemical cleaning of these membranes. These results suggest that an additional advanced water treatment technology may be required for the effective treatment of beauty hair salon wastewater for reuse purposes.

AB In this study, we investigated the pretreatment of a high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater by catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) process. Different experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the catalyst type, operating temperature, initial system pH, and oxygen partial pressure on the oxidation of the wastewater. Results show that the catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method have better catalytic activity compared to others. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion increased with the increase in temperature from 160 to 220 degrees C and decreased with the increase in pH. Moreover, the effect of the oxygen partial pressure on the COD conversion was significant only during the first 20 min of the reaction. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the wastewater improved greatly after CWAO, the ratio of BOD5/COD increased less than 0.1-0.75 when treated at 220 degrees C (BOD: biochemical oxygen demand).

AB Wastewater impact on drinking water sources was assessed using several approaches, including analysis of three pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)-primidone, carbamazepine, and caffeine-as indicators, and determination of precursor concentrations for the disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) using formation potential (FP) tests. Samples were collected in 2006 and 2007 in rivers impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges, at drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intakes upstream or downstream from these discharges, and from two WWTP effluents in two watersheds. The levels [10th percentile-maximum (median)] of primidone, carbamazepine, caffeine, and NDMAFP were 2-95 (7) ng/l, 2-207 (18) ng/l, 7-687 (78) ng/l, and 12-321 (35) ng/l, respectively. The highest concentrations of primidone, carbamazepine, and NDMA precursors were from one of the WWTP effluents, whereas the highest concentration of caffeine was detected in a river heavily impacted by treated wastewater discharges. The lowest concentrations of the three PPCPs were from a DWTP influent upstream of a metropolitan urban area with minimum wastewater impact. Temporal variations in PPCP and NDMAFP concentrations and streamflows in two selected watersheds were also observed. Furthermore, correlation analysis between caffeine or carbamazepine and primidone was evaluated. The results show that measurement of the two pharmaceuticals and NDMAFP tests can be used to evaluate wastewater impact in different watersheds, whereas caffeine results were more variable.

AB In this work, the presence of 20 pharmaceuticals in wastewater from Colombia is investigated. Several widely consumed compounds have been detected in wastewater samples from different origins and geographical areas in Colombia. The studied pharmaceuticals included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering stain drugs, lipid regulators, and anti-depressants. The investigated samples were urban wastewater collected during one whole week before (influent) and after treatment (effluent) in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Bogota and Medellin. Raw wastewater from the Hospital of Tumaco and from the city of Florencia were also collected. Analyses performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that most of the target analytes were present in all the wastewater samples. The highest concentrations (up to 50 mu g/L) corresponded to acetaminophen, but several antibiotics, such as azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and antihypertensive drugs, such as losartan and valsartan, were commonly present in influent wastewater (IWW) at levels above 1 mu g/L. Moreover, the treatment applied in WWTPs seemed to not efficiently remove the compounds under study, because most pharmaceuticals were also present in effluent wastewater (EWW) at concentrations close to those of the IWW. Special emphasis was made in this work on the quality of data reported, performing a detailed study of quality control (QC) samples. The analytical approach used -direct injection of 5-fold diluted samples without any additional treatment - is simpler and faster than the commonly applied solid phase extraction (SPE). The use of 12 isotope-labelled internal standards ensured the satisfactory correction of matrix effects for the corresponding analytes. For the remaining 8 compounds, no drastic matrix effects were observed, and only four compounds (cloxacillin, doxycydine, losartan, tetracycline) presented QC recoveries near or slightly below 60%, revealing ionization suppression, particularly in the IWW. Data on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals reported in this paper are the basis for current studies that aim to develop efficient systems for the degradation/removal of these compounds from the aquatic environment.

AB This research mainly aims at evaluating the function of Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) facing with different concentrations of Amoxicillin as different shock loads. A pilot MBR with an effective volume of 20 L equipped with a hollow fiber (HF) ultrafiltration membrane was applied. Hydraulic retention time and flow rate were kept at 12 h and 1.6 L/hr, respectively. 70 days after the pilot setup, the reactor at MLSS concentration of upper than 7000 mg/L reached the desired steady state. After the setup period, the concentration of the shock began at 5 mg/L and then reach 10,20,40,70, and 100 mg/L, respectively. The percentage removal of AMX, at shock concentrations of 5-20 mg/L, was up to 95 AMX removal at concentrations of over 40 mg/L abruptly decreased to 72 %. However, at concentrations of 70 mg/L and 100 mg/L the removal rates of 62.85 % and 61 % were achieved, respectively. The sorption percentage of AMX through sludge biomass equals 12.1 %. At any concentration of AMX the removal efficiency of COD reached upper than 95 % excluding 70 mg/L and 100 mg/L which is about 94 % and 92 % respectively. The nitrification efficiency was first 53.6 %, whereas after applying the shock, it decreased over time and 24 h after the shock reached its lowest level, i.e. 29.6 %.

AB Sorption-desorption behavior of the antibiotic tetracycline (TET) and the synthetic estrogen hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) with wastewater sludge and sludge-derived humic substances [humic acid (HA) and humin] was investigated. From acidic functional group capacity and elemental analyses, HA had higher polarity, aromaticity, and acidity than humin; humin contained aliphatic chains with high mineral content. The different physicochemical properties of the pharmaceuticals and sludge components yielded different kinds of sorption-desorption interactions. Partitioning coefficients (K-d) of TET to sludge were higher (1,552 +/- 41-4,667 +/- 41 L/kg) than EE2 (534 +/- 52-609 +/- 47 L/kg). TET sorption was highly pH-dependent and maximal at pH 9. Ca2+ ions enhanced sorption, emphasizing the role of polyvalent metal ions in forming TET-sludge complexes. Humin was the dominant component for TET sorption due to its high inorganic matter content. In contrast, EE2 sorption was independent of solution pH, forming mostly hydrophobic interactions with sludge organic matter. EE2 had a high affinity for HA due to its chemical structure. Desorption of the two pharmaceuticals differed as well. The amount of desorbed TET (18.7 +/- 1.3-29.8 +/- 2 %) was lower than that of EE2 (60.6 +/- 3-62.3 +/- 2 %), and the hysteresis index was higher for TET than EE2. While TET desorption tended to be delayed in the solid matrix, EE2 desorbed easily and in accordance with the aqueous equilibrium concentration. The conclusions emphasize the need for further research into frequently used pharmaceuticals with different physicochemical properties and the recognition of sludge application as an important source of distribution for these contaminants in the environment.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are co-introduced into the environment by irrigation with reclaimed wastewater and/or application of biosolids. In this study, we evaluate the role and mechanism of interaction of the pharmaceuticals naproxen and carbamazepine with structural fractions of biosolids-derived DOM. Sorption interactions were estimated from dialysis-bag experiments at different pHs.
   Sorption of naproxen and carbamazepine by the hydrophobic acid fraction exhibited strong pH-dependence. With both pharmaceuticals, the highest sorption coefficients (K-DOC) were at pH 4. With the hydrophobic neutral fraction, pH affected only naproxen sorption (decreasing with increasing pH). Among the hydrophilic DOM fractions, the hydrophilic acid fraction exhibited the highest K-DOC value for carbamazepine, probably due to their bipolar character. In the hydrophilic acid fraction-naproxen system, significant anionic repulsion was observed with increasing pH. The hydrophilic base fraction contains positively charged functional groups. Therefore with increasing ionization of naproxen (with increasing pH), K-DOC to this fraction increased. The hydrophilic neutral fraction exhibited the lowest K-DOC with both studied pharmaceuticals.
   The K-DOC value of carbamazepine with the bulk DOM sample was higher than the calculated K-DOC value based on sorption by the individual isolated fractions. The opposite trend was observed with naproxen at pH 8: the calculated K-DOC value was higher than the value obtained for the bulk DOM. These results demonstrate that DOM fractions interact with each other and do not act as separate sorption domains. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ready biodegradability of twenty food additives, belonging to the classes of artificial sweeteners, natural sweeteners, preservatives and colorings, was investigated using activated sludge as inoculum and OECD 301F respirometric test. According to the results, saccharin, aspartame, sodium cyclamate, xylitol, erythritol, maltitol, potassium sorbate, benzoic acid and sodium ascorbate are characterized as readily biodegradable compounds, partial biodegradation (<60% during the test) was noticed for steviol, inulin, alitame, curcumin, ponceau 4R and tartrazine, while no biodegradation was observed for the other five compounds. The duration of lag phase before the start of biodegradation varied between the target compounds, while their ultimate biodegradation half-life values ranged between 0.7 +/- 0.1 days (benzoic acid) and 24.6 +/- 1.0 days (curcumin). The expected removal of target compounds due to ultimate biodegradation mechanism was estimated for a biological wastewater treatment system operated at a retention time of one day and percentages higher than 40% were calculated for sodium cyclamate, potassium sorbate and benzoic acid. Higher removal percentages are expected in full-scale Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) due to the contribution of other mechanisms such as sorption to suspended solids, (bio)transformation and co-metabolic phenomena. Further biodegradation experiments should be conducted under different experimental conditions for the food additives that did not fulfill the requirements of the applied protocol. Future studies should also focus on the occurrence and fate of food colorants and natural sweeteners in full-scale STPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 15 pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was assessed in both influent and effluent samples. PACs were quantified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The sampling campaign was carried out during summer (n = 13) to assess the variation in both the influent concentrations and the removal efficiencies in similar climatic conditions. Among the selected PACs, all were quantified in influent samples but two of them were not systematically detected mainly due to the high quantification limit. PACs were detected at mu g L-1 levels with a maximum concentration of 96.7 mu g L-1 for Acetaminophen. The mean mass balance of the whole PAC pool during tracking was 448.5 and 26.3 g day(-1) in influents and effluents respectively. However, the removal efficiency varied depending on the sample (e.g. between -20 and 50% for Diclofenac). The fate of PACs during water treatment therefore depends on the removal quality in general, highlighted by the removal of nitrogen or BOD5. As a result, effluent concentrations were variable, unlike influent concentrations which were used to correctly assess the consumption behaviour of the population around the sampled WWTP. Although the daily mass loads were comparable with those found in other studies in Europe for the same type of WWTP, the estimated consumption sometimes exhibited significant differences with the theoretical one. These differences depend on the mode of consumption, i.e. whether the therapeutic class treats chronic or episodic diseases, and on the scale gap between estimated and theoretical concentrations.

AB The efficiency of homogeneous Fenton oxidation induced by simulated solar radiation to remove 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen hormone, from secondary treated effluents was investigated. Solar radiation was simulated with a 150W xenon lamp and experiments were conducted varying initial effluent pH (3-8), EE2 concentration (70-315 mu g/L), H2O2 concentration (1.5-86 mg/L) and Fe2+ concentration (1-5 mg/L). Changes in estrogen concentration were followed by high performance liquid chromatography. EE2 was readily oxidizable at acidic conditions (pH = 3) with complete conversion typically occurring in 5-10 min of irradiation at, e.g. 5 mg/L Fe2+, 4.3-15 mg/L H2O2 and 200 mu g/L EE2 concentration. The process involves two distinct kinetic regimes, a fast one during the very first minutes followed by a far slower one. The contribution of dark Fenton reactions to degradation was found to be considerable, particularly at higher concentrations of Fenton's reagents: nonetheless, the beneficial role of simulated solar irradiation was noticeable at lower concentrations and even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, as well as for the mineralization of the effluent organic matter. Two natural hormones, namely estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were also tested and their reactivity values were nearly equal to EE2. The implications for tertiary wastewater treatment (removal of pathogens and estrogenicity) are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were tested for their suitability for detecting sulfonamides in wastewater from various stages in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the river into which the wastewater is discharged, and two swine-rearing facilities. The sulfamethoxazole ELISA cross-reacts with several compounds, achieving detection limits of <0.04 mu g/L for sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethoxypyridine, sulfachloropyridine, and sulfamethoxine, whereas the sulfamethazine (SMZ) ELISA is more compound specific, with a detection limit of <0.03 mu g/L. Samples from various stages of wastewater purifications gave 0.6-3.1 mu g/L by SMX-ELISA, whereas river samples were similar to 10-fold lower, ranging from below detection to 0.09 mu g/L. Swine wastewater samples analyzed by the SMX-ELISA were either at or near detectable limits from one facility, whereas the other facility had concentrations of similar to 0.5 mu g/L, although LC-MS/MS did not confirm the presence of SMX. Sulfamethazine ELISA detected no SMZ in either WWTP or river samples. In contrast, wastewater samples from swine facilities analyzed by SMZ-ELISA were found to contain similar to 30 mu g/L [piglet (50-100 lb) wastewater] and similar to 7 mu g/L (market-weight hog wastewater). Sulfamethazine ELISA analyses of wastewater from another swine facility found concentrations to be near or below detection limits. A solid phase extraction method was used to isolate and concentrate sulfonamides from water samples prior to LC-MS/MS multiresidue confirmatory analysis. The recoveries at 1 mu g/L fortification ranged from 42 +/- 4% for SMZ to 88 +/- 4% for SMX (n = 6). The ELISA results in the WWTPs were confirmed by LC-MS/MS, as sulfonamide multiresidue confirmatory analysis identified SMX, sulfapyridine, and sulfasalazine to be present in the wastewater. Sulfamethazine presence at one swine-rearing facility was also confirmed by LC-MS/MS, demonstrating the usefulness of the ELISA technique as a rapid and high-throughput screening method.

AB To provide the first nationwide reconnaissance of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in water resources, the U.S. Geological Survey used five newly developed analytical methods to measure concentrations of 95 OWCs in water samples from a network of 139 streams across 30 states during 1999 and 2000. The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams susceptible to contamination (i.e. downstream of intense urbanization and livestock production). OWCs were prevalent during this study, being found in 80% of the streams sampled. The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential, industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 OWCs being found during this study. The most frequently detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid), cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent metabolite). Measured concentrations for this study were generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines, drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria. Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines established. The detection of multiple OWCs was common for this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs being found in a given water sample. Little is known about the potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of OWCs in the environment. In addition, results of this study demonstrate the importance of obtaining data on metabolites to fully understand not only the fate and transport of OWCs in the hydrologic system but also their ultimate overall effect on human health and the environment.

AB Sorption of 75 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to three different types of sludge (primary sludge, secondary sludge with short and long sludge age respectively) were investigated. To obtain the sorption isotherms batch studies with the APIs mixture were performed in four nominal concentrations to water containing 1 g of sludge. The range of APIs concentrations was between ng L-1 to mu g L-1 which are found in the wastewater effluents. Isotherms were obtained for approximately 45 of the APIs, providing distribution coefficients for linear (K-d), Freundlich (K-f) and Langmuir (K-L) isotherms. K-d, K-f and K-L ranging between 7.1 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(-2) and 6.1 x 10(4) and 9.2 x 10(-3) and 1.1 L kg(-1), respectively. The obtained coefficients were applied to estimate the fraction of APIs in the water phase (see Abstract Graphic). For 37 of the 75 APIs, the predicted presence in the liquid phase was estimated to >80%. 24 APIs were estimated to be present in the liquid phase between 20 and 80%, and 14 APIs were found to have <20% presence in the liquid phase, i.e. high affinity towards sludge. Furthermore, the effect of pH at values 6, 7 and 8 was evaluated using one way ANOVA-test. A significant difference in K(d)s due to pH changes were found for 6 of the APIs (variation 10-20%).

AB Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) resist degradation in wastewater treatment plants. Thus, they may be transformed by chemical disinfectants in the final treatment stage, generating products that may possess enhanced toxicity/biological activity relative to the parent compounds. For this reason, the reaction of cimetidine,an over-the-counter antacid, with the frequently used disinfectant, free chlorine, was investigated. Cimetidine degraded rapidly in the presence of excess free chlorine, indicating that it will likely undergo significant transformation during wastewater disinfection. Four major products were isolated and extensively characterized by comparison of liquid chromatographic retention times to known standards, mass spectrometry, H-1- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. An expected sulfur oxidation product, cimetidine sulfoxide, was identified along with three unexpected products: 4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyl-1H-imidazole,4-chloro5-methyl-1H-imidazole, and a product proposed to be either a beta- or delta-sultam. The last three products are formed by transformations not frequently observed in free chlorine reactions of PPCPs such as C-C bond cleavage and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. The unexpected transformations yielded compounds with more substantial structural changes than would be observed in common free chlorine reactions such as N-chlorination or electrophilic halogenation. The reaction pathway was elucidated by kinetic analysis and by independently treating isolated intermediates with free chlorine, and reaction mechanisms were proposed. Finally, the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of the chlorination products was estimated, and the products 4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyl-1H-imidazole and 4-chloro-5-methyl-1H-imidazole were estimated to have lower PNECs than cimetidine.

AB In this work, ozone oxidation of the antibiotics amoxicillin (AMX), cephalexin, and ceftriaxone was investigated in different samples: (i) aqueous solutions (100 mg L-1), (ii) an industrial wastewater containing AMX at 125 mg L-1 (chemical oxygen demand 6000 mg O-2 L-1), and (iii) a heavily contaminated industrial wastewater containing the antibiotics at a total concentration of 320 mg L-1. High performance liquid chromatography, molecular absorption spectrophotometry in the ultraviolet/visible region, and total organic carbon measurements showed that ozonation of antibiotics solutions led to removal higher than 95% with 10-20% mineralization. Industrial wastewater also showed very good efficiency for antibiotic removal (80-98%) after ozonation. Moreover, Microtox (R) test showed 86% toxicity reduction for the industrial wastewater.

AB Wastewater is a potential treasure trove of chemicals that reflects population behavior and health status. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been employed to determine population-scale consumption of chemicals, particularly illicit drugs, across different communities and over time. However, the sociodemographic or socioeconomic correlates of chemical consumption and exposure are unclear. This study explores the relationships between catchment specific sociodemographic parameters and biomarkers in wastewater generated by the respective catchments. Domestic wastewater influent samples taken during the 2016 Australian census week were analyzed for a range of diet, drug, pharmaceutical, and lifestyle biomarkers. We present both linear and rank-order (i.e., Pearson and Spearman) correlations between loads of 42 biomarkers and census-derived metrics, index of relative socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage (IRSAD), median age, and 40 socioeconomic index for area (SEIFA) descriptors. Biomarkers of caffeine, citrus, and dietary fiber consumption had strong positive correlations with IRSAD, while tramadol, atenolol, and pregabalin had strong negative correlation with IRSAD. As expected, atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide correlated positively with median age. We also found specific SEIFA descriptors such as occupation and educational attainment correlating with each biomarker. Our study demonstrates that wastewater-based epidemiology can be used to study sociodemographic influences and disparities in chemical consumption.

AB This study determined the effectiveness of pilot-scale tertiary sedimentation and filtration systems on lowering phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and pharmaceutical levels in municipal secondary wastewater effluent. Secondary effluent was diverted into five pilot-scale tertiary treatment systems. The systems used alum and a polymer during coagulation and flocculation, after which sedimentation was used to remove settleable solids, and filtration was used to remove nonsettleable solids. The filtration units following sedimentation were (1)continuous backwash upflow sand filtration following conventional sedimentation, (2)dual-media granular filtration following microsand ballasted sedimentation, (3)dual-media granular filtration following magnetite ballasted sedimentation, (4)ultrafiltration following microsand ballasted sedimentation, and (5)ultrafiltration following magentite ballasted sedimentation. Total phosphorus was 1.11mg/L in the secondary effluent and decreased to 0.015mg/L after sedimentation and ultrafiltration. BOD was 9.9mg/L in the secondary effluent and decreased to <1mg/L after the five systems. The pharmaceutical concentrations found in the secondary effluent were 211ng/L trimethoprim, 323ng/L carbamazepine, and 901ng/L sulfamethoxazole. The range of concentrations following tertiary treatment were 160-255ng/L trimethoprim, 302-335ng/L carbamazepine, and 482-792ng/L sulfamethoxazole. Overall, the tertiary sedimentation and filtration systems did not provide enhanced pharmaceutical removal. The results from this study corroborate other research findings, suggesting that rapid rate sand filtration and ultrafiltration may be inadequate for removing trace concentrations of water soluble pharmaceuticals, although phosphorus and BOD removal was >96% and >91%, respectively, comparing secondary and tertiary effluent.

AB The pre-treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation with Fe2+ was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The influence of different crucial parameters such as temperature, reaction time, Fe concentration, hydrogen peroxide excess (HE) and initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) have been evaluated. The optimum conditions for degradation led to COD reductions of up to 80% in only 1 h of treatment. The results showed that WHPO is an effective process for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Fe2+ addition improved COD removal. When reaction temperature is 440 degrees C, reaction time is 4 h, hydrogen peroxide excess is 0.8 and initial COD is 60 000 mg/l, and COD removal increased 11%.

AB Neonicotinoids in aquatic systems have been predominantly associated with agriculture, but some are increasingly being linked to municipal wastewater. Thus, the aim of this work was to understand the municipal wastewater contribution to neonicotinoids in a representative, characterized effluent-dominated temperate-region stream. Our approach was to quantify the spatiotemporal concentrations of imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and transformation product imidacloprid urea: 0.1 km upstream, the municipal wastewater effluent, and 0.1 and 5.1 km downstream from the wastewater outfall (collected twice-monthly for one year under baseflow conditions). Quantified results demonstrated that wastewater effluent was a point-source of imidacloprid (consistently) and clothianidin (episodically), where chronic invertebrate exposure benchmarks were exceeded for imidacloprid (36/52 samples; 3/52 > acute exposure benchmark) and clothianidin (8/52 samples). Neonicotinoids persisted downstream where mass loads were not significantly different than those in the effluent. The combined analysis of neonicotinoid effluent concentrations, instream seasonality, and registered uses in Iowa all indicate imidacloprid, and seasonally clothianidin, were driven by wastewater effluent, whereas thiamethoxam and imidacloprid urea were primarily from upstream non-point sources (or potential in-stream transformation for imidacloprid urea). This is the first study to quantify neonicotinoid persistence in an effluent-dominated stream throughout the year-implicating wastewater effluent as a point-source for imidacloprid (year-round) and clothianidin (seasonal). These findings suggest possible overlooked neonicotinoid indoor human exposure routes with subsequent implications for instream ecotoxicological exposure.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are major sources of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and other chemicals of toxicological concern for the aquatic environment. In the present study, we used an integrated strategy combining passive sampling (Chemcatcher (R)), developmental toxicity, and mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo bioassays to monitor the impacts of a WWTP on a river. In vitro screening revealed the WWTP effluent as a source of estrogen, glucocorticoid, and aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) receptor-mediated activities impacting the downstream river site where significant activities were also measured, albeit to a lesser extent than in the effluent. Effect-directed analysis of the effluent successfully identified the presence of potent estrogens (estrone, 17-ethinylestradiol, and 17-estradiol) and glucocorticoids (clobetasol propionate and fluticasone propionate) as the major contributors to the observed in vitro activities, even though other unidentified active chemicals were likely present. The impact of the WWTP was also assessed using zebrafish embryo assays, highlighting its ability to induce estrogenic response through up-regulation of the aromatase promoter-dependent reporter gene in the transgenic (cyp19a1b-green fluorescent protein [GFP]) zebrafish assay and to generate teratogenic effects at nonlethal concentrations in the zebrafish embryo toxicity test. The present study argues for the use of such an integrated approach, combining passive sampling, bioassays, and effect-directed analysis, to comprehensively identify endocrine active compounds and associated hazards of WTTP effluents.

AB Analytical technology is continuously improving, developing better methods for isolating and concentrating trace compounds in environmental samples. Polycyclic and nitro musks (PNMs) are one group of emerging trace compounds detected in municipal wastewater. Differences in sample storage, preparation, and extraction methods for their measurement have led to variability in results. We analyzed 11 PNMs by GC/MS and compared the results of different storage times and extraction methods (supercritical fluid (SFE) or microwave-assisted (MAE)) for 202 samples of primary sludge, waste activated sludge (WAS), raw sludge, and aerobically/anaerobically digested biosolids collected from Canadian municipal wastewater treatment plants. Sixty-three air-dried :samples were extracted by SEE, and 139 air-dried, centrifuged, or filtered samples were extracted by MAE. The mean Surrogate recoveries were 89%,, (standard deviation (SD) = 11%) for d(10)-anthracene by SFE and 88% (SD = 14%) for d(10)-phenanthrene by MAE. Storage study results showed that PNM concentrations changed by a mean of 7% and 9% for primary sludge and WAS respectively after four weeks and decreased up to 25% after 13.5 months of storage in amber glass containers at -18 degrees C. Air-drying of sludge at room temperature caused losses of about 50% of PNM concentrations compared to centrifugation. The proportions of PNMs present in the liquid phase of sludge samples were less than 5% compared to proportions in the sludge solids. The most complete liquid-solid separation was achieved by filtration of frozen/thawed sludge samples, producing a liquid phase that contained less than 1% of the total musk content of the sample.

AB The efficiency of five organic and five inorganic sorbents in removing 19 organic micropollutants (MPs), phosphorus, nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was tested in a two-week column experiment using household wastewater spiked with pharmaceuticals (n = 6), biocides/pesticides (n = 4), organophosphates (n = 3), a fragrance, a UV-stablizer, a food additive, a rubber additive, a plasticizer and a surfactant. Two types of granular activated carbon (GAC), two types of lignite, a pine bark product, and five mineral-based sorbents were tested. All the organic sorbents except pine bark achieved better removal efficiencies of DOC (on average, 70 +/- 27%) and MPs (93 +/- 11%) than the inorganic materials (DOC: 44 +/- 7% and MPs: 66 +/- 38%). However, the organic sorbents (i.e. GAC and xyloid lignite) removed less phosphorus (46 +/- 18%), while sorbents with a high calcium or iron content (i.e. Polonite (R) and lignite) generally removed phosphorus more efficiently (93 +/- 3%). Ammonium- nitrogen was well removed by sorbents with a pH between 7 and 9, with an average removal of 87%, whereas lignite (pH 4) showed the lowest removal efficiency (50%). Some MPs were well removed by all sorbents (>= 97%) including biocides (hexachlorobenzene, triclosan and terbutryn), organophosphates (tributylphosphate, tris-(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate and triphenylphosphate) and one fragrance (galaxolide). The pesticide 2,6-dichlorobenzamide and the pharmaceutical diclofenac were poorly removed by the pine bark and inorganic sorbents (on average, 4%), while organic sorbents achieved high removal of these chemicals (87%).

AB Pollution of the marine environment has been increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities. The preservation of marine ecosystems as well as the safety of harvested seafood are nowadays a global concern. In the present study, levels of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were assessed in different environmental compartments in the near-shore marine environment of False Bay, Cape Town, South Africa. The study revealed the presence of these persistent chemical compounds in different environmental samples from this location. Diclofenac was the most dominant compound detected, with higher concentration than the other pharmaceutical compounds, as well as being present in almost all the samples from the different sites (seawater, 3.70-4.18 ng/L; sediment, 92.08-171.89 ng/g dry wt; marine invertebrates, 67.67-780.26 ng/g dry wt; seaweed, 101.50-309.11 ng/g dry wt). The accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the different species of organisms reflects the increasing anthropogenic pressure taking place at the sampling sites along the bay, as a result of population growth, resident lifestyle as well as poorly treated sewage effluent discharge from several associated wastewater-treatment plants. The concentration of these contaminants is in the order marine biota > sediments > seawater. The contaminants pose a low acute and chronic risk to the selected trophic levels. A public awareness campaign is needed to reduce the pollution at the source, as well as wastewater discharge limits need to be more stringent. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-21. (c) 2021 SETAC

AB The UPLC MS/MS analysis showed the presence of the two antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry discharges during 3 months; norfloxacin and spiramycin which were quantified with the mean concentrations of 226.7 and 84.2 ng mL(-1), respectively. Sixteen resistant isolates were obtained from the pharmaceutical effluent and identified by sequencing. These isolates belong to different genera, namely Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Delftia, Shewanella, and Rheinheimera. The antibiotic resistance phenotypes of these isolates were determined (27 tested antibiotics-discs). All the studied isolates were found resistant to amoxicillin and gentamicin, and 83.33% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Multiple antibiotic resistances were revealed against beta-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides families. Our overall results suggest that the obtained bacterial isolates may constitute potential candidates for bioremediation and can be useful for biotechnological applications. Genotoxic effects were assessed by a battery of biotests; the pharmaceutical wastewater was genotoxic according to the bacterial Vitotox test and micronuclei test. Genotoxicity was also evaluated by the comet test; the tail DNA damages reached 38 and 22% for concentrated sample (10x) and non-concentrated sample (1x), respectively. However, the histological sections of kidney and liver's mice treated by pharmaceutical effluent showed normal histology and no visible structural effects or alterations as cytolysis, edema, or ulcerative necrosis were observed. Residual antibiotics can reach water environment through wastewater and provoke dissemination of the antibiotics resistance and induce genotoxic effects.

AB Due to their widespread use in human and animal healthcare, antibiotics and other drug residues are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Given their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and public health, the quantification of environmental drug residues has become a necessity. Various analysis techniques have been found to be suitable for reliable detection of such compounds. However, quantification can be difficult because these compounds are present at trace or ultra-trace levels. Consequently, the accuracy of environmental analyses depends on both the efficiency and the robustness of the extraction and quantification method. In this work, an off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS was applied to the simultaneous extraction and quantification of 26 pharmaceutical products, including 18 antibiotics, dissolved in a water phase. Optimal conditions were determined and then applied to assess the contamination level of the targeted drug residues in water collected from four sites in Northern France: a river, the input and output of an aerated lagoon, and a wastewater treatment plant. Drug residues associated with suspended solid matter (SSM) were also quantified in this work using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) combined with an on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS system in order to complete an assessment of the degree of total background pollution.

AB For the foreseeable future, industrial water demand will grow much faster than agriculture. The demand together with the urgency of wastewater treatment, will pose big challenges for most developing countries. We applied the bibliometric analysis combined with social network analysis and S-curve technique to quantitatively analyze 9413 publications related to industrial wastewater treatment in the Scientific Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases from 1998 to 2019. The results showed that: (1) Publications on industrial wastewater treatment have increased from 120 in 1998 to 895 in 2019 with a steady annual increment rate, and researchers have focused more on the application and optimization of existing technologies. (2) China had the highest number of publications (n = 1651, 19.66% of global output) and was a core country in the international cooperation network, whereas the United States and European countries produced higher quality papers. (3) By analyzing the co-occurrence and clusters of keywords and comparing three wastewater treatment categories (physical, chemical, biological), adsorption (n = 1277), oxidation (n = 1085) and activated sludge process (n = 1288) were the top three techniques. Researchers have shifted their focus to treatment technologies for specific wastewater type, such as textile wastewater, pulp and paper wastewater, and pharmaceutical wastewater. The S-curve from articles indicates that physical and chemical treatment technologies are attached with great potential in the near future, especially adsorption and advanced oxidation, while the biological treatment technologies are approaching to the saturation stage. Different pattern is observed for the S-curve derived from patents, which stressed the limited achievement until now and further exploration in the field application for the three treatment categories. Our analysis provides information of technology development landscape and future opportunities, which is useful for decision makers and researchers who are interested in this area.

AB Treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a real challenge for wastewater engineers. In this study, a pilot-scale system including an external loop airlift membrane bioreactor (ELAMBR) was applied for treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater. The performance of this system was evaluated in removal of acetaminophen as the main pollutant of a pharmaceutical wastewater. A conventional activated sludge (CAS process) laboratory system was used in parallel with this system to compare both systems in regard to their ability for acetaminophen removal. The performance of the ELAMBR system was monitored for approximately one month to investigate the long-term operational stability of the system and possible effects of solids retention time on the efficiency of removal of acetaminophen. The removal efficiency was significantly higher in the ELAMBR system than the CAS process. 100% of the acetaminophen was removed after 2 days in this system. The results also showed that initial concentration of acetaminophen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) are the most effective parameters in removal of a pollutant such as acetaminophen. This study demonstrates the usefulness of ELAMBR system for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with the advantages such as: (i) simple operation and maintenance, (ii) efficient removal of pharmaceutical pollutant and COD and (iii) low-energy consumption.

AB There have been few reports in the peer-reviewed literature on the levels of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in municipal wastewater from the Caribbean region. In this study of wastewater collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Barbados, caffeine and ibuprofen were detected at A mu g/L concentrations, whereas two steroid hormones (i.e. androstenedione, estrone) and several prescription pharmaceuticals were detected at ng/L concentrations. Among drugs of abuse, benzoylecgonine (i.e. metabolite of cocaine), MDMA (i.e. Ecstasy) and MDA (i.e. 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) were present at the highest concentrations in untreated wastewater. Overall, these data show that there is potential impact in the marine environment in Barbados from CECs discharged into the coastal zone.

AB Occurrence and fate of 17 antibiotics were investigated in the aqueous phase of river water under different hydrological conditions at 5 sampling locations in the Seine River inner estuary. The target analytes belonged to 4 groups: quinolones, sulfonamides, nitro-imidazoles and diaminopyrimidines. This six-month survey (from January to June 2006) showed that different compounds were occurring at individual concentrations reaching 544 ng L-1 (sulfamethoxazole). All 17 compounds were detected at least once in the survey. Sulfamethoxazole was detected in every sample, and showed the highest concentrations. Norfloxacin and flumequine were found to be the most ubiquitous quinolones, with detection frequencies of 33 and 75% respectively at the most contaminated site (Poses). Investigations concerning the origins of this contamination were made by means of a longitudinal profile along the Seine River between Paris and Poses. It showed large inputs of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole from wastewater treatment plants, with an increase in norfloxacin and sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 84% and 70% respectively, both reaching 155 ng L-1 in the river, downstream from a wastewater outlet. The detected compounds showed different dissipation patterns and behaviours under different hydrological conditions. Higher inputs of norfloxacin were found in low flow conditions, which were rapidly attenuated along the stream. In contrast, sulfamethoxazole inputs were increasing in high flow conditions, and dissipation of this compound was found to be slow. Similar behaviour was observed for the synergist trimethoprim. Flumequine was also frequently detected and its input increased during flood events. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the decrease water resources in the past decade, research for rational solutions on water use has become a worldwide concern. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, and when the soil moisture level is not assured of precipitation, it is supplemented by irrigation. In the current context of climate change, and consequently the arid territories growth, the researchers are looking for solutions to rational water consumption, and equally to cover the deficit of water in agriculture. In recent years, the solution of wastewater capitalization in agriculture is often promoted, but chemical and bacteriological composition of wastewater can seriously affect both soil quality and of the products obtained (animals, humans). In this context, the paper aims at analyzing some effects on soil structure resulted from the use of two types of wastewater in irrigation, respectively primary and and tertiary effluents.

AB A methodology was developed for the assessment and comparison of the environmental impact of two alternative pharmaceutical prescriptions. This methodology provides physicians with the opportunity to include environmental considerations in their choice of prescription. A case study with the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin at three locations throughout Europe showed that the preference for a pharmaceutical might show spatial variation, i.e. comparison of two pharmaceuticals might yield different results when prescribed at different locations. This holds when the comparison is based on both the impact on the aquatic environment and the impact on human health. The relative impacts of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin on human health were largely determined by the local handling of secondary sludge, agricultural disposal practices, the extent of secondary sewage treatment, and local food consumption patterns. The relative impacts of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin on the aquatic environment were mostly explained by the presence of specific sewage treatment techniques, as effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the most relevant emission pathway for the aquatic environment.

AB In this work, the combination of advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) and direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was investigated for the treatment of municipal wastewater collected from the sec-ondary clarifier of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). Average removal efficiencies of the 12 micropollutants present in the wastewater samples were higher than 95 % with ozonation (O-3) and photolytic ozonation (UV/O-3), whereas only near 50 % of removal efficiency was achieved with UV-peroxidation (UV/H2O2). When the ozone-based processes were combined with DCMD, the concen-tration of these micropollutants were below the detection limits in the respective permeate, increasing the quality of the treated water. However, the permeate fluxes in DCMD were remarkably higher when the wastewater was pre-treated with UV/H2O2 instead of O-3, most probably due to the better disinfection achieved by UV/H2O2. It was also confirmed that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the wastewater strongly affects the permeate fluxes achieved by DCMD. In this regard, the combination of the oxida-tion and membrane separation processes is more appropriate for wastewaters with low DOC contents (< 15 mg L-1).

AB In recent years, pharmaceutical products have been causing a serious environmental problem in hospital wastewater and water purification plants. The elimination of these pollutants is difficult due to their resistance to biological degradation. Paracetamol has been detected in higher concentrations in hospital wastewater than in other buildings. Activated carbons are a good material for removing paracetamol from hospital wastewater. One of the starting materials to obtain activated carbons is kenaf, which is an easy plant to cultivate. To study the elimination of paracetamol from hospital wastewater by activated carbon, the textural and chemical characterization of activated carbon, as well as the kinetic study and the analysis of the paracetamol adsorption mechanism by the adsorbent, have been carried out. The activated carbon samples studied are micro-mesoporous, with high specific surface values. The chemical composition with presence of oxygen groups favours the adsorption process. The adsorption kinetics were adjusted to a pseudo-second order model. The adsorption mechanism followed the intraparticular diffusion model, carried out in two stages: a fast first stage on the surface of the adsorbent and a slow one inside the pore. Based on the kinetic study, the use of this type of carbon is a good application for the removal of paracetamol from hospital wastewater.

AB Electrochemical oxidation effects of the tube type electrolysis module system were investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater. The tube type electrolysis module consisted of a rod anode and an outer tube cathode. Materials used for the anode were titanium electroplated with RuO2 and IrO2 respectively. Stainless steel was used for the cathode. Chlorate production was one of major factors in electrochemical oxidation of tube type electrolysis module system used in this research. Chlorine conversion from chloride to chlorate occurred at a rate of 66.8 mg/L for the textile wastewater and 75.7 mg/L for the pharmaceutical wastewater over a 60 min retention period. Chlorine gas concentration was 360 ppm for the textile wastewater and 500 ppm for the pharmaceutical wastewater after a 60 min electrolysis period. Specific energy consumption was measured during the electrolytic process with the Ti/RuO2 anode and the Ti/IrO2 anode. The range of specific energy consumption was 0.064-0.108 kW h/gCOD(Cr) for the Ti/RuO2 anode over the variation range of hydraulic retention time. The Ti/RuO2 anode had advantages in the electrolytic wastewater treatment with lower specific energy consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the applicability of different techniques for fluorescence excitation/emission matrices data interpretations, including peak-picking method, fluorescence regional integration and PARAFAC modelling, to act as surrogates in predicting emerging trace organic compounds (ETOrCs) removal during conventional wastewater treatments that usually comprise primary and secondary treatments. Results showed that fluorescence indexes developed using alternative methodologies but indicative of a same dissolved organic matter component resulted in similar predictions of the removal of the target compounds. The peak index defined by the excitation/emission wavelength positions (lambda(ex)/lambda(em)) 225/290 nm and related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine-like fluorescence was determined to be a particularly suitable surrogate for monitoring ETOrCs that had very high removal rates (average removal >70%) (i.e., triclosan, caffeine and ibuprofen). The peak index defined by lambda(ex)/lambda(em) =245/440 nm and the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 245, 350/450, both identified as humic-like fluorescence, were found remarkably well correlated with ETOrCs such as atenolol, naproxen and gemfibrozil that were moderately removed (51-70% average removal). Finally, the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima lambda(ex)/lambda(ex) =<240, 315/380 identified as microbial humic-like fluorescence was the only index correlated with the removal of the antibiotic trimethoprim (average removal 68%).

AB A wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are present in the environment, and many of their adverse effects are unknown. The environmental risk assessment of 26 PPCPs of relevant consumption and occurrence in the aquatic environment in Spain was accomplished in this research. Based on the ecotoxicity values obtained by bioluminescence and respirometry assays and by predictions using the US EPA ecological structure-activity relationship (ECOSAR (TM)), the compounds were classified following the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. According to the criteria of the European Medicines Agency, the real risk of impact of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the aquatic environment was predicted. In at least two ecotoxicity tests, 65.4 % of the PPCPs under study showed high toxicity or were harmful to aquatic organisms. The global order of the species' sensitivity to the PPCPs considered was as follows: Vibrio fischeri (5 min) > Vibrio fischeri (15 min) > algae > crustaceans > fish > biomass of WWTP. Acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clofibrate, ibuprofen, omeprazole, triclosan, parabens and 1,4-benzoquinone showed some type of risk for the aquatic environments and/or for the activated sludge of WWTPs. Development of acute and chronic ecotoxicity data, the determination of predicted and measured environmental concentrations of PPCPs, the inclusion of metabolites and transformation products and the evaluation of mixtures of these compounds will allow further improvements of the results of the ERAs and, finally, to efficiently identify the compounds that could affect the environment.

AB The elimination of six acidic pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and naproxen) in a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using an activated sludge system and membrane bioreactors (MBRs) was investigated by using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system for measurement of the compounds. Limited information is available for some of the tested pharmaceuticals at present. Solid retention times (SRTs) of the WWTP and the two MBRs were 7, 15, and 65 days, respectively. The elimination rates varied from compound to compound. The MBRs exhibited greater elimination rates for the examined pharmaceuticals than did the real plant. Dependency of the elimination rates of the pharmaceuticals on SRTs was obvious; the MBR operated with a longer SRT of 65 days clearly showed better performance than did the MBR with a shorter SRT of 15 days. The difference between the two MBRs was particularly significant in terms of elimination of ketoprofen and diclofenac. Measurements of the amounts of adsorbed pharmaceuticals on the sludge and aerobic batch elimination experiments were carried out to investigate the elimination pathways of the pharmaceuticals. Results of the batch elimination tests revealed that the sludges in the MBRs had large specific sorption capacities mainly due to their large specific surface areas. Despite the sorption capacities of sludges, the main mechanism of elimination of the pharmaceuticals in the investigated processes was found to be biodegradation. Biodegradation of diclofenac, which has been believed to be refractory to biodegradation, seemed to occur very slowly.

AB The study reports the biodegradability enhancement of pharmaceutical wastewater along with COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) color and toxicity removal via O-3, O-3/Fe2+, O-3/nZVI (nano zero valent iron) processes. Nano catalytic ozonation process (O-3/nZVI) showed the highest biodegradability (BI- BOD5/COD) enhancement of pharmaceutical wastewater up to 0.63 from 0.18 of control with a COD, color and toxicity removal of 62.3%, 93% and 82% respectively. The disappearance of the corresponding Fourier transform infrared (MR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) peaks after pretreatment indicated the degradation or transformation of the refractory organic compounds to more biodegradable organic compounds. The subsequent aerobic degradation study of pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater resulted in biodegradation rate enhancement of 5.31, 2.97, and 122 times for O-3/nZVIO(3)/Fe2+ and O-3 processes respectively. Seed germination test using spinach (Spinacia oleracea) seeds established the toxicity removal of pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Earlier investigations on biological methods of wastewater treatment have revealed that algal based wastewater treatment could be a green, cost effective and efficient approach for the removal of heavy metals. So, this study aimed to assess the potential of microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa for remediation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn, and Ni) from varying concentration (25%, 50%, 75 and 100%) of wastewater collected from Common Effluent Treatment Plant. Heavy metals such as Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn, and Ni have been removed significantly from the wastewater, with percentage removal ranging from 73%, 60%, 75%, 66%, 87%, 83%, and 74% with 50% test solution, 57%, 59%, 70%, 56%, 72%, 66%, and 62% with 75% test solution, and 47%, 55%, 56%, 71%, 61%, 77%, and 72% with 100% test solution respectively. Studies on biochemical assay (protein, carbohydrate, and pigment) of Chlorella pyrenoidosa were also an important part of the present investigation to understand the interaction of heavy metals with algal biochemical compounds using Pearson correlation co-efficient. Biomass grown in CETP wastewater can be used for synthesis of various fruitful value-added end products like bio-diesel, pharmaceutical products, cosmetic products, bio-adsorbent etc.

AB For a novel approach of resource-efficient water reuse, a municipal wastewater treatment plant was extended at pilot scale for advanced wastewater treatment, i.e., ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration, and a hydroponic system for reclaimed water driven lettuce cultivation. The treatment specific wastewater lines with the corresponding lettuce plants, differentiated into roots and shoots, were monitored for priority wastewater micropollutants, i.e., acesulfame (sweetener), caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole with acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (human pharmaceuticals), 1H-benzotriazole, and 4/5-methylbenzotriazole (industrial chemicals). As clearly demonstrated, conventional tertiary treatment could not efficiently clean up wastewater. Removal efficiencies ranged from 3% for carbamazepine to 100% for ibuprofen. The resulting pollution of the hydroponic water lines led to the accumulation of acesulfame, carbamazepine, and diclofenac in lettuce root systems at 32.0, 69.5, and 135 mu g kg(-1) and in the uptake of acesulfame and carbamazepine into lettuce shoots at 23.4 and 120 mu g kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. In contrast, both advanced treatment technologies when operating under optimized conditions achieved removal efficiencies of > 90% also for persistent micropollutants. Minimizing the pollution of reclaimed water thus met one relevant need for hydroponic lettuce cultivation.

AB We assess how different micropollutants and microplastics, connected to wastewater are introduced into the Baltic Sea. The relevance of untreated wastewater, treated wastewater, treated and untreated rain runoff, as well as combined sewer overflow (CSO), is assessed in respect to mass balance, as well as relative inflows of micropollutants and -plastics into the Baltic Sea. To achieve this, modelling based on data on exemplary sewer systems and measured micropollutant concentrations in the single sources were used. Most compounds reach the receiving Baltic Sea via treated wastewater. A few exceptions are compounds that are removed to a very high extent in wastewater treatment plants. For these compounds, the emissions with stormwater (e.g., terbutryn) or untreated wastewater (e.g., triclosan) are dominating. Additionally, compounds that are discharged with the water that is running off urban surfaces are introduced into marine areas via rain runoff. These data are used to forecast a total mass load and concentrations that can be expected in the Baltic Sea. Massloads are expected to be between 0.1 and 5.9 t/a for triclosan and TCPP (iris (2-chloropropyl) phosphate) and 0.2 t/a for microplastic particles. The expected concentrations in open Baltic Sea waters range from 0.01 to 26 ng/L.

AB Diatoms are a type of microalgae with diverse capabilities which make them useful for multiple applications. The abundance of diatoms in water bodies facilitates the removal of pollutants from wastewater originating from different industries, such as agriculture and other anthropogenic sources. The unique photosynthetic, cellular and metabolic characteristics of diatoms allows them to utilize pollutants like nitrate, iron, phosphate, molybdenum, silica, and heavy metals, such as copper, cadmium, chromium, lead, etc., which make diatoms a good option for wastewater treatment. In addition, the biomass produced by diatoms growth on wastewaters has diverse applications and can, therefore, be valuable. This review focusses on the unique capabilities of diatoms for wastewater remediation and the capture of carbon dioxide, concomitant with the generation of valuable products. Diatom biorefinery can be a sustainable solution to wastewater management, and the biomass obtained from treatment can be turned into biofuels, biofertilizers, nutritional supplements for animal production, and used for pharmaceutical applications containing bioactive compounds like EPA, DHA and pigments such as fucoxanthin.<bold> </bold>

AB Ozone aeration may significantly change nitrogen form and availability in anaerobic swine wastewater, hence it is important to characterize the effect of ozone on nitrogen. In order to study the influences of ozone and aeration time on the nitrogen transformation and availability in anaerobic swine wastewater, an indoor experiment was conducted with self-designed ozone producer apparatus under five different durations of ozone aeration, 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively. Water samples were collected in different aeration time and different nitrogen forms were determined. The results showed that different durations of ozone aeration remarkably affected nitrogen contents and formations in wastewater system. Specifically, the content of total nitrogen, soluble Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) significantly declined by 10.11%, 6.75%, 17.90%, 98.81% and 89.33% (p < 0.05), respectively. On the contrary, the content of nitrate nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen increased by 613.85% and 459.85% at the end of 60 min (p < 0.05), respectively. The results suggested nitrogen form transformation and nutrient concentration change should be taken into consideration before reusing swine wastewater in irrigation.

AB Hematological studies were carried out to investigate the possible deleterious effects of pharmaceutical wastewater according to the circadian dosing-time on albino mice. Pharmaceutical wastewater of 10 ml/kg was injected to different groups of animals by i.p. route at two different circadian stages 9 and 17 h after light onset, i.e. HALO corresponding, respectively, to times of best tolerance and maximum toxicity. The samples were measured for changes in the hematological parameters, such as the red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT), the hemoglobin concentration (Hb), and the erythrocyte indices: the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at 17 HALO induced a maximum decrease in RBC cells (-29.84% vs. -17.6% at 9 HALO) and in Hb concentration (-27% vs. -20% at 9 HALO). However, administration of pharmaceutical wastewater at 17HALO induced a maximum increase in MCV value (+37.26% vs. +16%. at 9 HALO) and PLT twofold higher than the control vs. only +18% at 9 HALO. Wastewater treatment at 9 and 17HALO resulted in a slight decrease (approximate to -5%) in hematocrit percentage, but not statistically significant. WBC cells were reduced significantly (p < 0.01) by -53.8% in mice treated at 9 HALO and were increased significantly (p < 0.01) by +21% in mice treated at 17HALO compared to control. The administration of pharmaceutical wastewater induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in PLT counts at 9 HALO (+18%). While the rate of PLT was increased twofold in mice treated at 17 HALO. The data indicate that the pharmaceutical wastewater-induced hematological toxicity was higher, when it is administered in the middle of the dark span coinciding with time of maximum lethality and ataxia.

AB In this paper, supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is applied to treat analgin pharmaceutical wastewater. The results show that temperature, residence time and oxidant excess (OE) can improve X-COD (COD removal). The OE and residence time markedly influences X-COD at higher reaction temperatures (>510 degrees C). Increasing the preheating rate for the X-COD improvement in SCWO is significant. X-COD and X-TN. (total nitrogen removal) are 99.53 and 87.81%. More than 93.1 wt.% total organic carbon (TOC) and 87.81 wt.% total nitrogen in the analgin pharmaceutical wastewater are converted into CO2 and N-2 under the above conditions, respectively.

AB Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are a very attractive option for the treatment of hospital wastewater and elimination of pharmaceuticals in high density urban areas. The present investigation showed that, depending on the substance, between 19% and 94% of the level of antibiotics found in the environment originate from hospitals. Because of their ecotoxic potential, hospital wastewaters can have a significant impact on the environment. The segregation of these wastewaters and their separate treatment at the source can reduce the entry of drugs in waterways and enable water reuse after adequate polishing treatment processes.

AB The correction factor (CF) is a critical parameter in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) that significantly influences the accuracy of the final consumption estimates. However, most CFs have been derived from a few old pharmacokinetic studies and should be re-evaluated and refined to improve the accuracy of the WBE approach. This study aimed to review and estimate the CFs for atenolol, carbamazepine, and naproxen for WBE using the daily mass loads of those pharmaceuticals in wastewater and their corresponding dispensed prescription data in Australia. Influent wastewater samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants serving approximately 24% of the Australian population and annual national dispensed prescription data. The estimated CFs for atenolol and carbamazepine are 1.37 (95% CI: 1.17-1.66) and 8.69 (95% CI: 7.66-10.03), respectively. Due to significant over-the-counter sales of naproxen, a reliable CF could not be estimated based on prescription statistics. Using an independent dataset of 186 and 149 wastewater samples collected in an urban catchment in 2011 and 2012, WBE results calculated using the new CFs matched well with the dispensed data for atenolol and carbamazepine in the catchment area.

AB This study uses 4,4'-dinitrostilberie-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNS) wastewater to produce paramycin (4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), an antitubercular agent and important pharmaceutical intermediate. The high concentrations of aromatic sulfonic acids contained in the wastewater, derived from a DNS production facility, have been transformed to paramycin in yields of more than 85%. This waste-disposal strategy, which combines oxidation using NaClO, reduction using iron powder, and subsequent alkaline fusion with NaOH, has been proven to be successful in dealing with ton-scale DNS wastewater. Compared with common treatment methods, which usually involve degrading the compounds, this new method recycles most of the aromatic sulfonic acids in the wastewater to produce paramycin. This effectively solve:; the associated environment problems associated with DNS wastewater and is also potentially profitable. The present approach could also lead to alternative solutions for dealing with other industrial wastewaters generated from oxidative coupling reactions of nitro-substituted toluenes to the corresponding substituted stilbenes.

AB Sub-optimal adherence to pharmacological therapy is one of the main reasons for poor effectiveness, reducing the patient's quality of life and affecting health-care economics. This study investigated the possibility for a wastewater-based epidemiology approach to assess the overall adherence of a population to some pharmacological therapies in a defined area. We selected specific active ingredients and their main urinary metabolites (biomarkers) according to the best practice protocol available and we measured them for the first time in urban wastewater. We conducted this first case study in Italy, considering the whole country and two Italian regions by sampling for five days six cities from north to south. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the biomarkers in raw wastewater, developing and validating specific analytical methods. We used concentrations measured in influent wastewater, together with a careful review of the excretion profile of the active ingredients selected, to back-calculate consumption (measured consumptions - MC) which were then compared with consumptions calculated from medical prescriptions (expected consumptions - EC) reported annually by the Italian Medicine Agency. In general there was a rough correlation between MC and EC, with ratios sometimes close to unity and always within a 0.3-3.0 range. Interpretation of the results suffers some biases, which are case-by-case discussed in detail, but inclusion of measurements of the urinary metabolites together with the active ingredients gave a fuller understanding of the results.

AB The seasonal sunlight-induced photodegradation of seven emerging contaminants (ECs) in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon was examined in a lab-scale study over a year. There were obvious seasonal trends for the degradation rates of all the ECs in both ultrapure water and lagoon wastewater matrices with strong correlations (R-2 = 0.65-0.90) between sunlight irradiance and their degradation rates in pure water, indicating the dominant influence of natural sunlight intensity. This suggests the importance of recording light source conditions for the purposes of data interpretation and modelling of sunlight-induced photolysis. It was demonstrated that photolysis of these ECs was likely to occur only within the first 10 cm of the lagoon surface. Strongly temperature dependent photodegradation was observed for the five ECs which primarily underwent indirect photolysis in the lagoon wastewater, and activation energy values (which could be used for simulation of the photodegradation process) were obtained for these compounds. The quantum yields of the ECs were determined under wastewater-relevant pH conditions. The APEX environmental model was adjusted to simulate the photodegradation of these ECs in the lagoon wastewater. The predicted results were largely in agreement with the seasonal measurements, with some overestimated photodegradation rates obtained for winter, suggesting that temperature should be included as a factor for modelling the photolysis of ECs. These results indicate that there is potential to establish a model to predict the photodegradation of a wide range of ECs in wastewater treatment lagoons to facilitate risk assessment of the treated wastewater.

AB Hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) is a favorable technique for the pertraction of metal ions, especially at very low metal concentration. In this work, the pertraction of silver ions from acidic pharmaceutical wastewater via HFSLM was investigated. Pharmaceutical wastewater containing 30 mg/dm(3) of silver ions and 120 mg/dm3 of ferric ions was subjected to HFSLM as a feed solution. LIX 84-I dissolved in organic solvent together with Na(2)S(2)0=O-3.5H(2)O solution was selected for use as a liquid membrane and a receiving solution, respectively. The influence of ferric ions on the pertraction of silver ions was studied firstly using wastewater with normal ferric ion concentration and secondly using wastewater with ferric ion precipitation by phosphoric acid solution. The highest pertraction of silver ions was achieved by using 0.1 M of LIX 84-I and 0.5 M of Na2S2O3.5H(2)O solution at pH of feed and receiving solutions of 3.5 and 2. The flow rates of feed and receiving solutions were 0.2 dm(3)/min. 0.6 mg/dm(3) of silver ions that remained in the wastewater was below the mandatory discharge limit. No effect of normal ferric ion concentration in the wastewater on silver ion pertraction was observed. The crucial parameters were defined to confirm the efficiency and reliability of the system. Finally, the controlling transport regime of silver ion pertraction across HFSLM was determined by the diffusion flux and reaction flux models. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Land application of wastewater effluent is beneficial for recharging groundwater aquifers and avoiding direct pollutant discharges to surface waters. However, the fate of non-regulated organic wastewater pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), in such wastewater reuse systems is understudied. Here, a 14-month study (October 2016 through December 2017) was conducted to evaluate the fate and potential risks of seven commonly used PPCPs in a local wastewater treatment plant (WWFP) and from 13 groundwater monitoring wells at a spray-irrigation site where effluent has been spray-irrigated since the early 1980s. Acetaminophen and trimethoprim were the most frequently detected (93%) PPCPs in WWI? influent, while in the effluent, caffeine and trimethoprim were detected most frequently (70%). Wastewater treatment generally reduced concentrations of acetaminophen and caffeine by >88%: however, some compounds had low removal or were present at higher concentrations in the effluent compared with influent (e.g. naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ofloxacin). Seasonal trends were observed, with higher PPCP concentrations in the WWTP influent and effluent in the winter. Risk calculations conducted on the wastewater effluent suggest that the risk posed by PPCPs that persisted in the effluent are medium to high to aquatic organisms. Detection frequencies of PPCPs were lower in groundwater samples compared to the effluent, with sulfamethoxazole (40%) and caffeine (32%) as the most frequently detected compounds. Similarly, average concentrations of PPCPs in groundwater were found to be nearly two orders of magnitude lower than concentrations in the effluent Minimal seasonal influence was observed for groundwater samples. Human health risk assessments indicate that concentrations in groundwater, which is used as a drinking water source, appear to pose minimal risk. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmaceutical pollutants in urban wastewater can be reduced during algal cultivation. A mixed population of wild freshwater green algal species was grown on urban wastewater influent in a 650 L photobioreactor under natural light and with the addition of flue gases. Removal efficiencies were very high (> 90 %), moderate (50-90 %), low (10-50 %), and very low or non-quantifiable (< 10 %) for 9, 14, 11, and 18 pharmaceuticals, respectively, over a 7-day period. High reduction was found in the following pharmaceuticals: the beta-blockers atenolol, bispropol, and metoprolol; the antibiotic clarithromycine; the antidepressant bupropion; the muscle relaxant atracurium; hypertension drugs diltiazem and terbutaline used to relive the symptoms of asthma. Regression analysis did not detect any relationship between the reduction in pharmaceutical contents and light intensity reaching the water surface of the algal culture. However, the reduction was positively correlated with light intensity inside the culture and stronger when data collected during the night were excluded. Algae cultivation can remove partially or totally pharmaceutical pollutants from urban wastewater, and this opens up new possibilities for treating urban wastewater.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) in wastewater have recently attracted the attention of researchers as they pose significant risks to human health and wildlife. This paper presents the state-of-art technologies used to remove ECs from wastewater through a comprehensive review. It also highlights the challenges faced by existing EC removal technologies in wastewater treatment plants and provides future research directions. Many treatment technologies like biological, chemical, and physical approaches have been advanced for removing various ECs. However, currently, no individual technology can effectively remove ECs, whereas hybrid systems have often been found to be more efficient. A hybrid technique of ozonation accompanied by activated carbon was found significantly effective in removing some ECs, particularly pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Despite the lack of extensive research, nanotechnology may be a promising approach as nanomaterial incorporated technologies have shown potential in removing different contaminants from wastewater. Nevertheless, most existing technologies are highly energy and resource-intensive as well as costly to maintain and operate. Besides, most proposed advanced treatment technologies are yet to be evaluated for large-scale practicality. Complemented with techno-economic feasibility studies of the treatment techniques, comprehensive research and development are therefore necessary to achieve a full and effective removal of ECs by wastewater treatment plants.

AB The present study investigates the effect of addition of calcium hypochlorite in the titanium dioxide (TiO2) mediated degradation of bio-recalcitrant wastewater from pharmaceutical industry. The degradation studies were carried out in photoreactor irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light at 365 nm under slurry mode. The reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was estimated as an index of degradation. The influence of process parameters viz., catalyst dose, pH, oxidant concentration and source of light (UV/Solar) on degradation was studied. The degradation efficiency was also compared with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which has been widely used as an oxidant in the photocatalytic systems. The degradation efficiency of wastewater with oxidant alone was found to be comparatively less. Degradation of 67% was achieved in UV/TiO2 system at optimized conditions (3.0 g/L TiO2, pH 4) after 7 h of irradiation. The use of calcium hypochlorite (0.25 g/L) along with TiO2 (3.0 g/L) at pH 4 has been found to increase the degradation efficiency of wastewater up to 82% which would facilitate the recycling of wastewater from pharmaceutical industry.

AB The presence of emergent antibiotics, in livestock wastewater may affect constructed wetlands (CWs) performance in the removal of other pollutants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of two antibiotics commonly used in livestock industry, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, on metal removal by CWs.
   Microcosms (0.4 m x 0.3 m x 0.3 m), simulating CWs, were constructed with Phragmites australis to treat livestock wastewater spiked or not with 100 mu g/L of enrofioxacin or ceftiofur (individually or in mixture). Wastewater was treated during 20 one-week cycles. After one-week cycle wastewater was removed and replaced by new wastewater (with or without spiking). At weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20, treated wastewater was analysed to determine the removal rates of metals (Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) and of each antibiotic. At weeks 1, 8 and 20 portions of the plant root substrate were collected and metals determined. At the end of the experiment metal levels were also determined in plant tissues.
   Removal rate of Fe from wastewater was 99%. Removal rates of Cu and Zn were higher than 85% and 89%, respectively, whereas for Mn removal rates up to 75% were obtained. In general, no significant differences were observed through time in the removals of the different metals, indicating that the systems maintained their functionality during the experimental period. Antibiotics did not interfere with the system depuration capacity, in terms of metals removals from wastewater, and ceftiofur even promoted metal uptake by P. australis.
   Therefore, CWs seem to be a valuable alternative to remove pollutants, including antibiotics and metals, from livestock wastewaters, reducing the risk the release of these wastewaters might pose into the environment, although more research should be conducted with other antibiotics in CWs.

AB The antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has received recent attention due to the potential use as a first-line defense against H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses. Research has shown that oseltamivir is not removed during conventional wastewater treatments, thus having the potential to enter surface water bodies.
   A series of laboratory experiments investigated the fate and the removal of oseltamivir in two surface water ecosystems of Japan and in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Northern Italy. Persistence of oseltamivir in surface water ranged from non-detectable degradation to a half-life of 53 d. After 40 d, <3% of radiolabeled oseltamivir evolved as (CO2)-C-14. The presence of sediments (5%) led to a significant increase of oseltamivir degradation and mineralization rates. A more intense mineralization was observed in samples of the wastewater treatment plant when applying a long incubation period (40 d). More precisely, 76% and 37% of the initial radioactivity applied as C-14-oseltamivir was recovered as (CO2)-C-14 from samples of the biological tank and effluent water, respectively. Two bacterial strains growing on oseltamivir as sole carbon source were isolated and used for its removal from synthetic medium and environmental samples, including surface water and wastewater. Inoculation of water and wastewater samples with the two oseltamivir-degrading strains showed that mineralization of oseltamivir was significantly higher in both inoculated water and wastewater, than in uninoculated controls. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis showed that Tamiflu would not affect the microbial population of surface water and wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ID TRAMETES-VERSICOLOR
AB Fungi have been shown to be promising candidates to be used in removal of pharmaceutical compounds during wastewater treatment processes. However, fungal growth, including removal efficiency, can be affected by several factors, such as temperature and the pH. The ability of fungal isolates to grow in the presence of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was tested. Removal efficiency results indicated that a fungal isolate of Aspergillus luchuensis can completely (>99.9%) remove diclofenac from a synthetic wastewater media without a pH correction within 10 days of incubation. Furthermore, the results of the biosorption test for A. luchuensis indicate that this isolate uses the biosorption mechanism as a strategy to remove diclofenac. Finally, the results demonstrate that A. luchuensis can remove >98% of diclofenac in non-sterile wastewater without a pH correction immediately after biomass inoculation on biofilm carriers while Trametes versicolor requires an incubation period of at least 24 h to completely remove diclofenac. Therefore, this isolate is a promising candidate for use in removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater with typical pH 7.8, minimizing a requirement of the pH correction.

AB Different advanced oxidation processes (AOP) were developed for the treatment of highly loaded wastewater streams. Optimisation of removal and improvement of efficiency were carried out on a laboratory, semiworks and pilot plant scale. The persistent cytostatic drug cyclophosphamide was selected as a reference substance regarding elimination and evaluation of the various oxidation processes because of its low degradability rate. The investigated processes are cost-efficient and suitable regarding the treatment of wastewater streams since they lead to efficient elimination of antibiotics and antineoplastics. A total reduction of toxicity was proven by means of the umuC-test. However, in order to reduce pharmaceuticals from the water cycle, it must be considered that the input of more than 80% of the pharmaceuticals entering wastewater treatment systems results from private households. Therefore, advanced technologies should also be installed at wastewater treatment plants.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are generated through complex manufacturing processes that contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents, and are usually characterized by a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), toxicity, and refractory compounds. In this paper, wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) was adopted to treat pharmaceutical wastewater. Central composite design, an experimental design for response surface methodology (RSM), was used to create a set of 30 experimental runs needed for optimizing operating conditions. The experimental results show that WPO could effectively reduce COD by 97.5% at optimum conditions: temperature is 260 degrees C, H2O2 excess (HE) is 0, the initial concentration of pharmaceutical wastewater is 45,000 mg/L, and reaction time is 10 mm. WPO process is possibly suitable for a primary treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater. Response surface methodology (RSM) could be effectively adopted to optimize the operating multifactors in a complex WPO process.

AB The stabilities of the bacterial community structures supported by seven full-scale biological reactors treating pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Effluent quality from this treatment process was consistently high with respect to BOD5 (<30 mg l(-1)), soluble COD (< 500 mg l(-1)). and total ammonia (<5 mg l(-1) as N) concentrations. Long-term community structure stability was studied by comparing the similarity of PCR-DGGE fingerprints from samples collected 87 days apart between which the influent wastewater characteristics were relatively stable. The Dice index (C-s) of similarity was moderately high for the first four reactors (C-s = 0.61-0.77) and very high for the last three reactors (C-s = 0.89-0.91). Short-term community structure stability was studied by comparing PCR-DGGE fingerprints from samples collected 15 days apart between which the influent wastewater characteristics changed significantly, while the effluent quality remained consistently high, The bacterial community composition of each of the seven bioreactors showed a moderate community shift (C-s = 0.70-0.76). Short-term variability in influent wastewater composition, therefore, affected a greater community shift than did long-term operation treating a wastewater of relatively consistent composition. These results indicate that functionally stable wastewater treatment bioreactors have stable microbial community structures under normal operating conditions but are able to adapt in response to perturbations to sustain high effluent quality.

AB Organosilicon wastewater, generally contains plentiful silicone polymers, high salinity and high chemical oxygen demand (COD), and therefore, has great impact on the environment. This study explored the degradation of organosilicon wastewater by UV-based advanced oxidation processes: UV/H2O2, UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) and UV/peroxymonosulfate (PMS). At natural pH of wastewater and 100 mM of oxidant concentration, UV/PDS achieved a higher COD removal (90.6%) than UV/PMS (80.8%) after a 240 min reaction time, whereas only half time was required for UV/H2O2 to reach nearly the same COD removal (89.7%) as UV/PDS. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis indicated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were the main reactive species for COD removal. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to monitor the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in the organosilicon wastewater. The results illustrated that the tyrosine-, tryptophan- and humic-like substances were three components of DOM and all of them were significantly degraded into smaller molecular weight fractions.

AB Due to a lack of adequate experimental techniques, the kinetics of the first 20 s of ozone decomposition in natural water and wastewater is still poorly understood. Introducing a continuous quench-flow system (CQFS), measurements starting 350 ms after ozone addition are presented for the first time. Very high HO. to O-3 exposures ratios (R-ct = integral HO(.)dt/integral O(3)dt) reveal that the first 20s of ozonation present oxidation conditions that are similar to ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOP). The oxidation of carbamazepine could be accurately modeled using O-3 and HO. exposures measured with CQFS during wastewater ozonation. These results demonstrate the applicability of bench scale determined second-order rate constants for wastewater ozonation. Important degrees of pharmaceutical oxidation and microbial inactivation are predicted, indicating that a significant oxidation potential is available during wastewater ozonation, even when ozone is entirely decomposed in the first 20 s.

AB At Linz-Unkel (Germany) sewage treatment plant the first full scale state-of-art EloDry-Pro (R) plant for sewage sludge has been constructed, consisting of the PYREG(R)reactor and the EloDry (R) belt dryer. The system is characterised by small footprint, flexibility, modular design and efficient energy management.
   The sludge dried using an EloDry (R) belt dryer undergoes staged combustion using the PYREG (R) module at around 6,500 degrees C. This reduces the sludge to a fraction of its original volume while disinfecting it and removing micro-pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues. The residual ash, which has a high percentage of plant-available phosphorus, is then supplied to the fertiliser industry as a recycled raw material.
   The working principle of EloDry-Pro (R) installation, including heat flows of the system, is presented.
   The paper describes Pyreg (R)'s advanced emission control systems, preventing NOx formation and removing harmful substances such as mercury and sulphur.
   The EloDry-Pro (R) technology is an innovative and cost-effective approach to decentralised thermal recycling of sewage sludge. Both sewage sludge volumes and transportation costs are reduced by up to 90%, therefore making it a low carbon cost-effective alternative to the transportation of sludge and allowing local sludge processing at plants under 100 k population.

AB BACKGROUND The aim of this work was to study the biological treatment of a synthetic wastewater containing emerging contaminants. The 95-day experiment was conducted in an 81 L continuous flow conventional activated sludge apparatus consisting of anoxic and aerobic reactors with internal recycling, and a clarifier with activated sludge recycling. Real activated sludge from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in the Nur-Sultan city was used. The degradation efficiencies of caffeine, metronidazole, and ibuprofen in the synthetic wastewater were studied either separately or in combination.
   RESULTS When treated separately at the concentration of 30 mg/L, the degradation of caffeine and ibuprofen was up to 100%, while the degradation of metronidazole was in the range of 12-27%. Caffeine and ibuprofen inhibited the nitrification process, while the presence of metronidazole in the system suppressed the activity of denitrifying microorganisms. The biological treatment of the synthetic wastewater containing all three compounds (at the concentration of 10 mg/L each) resulted in degradation of caffeine and ibuprofen up to 100%, and 56% in the case of metronidazole. As both nitrification and denitrification processes were affected, the total nitrogen removal was significantly reduced from 53% to 22%.
   CONCLUSION Complete degradation of caffeine and ibuprofen, and partial degradation of metronidazole were observed in a synthetic wastewater using the activated sludge process. As the presence of emerging pollutants in a wastewater affects the general efficiency of the wastewater treatment plants, other physical or chemical pre-treatment should be utilized to minimize the harmful effect of contaminants on the biological processes.

AB The distribution of DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni and Zn in four profile samples collected from areas contaminated with wastes from tannery, city sewage, pharmaceutical and paper mills located at different places in Bangladesh was investigated. Soil samples were analysed for the total and their DTPA-extractable metal contents. The total concentration of metals in the soil horizons ranged from 0.07 to 0.62 mg kg(-1) for Cd, 31 to 54 mg kg(-1) for Ni and 59 to 838 mg kg(-1) for Zn, respectively. These metal concentrations were highest in the surface and lowest in the subsurface horizons. This trend was also observed for the DTPA-extractable amounts of these metals. The relative extractability, expressed as the ratio of DTPA to total contents (aqua regia-extractable) was :33 to 46% for Cd, 2 to 10% for Ni and 3 to 28% for Zn, respectively, in the Al horizon, while in the B and C horizons the ratios decreased gradually as did total concentration, indicating that metal contamination was primarily limited to the surface horizon. For all three metals, the above mentioned ratio was highest in the city sewage soil and the lowest in. the paper mill soil. In general, the extent of contamination among the profiles investigated was in the following order: city sewage > tannery > > pharmaceutical > paper mill soil. Higher ratios of DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni and Zn in the city sewage soil than the other soils may create a risk for the contamination of agricultural products and ground water.

AB Electrochemical oxidation technology is an effective technique to treat high-concentration wastewater, which can directly oxidize refractory pollutants into simple inorganic compounds such as H2O and CO2. In this work, two-dimensionally stable anodes, Ti/RuO2-IrO2-SnO2, have been developed in order to degrade organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the oxide coating was successfully fabricated on the Ti plate surface. Electrocatalytic oxidation conditions of high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater was discussed and optimized, and the best results showed that the COD removal rate was 95.92% with the energy consumption was 58.09 kW.h/kgCOD under the electrode distance of 3 cm, current density of 8 mA/cm(2), initial pH of 2, and air flow of 18 L/min.

AB In this study, an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) mesophilic reactor was used to remove antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater. The hydraulic retention time was held constant at 13.3 days. The volumetric organic loading value increased from 0.33 to 7.43 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1) using antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater gradually diluted with various ratios of domestic wastewater. A COD removal efficiency of 95.7% was obtained with a maximum yield of 3,700 L d(-1) methane gas production. The results of the study were interpreted using the modified Stover-Kincannon, first-order, substrate mass balance and Van der Meer and Heertjes kinetic models. The obtained kinetic coefficients showed that antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater can be successfully treated using a UASB reactor while taking COD removal and methane production into account.

AB Increasing attention has been given to pollution of the water environment by pharmaceutical compounds discharged from wastewater treatment plants. High-pressure driven membranes such as a nanofiltration (NF) membrane and a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane are considered to be effective for control of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment. In practical applications of NF/RO membranes to municipal wastewater treatment, feed water for the membranes always contains organic macromolecules at concentrations of up to 10 mg-TOC/L, which are mainly composed of soluble microbial products (SMPs) produced during biological wastewater treatment such as an activated sludge process. In this study, influence of these organic macromolecules on removal of six pharmaceuticals by NF/RO membranes (UTC-60 and LF10) was investigated. Two types of biological treatment (conventional activated sludge process followed by media filtration (i.e., tertiary treatment) and treatment with a membrane bioreactor (MBR)) were examined as pretreatments for NF/RO membranes in this study. In the filtration tests with wastewater effluents, removal of the pharmaceuticals was higher than that seen with deionized pure water spiked with the pharmaceuticals. The increase was significant in the case of the NF membrane. Both alteration of membrane surface properties due to membrane fouling and association of the pharmaceuticals with organic macromolecules contributed to the increase in removal of pharmaceuticals by the membranes. Characteristics of the organic macromolecules contained in the wastewater effluents differed depending on the type of treatment, implying that removal of pharmaceuticals by NF/RO membranes is influenced by the type of pretreatment employed.

DE Hospital wastewaters; NDMA; Formation potential; Biological treatment
AB Hospital wastewaters contain high concentrations of pharmaceutical residues and other chemicals, and may present an important source for NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) and its precursors in the aquatic environment. The present study evaluates the contribution of hospital wastewater to NDMA environmental load and identifies important sources within the hospital itself. For this purpose, wastewaters from five large hospitals in Israel were analyzed, and concentrations of NDMA were found in the range of 20.7-56.7 ng/L, which are similar to NDMA concentrations typically detected in domestic wastewater. The relative contribution of day surgery, oncology, laboratories, and central kitchen (in Sheba hospital) to the daily load of NDMA was calculated as 20.2%, 8.2%, 10%, and 43.2%, respectively. In addition, NDMA concentration in Sheba's mixed wastewater stream, measured throughout a complete working day, was highest at 14:00. This suggests the possible impact of lunchtime on NDMA concentration, and emphasizes the dominant contribution of central kitchen waste. Finally, formation potential of NDMA in the mixed stream was 7300 ng/L, in the upper range of domestic wastewater, but could be decreased by 70% during subsequent aerobic biological wastewater treatment.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutical and personal care products in the environment are of increasing public importance because of their ubiquitous nature and documented effects on wildlife, ecosystems, and potentially humans. One potential, yet undefined, source of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment is via the land application of municipal wastewater onto permitted lands. The objective of the present study is to determine the extent to which pharmaceuticals are mitigated by or exported from managed tree plantations irrigated with municipal wastewater. A specific focus of the present study is the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in groundwater and surface water discharge. The study site is a municipality that land-applies secondary treated wastewater onto 930 hectares of a 2000-hectare managed hardwood and pine plantation. A suite of 33 pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones was targeted in the analysis, which consisted of monthly grab sampling of groundwater, surface water, and wastewater, followed by concentration and cleanup via solid phase extraction and separation, detection, and quantification via liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. More than one-half of all compounds detected in irrigated wastewater were not present in groundwater and subsequent surface water. However, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, caffeine, and other prescription and over-the-counter drugs remained in groundwater and were transported into surface water at concentrations up to 10 ng/L.

AB Many industries and industrial processes, such as electroplating, acid mine drainage, the pharmaceutical industry, and industries that use phosphorous, produce large volumes of acidic wastewater that must be treated before discharge. Generally, a large quantity of an alkali, such as lime, caustic soda, or soda ash is used to neutralize the acidic wastewater and it is a costly treatment process. Therefore, new self-releasing alkali materials were studied. This research proposed the synthesis of sustainable porous alkali-activated materials (porous AAMs) by a simple method for acidic wastewater treatment. Industrial wastes, i.e., fly ash and bottom ash from a power plant, were employed to produce porous AAMs using sodium silicate solution as a foaming agent. The test results showed that fly ash and bottom ash AAMs had the potential to be used as pH modifiers. 0.001 M HCl solution (pH of 3) was selected as the representative acidic wastewater, and the pH of the solution fell to within the allowable discharge pH range of 5.5-9.0 according to the effluent discharge standard of Thailand. The retention time was three days for a solid-to-solution ratio of 1:500 w/v (g/ml). Porous AAMs present an attractive way of utilizing waste coal ashes compared to a cost-effective method for acidic wastewater treatment.

AB In present study, the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater from an erythromycin (ERY) production factory by gamma irradiation was investigated. Results showed that a variety of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), involving MLSB, tet, bla, multidrug, sul, MGEs and van genes and plentiful 9 bacterial phyla were identified in the raw wastewater. In addition to ERY, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and tetracycline (TC) were also identified with the concentration of 3 order of magnitude lower than ERY. Results showed that the abatement of ARGs and antibiotics was much higher than that of antimicrobial activity and COD. With the absorbed dose of 50 kGy, the removal percentage of ARGs, ERY, antimicrobial activity and COD was 96.5-99.8%, 90.0%, 47.8% and 10.3%, respectively. The culturable bacteria were abated fast and completely at 5.0 kGy during gamma irradiation. The genus Pseudomonas was predominant in raw wastewater (56.7%) and its relative abundance decreased after gamma irradiation, to 1.3% at 50 kGy. With addition of peroxymonosulfate (PMS, 50 mM), the antimicrobial activity disappeared completely and ERY removal reached as high as 99.2% at the lower absorbed dose of 25 kGy. Ionizing radiation-coupled technique is a potential option to treat pharmaceutical wastewater for reduction of antibiotics, ARGs and antimicrobial activity.

DE antibiotics; pharmaceuticals; wastewater; zeolites
ID PHARMACEUTICALS
AB Pharmaceuticals are one of the most used compounds present in various environmental compartments. Due to their high consumption and possible unhealthy effect on ecosystems, pharmaceuticals have been identified as "emerging organic contaminants". Since these compounds have medium to high polarity, they end up in the water compartment after being used. This work deals with the sorption of three pharmaceutical substances from the therapeutic group of antibiotics. Specifically we have focused on Azithromycin, Clarithromycin and Erythromycin. Three fractions of the natural Slovak zeolites (200 mu m, 0.5-1 mm and 1.5-2 mm) were used as the sorption medium. Experimental results have proven very effective sorption of antibiotics by zeolites. Azithromycin removal of over 99 % for all three zeolite fractions from wastewater treatment plant Stupava and wastewater treatment plant Devinska Nova Ves was achieved. Clarithromycin removal of 79 % for fraction 1-2.5 mm, 87.3 % for fraction 0.5-1 mm and of 99.8 % for fraction 200 mu m from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant Stupava was observed. Erythromycin removal of 31.3 % for fraction 1-2.5 mm, 66.9 % for fraction 0.5-1mm and of 94.7 % for fraction 200 pm from effluent of wastewater treatment plant Stupava was measured. More than 95 % of Clarithromycin and Erythromycin were eliminated from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant Devinska Nova Ves. The highest elimination percentage was observed for the smallest zeolite fraction due to the highest specific surface area.

AB Antibiotics are among the most commonly used group of pharmaceuticals in human medicine. They can therefore reach surface and groundwater bodies through different routes, such as wastewater treatment plant effluents, surface runoff, or infiltration of water used for agricultural purposes. It is well known that antibiotics pose a significant risk to environmental and human health, even at low concentrations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of aminoglycosides and phenicol antibiotics in municipal wastewaters, sea water and pharmaceutical effluents in Tunisia. All analysed water samples contained detectable levels of aminoglycoside and phenicol antibiotics. The highest concentrations in wastewater influents were observed for neomycin and kanamycin B (16.4 ng mL(-1) and 7.5 ng mL(-1), respectively). Chloramphenicol was found in wastewater influents up to 3 ng mL(-1). It was observed that the waste water treatment plants were not efficient in completely removing these antibiotics. Chloramphenicol and florfenicol were found in sea water samples near aquaculture sites at levels up to, respectively, 15.6 ng mL(-1) and 18.4 ng mL(-1). Also aminoglycoside antibiotics were found near aquaculture sites with the highest concentration of 3.4 ng mL(-1) for streptomycin. In pharmaceutical effluents, only gentamycin was found at concentrations up to 19 ng mL(-1) over a sampling period of four months.

AB Everyday domestic activity is a significant source of water pollution. The presence of six household micropollutants in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was assessed in wastewater and sludge. A multi-target analytical method was developed for the quantification of ibuprofen, erythromycin, ofloxacin, 4-nonylphenol, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (triclosan), and sucralose. The micropollutants were extracted from the liquid and solid phases and their concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS. The efficiency of micropollutants' removal within a conventional activated sludge process was assessed. From 50 % to 90 % of ibuprofen and erythromycin was removed from the wastewater liquid phase. Their removal can be attributed to biological degradation as they were not found adsorbed on the outlet sludge. Ofloxacin and triclosan were removed from the liquid phase with similar efficiencies; however, they were adsorbed on the sludge, so it was not possible to determine their removal mechanism (whether biodegradation or displacement to solid phase/sequestration). Sucralose was not removed from wastewater (3 mu g L-1 in inlet and outlet liquid phase) and not adsorbed on the sludge. 4-Nonylphenol concentrations were sometimes higher in the WWTP outlet water; this may relate to the degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates in the wastewater treatment process. 4-Nonylphenol was always present in the outlet sludge.

AB In this study characterization and biological treat ability of tablet production wastewaters of a pharmaceutical industry were assessed. Source-based wastewater characterization of tablet, pastille, effervescent tablets and chewing tablet productions indicated variable strength of wastewaters with COD values between 1030 and 6700 mg/L. Biological treatability studies conducted on these wastewaters showed that the wastewater having BOD/COD ratios above 0.4 could be effectively treated using activated sludge process at 0.21-0.25 g COD/(g VSS d) organic loading. One of the tablet production wastewaters was found to be practically non-biodegradable. Ozonation of this wastewater yielded a limited increase in biodegradability. 60% COD removal could be obtained by biological treatability experiments at organic loadings of 0.06 to 0.1 g COD/(g VSS d) using composite samples prepared as a mixture of ozonized and non-ozonized tablet wastewaters.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern. Recent research has suggested that interactions between pathogens and antibiotic residues in various environmental matrices promote the development and spread of AMR in the environment. The levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment have been analysed globally. Recently, Predicted No Effect Environmental Concentration (PNEC) values for many antibiotics have been suggested, based on their estimated minimal selective concentrations for selected bacterial species. The PNEC values can serve as a guide on the maximum levels of antibiotic residues in an environmental matrix, below which resistance is unlikely to develop. Aim: We aimed to determine which of the antibiotics, considered as ?priority antibiotics? by the World Health Organisation (WHO), most frequently exceeded their PNEC values in the global aquatic environment. Methods: We obtained data from the German Environment Agency pharmaceutical database on means, medians or single values of 12 antibiotic types in five different environmental matrices [municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, industrial wastewater effluent, hospital wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water] across 47 countries. We compared the mean levels of the 12 antibiotics in each environmental matrix to their suggested PNEC values to determine which antibiotic types exceeded PNEC and were most likely to select for resistance. We also determined which environmental matrices and countries had the highest burden of antibiotic residues. Results: Our study revealed that 7.9% of all analyses of antibiotic residues performed in the environmental matrices globally exceeded PNEC. Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin had the greatest proportion ( 30%) of residues exceeding PNEC. Hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater had the highest burden of antibiotic residues exceeding PNEC. No antibiotics exceeded PNEC in drinking water. Conclusion: While most environmental monitoring studies have focused on municipal wastewater treatment plants, the limited number of studies on hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater revealed that a large number of antibiotic residues coming from these sources exceeded their PNEC values. Our study highlights the importance of implementing on -site treatment systems that aim to destroy antibiotics prior to discharging wastewater to surface waters. Attention needs to be focused on the role that environmental matrices, particularly our wastewater sites, play in promoting antibiotic resistance. Novel treatment technologies need to be developed and implemented to increase the removal efficiencies of treatment plants and from antibiotic manufacturing, and decrease the discharge of antibiotic residues into aquatic environments.

AB Twelve antibiotic substances for human use, including trimethoprim and representatives of the fluoroquinolone (FQ), sulfonamide (SA), penicillin (PE), cephalosporin (CE), nitroimidazole (NI), tetracycline (TC), and macrolide (MA) groups, were subjected to a screening study at five Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) during one week in 2002 and one week in 2003. The analytes were extracted from raw sewage water, final effluent, and sludge by solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-solid extraction (as appropriate) and then identified and quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The most frequently detected antibiotics in the matrices considered in this study were norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline. The other analytes were only detected in a few samples. Analysis of the weekly mass flows through each STP showed that FIGS were partly eliminated from the water during sewage water treatment and the highest amounts of these substances were found in sludge. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were mainly found in raw sewage water and final effluent, but these substances had balancing mass flows, indicating that they too can withstand sewage water treatment. The mass flow patterns for doxycycline were more complex, with high amounts occurring in sludge in some cases, suggesting that the behavior of this analyte may be more strongly influenced by the treatment process and other variables at individual STPs. The environmental load (the sum of the amounts in the final effluent and sludge) normalized to the number of inhabitants in the catchment area of each investigated STP compared with theoretical predictions based on consumption data (in parentheses) showed good correlations: norfloxacin, 0.8 (0.9); ofloxacin, 0.3 (0.2); ciprofloxacin, 1.3 (3.5); sulfamethoxazole, 0.2 (0.4); trimethoprim, 1.1 (1.0); and doxycycline, 0.7 (0.4) mg per person per week. The results show that reasonably accurate predictions of environmental load of these antibiotics can be time-effectively derived from consumption data without additional measurements.

AB A reliable and sensitive analytical method for the determination of estrone (El), 17beta-estradiol (E2), and the synthetic hormone 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) has been established. Samples are concentrated using automated solid-phase extraction and analysis is performed by liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass spectrometry. Recoveries of all analytes were between 93% and 107%, and limits of quantification (LOQs) between 0.1 and 0.4 ng/L for purified sewage, and surface, ground, and drinking water, and between 1 and 2 ng/L in case of raw sewage. For the investigation of estrogen release into the environment and its behavior during sewage and surface water treatment, and during ground water recharge, samples from municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), a surface water treatment plant, a bank filtration site, and a ground water enrichment (GWE) pond were analyzed. E1 was found in the raw waste water with an average concentration of 157 ng/L, whereas E2 and EE2 were found with mean concentrations of only 18 and 9 ng/L, respectively. Sewage treatment by municipal WWTPs affected a removal of EE2 (76%), E1 (92%), and E2 (94%). In the investigated surface water of Berlin, only E1 could be detected at concentrations around or below 1 ng/L. E2 and EE2 were not present in the Berlin surface water above the LOQ of 0.2 ng/L, respectively. Surface water treatment also leads to a significant removal of E1 (> 80%). In the ground water samples from the GWE site near Lake Tegel, only a few samples contained detectable concentrations of E1. These samples were collected from a shallow monitoring well located very close to the bank of the pond. Even a short distance between the bank and observation wells led to concentrations of E1 below the LOQ showing the potential of ground water recharge systems for the retention of estrogenic steroids depending on the environmental setting.

AB The pharmaceutical wastewater was treated by coupling solar photo-Fenton process with an aerobic sequential batch reactor (SBR). Pharmaceutical wastewater has high COD and very low BOD and hence it is difficult to treat them biologically. The main purpose is to determine optimal photo-Fenton conditions (i.e., pH, ferrous ion concentration, H2O2 dosage and treatment time) for making wastewater biocompatible and suitable for subsequent biological treatment. Solar photo-Fenton process enhances biodegradability and a significant enhancement of biodegradability was found at the optimum conditions of pH = 3, H2O2 = 5 g L-1, Fe2+ = 1 g L-1 and irradiation time = 60 min. At this condition BOD3/COD ratio increased from 0.015 to 0.54. The coupled solar photo-Fenton with SBR process obtained COD removal of 98% and the effluent COD concentration was found to be 100 mg/L, which meets the requirements of the discharge standard.

AB Wastewater from the fertiliser industry is characterised by high chloride concentration, normally varying between 60 and 76 g/ l. Experiments with biological,denitrification were performed in laboratory-scale 'fill and draw' reactors with synthetic fertiliser wastewater, with chloride concentrations up to 96.7 g Cl/lat 37degreesC; the pH was controlled in the range 6.8 to 7.2. Potassium acetate was added as carbon source for the suspended cultures. The results of the experiments showed that biological denitrification was feasible at the extreme environmental conditions prevailing in undiluted fertilliser-wastewater. However, the extreme conditions affected the denitrification rates, The volumetric rates were reduced by a factor of ten between chloride levels of 4.8 to 96.7 g/l. The results from the performed tests can also be applied to other wastewaters with similar characteristics as that of the fertitiser industry, i.e. with high salinity. As an example, the pharmaceutical and aquacultural industries can be mentioned.

AB Reverse electrodialysis (RED)-based hybrid processes (e.g., RED-ED/RO) have been proposed for more energyefficient desalination in drinking water production. The use of secondary-treated wastewater as a low-salinity stream in RED raises concerns about enhanced membrane fouling and, especially, potential organic micropollutants (OMPs) contamination of drinking water sources. The influence of membrane fouling and channel clogging on the transport and adsorption of 25 OMPs in RED was investigated using synthetic and real seawater and secondary-treated wastewater for 40 days. Real wastewater induced more membrane fouling and channel clogging than its synthetic counterparts and real seawater, as evidenced by pressure drop increase, permselectivity decrease, and ATP levels increase. The OMP transport and adsorption in real seawater conditions were higher than their synthetic counterparts, while OMP transport and adsorption under real wastewater conditions decreased significantly compared to synthetic wastewater conditions, possibly due to: 1) higher OMP-membrane interaction compared to OMP-fouling layer interaction (steric and electrostatic mechanisms), and 2) OMP adsorption onto the effluent organic matter in real wastewater. These results provide critical implications for (2021) industrial scenarios: OMPs transport might be overestimated at the lab-scale when using synthetic streams, clearly indicating the key role of effluent organic matter and fouling in RED using impaired water.

AB Reasonable disposal of sewage sludge (SS) as a resource to avid secondary pollution is the major objective. In this study, co-hydrothermal treatment combined with pyrolysis (co-HTP) of rice straw (RS) and sewage sludge for production of biochar was evaluated. The biochar yield was evaluated, and the basic characteristics of biochar including fuel characteristics, porosity characteristics and crystalline characteristics, as well as the heavy metals behaviors were examined. The results indicated that biochar yield exhibited a decreasing trend with the increase of RS blending ratio, and there was a synergy between RS and SS during co-HTP process for the slightly higher biochar yield than that of the predicted values. The co-HTP process promoted the increase of aromaticity and stability of biochar, along with an obvious increase of specific surface area of 116.81 m2/g for H-7RS/3SS-Char. The results also indicated that co-HTP process decreased the total concentrations of heavy metals in biochar and had the promoting effect on heavy metals immobilization for reducing environmental risks due to the reduced percentage of heavy metals in bioavailable fractions.

AB The degradation of ibuprofen was investigated in aqueous solution by three-dimensional particle electrode (TDE) technology. When the initial concentration was between 10 and 40mg/L, almost 80% of the ibuprofen was degraded at 6h. However, only about 16.64% of ibuprofen was mineralized even at 6h according to total organic carbon measurements. A combined process of TDE and biological aerated filter (BAF) was therefore developed to enhance the treatment of ibuprofen contaminated municipal sewage. The effluent quality of coupled process was substantially improved by TDE due to the degradation of ibuprofen and related intermediates. The experimental results showed that TDE-BAF is effective for removing ibuprofen from municipal sewage.

AB Wastewater analysis has the potential to provide objective information on community drug use. Introducing a population biomarker (PB) in the sample analysis may significantly reduce errors in the back-calculation associated with population estimation and wastewater volume measurement. A number of potential PBs have been suggested but no systematic evaluation has been conducted so far. This study evaluated the eligibility of the previously suggested PB candidates (creatinine, cholesterol, coprostanol and cotinine) as well as three new ones (cortisol, androstenedione and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) using five criteria. We assessed the quantification method, affinity to particulate matter and stability of candidates in wastewater, as well as the constancy of inter-day excretion and correlation between excretion and census population. All PB candidates were quantifiable in wastewater. Cholesterol and coprostanol were eliminated from further consideration due to affinity to particulate matters in the wastewater. Creatinine, cortisol and androstenedione were disqualified for stability reasons. On a population scale, both cotinine and 5-HIAA were excreted (RSD = 8.01 +/- 1.13% and 10.20 +/- 0.89%, respectively) at a constant rate and concentrations of each correlated well with the census population (r = 0.9809 and 0.9442, respectively). Overall, both cotinine and 5-HIAA are eligible PBs, but the neurotransmitter metabolite 5-HIAA may be more suitable for international comparisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) was investigated in treated wastewater intended for reuse in agriculture. An agarose hydrogel diffusion-based passive sampler was exposed to the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Cyprus, which is equipped with membrane bioreactor (MBR). Passive samplers in triplicate were exposed according to a time-series exposure plan with maximum exposure duration of 28 days. Composite flow-proportional wastewater samples were collected in parallel with the passive sampling exposure plan and were processed by solid phase extraction using HORIZON SPE-DEX 4790 and the same sorbent material (Oasis HLB) as in the passive sampler. The analysis of passive samplers and wastewater samples enabled (i) the field-scale calibration of the passive sampler prototype by the calculation of in situ sampling rates of target substances, and (ii) the investigation of in silico predicted transformation products of the four most ecotoxicologically hazardous antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin). Additionally, the wastewater samples were subjected to the analysis of seven preselected antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile resistant element (int1). All extracts were analyzed for chemicals in a single batch using a highly sensitive method for pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and illicit drugs by liquid chromatography tandem MS/MS (LC-QQQ) and for various other target compounds (2316 compounds in total) by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). 279 CECs and all investigated ARGs (except for bla(CTX-M-32)) were detected, highlighting potential chemical and biological hazards related to wastewater reuse practices. 16 CECs were prioritized following ecotoxicological risk assessment, whereas sul1 and the mobile resistant element (int1) showed the highest abundance. Comprehensive monitoring efforts using novel sampling methods such as passive sampling, wide-scope target screening and molecular analysis are required to assure safe application of wastewater reuse and avoid spread and crop uptake of potentially hazardous chemicals.

AB In an effort to mitigate the discharge of micropollutants to surface waters, adsorption of micropollutants onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) after conventional wastewater treatment has been identified as a promising technology for enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals and pesticides from wastewater. We investigated the effectiveness of super-fine powdered activated carbon, SPAC, (ca. 1 mu m mean particle diameter) in comparison to regular-sized PAC (17-37 mu m mean diameter) for the optimization of micropollutant removal from wastewater. Adsorption isotherms and batch kinetic experiments were performed for 10 representative micropollutants (bezafibrate, benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gabapentin, mecoprop, metoprolol, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) onto three commercial PACs and their super-fine variants in carbonate buffer and in wastewater effluent. SPAC showed substantially faster adsorption kinetics of all micropollutants than conventional PAC, regardless of the micropollutant adsorption affinity and the solution matrix. The total adsorptive capacities of SPAC were similar to those of PAC for two of the three tested carbon materials, in all tested waters. However, in effluent wastewater, the presence of effluent organic matter adversely affected micropollutant removal, resulting in lower removal efficiencies especially for micropollutants with low affinity for adsorbent particles in comparison to pure water. In comparison to PAC, SPAC application resulted in up to two-fold enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from effluent wastewater. The more efficient adsorption process using SPAC translates into a reduction of contact time and contact tank size as well as reduced carbon dosing for a targeted micropollutant removal. In the tested effluent wastewater (5 mg/L DOC), the necessary dose to achieve 80% average removal of indicator micropollutants (benzotriazole, diclofenac, carbamazepine, mecoprop and sulfamethoxazole) ranged between 13 and 15 mg/L. These promising results warrant pilot-scale tests using super-fine PAC as an alternative to PAC for more efficient micropollutant removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, TiO2/Ni photo-anode and multi-walled carbon nano-tubes (MWCNTs) air cathode were prepared by the dip-coating method, and the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of real pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated in the self-made reactor. The combination of the TiO2/Ni electrode and MWCNTs air cathode was adopted to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater by the process of photoelectrocatalysis. Various operational parameters to achieve optimum efficiency of this photoelectrocatalytic degradation system are presented, such as applied bias voltage, NaCl concentration, pH and different degradation methods. Under the optimal conditions, the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour are 93.5% and 78.5% respectively. The possible roles of the anodecathode on the reactions and the probable mechanisms of effect were also discussed. The photoelectrocatalytic technology can be used for the long-term treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The present study evaluated the removal capacity of a UASB-HRAP treatment system, combining anaerobic and microalgae-based, aerobic treatment, for eleven organic micropollutants present in raw sewage, including pharmaceuticals, estrogens and xenoestrogens. The UASB reactor and the HRAP were operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 h and 8 days, respectively. Influent and effluent samples from the UASB and HRAP were collected periodically. All the target compounds were detected in raw sewage, with an occurrence ranging from 70 to 100%. Removal rates in the UASB reactor were generally incomplete, ranging from no removal (-25.12% for the hormone EE2-ethinylestradiol) to 84.91% (E2 - estradiol). However, the overall performance of the UASB + HRAP system was highly efficient for the majority of the compounds, with removal rates ranging from 64.8% (ibuprofen) to 95% (estrone). Gemfibrozil and bisphenol A were the only exceptions, with overall removal rates of 39% and 43%, respectively. Hormones were the compounds with the highest removal rates in the system.

AB In urban areas such as Berlin (Germany) with high municipal sewage water discharges and low surface water flows there is a potential risk of drinking water contamination by polar organic compounds when groundwater recharge is used in drinking water production. Thus, some pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are not eliminated completely in the municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) and they are discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. In terms of several monitoring studies carried out in Berlin between 1996 and 2000, PhACs such as clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, primidone and carbamazepine were detected at individual concentrations up to the mu/I-level in influent and effluent samples from STPs and in all surface water samples collected downstream from the STPs. Under recharge conditions, several compounds were also found at individual concentrations up to 7.3 mug/I in samples collected from groundwater aquifers near to contaminated water courses. A few of the PhACs were also identified at the ng/I-level in Berlin tap water samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater is considered a complex mixture populated with pathogenic microorganisms. The genetic constitution of these microorganisms can be changed through the direct and indirect effects of hospital wastewater constituents, leading to the appearance of antibiotic multi-resistant bacteria. To avoid environmental contamination hospital wastewaters must be treated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of hospital wastewater treated by a combined process of biological degradation (septic tank) and the Fenton reaction. Thus, after septic tank biodegradation, batch Fenton reaction experiments were performed in a laboratory-scale reactor and the effectiveness of this sequential treatment was evaluated by a physico-chemical/microbiological time-course analysis of COD, BOD5, and thermotolerant and total coliforms. The results showed that after 120 min of Fenton treatment BOD5 and COD values decreased by 90.6% and 91.0%, respectively. The BOD5/COD ratio changed from 0.46 to 0.48 after 120 min of treatment. Bacterial removal efficiency reached 100%, while biotests carried out with Scenedesmus subspicatus and Daphnia magna showed a significant decrease in the ecotoxicity of hospital wastewater after the sequential treatment. The use of this combined system would ensure that neither multi-resistant bacteria nor ecotoxic substances are released to the environment through hospital wastewater discharge.

AB An increasing area of agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater worldwide due to the scarcity of fresh water resources. Whether wastewater irrigations can affect the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of natural organic matter in soils is unclear. In this study, we assess the responses of the electron-accepting capacity (EAC) and electron-donating capacity (EDC) of soil humic substances (HS) to irrigations with wastewaters from different sources. We show that the EAC of soil HS increases and the EDC of soil HS decreases after irrigation with domestic wastewater. Conversely, the EAC of soil HS decreases and the EDC of soil HS increases after irrigation with industrial wastewater. The EAC and EDC of soil HS exert no changes after irrigation with pharmaceutical wastewater. Irrigations with wastewaters from different sources can cause the distinct directions of changes in the activities of lignin peroxidase and laccase by altering the content of labile organic carbon, heavy metals or antibiotics in soils, thereby changing the chemical structures and finally the ETC of HS along different directions. These results can provide insights into the role of HS in environmentally relevant processes in agricultural soils under the context of wastewater irrigations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Global water shortage is placing an unprecendent pressure on water supplies. Treated wastewater is a valuable water resource, but its reuse for agricultural irrigation faces a roadblock the public concern over the potential accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into human diet. In the present study, we measured the levels of 19 commonly occurring pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in 8 vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater under field conditions. Tertiary treated wastewater without or with a fortification of each PPCP at 250 ng/L, was used to irrigate crops until harvest. Plant samples at premature and mature stages were collected. Analysis of edible tissues showed a detection frequently of 64% and 91% in all vegetables from the treated wastewater and fortified water treatments, respectively. The edible samples from the two treatments contained the same PPCPs, including caffeine, meprobamate, primidone, DEET, carbamazepine, dilantin, naproxen, and triclosan. The total concentrations of PPCPs detected in edible tissues from the treated wastewater and fortified irrigation treatment were in the range of 0.01-3.87 and 0.15-7.3 mg/g (dry weight), respectively. Annual exposure of PPCPs from the consumption of mature vegetables irrigated with the fortified water was estimated to be only 3.69 mu g per capital. Results from the present study showed that the accumulation of PPCPs in vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater was likely limited under field conditions.

AB Treatment of sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater is a big challenge. In this study, a series of anaerobic evaluation tests on pharmaceutical wastewater from different operating units was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion, and the results indicated that the key refractory factor for anaerobic treatment of this wastewater was the high sulfate concentration. A laboratory-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated for 195 days to investigate the effects of the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), organic loading rate (OLR), and COD/SO4 2-ratio on the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in pharmaceutical wastewater and the process performance. The electron flow indicated that methanogenesis was still the dominant reaction although sulfidogenesis was enhanced with a stepwise decrease in the influent COD/SO4 2-ratio. For the treated sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater, a COD of 4983 mg/L (diluted by 50%), OLR of 2.5 kg COD/(m 3 $ d), and COD/SO4 2-ratio of more than 5 were suitable for practical applications. The recovery performance indicated that the system could resume operation quickly even if production was halted for a few days.

AB Pharmaceutical substances have been detected in sewage effluents as well as receiving waters in many parts of the world. In this study, the occurrence and removal of a number of drug compounds were studied within a large sewage treatment plant in the south of England. Samples were processed using solid phase extraction and analysed using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrate that ibuprofen, paracetamol, salbutamol and mefenamic acid were present in both the influent and effluent of the works while propranolol-HCl was not found above the limit of quantification in any sample. Elimination rates were circa 90% for each compound but several hundred nanograms per litre were still present in the final effluent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large variations in removal efficiencies (REs) of chemicals have been reported for monitoring studies of activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this work, we conducted a meta-analysis on REs (1539 data points) for a set of 209 chemicals consisting of fragrances, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals in order to assess the drivers of the variability relating to inherent properties of the chemicals and operational parameters of activated sludge WWTPs. For a reduced dataset (n = 542), we developed a mixed-effect model (meta-regression) to explore the observed variability in REs for the chemicals using three chemical specific factors and four WWTP-related parameters. The overall removal efficiency of the set of chemicals was 82.1% (95% CI 75.2-87.1%, N = 1539). Our model accounted for 17% of the total variability in REs, while the process-based model SimpleTreat did not perform better than the average of the measured REs. We identified that, after accounting for other factors potentially influencing RE, readily biodegradable compounds were better removed than non-readily biodegradable ones. Further, we showed that REs increased with increasing sludge retention times (SRTs), especially for non-readily biodegradable compounds. Finally, our model highlighted a decrease in RE with increasing K-OC. The counterintuitive relationship to K-OC stresses the need for a better understanding of electrochemical interactions influencing the RE of ionisable chemicals. In addition, we highlighted the need to improve the modelling of chemicals that undergo deconjugation when predicting RE. Our meta-analysis represents a first step in better explaining the observed variability in measured REs of chemicals. It can be of particular help to prioritize the improvements required in existing process-based models to predict removal efficiencies of chemicals in WWTPs.
   Environmental significance
   The amount of chemicals released into water bodies from consumer product use in developed countries mainly depends on the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove chemicals from wastewater. Current modelling approaches fail to explain the large variability observed in monitored removal efficiencies (REs). Applying a meta-analytical and meta-regression approach on a database of 1539 REs for surfactants, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals, we found empirical evidence that the sludge retention time of the WWTP, and biodegradation potential and partitioning to solids of the chemicals were important when modelling REs. Our model results also suggest that a better understanding of chemical-specific processes, like deconjugation and electrochemical interactions with sludge, are crucial for a better prediction of REs in WWTPs.

AB Assessing collective drug consumption based on the concentrations of illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater is a new technology. Currently, this technology is receiving attention in China, and methods for multiple illicit drug detection in wastewater are urgently needed. In our study, a method with a short runtime (7 min), a small solid-phase extraction (SPE) loading volume (50 mL) and high sensitivity (lower limits of quantitation (LLOQs) ranged from 0.2 to 5 ng/L) was developed for the simultaneous determination of amphetamines, ketamine, opiates, cocaine and their metabolites in wastewater. Samples were enriched by SPE on a mixed-mode sorbent (Oasis MCX) and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.1 to 2 ng/L, and the LLOQs varied between 0.2 and 5 ng/L. Moreover, the method developed was applied to real wastewater samples collected from 15 different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In the results, the most abundant compounds were morphine (1.8-46.6 ng/L) and codeine (3.7-24.9 ng/L), which were detected in 13 WWTPs. After successful optimization of the UPLC-MS/MS conditions and sample loading pH, the method developed is able to meet the needs of common illicit drug monitoring and high-throughput analysis requirements.

AB Catalytic wet oxidation of high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater with Fe3+ as catalyst was carried out in a batch reactor. Results showed that the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater was enhanced significantly by Fe3+. The effects of reaction parameters, such as the catalyst dose, reaction temperature, time, and initial oxygen pressure, were discussed. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal increased with the increases of catalyst dose, temperature, time and oxygen supply. With the initial COD 34,000-35,000 mg/L, approximately 70% COD removal can be achieved under the conditions of catalyst 1.0 g and oxygen pressure 1.0 MPa at 250 degrees C after 60 min. The results of kinetic studies showed that two reaction steps existed in this oxidation process, which followed an apparent first-order rate law. This process provides an effective approach for the pretreatment of high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater.

DE Anaerobic treatment; batch reactor; antibiotic; synthetic wastewater
AB Antibiotics are among the most successful group of pharmaceuticals used for human and veterinary therapy. However, large amounts of antibiotics are released into municipal wastewater due to incomplete metabolism in humans or due to disposal of unused antibiotics. Anaerobic treatment systems increasingly used for removal of antibiotics from wastewater.
   Today, anaerobic treatment systems commonly used for wastewater containing medium and high degree of organic matters. This study was carried out for the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing different antibiotic group in batch reactor for removal of COD. The treatment process was monitored based on the statistical optimisation data of the batch reactor studies. In the Full factorial tests, 27 different tests are established by considering the variables such as (i) different antibiotic groups (fluconazole, cefamycin and tetracycline); (ii) different initial antibiotic concentrations (25, 50, 75 mg/L) and (iii) a type of co-substrate (propionic acid, glucose, propionic acid-butyric acid-acetic acid mixture). As a result of the statistical study is significant type of antibiotics, antibiotic concentration and type of co substrate have a significant effect statistically on the COD removal (p<0.05). The maximum COD removal for the fluconazole (experiment 19) was 98,87%.

AB The occurrence and behavior of carbamazepine (CBZ) was investigated in aquatic environment of Yangtze River Delta, East China. The water samples were enriched by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector. The validation of the analytical method included linearity (0.1-1 mg/L), recovery studies, and determination of limits of quantification. Limits of quantification of CBZ in various aquatic samples were in the range of 0.1-0.2 mu g/L. CBZ was detected in the Tongji University Intramural River, the Huangpu River, and the Suzhou River with the highest concentration of 1,090 ng/L, but not detected in the Nanhengyin River and the Caojia River. In sewage water samples, CBZ was not detected in one of the sewage treatment plants (STPs) but was detected in the raw influents and effluents at the other three selected STPs in Shanghai, with the concentrations ranging from 230 to 1,110 ng/L. CBZ was not completely eliminated after secondary treatment (with the active sludge process).

AB Water treatment plants are often not effective in removing pharmaceuticals, personal care products or natural hormones from their effluents. To test the effects of these effluents on fish, we exposed male fat-head minnows (Pimephales promelas) for 48 h to effluents at two sites, one up-stream and the other down-stream from a water treatment plant. Gene expression profiling showed that significant changes occurred in the gonad of fish exposed below, compared to above the treatment plant and to laboratory control fish. Among the biological processes affected were the innate immune response, response to stress, control of homeostasis, control of transcription, metabolism, and cell communication. This work suggests that fish are impacted by exposures to the sewage treatment effluents and effects can be detected rapidly by gene expression profiling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal and diurnal patterns of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and its formation potential (NMOR FP) were examined with water samples taken from five outlets of four sewage treatment plants (STPs), seven main stream sites, and five tributary sites in the Yodo River basin. STPs were shown to be the main sources of downstream NMOR load. The highest NMOR levels were found in the discharge from one STP (26.4-171 ng/L). Continuous sequential samplings over a period of 24 h at this STP revealed that NMOR flux at the influent point fluctuated in both summer (0.4-3.2 g/h) and winter (0.3-5.4 g/h), while it was steady in the effluent In addition, levels of NMOR remained stable during the biological treatment and disinfection processes. The present research demonstrated that NMOR could be formed from morpholine (MOR) in raw sewage treated by this STP, with a possible mechanism being formaldehyde-catalyzed nitrosation of MOR by nitrites, prior to raw sewage entering the STP. This implies that the NMOR detected here might not be a disinfection byproduct per se under low-chlorine disinfection (around 1.0 mg/L), but is primarily a contaminant that is difficult to remove during sewage treatment NMOR attenuated significantly in the rivers in the daytime with production of MOR, but persisted during nights, which demonstrated the importance of monitoring NMOR levels in the water environment during periods of low UV intensity, especially nights.

AB The occurrence and geochemical behavior of nine pharmaceutical compounds were investigated along the Yangtze River Estuary and its coastal area, by sampling and analysis of pharmaceuticals in sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloidal and soluble phases. In addition, the impact of sewage input was examined by sampling from sewage treatment plants (STP) effluent and its upstream and downstream in the Yangtze River. Although at relatively low concentrations in SPM and sediments, several pharmaceuticals were found at elevated concentration in filtered water samples from SIP-affected sites. SIP is therefore an important input of pharmaceuticals in the study area. Colloidal phase was further separated from bulk water samples using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF), confirming it being an effective sorbent for pharmaceuticals with high sorption capacity which are 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than SPM. Moreover, mass balance calculations showed that significant percentages of selected pharmaceutical compounds were associated with aquatic colloids, indicating colloids as a reservoir for these contaminants in the Yangtze estuarine system.

AB The two-chambered microbial fuel cell (MFC) was designed and used for studying the efficiency of the real wastewater treatment from a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical plant as well as from synthetic wastewater containing diclofenac sodium (DS). The removal of the contaminants was expressed regarding chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, as measured by spectrophotometry experiments. Moreover, the effect of two different types of the cathode on current characteristics and COD removal was investigated. This research showed that the Pt-coated Ti cathode could lead to higher efficiency of both power density and COD removal. In this case, the results indicated that the maximum power density (P-max) was 20.5 and 6.5 W/m(3)and the maximum COD removal was 93 and 78% for MFCs using real and synthetic wastewater, respectively.

AB Results from coastal water pollution monitoring (Lesvos Island, Greece) are presented. In total, 53 samples were analyzed for 58 polar organic micropollutants such as selected herbicides, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, stimulants, artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals. Main focus is the application of a proposed wastewater indicator quartet (acesulfame, caffeine, valsartan, and valsartan acid) to detect point sources and contamination hot-spots with untreated and treated wastewater. The derived conclusions are compared with the state of knowledge regarding local land use and infrastructure. The artificial sweetener acesulfame and the stimulant caffeine were used as indicators for treated and untreated wastewater, respectively. In case of a contamination with untreated wastewater the concentration ratio of the antihypertensive valsartan and its transformation product valsartan acid was used to further refine the estimation of the residence time of the contamination. The median/maximum concentrations of acesulfame and caffeine were 5.3/178 ng L-1 and 6.1/522 ng L-1, respectively. Their detection frequency was 100%. Highest concentrations were detected within the urban area of the capital of the island (Mytilene). The indicator quartet in the gulfs of Gera and Kalloni (two semi-enclosed embayments on the island) demonstrated different concentration patterns. A comparatively higher proportion of untreated wastewater was detected in the gulf of Gera, which is in agreement with data on the wastewater infrastructure. The indicator quality of the micropollutants to detect wastewater was compared with electrical conductivity (EC) data. Due to their anthropogenic nature and low detection limits, the micropollutants are superior to EC regarding both sensitivity and selectivity. The concentrations of atrazine, diuron, and isoproturon did not exceed the annual average of their environmental quality standards (EQS) defined by the European Commission. At two sampling locations irgarol 1051 exceeded its annual average EQS value but not the maximum allowable concentration of 16 ng L. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate (the active ingredient in Paxil) is a pharmaceutical compound used for the treatment of depression, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Paroxetine (PA) is extensively metabolized in humans, with about 97% of the parent compound being excreted as metabolites through the urine and feces of patients. Therefore PA and metabolites have the potential to be discharged into wastewater treatment systems after therapeutic use. PA and its major human metabolite (PM) were investigated using studies designed to describe physical/chemical characteristics and determine their fate and effects in the aquatic environment. A significant portion of the PM entering a wastewater treatment plant would be expected to biodegrade given the higher activated sludge solids concentrations present in a typical wastewater treatment plant. The potential for direct photolysis of PM is also possible based on photolysis results for PA itself. These results provide strong support for expecting that PA and PM residuals will not persist in the aquatic environment after discharge from a wastewater treatment facility This conclusion is also supported by the results of a USGS monitoring study, where no PM was detected in any of the samples at the 260 ng/L reporting limit. The results presented here also demonstrate the importance of understanding the human metabolism of a pharmaceutical so that the appropriate molecule(s) is used for fate and effects studies. In addition to the PA fate studies, PM was investigated using studies designed to determine potential environmental effects and a predicted no effect level (PNEC). The average measured activated sludge respiration inhibition value (EC50) for PM was 82 mg/L. The measured Microtox EC50 value was 33.0 mg/L, while the Daphnia magna EC50 value was 35.0 mg/L. The PNEC for PM was calculated to be 35.0 mug/L. Fate data were then used in a now watershed-based environmental risk assessment model, PhATE, to predict environmental concentrations (PECs). Comparison of the calculated PECs with the PNEC allows an assessment of potential environmental risk. Within the 1-99% of stream segments in the PhATE model, PEC values ranged from 0.003 to 100 ng/L. The risk assessment PEC/PNEC ratios ranged from similar to3 x 10(-8) to similar to3 x 10(-3), indicating a wide margin of safety, since a PEC/PNEC ratio < 1 is generally considered to represent a low risk to the environment. In addition, Microtox studies carried out on PM biodegradation byproducts indicated no detectable residual toxicity. Any compounds in the environment as a result of the biodegradation of PM should be innocuous polar byproducts that should not exert any toxic effects.

AB Sewage effluents are widely recognised as the main source of emerging contaminants, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals in surface waters. A full-scale granular activated carbon (GAC) plant has been installed as an advanced technology for the removal of these contaminants, in a major sewage treatment works (STW) in South-West England as part of the UK National Demonstration Programme for EDCs. This study presented for the first time, an assessment of the impact of a recently commissioned, post-tertiary GAC plant in the removal of emerging contaminants in a working STW. Through regular sampling followed by solid-phase extraction and analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). a significant reduction in the concentrations of steroidal estrogens was observed (>43-64%). In addition, significant reductions were observed for many of the pharmaceutical compounds such as mebeverine (84-99%), although the reduction was less dramatic for some of the more widely used pharmaceuticals analysed, including carbamazepine and propranolol (17-23%).

AB Relative stable aerobic granular sludge (AGS) formed in a newly constructed continue flow microbial fuel cell (cf-MFC) system. AGS bulking caused by filamentous over-growth was observed in treating simulated wastewater with COD concentration of around 1,000mg/L after more than 50d. Addition of pharmaceutical wastewater in the influent of the cf-MFC at COD concentration of around 1,500mg/L alleviated AGS bulking obviously, with average COD removal efficiency of 82.2%. However, AGS self-collapse happened after influent COD concentration of the pharmaceutical wastewater increased to around 2,500mg/L, corresponding COD removal efficiency decreased to 58.2% dramatically. High simultaneous nitrification and denitrification performance was obtained in the cf-MFC, which was affected by the addition of pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, appearance variations of the AGS under different operation conditions were shown.

ID RISK
AB A rapid, sensitive and highly specific HPLC-MS/MS method with direct on-line preparation was applied for the determination of 20 common pharmaceuticals in hospital and urban wastewater. Median drug concentrations were quite similar in the majority of samples, cerca 1 mu g L-1 ranging from 0.06 to 2.67 mu g L-1 in both water. Pharmaceutical hospital contribution, below 1 %, was negligible, as compared to the huge amount in the municipal plant flow. Due to only partial elimination in the plant, hundreds of kilograms of harmful waste per year are discharged in the River Seine. Therefore, to reduce potential human and environmental exposure, a topic of major concern, an efficient drug treatment procedure should be used at the municipal plant stage in order to reduce urban wastewater pollution. The HPLC-MS/MS method could be a very useful tool to optimize the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment process.

AB Artificial sweeteners are used as sugar substitutes in our daily lives yet consumption and release patterns are currently unknown in Australia. The spatial distribution of artificial sweetener consumption and WWTP effluent emission in Australia was estimated by wastewater analysis. Wastewater influent and effluent samples were collected from 69 WWTPs across Australia during the week of the 2016 Australian census. Mean population weighted per capita loads for individual artificial sweeteners (cyclamate, aspartame, acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin) ranged from 0.12 +/- 0.14 mg d(-1)p(-1) for aspartame to 6.9 +/- 2.8 mg d(-1)p(-1) for acesulfame with 1004 kg of these artificial sweeteners being consumed daily in Australia. Significant removal of aspartame (100%), cyclamate (92 +/- 18%) and saccharin (88 +/- 21%) was observed during wastewater treatment. The average per capita release to the environment for individual artificial sweeteners (cyclamate, acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin) ranged from 230 +/- 780 mg d(-1) 1000p(-1) (cyclamate) to 3800 +/- 1400 mg d(-1) 1000p(-1) (sucralose). The daily release of artificial sweeteners from Australian WWTPs was estimated to be 142 kg suggesting that 14% of the artificial sweeteners consumed in Australia are released into the environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first wastewater study to estimate the occurrence and population-normalized artificial sweetener consumption and emission in Australia.

AB Pharmaceutical degradation in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) represents a challenge since municipal wastewater and hospital effluents contain pharmaceuticals in low concentrations (recalcitrant and persistent in WWTP) and biodegradable organic matter (BOM) is the main pollutant. This work shows the feasibility of coupling electro-oxidation with a biological system for the simultaneous removal of recalcitrant drugs (bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, indomethacin and sulfamethoxazole (BGIS)) and BOM from wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained without affecting the performance of activated sludge. BGIS degradation was performed by advanced electrochemical oxidation and the activated sludge process for BOM degradation in a continuous reactor. The selected electrochemical parameters from microelectrolysis tests (1.2Ls(-1) and 1.56mAcm(-2)) were maintained to operate a filter press laboratory reactor FM01-LC using boron-doped diamond as the anode. The low current density was chosen in order to remove drugs without decreasing BOM and chlorine concentration control, so as to avoid bulking formation in the biological process. The wastewater previously treated by FM01-LC was fed directly (without chemical modification) to the activated sludge reactor to remove 100% of BGIS and 83% of BOM; conversely, the BGIS contained in wastewater without electrochemical pre-treatment were persistent in the biological process and promoted bulking formation.

AB Sericin protein having high additional value in many industries such as textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is always discharged in silk reeling wastewater which causes serious environmental pollution. In this paper, different combined process of acidulation precipitation-ultrafiltration (UF)-nanofiltration (NF) was investigated and optimized to recover high-purity sericin protein from silk reeling wastewater. Inner-pressure hollow fiber polyamide NF composite membrane was prepared through the interfacial polymerization. The results showed that the recovery of sericin protein in the supernatant liquid after acidulation precipitation treatment could reach 72.1% when using the UF membrane (MWCO 6000)-NF membrane integrated process. When the mixture of sericin protein precipitation and concentrated liquid after UF and NF filtration was diluted four times, the better comprehensive results were achieved. The loss rate of sericin protein and the salt content of concentrated liquid was 34.1% and 29.1%, respectively while the conductivity after UF membrane treatment was lower than that of the local tap water. More than 86% sericin protein from cocoon cooking wastewater, refining wastewater and mixed wastewater could be recovered by the optimized UF-NF combination process. Using 0.2 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid as the cleaning agent could effectively recover the water flux of NF membrane. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   The removal efficiency of ampicillin, doxycycline, sulfathiazole and tylosin; the antibiotic degradation degree after electrolysis; and the toxicity and qualitative composition of antibiotic solutions after electrocoagulation were determined in the experiments.
   HPLC-QTOF was used for quantitative and qualitative determination. The eco-toxicity was assessed using the MARA (R) assay.
   After electrocoagulation, the concentration of ampicillin, doxycycline, sulfathiazole and tylosin in wastewater decreased 3.6 +/- 3.2%, similar to 100%, 3.3 +/- 0.4% and 3.1 +/- 0.3%, respectively. Doxycycline was the only antibiotic effectively removed from wastewater during electrocoagulation. Simultaneously, part of this antibiotic underwent oxidative degradation. As a result of this process, the eco-toxicity in the reaction environment decreased. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bio-based fertilizers including farmyard manure, sewage sludge, meat and bone meal, composts, digestates and derived products are nutrient-rich fertilizers. They deliver organic matter but may pose the risk to contaminate soils by pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, resistance genes or pathogens. Manure and sewage sludge are increasingly used in biogas plants for energy production with the residue being used as fertilizer. It is therefore important to understand the fate of pharmaceuticals during anaerobic digestion. In the present study, 29 biogas plants from three countries were studied. The different input materials and output after digestion were analyzed for selected examples of antibiotics from three different classes, namely tetracyclines (TCs), sulfonamides (SAs) and fluoroquinolones (FQs). These classes are frequently found in animal manures and sewage sludge and display differing mobility and persistence. The results revealed that antibiotics could be detected in 81% of the substrates derived from animal manures and sewage sludge and in 83% of the digestates. Antibiotics were determined with the highest frequency of 100% in sewage sludge where especially ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were found. Highest concentrations were analyzed in poultry dung with in maximum of 8.6 and 8.2 mg/kg DW of enrofloxacin and tetracycline, respectively. After digestion, slightly lower concentrations of antibiotics were determined for most substrates. However, in one biogas plant using poultry dung as an input material a maximum concentration of 15.2 mg/kg DW of tetracycline was determined in the digestate, which after separation accounted for 29.8 mg/kg DW of tetracycline in the liquid phase.

AB Pollution status of six anticancer agents in the river water and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Japan was surveyed with comparative analysis of the levels of four microbial and one psychotropic pharmaceuticals widely used for therapeutic medication. The area of survey is located in the Kanzaki-Ai River basin which is a major subcatchment of the Yodo River basin and is centered on a highly populated area that includes the middle and downstream reaches of the Yodo River. Selected cancer agents were bicalutamide, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, doxifluridine, tamoxifen, and tegafur. A combination of strong anion solid-phase extraction cartridge under pH 11 for adsorption and optimization of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) system was necessary to ensure high recovery rates (63-124 % for river water and 52-115 % for STP effluent). The year-round survey of these compounds in four seasons showed that all anticancer compounds were detected at median concentrations ranged from not detected to 32 ng/L in the river water and from not detected to 245 ng/L in the effluents of sewage treatment plants not using ozonation. In the case of bicalutamide (an active antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer), the maximum concentration detected was 254 ng/L in river water and 1032 ng/L in non-ozonated sewage treatment plant effluents. Based on the mass balance, sewage treatment plants were the primary sources of anticancer compounds as well as the other pharmaceuticals in the river, and the attenuation effect of the river water was small. Ozonation at sewage treatment plants was effective in removing these compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the existence of bicalutamide, doxifluridine, and tegafur in the river environment.

AB Water pollution has been a major concern for agrarian societies like Pakistan. Pharmaceutical industries are amongst the foremost contributor to industrial waste. Present study addresses the generation of oxidative stress caused by 2 months exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater in rats and their response to oral treatment with vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. The rats were randomized into five groups (n = 5) named as negative control, pharmaceutical wastewater (PEW) 100 %, PEW 10 %, PEW 1 %, and PEW 100 % + vitamin E. Oxidative damage in rats was evaluated by estimation of the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver, kidney, and blood/plasma. Exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater significantly decreased the activities of T-SOD and CAT and concentration of H2O2 in the liver and kidney and blood/plasma. Exposure to 100 % pharmaceutical wastewater exhibited a maximum decline in T-SOD activity, and activity was reduced to only 63.57 U/mL, 32.65, and 43.57 U/mg of protein in the plasma, kidney, and liver, respectively. Exposure to wastewater minimized activity CAT to 89.25 U/g of hemoglobin, 54.36, and 62.95 U/mg of protein in the blood, kidney, and liver, respectively. Treatment with vitamin E significantly increased the activity of T-SOD and CAT. However, increase in concentration of H2O2 was also observed in vitamin E exposed rats. Histopathology of the kidney revealed coagulative necrosis of renal epithelial cells and peritubular congestion. Endocardium showed infiltration of inflammatory cells and cellular breakdown in some areas. Lung sections exhibited atelectasis and emphysema of alveoli suggesting decline in lung function. The anatomy of the liver was also compromised due to severe degeneration and cellular swelling. The present study concluded that pharmaceutical wastewater induced severe oxidative stress in Wistar rats and ensued in histopathological lesions in several vital organs suggesting its high toxicity. Non-enzymatic antioxidant vitamin E may ameliorate oxidative stress induced by pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB In this study, the anaerobic treatment of high-strength antibiotic production wastewater and the development of a mathematical model for the treatment were attempted. Anaerobic treatability was investigated using synthetic solutions and original wastewater of which the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined. Initial COD of solutions was increased from 3,000 to 43,000 mg O-2/liter in an anaerobic bioreactor. The bioreactor pH was maintained at 6.5-7.5. The temperature was kept constant at 37 +/- 1degreesC. Raw materials and original wastewater containing penicillin antibiotics were obtained from Fako Pharmaceutical Factory (Fako) in Istanbul, Turkey. Anaerobic sludge used for treatment was obtained from Pakmaya Baker's Yeast Producing Factory (Pakmaya) in Izmit, Turkey and the Fako. A mathematical model based on substrate (total COD) concentration was developed assuming that only three consecutive reactions, namely, hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis, are significant. From the experimental data, a model that can be used for COD calculation as a function of time was developed using the first- and the second-order kinetic approaches. Making use of the developed model equation, it was proved that the anaerobic treatment of high strength (COD > 25,000 mg O-2/liter) antibiotic production wastewater fits the second-order kinetics.

AB The performance of a sequencing batch biofilter integrating anaerobic/aerobic conditions in one tank to treat a pharmaceutical wastewater effluent was studied. A pilot reactor, packed with a porous volcanic stone (puzzolane) was used in the study. The reactor operated as a sequencing batch biofilter, SBB, with reaction times varying for the anaerobic stage from 8 to 24 h and for the aerobic one from 4 to 12 h. The volume of exchange was from 16 to 88%. The pharmaceutical wastewater contained organic chemicals including phenols and o-nitroaniline, a concentration of organic matter that varied from 28,400 to 72,200 mg/L (as total COD), 280 to 605 mg N-NH4/L, and 430 to 650 mg SST/L. In order to acclimatize the microorganisms to the industrial wastewater, the organic load was increased stepwise from 1 to 7.7 kg COD/m(3)/d. The adequate time was obtained when the removal efficiency of COD reached 80% or more. Maximal removal loads, associated to high removal efficiencies (95-97% as COD), varied from 4.6 to 5.7 kg COD/m(3)/d. Under these conditions color removal was 80% as Pt-Co units. Microtox analysis was performed to the wastewater and to the anaerobic and aerobic stages. It was observed that the aerobic stage was the responsible for wastewater detoxification. Results showed that the anaerobic/aerobic SBB was able to treat efficiently initial concentrations of the raw effluent up to 28,400 mg COD/L.

AB The combination of qualitative methods with quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in wastewater treatment plants using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry is presented. The selected pharmaceuticals were found at a low or medium level in raw wastewater, compared with previous studies around the world. The removal efficiencies of sulfamethoxazole in the four parallel biological treatment processes were similar. Data-independent and data-dependent mass spectrometry acquisition methods (All Ions MS/MS and auto MS/MS) were employed for qualitative analysis. Five of the 18 tentatively identified compounds resulted from data-independent acquisition mode were confirmed with standards. Thirty-nine pharmaceuticals and seven metabolites were tentatively identified using data-dependent acquisition mode. The parent pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, such as caffeine and its three metabolites (3-methylxanthine, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, and paraxanthine), were detected in wastewater. Irbesartan and valsartan were tentatively identified in both positive and negative modes. The present study demonstrates that both data-dependent and data-independent acquisitions are suitable and reliable for tentative determination of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in municipal wastewater.

AB This study focuses on the use of advanced oxidation processes as a tertiary treatment in wastewater treatment plants to degrade contaminants of emerging concern at the natural pH of the biologically treated wastewater. Different peroxide dosages and initial concentrations of a mix of three pharmaceuticals commonly present in wastewater (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen) were tested in a batch photoreactor. The addition of Fe2+ and TiO2 as catalysts was also tested with the aim of improving the degradation rate of the pharmaceuticals. Among the contaminants tested, ciprofloxacin was the pollutant that showed the best degradation. It was completely removed from water after 20 min of treatment under any of the experimental conditions assessed. High degradation percentages, between 89.83 and 100%, were achieved for ibuprofen, while carbamazepine shows the lowest degradation, ranging from 80.14 to 100%. In terms of global efficiency, a complete degradation was achieved when the concentration of the tested contaminants was similar to current concentration levels in urban wastewater effluents. The addition of the catalysts did not significantly improve the degradation rates.

AB Hospital wastewater contains a great variety of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs), mainly due to excretion by patients. These PhCs, called emerging pollutants, are not fully eliminated in treatment plants, and are consequently detected in various environmental matrices, contributing to bacterial resistance and adverse environmental impacts on water resources. This study explores a consumption-based approach to predict the contribution of PhCs to a Brazilian hospital's wastewater. This approach identifies the consumption of major pharmaceutical classes in the studied hospital. Overall, this approach demonstrates a unique opportunity to screen PhCs used in hospitals and identify priority pollutants in hospital wastewater.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has become an esteemed method to convert sewage sludge into biochar. Besides dewatering and disinfection the process is suggested to reduce the micropollutant load, which would be beneficial for the use of biochar as fertilizer. This study was designed to examine reduction of micropollutants and formation of transformation products during HTC using the example of diclofenac. We investigated compounds' removal at HTC conditions in inert experiments and in real samples. Results showed that HTC temperature (>190 degrees C) and pressure (similar to 15 bar) have the potential to fully degrade diclofenac in inert experiments and spiked sewage sludge (>99%) within 1 h. However, interfering effects hinder full removal in native samples resulting in 44% remaining diclofenac. Additionally, a combination of suspected-target and non-target analysis using LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS resulted in the determination of six transformation products. These products have been reported in biochar from HTC for the first time, although other studies described them for other processes like advanced oxidation. Based on the detected transformation products, we proposed a degradation mechanism reflecting HTC reactions such as dehydroxylation and decarboxylation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals formulation industry poses a problem for water pollution control due to complexity and variability of pollutant source and characteristics. In this study, wastewater character of a pharmaceuticals formulation industry and its treatability were experimentally investigated. Three groups of products that are commonly used were selected. These are liquid products, lacque tablet and antibiotics. Biological treatability and pretreatment by ozone oxidation with or without catalyst were assessed. Liquid production wastewater proved to be capable of being directly handled by the biological treatment, while lacque tablet manufacturing wastewater required pretreatment for effective biological treatment. Biological treatment of antibiotic manufacturing wastewater was found to be having no effect with or without pretreatment.

AB In this work, a study on the occurrence and behavior of illicit drugs and metabolites in sewage water systems has been made. A comprehensive dataset was obtained by analyzing illicit drugs daily in influent and effluent waters from three sewage treatment plants (STPs), over three different weeks. To complete this dataset, monitoring was conducted during an international pop/rock festival, an interesting facet within this study. The STPs selected were sited along the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Castellon province, Valencia region) and represent towns of different sizes, with appreciable variations in the population in the summer period. Illicit drug concentrations in the influents were low, except during the celebration of the music festival, when the levels of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, amphetamine, MDA and MDMA increased. Comparing the influent and effluent concentration data allowed the rough estimation of the removal of illicit drugs and metabolites by each STP. Removal efficiencies were estimated between 75 and 100% for most of the analytes under investigation. The loads discharged into the aquatic ecosystem were also calculated from effluent data. Weekly discharges of drugs and metabolites via effluent sewage waters presented values commonly below 10 g for each individual drug, with the exception of benzoylecgonine, which usually exceeded this level. The increase in population and drug consumption during the music event led to a notable increase in the weekly discharges, reaching values up to 406 g of MDMA and 122 g of benzoylecgonine.

AB Wastewater treatability investigations were conducted for a specialty batch pharmaceuticals production facility which typically produces small quantities of numerous chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Production campaigns typically range from two days to four weeks in duration. Due to these production changes, the organic loading and chemical makeup of the wastewater constantly varies, resulting in less than optimum treatment plant performance. In addition, the facility planned to increase production in the future, thereby increasing wastewater flow and organic load.

AB Ozone oxidation is proven to be an effective solution for the degradation of selected oestrogenic active substances detected in secondary wastewaters such as beta-oestradiol, oestrone, oestriol, 17-alpha-ethinyloestradiol, mestranol, daidzeine, beta-sitosterol, bisphenol A, norethisterone, 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-iso-nonylphenol, up to their limit of detection. The matrix-effect of wastewater was investigated performing ozone experiments under batch mode and continuous mode using drinking water and a wastewater issued from a local plant both spiked with the non-detected substances. The results obtained indicate that the wastewater matrix greatly affects the kinetics of ozone reaction with these substances but does not really change the related reactivity scale. The ozone dose corresponding to the full conversion of target EDCs consequently increases as their oxidation takes place competing with reactions of background pollutants represented by the COD and DOC content. However, a usual dose close to 12 mg/L was found sufficient to provide high degradation yields for all substances studied while 35% of COD was removed. This is a contribution to the numerous current works focused on technologies able to improve the quality of water discharged from wastewater treatment plants, both considering conventional parameters and emerging contaminants.

AB In Mediterranean countries, reuse of reclaimed water is essential for crop irrigation. The occurrence of pesticides in agro-wastewater may represent a risk for human health and environment owing to their release in soil and translocation to plants. The novelty of this work relies on the reuse of reclaimed agro-wastewater polluted with thirteen pesticides for lettuce irrigation. Removing of pesticide residues in agro-wastewater was carried out using natural sunlight and TiO2/Na2S2O8 in a pilot facility located in Murcia (SE of Spain). The studied pesticides were azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpropham, flutolanil, flutriafol, isoxaben, methoxyfenozide, myclobutanil, napropamide, prochloraz, propamocarb, propyzamide and triadimenol, which are commonly used in southeast Spain to treat lettuces grown. Different heterogeneous and homogeneous processes were studied and compared. Previously, the optimization of the process for the selection of the best catalytic system was performed at lab-scale. TiO2 + S2O82-- was selected due to the greater effectiveness, achieving almost complete disappearance after about 400 kJ m(-2) of cumulative UVA exposure. No significant differences were observed in quality parameters of lettuce grown using treated and non-treated agro-wastewater.

AB A detailed study of the free and conjugated estrogen load discharged by the eight major sewage treatment plants into the Yodo River basin, Japan was carried out. Sampling campaigns were focused on the winter and autumn seasons from 2005 to 2008 and the free estrogens estrone(E1), 17 beta-estradiol(E2), estriol(E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol(EE2) as well as their conjugated (sulfate and glucuronide) forms. For both sewage effluent and river water E2 and El concentrations were greatest during the winter period (December March). This coincides with the period of lowest rainfall and lowest temperatures in Japan. El was the dominant estrogenic component in effluent (means of 10-50 ng/L) followed by E2 (means of 0.5-3 ng/L). The estrogen sulfate conjugates were found intermittently in the 0.5-1.7 ng/L concentration range in the sewage effluents. The greatest estrogen exposure was found to be in the Katsura River tributary which exceeded 1 ng/L E2-equivalents during the winter period. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The research investigates the treatment of real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater by synergic catalytic ozonation with iron-loaded zeolite A (Fe-Z) catalyst and electroflocculation process in a hybrid reactor. The wastewater was characterized by high organic content (COD =1220 mg/L) and turbidity 247 NTU. The experiments were conducted in a batch laboratory scale hybrid reactor with ozone spargers, metal electrodes, and suspended buckets loaded with (Fe-Z) catalyst. The effect of operational parameters of voltage (5-15 V), pH (5-9), ozone dose (0.2-0.4 mg/min), and catalyst dose (1-2 g/L) on COD and turbidity removal was studied with the mechanism explored. The obtained results showed the COD removal efficiency was 85.12 % and the turbidity of pharmaceutical wastewater reduced to 78 NTU at optimal conditions of voltage 5 V, pH 7, ozone dose 0.4 mg/min, and catalyst dose 1.5 g/L. The pharmaceutical removals achieved were 100 % for enrofloxacin and 90 % for amoxicillin. It is therefore concluded that the synergic process was found highly suitable for the effective treatment of veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater in the hybrid reactor as an effective option.

AB The primary source of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is the discharge of wastewater effluents. Pharmaceuticals are a large and diverse group of compounds. Among them, psychotropic substances are particularly interesting to study due to their specific known mode of action. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of wastewater effluents from a psychiatric hospital wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on several aquatic organisms. All the analyzed pharmaceuticals (10 compounds) were detected in WWTP effluents as well as in the receiving river. Although the environmental concentrations were generally at trace levels (ngL(-1) to gL(-1)), induce toxic effects were observed. This study showed the effects of the WWTP effluents on the oogenesis and/or embryogenesis of amphipod crustacean Gammarus fossarum, Japanese fish medaka Oryzias latipes, mollusk Radix peregra, and planarian Schmidtea polychroa. A decrease of the number of oocytes and produced embryos was observed for G. fossarum and S. polychroa. Similarly, the hatching rate of R. peregra was affected by effluents. In the receiving river, the macroinvertebrate community was affected by the wastewater effluents discharge.

TI Determination of detoxification to Daphnia magna of four pharmaceuticals

SO CHEMOSPHERE
LA English
DT Article
DE Biodegradation; Daphnia; Detoxification; Pharmaceuticals; Sewage;
   Surfactants
ID MIXTURE TOXICITY; ANTIBIOTICS
AB Pharmaceuticals are bioactive compounds generally resistant to biodegradation, which can make them problematic when they are released into nature. The use pattern for pharmaceuticals means that they are discharged into water via sewage treatment plants. Also surfactants are discharged through sewage treatment plants, primarily due to their use in detergents and shampoos and other cleaners. In this study the acute toxicity to Daphnia magna of four pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, paracetamol and zinc pyrithione) and seven surfactants (C8 alkyl glucoside, C6 alkyl glucoside, sodium caprylimidiopropionate, tallow-trimethyl-ammonium chloride, potassium decylphosphate, propylheptanol ethoxylate and alkylmonoethanolamide ethoxylate) was determined. Abiotic (without activated sludge bacteria) and biotic (with activated sludge bacteria) detoxification was also determined. The 24-h EC50s ranged from 2 mu g L-1 for the most toxic substance (zinc pyrithione) to 2 g L-1 for the least toxic compound (C6 alkyl glucoside). Detoxification rates determined as the ratio between initial EC50 and EC50 after 1 week in water with activated sludge bacteria ranged from 0.4 (paracetamol) to 13 (zinc pyrithione). For most of these chemicals detoxification rate decreased after 1 week, but for one (alkylmonoethanolamide ethoxylate) it increased from about 2 to 30 times after 2 weeks. Many of these chemicals were "detoxified" also abiotically at about the same rate as biotically. Further studies are needed to determine the degradation products that were precipitated (aggregated) for some of the tested chemicals. Altogether, this study has shown that there are large differences in toxicity among chemicals entering sewage treatment plants, but also that the detoxification of them can differ. Therefore, the detoxification should receive more attention in the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals entering sewage treatment plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This is the first study dealing with removal of the pharmaceutical substances in municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) from Peru and the impact of these compounds in surface waters receiving treated wastewater. To this aim, samples from MWWTP of Lima (Peruvian Coast), MWWTP of Cusco, Puno and Juliaca (Peruvian Highlands), as well surface water (confluence of Torococha and Coata rivers in Juliaca) were analyzed. A total of 38 target pharmaceuticals were included in this study and were determined by Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Around 60% and 75% of the target pharmaceuticals could be quantified in surface water and MWWTPs, respectively. Acetaminophen was the drug found at the highest concentration, and it was present in all the treated wastewater samples reaching average values above 100 mu g/L in the department of Puno. The gabapentin anti-epileptic drug (up to 11.85 mu g/L in MWWTP Lima) and the antibiotics clarithromycin, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin (1.86 to 4.47 mu g/L in MWWTP Lima) were also found at moderate concentrations in the treated wastewater. In surface water, the highest concentration corresponded also to acetaminophen (28.70 mu g/L) followed by sulfamethoxazole (4.36 mu g/L). As regards the pharmaceuticals removal, data of this work showed that the MWWTP Cusco (aerobic biologic process by synthetic trickling filters as secondary treatment) was more efficient than the MWWTP Lima (a preliminary treatment that combines grilles, sand trap, degreaser-aerated and sieved of 1.0 mm). However, many pharmaceuticals (around 50% of the compounds investigated) presented concentrations in treated wastewater similar or even higher than in influent wastewater. The environmental ecological risk of pharmaceuticals was assessed based on calculated Risk Quotient (RQ) in the treated wastewater and surface water from the concentration data found in the samples. According to our data, three antibiotics (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin) and the analgesic acetaminophen posed high environmental risk (RQ = 1) on the aquatic environment. In the river, all antibiotics (except norfloxacin) as well as the analgesic-anti-inflammatory compounds acetaminophen, diclofenac posed a high environmental risk (RQ = 1). Based on data reported in this work for the first time in water samples from Peru, it can be deduced that the treatment processes applied in important cities from Peru are not enough efficient to remove pharmaceuticals in wastewater. As a consequence, severe environmental risks associated to the presence of pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater and surface water are expected; so complementary treatment processes should be implemented in the MWWTPs for a more efficient elimination of these compounds.

AB The aim of the present work was to evaluate, at microcosm level, the capacity of constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove veterinary pharmaceutical compounds, from wastewater. Results indicated that CWs have potential to mitigate the release of veterinary drugs, namely enrofloxacin (ENR, a fluoroquinolone) and tetracycline (TET, tetracyclines family). Removal efficiencies of 94% and 98% where achieved for TET and ENR, respectively, when treating pigfarm wastewater effluent doped at 100 mu g L-1 drug level, along twelve weeks. Occurrence of adsorption of the drugs to CWs substrate may be the predominant mechanism for ENR, although for TET there are signs that degradation is also occurring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is usually complex and highly toxic, mostly containing antibiotics. The conventional activated sludge technology is unsatisfactory in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater owing to the impact of antibiotic toxicity. In this study, a novel whole-cell biocatalyst that can accelerate the degradation of antibiotics was developed by displaying ?-lactamase on the cell surface of Aspergillus niger. The biocatalyst showed high enzyme activity (6.53 ? 1.62 U/g dry weight) and stable performance. Cefamezin (80.45%), amoxicillin, and ampicillin were completely degraded by the biocatalyst A. niger-Bla within 1 h owing to the effect of ?-lactamase on the ?-lactam ring. A. niger mycelial pellets were used as biological carriers to construct aerobic granular sludge (AGS), which was used to treat actual pharmaceutical wastewater containing ?-lactam antibiotics. The A. niger-Bla system significantly improves the removal of antibiotics (>60%) and the overall performance of the reactor. The modified A. niger-Bla AGS reduces the impact of antibiotics and maintain the richness and diversity of AGS microbial community, thus improving the system?s overall performance and maintaining the stability of AGS. This technology provides a novel idea to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics.

TI Quantification of Active Ingredient Losses from Formulating
   Pharmaceutical Industries and Contribution to Wastewater Treatment Plant
   Emissions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this work, emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from formulating pharmaceutical industries (FPIs) were investigated for the first time based on detailed production information and compared to overall API emissions in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. At two municipal WWTPs, both receiving wastewater from several FPIs, two months' daily effluent samples were collected and measured using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Thirty-three APIs formulated during the sampling period as well as >120 organic contaminants commonly present in WWTP effluents were quantified. On the basis of their time patterns and manufacturing data, industrial contributions were found for 22 of 26 APIs (85%) detected in the samples and processed by the FPIs. API emissions from FPIs led to daily concentration increases of up to 300-fold, despite pretreatment of the industrial wastewater. However, emissions from FPIs seemed to depend on the type of formulating activity, with granulation and mixing being most prone to API losses. Losses from FPIs were responsible for the highest concentrations and for up to 60% of the daily total API emissions measured. Furthermore, screening for suspects in LC-HRMS data resulted in the detection of unexpected emissions from FPIs, demonstrating the value of these data to comprehensively assess industrial API losses. Overall, this study showed that FPIs were relevant contributors of APIs emitted in the WWTP effluents, although only a minor fraction (<1%) of the total processed API quantity was lost to the wastewater, and despite the small percentage (<5%) of FPI wastewater compared to the total wastewater flow.

ID ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES; DEGRADATION
AB The applications of novel Fe-TiO2 composite capable of incorporating in-situ dual effect (photocatalysis and photo-Fenton) have been studied for the treatment of real pharmaceutical effluent using batch and continuous reactors. The treatment time was reduced to a great extent using these novel composite beads along with significant reduction in COD (83%). Coagulation using FeCl3 as a coagulating agent was used as a pre-treatment step prior to in-situ dual process. The parametric optimization in case of in-situ dual process was carried out in batch mode under artificial UV-A irradiations. The biodegradability index (BOD5/COD) of wastewater became 0.71 from 0.172 after 5 h of treatment via in-situ dual process. The intermediates present in the real wastewater before and after the treatment process, were carefully identified through GC-MS analysis based on which a tentative degradation mechanism for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater has been proposed. The treated wastewater was found to be completely non-toxic as confirmed through cyto-toxicity as well as acute toxicity analysis. The field-scale applications of fixed-bed in-situ dual process using Fe-TiO2 composite beads were validated from successful treatment (80% COD reduction) of real wastewater (5 L) in less than 120 min in a pilot-scale once-though cascade reactor under natural solar irradiations. Moreover, Fe-TiO2 composite beads represented an outstanding recyclability efficiency (> 70 recycles) without depicting any significant reduction in their activity as confirmed through various characterization techniques.

AB The production and usage of antibiotics have been increasing rapidly with the improving quality of life and the rapid development of aquaculture, thus inducing the introduction of these antibiotics residues into the environment, increasing water pollution levels. Due to bioaccumulation, bacteriostatic activity, many of these threaten aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Here we prepared double-shelled ZnSnO3 hollow cubes for efficient photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic wastewater. The ZnSnO3, synthesized via co-precipitation, shows superior performance and stability compared to that prepared by hydrothermal and template-assisted methods. The prepared ZnSnO3 effectively photocatalyzed the degradation of not only ciprofloxacin and sulfamonomethoxine pharmaceutical wastewater, but also methylene blue, rhodamine B and methyl orange dye wastewater. The hollow structure facilitates the adsorption of dye molecules and provides a better platform for direct interaction between dye molecules and photocatalysts. Moreover, the antibacterial activity test for photocatalytic degradation effluent indicated that the biotoxicity of CIP toward Escherichia coli DH5a was eliminated after the ZnSnO3 photocatalysis under simulated irradiation. This study not only demonstrates an efficient photocatalyst, but also further indicates the effectiveness of photocatalytic technology in the treatment of antibiotic wastewater.

AB Estrogens are one of the micro-pollutants in the wastewater which have detrimental effects on water living organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of ultrasound to reduce the estrogen (E1) and 17 betaestradiol (E2) from municipal wastewater. Hence, a cylindrical batch reactor was designed. The effects of powers, frequency, exposure time and pH on reduction efficiency were investigated. The residual concentration of E1 and E2 hormones was measured in reactor effluent by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. The results showed that ultrasound removed 85-96% of both E1 and E2 hormones after 45 min while other parameters changes in the range of their operations. Also, the frequency and power of ultrasound had a significant effect on reduction efficiency of hormones while the exposure had no significant effect. Furthermore, the interaction of power and frequency reduced their efficacy to 64.3% (P-value = 0.005). The result also indicated that the ultrasound waves have high ability to reduce Steroid hormones from municipal wastewater. The proposed method can be considered as one of the significant strategies for reduction or destruction of hormones from wastewater due to the non-generation of dangerous byproducts and the low energy consumption.

DE organic pollution parameter; urban wastewater; UV absorbance 254
AB The present study aims to fill the data gap analysis in urban wastewaters characteristics in Benin and its statistical analysis. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Total Phosphorus (TP) and UV Absorbance at 254 nm, were determined on domestic (greywater and blackwater) and industrial (hospital, pharmaceutical and commercial laundry) wastewater in Cotonou city. Analysis of variance showed a strong significant difference in the physico-chemistry of the various effluents. The pharmaceutical wastewater has the highest concentration of organic pollution (COD = 5,912 +/- 1,026 mg/L, Abs.UV254 = 2.667 +/- 0.327 cm(-1)). The organic load of blackwater is mainly in particulate and biodegradable form. Besides, the correlation study showed the limits of pH and EC as an indicator of organic load. Furthermore, the choice of COD or BOD5 as the main design parameter would be limited to blackwater treatment. Abs.UV254 was found to be the parameter having a strong relationship with other parameters of all effluents except blackwater. It then takes priority over COD for the treatment of greywater and industrial wastewater. For future wastewater treatment plant design, we recommend to consider Abs.UV254 as an important parameter.

AB The organic wastewater obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratory with ultra-high COD value (>15,000 mg/L) was treated by Fenton and Electrolytic oxidation technology separately. Single factor experiments of Fenton process and Box-bohnken design (BBD) method for Electrolytic oxidation technology were used to find their optimal conditions. BOD5 was measured to evaluate the biodegradability of the sample. Single pretreatment technology could improve the biodegradability of the organic wastewater a little, but not significantly. The combined sequence of the two technologies, Fenton-EOT process (Fenton first then Electrolytic), EOT-Fenton process (Electrolytic first then Fenton), F&E Process (Fenton and Electrolytic oxidation occurred simultaneity) was compared. The Fenton-EOT process had the highest COD removal efficiency. All the combined processes used in this study could improve the biodegradability of the raw wastewater significantly. Luminous bacteria detection was conducted to measure the biotoxicity of the organic wastewater and the effluents. Fenton-EOT was the optimal pretreatment process due to its advantages in decreasing the biotoxicity and improving degradability of the raw water.

AB Adyar and Cooum, the two rivers intersecting Chennai city, are exposed to serious pollution due to the release of large quantities of dumped waste, untreated wastewater and sewage. Sediments can act as repository for emerging organic contaminants. Hence, we have monitored the occurrence and risk associated with plasticizers [six phthalic acid esters (PAEs), bis(2-ethyl hexyl adipate) (DEHA)] and bisphenol A (BPA) in surface riverine sediments of Adyar and Cooum rivers from residential/commercial, industrial and electronic waste recycling sites. sigma(7)plasticizers (PAEs + DEHA) in the Adyar riverine sediment (ARS) and Cooum riverine sediment (CRS) varied between 51.82-1796 and 28.13-856 ng/g, respectively. More than three-fourth of sigma(7)plasticizers came from bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), in accordance with the high production and usage of this compound. BPA varied between 10.70-2026 and 7.58-1398 ng/g in ARS and CRS, respectively. Average concentrations of plasticizers and BPA were four times higher in electronic waste (e-waste) recycling sites when compared with industrial and residential/commercial sites. BPA and DEHP showed a strong and significant correlation (R-2 = 0.7;p < 0.01) in the e-waste sites thereby indicating common source types. Sites present at close proximity to raw sewage pumping stations contributed to 70% of the total BPA observed in this study. For the derived pore water concentration of plasticizers and BPA, the ecotoxicological risk has been found to be higher in ARS over CRS. However, sediment concentrations in all the sites of ARS and CRS were much below the recommended serious risk concentration for human (SRChuman) and serious risk concentration for ecotoxicological (SRCeco).

AB Removal of six active pharmaceutical ingredients in wastewater was investigated using chlorine dioxide (ClO2) or peracetic acid (PAA) as chemical oxidants. Four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid) and two lipid-regulating agents (gemfibrozil and clofibric acid, a metabolite of clofibrate) were used as target substances at 40 mu g/L initial concentration. Three different wastewaters types originating from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used. One wastewater was collected after extended nitrogen removal in activated sludge, one after treatment with high-loaded activated sludge without nitrification, and one from the final effluent from the same plant where nitrogen removal was made in trickling filters for nitrification and moving-bed biofilm reactors for denitrification following the high-loaded plant. Of the six investigated compounds, only clofibric acid and ibuprofen were not removed when treated with ClO2 up to 20 mg/L. With increasing PAA dose up to 50 mg/L, significant removal of most of the pharmaceuticals was observed except for the wastewater with the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD). This indicates that chemical oxidation with ClO2 could be used for tertiary treatment at WWTPs for active pharmaceutical ingredients, whereas PAA was not sufficiently efficient.

AB In this study, the occurrence and sources of five cataloged antibiotics and metabolites were studied in Jiulongjiang River basin, south China. Nineteen antibiotics and 13 metabolites were detected in water samples from 16 river sampling sites, wastewater from 5 swine-raising facilities, and effluent from 5 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results showed that 12 antibiotics and 6 metabolites were detected in river water samples. Sulfonamides (SAs) and their metabolites were detected at high concentrations (8.59-158.94 ng/L). Tetracyclines (TCs) and their metabolites were frequently detected in swine wastewater, and the maximum concentration was up to the level in milligram per liter. Macrolides (MLs) and beta-lactams (beta-Ls) were found in all WWTP effluent samples and some river samples, while they were never found in any of the swine wastewater samples. SAs and quinolones (QNs) were detected in all samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 16 surface water samples was applied to achieve the spatial distribution characteristics of antibiotics in the Jiulongjiang River. As a result, two categories were obviously obtained. Principal component analysis and redundancy analysis showed that TCs and SAs as well as their metabolites were the major antibiotics in Jiulongjiang River, and they mainly originated from swine wastewater, while the QNs, MLs, and beta-Ls in the Jiulongjiang River came from WWTP effluent.

AB Reclaimed wastewater is an important source of irrigation in semiarid and arid zones. Here we report data on carbamazepine (CBZ) uptake by cucumber plants in hydroponic culture and greenhouse experiments using different soil types irrigated with fresh water or reclaimed wastewater. Data obtained from the hydroponic culture experiments suggest that CBZ is mainly translocated by water mass flow, and thus it is concentrated and accumulated to the largest extent in the mature/older leaves. Carbamazepine concentration in cucumber fruits and leaves was negatively correlated with soil organic matter content. The concentrations of CBZ in the roots and stems were relatively low, and most CBZ in the plant (76-84% of total uptake) was detected in the leaves. A greenhouse experiment using fresh water and reclaimed wastewater spiked, or not, with CBZ at 1 mu g L-1 (typical concentration in effluents) revealed that CBZ can be taken up and bioaccumulated from its background concentration in reclaimed wastewater. Bioaccumulation factor (calculated as the ratio of CBZ concentration in the plant to that in the soil solution) for the fruits (0.8-1) was significantly lower than the value calculated for the leaves (17-20).
   This study emphasizes the potential uptake of active pharmaceutical compounds by crops in organic-matter-poor soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and highlights the potential risks associated with this agricultural practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive study aimed at monitoring of temporal variability of illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, methamphetamine and cannabis) and therapeutic opiate methadone in a large-sized European city using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was conducted in the city of Zagreb, Croatia, during an 8-year period (2009-2016). The study addressed the impact of different sampling schemes on the assessment of temporal drug consumption patterns, in particular multiannual consumption trends and documented the possible errors associated with the one-week sampling scheme. The highest drug consumption prevalence was determined for cannabis (from 59 +/- 18 to 156 +/- 37 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years), followed by heroin (from 11 +/- 10 to 71 +/- 19 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years), cocaine (from 8.3 +/- 0.9 to 23 +/- 4.0 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years) and amphetamine (from 1.3 +/- 0.9 to 21 +/- 6.1 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years) whereas the consumption of MDMA was comparatively lower (from 0.18 +/- 0.08 to 2.7 doses +/- 0.7 doses/day/1000 inhabitants 15-64 years). The drug consumption patterns were characterized by clearly enhanced weekend and Christmas season consumption of stimulating drugs (cocaine, MDMA and amphetamine) and somewhat lower summer consumption of almost all drugs. Pronounced multiannual consumption trends were determined for most of the illicit drugs. The investigated 8-year period was characterized by a marked increase of the consumption of pure cocaine (1.6-fold), THC (2.7-fold), amphetamine (16-fold) and MDMA (15-fold) and a concomitant decrease (2.3-fold) of the consumption of pure heroin. The heroin consumption decrease was associated with an increase of methadone consumption (1.4-fold), which can be linked to its use in the heroin substitution therapy. The estimated number of average methadone doses consumed in the city of Zagreb was in a good agreement with the prescription data on treated opioid addicts in Croatia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence and distribution of typical of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which comprise two types of polycyclic musks (PCMs) including Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN) as well as six types of estrogens containing estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and bisphenol A (BPA), were investigated at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Jiangsu, China. Only raw wastewater was treated in WWTP A while WWTP B was serving an urban-industrialized area. In the influent, the concentrations of EE2 (2193-4437 ng L-1), E2 (1126-1170 ng L-1), and DES (268-421 ng L-1) were generally higher than the previously reported values, whereas the concentrations of HHCB (306-316 ng L-1), E1 (29-129 ng L-1), E3 (53 ng L-1), and BPA (26-176 ng L-1) were much lower than those reported in other previous studies. In addition, AHTN was not detected in either WWTP and E3 was not found in WWTP B. The detected processes including anaerobic/oxic process (A/O), combined orbal oxidation ditch process (C-orbal OD) and anaerobic/anoxic/anoxic/oxic membrane biological reactor (A/A/A/O-MBR) showed higher removal efficiencies for HHCB (67-71%) and EE2 (87%) than those in other previous studies. Besides, the total hydraulic retention time (HRT) ranged between 6.7 and 20.0 h, sludge retention time (SRT) ranged between 8 and 23 d, and water temperature ranged from 24.8 to 28.2 degrees C. The removal efficiencies for estrogens in biological processes were related to the following factors: the level of hydrophobic estrogens, the type of removal process (C-orbal OD was consistently less efficient in removing estrogens than A/O and A/A/A/O-MBR), and a high SRT or HRT (A/A/A/O-MBR with higher SRT and HRT showed higher and more stable removal of hydrophobic estrogens).

AB Heroin consumption in major cities across China was estimated for the first time via wastewater-based epidemiology. Influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from 49 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 24 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Concentrations of morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, and codeine were measured. Near complete removal of morphine by wastewater treatment processes was observed, whereas removal rates of codeine were slightly lower. Morphine loads were much higher than codeine loads at most WWTPs in China, a trend opposite to that in many European countries. In addition, morphine and codeine loads were strongly correlated at most WWTPs, indicating morphine and codeine in wastewater were predominantly from the same source, street heroin. At WWTPs in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, codeine loads were considerably higher than morphine loads, consistent with previous reports of codeine abuse (e.g., as cough syrup) among middle and high school students in Guangdong province. Heroin consumption was derived based on morphine loads and taking into account therapeutic use of morphine and codeine, as well as contribution of codeine and acetylcodeine in street heroin. Highest heroin consumption was observed in northwestern and southwestern China. The average heroin consumption of the sampled cities was 64.6 +/- 78.7 mg/1000 inh/d. The nation-wide average heroin consumption was much lower than that of methamphetamine, consistent with seizure data and numbers of registered heroin and methamphetamine users in China.

AB This study concerned the anaerobic treatment of five different industrial wastewaters with a diverse and complex chemical composition. The kinetics of biotransformation of this wastewater at different chemical oxygen demand (COD) were studied in a batch reactor. Wastewater from an amino acid producing industry (Fermex) and from a tank that received several types of wastewaters (collector) contained 0.83 gl(-1) and 0.085 gl-1 sulfate, respectively. During the study period of 20 days, methane formation was observed in all types of wastewaters. Studies on COD biodegradation showed the reaction velocity was higher for Fermex wastewater and lower for collector wastewater, with values of 0.0022 h(-1) and 0.0011 h(-1), respectively. A lower methanogenic activity of 0.163 g CH4 day(-1) g(-1) volatile suspended solids (VSS) and 0.20 g CH4 day(-1) g(-1) VSS, respectively, was observed for paper producing and brewery wastewater. Adapted granular sludge showed the best biodegradation of COD during the 20-day period. The sulfate-reducing activity in pharmaceutical and collector wastewater was studied. A positive effect of sulfate-reducing activity on methanogenic activity was noted for both types of wastewaters, both of which contained sulfate ions. All reactions of methane generation for the tested industrial wastewaters were first-order. The results of this study suggest that the tested wastewaters are amenable to anaerobic treatment.

AB Studies on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals show that the widely used pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and diclofenac are present in relevant concentrations in the environment. A pilot plant treating hospital wastewater with relevant concentrations of these pharmaceuticals was evaluated for its performance to reduce the concentration of the pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen was completely removed, whereas diclofenac yielded a residual concentration, showing the necessity of posttreatment to remove diclofenac, for example, activated carbon. Successively, detailed laboratory experiments with activated sludge from the same wastewater treatment plant showed bioremediation potential in the treatment plant. The biological degradation pathway was studied and showed a mineralisation of ibuprofen and degradation of diclofenac. The present microbes were further studied in laboratory experiments, and DGGE analyses showed the enrichment and isolation of highly purified cultures that degraded either ibuprofen or diclofenac. This research illuminates the importance of the involved bacteria for the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals in a wastewater treatment plant. A complete removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater will stimulate water reuse, addressing the worldwide increasing demand for clean and safe fresh water.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants and are released into surface waters resulting in toxin accumulation. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of solar irradiation on PhACs in wastewater using immobilized TiO2 present as a catalyst, and to study the potential of this photocatalysis technique as a post-treatment process for wastewater effluent. We treated a mixture of PhACs spiked in wastewater effluent and in deionized water as a control with simulated solar irradiation for 96h. Experiments were conducted with immobilized TiO2 (photocatalysis) and without (photolysis). First, TiO2 was successfully immobilized on 200-500 mu m sand by using a sol-gel method. The photocatalysis resulted in high removal efficiencies for poorly biodegradable PhACs in wastewater effluent: 100% for propranolol, 100% for diclofenac, and 76 +/- 3% for carbamazepine. Photodegradation of all four PhACs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the kinetic constant of photocatalysis was much higher than that of photolysis in the absence of a catalyst. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater effluent enhanced photodegradation of PhACs by producing reactive radicals. However, at the same time, DOM inhibited photodegradation, possibly because DOM reforms the oxidation intermediates of PhACs into parent compounds. From an application perspective, water depth was confirmed as a key factor in photodegradation of PhACs due to light attenuation by modelling and experimental results. In addition, after photocatalysis, toxicity of PhACs decreased and biodegradability of wastewater effluent increased slightly. In conclusion, the technique is a promising post-treatment process to improve water quality, prior to discharging to natural waters or to polishing water treatment systems such as wetlands and lagoons.

AB A suspended growth photobioreactor was utilized to treat pharmaceutical wastewater by a wild strain purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium isolated from the soil. The strain was named Z08 and identified as Rhodobacter-sphaeroides by 16SrDN. The photobioreactor was illuminated externally with two (40 W) fluorescent compact light sources on both sides. Its operation pH and temperature were between 6.8 - 7.0 and 20 - 30 degrees C, respectively. Optimum growth of the isolate was obtained after enrichment of the pharmaceutical wastewater with 0.5 % ammonium sulfate and 0.1 % yeast extract under microaerobic optimum light (6000 lx) condition at 5d retention. Using these optimum conditions, the maximum dry cell weight and chemical oxygen demand percentage removal were 880 mg/L and 80 %. Chemical analysis of the culture after treatment of the enriched and non-enriched wastewater showed the crude protein content of the biomass to be 54.6 % and 38.0 %, respectively. This study proved that photosynthetic bacteria could transform complex wastewater that contains recalcitrant organic compounds with a resultant recovery of useful products.

AB The paper presents a study on the treatment of the furniture industry wastewater in a bench scale advanced oxidation reactor. The researched technology utilized a simultaneous application of ozone, ultraviolet radiation and surface-immobilized TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst. Various combinations of processes were tested, including photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, catalytic ozonation, photolytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation were tested against the efficiency of degradation. The efficiency of the processes was primarily characterized by the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, indicating the remaining organic material in the wastewater after the treatment, while the toxicity changes in wastewater were researched by Daphnia magna toxicity tests. Photocatalytic ozonation was confirmed as the most effective combination of processes (99.3% of TOC reduction during 180min of treatment), also being the most energy efficient (4.49-7.83MJ/g). Photocatalytic ozonation and photolytic ozonation remained efficient across a wide range of pH (3-9), but the pH was an important factor in photocatalysis. The toxicity of wastewater depended on the duration of the treatment: half treated water was highly toxic, while fully treated water did not possess any toxicity. Our results indicate that photocatalytic ozonation has a high potential for the upscaling and application in industrial settings.

AB Solar photo-Fenton process has been extensively reported to be highly efficient in the remediation of complex industrial wastewater containing several families of pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, pesticides, derivatives of wine, etc. Moreover, solar photo-Fenton mathematical modelling regarded as a powerful tool for scaling-up and process control purposes is hindered by the complexity and variability of its reaction mechanism which depends on the particular wastewater under study. In this work, non-biodegradable cork boiling wastewater has been selected as a case study for solar photo-Fenton dynamic modelling by using MATLAB (R) software. First of all physic-chemical pretreatment was applied attaining chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions between 43 and 70% and total suspended solid (TSS) reductions between 23% and 59 %. After solar photo-Fenton treatment, COD decreased between 45 and 90 % after consumptions of H2O2 varying around 1.9 and 2.4 g/L. Individual calibration of the semi-empirical model by using experimental results made it possible to perfectly predict hydrogen peroxide variations throughout the treatment. It must be highlighted that slight deviations between predictions and experimental data must be attributed to important changes in wastewater characteristics.

AB Pharmaceutical and illicit drugs are emerging contaminants found in the environment globally. Many are chiral and stereochemistry plays an important role on their environmental fate and effects. However, investigations at the enantiomeric level are limited, particularly for complex particulate matrices such as sediments. This is due to further sample processing requirements and a lack of suitable analytical methods. Therefore, here a new enantioselective methodology is proposed for 15 drugs in sediment. Sample treatment by accelerated solvent extraction and solid phase extraction was critical for subsequent enantioselective separations. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, a Chiral-V enantioselective column enabled multi-residue separations of anti-depressants, beta-blockers, beta-agonist, anti-histamine and stimulants. Method trueness for all enantiomers was 86-121% and method quantitation limits were below 3 ng g(-1)dry weight. Application of the method revealed the enantiomeric composition of fluoxetine, amphetamine, propranolol, venlafaxine and citalopram in sediment for the first time. All drugs except venlafaxine were present in non-racemic form, i.e. unequal enantiomer concentrations. This is significant considering drug toxicity towards benthic organisms could be enantiospecific.

AB The treatment of a real pharmaceutical production wastewater by electrolysis using three-dimensional electrodes (3D electrolysis), ozonation, and their combined process (3D/O-3) was investigated in this study. The pharmaceutical wastewater was characterized by a high organic concentration (total organic carbon (TOC) of 13,475 mg/L) and high acute toxicity (100% inhibition of the luminescent bacterial Vibrio fischeri). After 6 h treatment, 23% and 43% of TOC could be removed from the pharmaceutical wastewater by individual ozonation and the 3D electrolysis process using granular activated carbon (GAC) as the particle electrodes, respectively. However, the acute toxicity of the wastewater was hardly reduced by the two individual processes. In comparison, by sparging the ozone generator effluent (oxygen and ozone gas mixture) in the three-dimensional electrode reactor, the 3D/O-3 process considerably enhanced TOC abatement to similar to 71% and reduced the inhibition of the luminescent bacterial to < 70% in Microtox bioassays. These improvements can be mainly attributed to the enhanced hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) production in the 3D/O-3 process via several reaction mechanisms, e.g., the reaction of sparged O-3 with in situ generated H2O2, the electrochemical reduction of O-3, and GAC catalyzed O-3 decomposition, which in turn enhanced the oxidation of organics in the bulk and those adsorbed onto the GAC particle electrodes. The results of this study indicate that there exists a synergistic effect between 3D electrochemical process and ozonation for the degradation of toxic organics in the pharmaceutical wastewater. Compared with the two individual processes, the 3D/O-3 process can thus provide a more effective option for the treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus HK 35, which is also an edible industrial mushroom commonly cultivated in farms, was tested in the degradation of typical representatives of endocrine disrupters (EDCs; bisphenol A, estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, triclosan and 4-n-nonylphenol); its degradation efficiency under model laboratory conditions was greater than 90% within 12 days and better than that of another published strain P. ostreatus 3004. A spent mushroom substrate from a local farm was tested for its applicability in various batch and trickle-bed reactors in degrading EDCs in model fortified and real communal wastewater. The reactors were tested under various regimes including a pilot-scale trickle-bed reactor, which was finally tested at a wastewater treatment plant. The result revealed that the spent substrate is an efficient biodegradation agent, where the fungus was usually able to remove about 95% of EDCs together with suppression of the estrogenic activity of the sample. The results showed the fungus was able to operate in the presence of bacterial microflora in wastewater without any substantial negative effects on the degradation abilities. Finally, a pilot-scale trickle-bed reactor was installed in a wastewater treatment plant and successfully operated for 10 days, where the bioreactor was able to remove more than 76% of EDCs present in the wastewater.

AB Low levels of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in aquatic environments worldwide, but their human and ecological health risks associated with low dose environmental exposure is largely unknown due to the large number of these compounds and a lack of information. Therefore prioritization and ranking methods are needed for screening target compounds for research and risk assessment. Previous efforts to rank pharmaceutical compounds have often focused on occurrence data and have paid less attention to removal mechanisms such as human metabolism. This study proposes a simple prioritization approach based on number of prescriptions and toxicity information, accounting for metabolism and wastewater treatment removal, and can be applied to unmeasured compounds. The approach was performed on the 200 most-prescribed drugs in the US in 2009. Our results showed that under-studied compounds such as levothyroxine and montelukast sodium received the highest scores, suggesting the importance of removal mechanisms in influencing the ranking, and the need for future environmental research to include other less-studied but potentially harmful pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), a feature of the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, is used in this work outside the LCA framework. as a means to quantify the potential environmental impacts on ecotoxicity and human toxicity of wastewater containing priority and emerging Pollutants. In order to do this, so-called characterisation factors are obtained for 98 frequently detected pollutants, using two characterisation models, EDIP97 and USES-LCA. The applicability of this methodology is shown in a case Study in which wastewater influent and effluent samples from a Spanish wastewater treatment plant located in the Mediterranean coast were analysed. Characterisation factors were applied to the average concentration of each pollutant, obtaining impact scores for different scenarios: discharging wastewater to aquatic recipient, and using it for crop irrigation. The results show that treated wastewater involves a substantially lower environmental impact when compared to the influent, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are very important contributors to toxicity in this wastewater. Ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and nicotine constitute the main PPCPs of concern in this case study, while 2,3,7,8-TCDD, Nickel, and hexachlorobenzene are the priority pollutants with highest contribution. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the new characterisation factors are based on very limited data, especially with regard to toxicology, and therefore they must be seen as a first screening to be improved in the future when more and higher quality data is available.

AB Over the last decade, research has examined the endocrine-disrupting action of various environmental pollutants, including hormones, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants, in sewage treatment plant effluent. Responding to the growth of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the pollutants present in their wastewater (e.g., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rule that tightens the regulation of CAFOs. In this study, we collected wild fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to feedlot effluent (FLE) and observed significant alterations in their reproductive biology. Male fish were demasculinized (having lower testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size). Defeminization of females, as evidenced by a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio of in vitro steroid hormone synthesis, was also documented. We did not observe characteristics in either male or female fish indicative of exposure to environmental estrogens. Using cells transfected with the human androgen receptor, we detected potent androgenic responses from the FLE. Taken together, our morphologic, endocrinologic, and in vitro gene activation assay data suggest two hypotheses: a) there are potent androgenic substance(s) in the FLE, and/or b) there is a complex mixture of androgenic and estrogenic substances that alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or gonadotropins. This is the first study demonstrating that the endocrine and reproductive systems of wild fish can be adversely affected by FLE. Future studies are needed to further investigate the effects of agricultural runoff and to identify the biologically active agents, whether natural or pharmaceutical in origin.

AB The Mezquital Valley system is the world's oldest and largest example with regard to use of untreated wastewater for agricultural irrigation. Because of the artificial high recharge associated with the Mezquital Valley aquifers, groundwater is extracted for human consumption, and there are plans to use this groundwater as a water resource for Mexico City. Thus, this study analyzed 218 organic micro-contaminants in wastewater, springs, and groundwater from Mezquital Valley. Five volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nine semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were detected in the wastewater used for irrigation. Only two SVOCs [bis-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate] were detected in all the wastewater canals and groundwater sources, whereas no VOCs were detected in groundwater and springs. Of the 118 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and 7 reproductive hormones measured, 65 PhACs and 3 hormones were detected in the wastewater. Of these, metformin, caffeine, and acetaminophen account for almost sixty percent of the total PhACs in wastewater. Nevertheless, 23 PhACs were detected in groundwater sources, where the majority of these compounds have low detection frequencies. The PhACs sulfamethoxazole, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, carbamazepine, and benzoylecgonine (primary cocaine metabolite) were frequently detected in groundwater, suggesting that although the soils act as a filter adsorbing and degrading the majority of the organic pollutant content in wastewater, these PhACs still reach the aquifer. Therefore, the presence of these PhACs, together with the high levels of the endocrine disruptor bis-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate, indicate that water sources derived from the recharge of the studied aquifers may pose a risk to consumer health.

AB In the Maldivian islands, the lack of sewage wastewater treatment and an improper landfill enhance the potential hazard of emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products. In order to analyze the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the marine biota, sponges were collected in two coral reef areas of Magoodhoo island (Faafu), one near the landfill and the other furthest from the island. Caffeine, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were detected only in the proximity of the landfill, with caffeine showing the highest concentration (28.4 ng/g d.w.), followed by fluoxetine (6.00 ng/g d.w.). Norfluoxetine was below the limit of quantification of 10 ng/g d.w. Nitro xylene, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide and galaxolide were found in both areas, with concentrations of 3.51/6.11/8.54 and< LOQ/1.14/0.62 ng/g d.w., respectively. Due to the vital role of the coral reef for the livelihood and economy of the Maldivian people, attention should be paid to this class of contaminant.

AB In this study, seven kinds of synthetic musks were characterized in sediment samples of Yellow River Delta wetland, including celestolide, phantolide, traseolide, galaxolide, tonalide, musk xylene, and musk ketone. They were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with recoveries of 91.85 %-105.35 % and the relative standard deviation (% RSD) were 3.30 %-8.11 % for all analytes. Galaxolide and tonalide were the main musk contaminants which were detected in sediment samples. The total concentrations of galaxolide ranged from 1.42 to 8.60 ng/g (mean 2.92 ng/g) (dry weight, dw); the total concentrations of tonalide ranged from the detection limit (LOD) to 3.63 ng/g (mean 1.69 ng/g, dw). The one reason of the higher level of SM pollutants was the domestic wastewater dumped by the local residents in some sites. And there was no significant correlation between SMs and TOC in sediment samples of Yellow River Delta wetland (p > 0.05).

AB Emerging pollutants, including pharmaceutical compounds, are producing water pollution problems around the world. Some pharmaceutical pollutants, which mainly reach ecosystems within wastewater discharges, are persistent in the water cycle and can also reach the food chain. This work addresses this issue, accounting the grey component of the water footprint (GWF(P)) for four of the most common pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KTP) and naproxen (NPX)). In addition, the GWF(C) for the main conventional pollutants is also accounted (nitrate, phosphates and organic matter). The case study is the Murcia Region of southeastern Spain, where wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) purify 99.1% of the wastewater discharges and there is an important direct reuse of the treated wastewater in irrigation. Thus, the influence of WWTPs and reuse on the GWF is analysed. The results reveal that GWF B only taking into account pharmaceutical pollutants, has a value of 301 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) considering only conventional pollutants (GWF(C)), this value increases to 4718 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) . So, the difference between these values is such that in other areas with consumption habits similar to those of the Murcia Region, and without wastewater purification, conventional pollutants may well establish the value of the GWF. On average, the WWTPs reduce the GWF(C) by 90% and the GWF(P) by 26%. These different reductions of the pollutant concentrations in the treated effluents show that the GWF is not only due to conventional pollutants, and other contaminants can became critical, such as the pharmaceutical pollutants. The reuse further reduces the value of the GWF for the Murcia Region, by around 43.6%. However, the reuse of treated wastewater is controversial, considering the pharmaceutical contaminants and their possible consequences in the food chain. In these cases, the GWF of pharmaceutical pollutants can be used to provide a first approximation of the dilution that should be applied to the treated wastewater discharges when they are reused for another economic activity that imposes quality restrictions. For the case of agriculture in the Murcia Region, the dilution required is 2 (fresh water) to 1 (treated wastewater), taking into account the pollution thresholds established in this work.

AB Treated wastewater is expected to be increasingly used as an alternative source of irrigation water in areas facing fresh water scarcity. Understanding the behaviors of contaminants from wastewater in soil and plants following irrigation is critical to assess and manage the risks associated with wastewater irrigation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil texture and drought stress on the uptake of antibiotics and the internalization of human pathogens into lettuce through root uptake following wastewater irrigation. Lettuce grown in three soils with variability in soil texture (loam, sandy loam, and sand) and under different levels of water stress (no drought control, mild drought, and severe drought) were irrigated with synthetic wastewater containing three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin and oxytetracycline) and one Salmonella strain a single time prior to harvest. Antibiotic uptake in lettuce was compound-specific and generally low. Only sulfamethoxazole was detected in lettuce with increasing uptake corresponding to increasing sand content in soil. Increased drought stress resulted in increased uptake of lincomycin and decreased uptake of oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. The internalization of Salmonella was highly dependent on the concentration of the pathogen in irrigation water. Irrigation water containing 5 Log CFU/mL Salmonella resulted in limited incidence of internalization. When irrigation water contained 8 Log CFU/mL Salmonella, the internalization frequency was significantly higher in lettuce grown in sand than in loam (p = 0.009), and was significantly higher in lettuce exposed to severe drought than in unstressed lettuce (p = 0.049). This work demonstrated how environmental factors affected the risk of contaminant uptake by food crops following wastewater irrigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the 1980s, advances in wastewater treatment technology have led to considerably improved surface water quality in the urban areas of many high income countries. However, trace concentrations of organic wastewater-associated contaminants may still pose a key environmental hazard impairing the ecological quality of surface waters. To identify key impact factors, we analyzed the effects of a wide range of anthropogenic and environmental variables on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. We assessed ecological water quality at 26 sampling sites in four urban German lowland river systems with a 0-100% load of state-of-the-art biological activated sludge treated wastewater. The chemical analysis suite comprised 12 organic contaminants (five phosphor organic flame retardants, two musk fragrances, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, octylphenol, diethyltoluamide, terbutryn), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 12 heavy metals. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified organic contaminants that are mainly wastewater-associated (i.e., phosphor organic flame retardants, musk fragrances, and diethyltoluamide) as a major impact variable on macroinvertebrate species composition. The structural degradation of streams was also identified as a significant factor. Multiple linear regression models revealed a significant impact of organic contaminants on invertebrate populations, in particular on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species. Spearman rank correlation analyses confirmed wastewater-associated organic contaminants as the most significant variable negatively impacting the biodiversity of sensitive macroinvertebrate species. In addition to increased aquatic pollution with organic contaminants, a greater wastewater fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in salinity. This study highlights the importance of reducing the wastewater-associated impact on surface waters. For aquatic ecosystems in urban areas this would lead to: (i) improvement of the ecological integrity, (ii) reduction of biodiversity loss, and (iii) faster achievement of objectives of legislative requirements, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.

AB The presence of microconstituents (MCs) in the environment has become an emerging concern to scientists and engineers. Sorption is one of the important removal mechanisms for MCs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) since there is significant sludge production. The purpose of this study is to explore sorption kinetics and isotherms of MCs onto primary sludge. Three MCs, bisphenol-A (BPA), 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and triclosan (TCS), were chosen for this study. They are hydrophobic and have low vapor pressure, which makes sorption a potential removal mechanism. Both sorption kinetics and isotherm experiments were conducted using primary sludge collected from a local municipal WWTP. The time to equilibrium was around 7 h for all chosen MCs. A pseudo second-order rate model was better at describing the sorption rate than a pseudo first-order rate model. Linear sorption isotherm models were found to fit the experimental data, and the solid-liquid partitioning coefficients for BPA, EE2 and TCS were 81, 728 and 6,407 L/kg.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in wastewater discharge can be stressors to estuarine species. We transplanted juvenile Pacific oysters at varying distances within sites near wastewater treatment plant outfalls or oyster aquaculture control sites to assess small scale spatial variation in contaminant uptake and oyster condition. Oysters were transplanted to sites in Coos and Netarts Bays, Oregon and Grays Harbor, Washington, then collected after 9 and 12 months. Two pharmaceuticals (miconazole and virginiamycin M1) were detected in spring samples and four alkylphenols (NP1EO, NP2EO, NP and OP) were detected in summer samples, with more frequent detections at wastewater sites. Contaminant concentrations were similar across site types, indicating that even in sparsely populated coastal areas (<25,000 in the watershed), shellfish are exposed to and uptake wastewater contaminants. Additionally, oyster condition was lower at wastewater sites compared to aquaculture sites, indicating a need to better understand whether contaminant exposure affects oyster condition.

AB The use of refractory gadolinium (Gd) complexes as paramagnetic contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging has resulted in point source release of anthropogenic Gd (Gd(Anth)) into the environment, and presents opportunities to trace the fate of wastewater in natural environments. We demonstrate an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique that is capable of detecting Gd(Anth) at concentrations as low as 48 fM, approximately six orders of magnitude lower than most other micropollutants, without the need for preconcentration. Further, we establish the ubiquitous presence of Gd(Anth) in wastewater at eight separate wastewater treatment plants in Brisbane, Australia, over a 3-month time period. in contrast, there is no evidence of Gd(Anth) in tap water, or in four separate regional water supply dams in South East Queensland, Australia. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that other anthropogenic micropollutants sourced from urban wastewater would be present in the drinking water supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, 12 polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PBDD/Fs) were analyzed by gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry in the composited, archived biosolids that were collected in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia from 94 wastewater treatment plants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in its 2001 national sewage sludge survey. Two PBDDs and five PBDFs were detected in the biosolids composites at varying frequencies (40-100%) with a total mean concentration of 10,000 ng/kg dry weight (range: 630-42,800), of which 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hepta-BDF constituted about 95% by mass. Relative to commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) formulations, the ratio of PBDD/Fs to PBDEs in biosolids was 55-times higher (?0.002% vs ?0.11%), which indicates potential PBDE transformation or possibly additional sources of PBDD/Fs in the environment. The TEQ contribution of PBDD/Fs was estimated at 162 ng/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (range: 15-672), which is equivalent to 75% (range: 12-96%) of the total TEQ in biosolids. The TEQ of DLCs released annually to U.S. soils as a result of the land application of biosolids was estimated at 720 g (range: 530-1600 g). Among all known DLCs determined in biosolids, brominated analogs contributed 370% more TEQ than did chlorinated congeners, which indicates the need to include brominated DLCs in the exposure and risk assessment of land-applied biosolids.

AB This article provides data on the contamination of different kinds of sludge (raw, centrifuged, digested, thermally dried sludge and sludge cake) from Paris conurbation by 71 various pollutants including pharmaceutical products (PHPs), hormones, perfluorinated acids (PFAs), linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), alkylphenols (APs), phthalates (PAEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs).
   Very high contents of LAS (0.1-10g/kg dry matter - DM) compared to other compounds were found in all types of sludge followed by DEHP (10-100 mg/kg DM) and fluoroquinolones (1-100 mg/kg DM). APs were measured at intermediary contents in Parisian sludge, lying in the 2-20 mg/kg DM range. Finally, hormones, PAHs, PCBs, PAEs, PFAs and the remaining PHPs were all found at contents lower than 1 mg/kg DM.
   For most compounds (PHPs, PFOS, DEHP, PAHs), no significant differences in the micropollutant contents were found for similar types of sludge from different WWTP in Paris, highlighting the homogeneity of sludge contamination in downstream Paris catchment.
   The variability of concentration is rather high (coefficient of variation >100%) for several PHPs, PFAs or PCBs while it is moderate (<100%) or low (<50%) for fluoroquinolones, hormones, PAHs, APs or LAS. In addition, digestion seems to have a buffer effect as variabilities are lower in digested sludge for PHPs, PFAs, APs and PCBs. During sludge treatment (centrifugation, digestion, thermal drying, sludge conditioning + press filtration), the hormones, LAS, APs, PAHs, DEHP and PCBs concentrations increased, while those of PHPs and PFAs decreased. In the case of digestion, the increase of content can be explained by no pollutant removal or a lower removal than DM removal (concentration phenomenon) whereas the decrease underlines that the compound is more removed than the DM. In any case, these concentration variations presuppose the mechanisms of dissipation that could be attributed to volatilization, biotic or abiotic transformation (complete or with metabolites production), bound residues formation.
   In addition, data on sludge liquors - centrifuged (CW) and condensed (TDW) waters - from respectively centrifugation and thermal drying were collected. Several hormones, PHPs, PFAs, LAS, PAEs, APs, PCBs and PAHs were quantified in CW and TDW, displaying a transfer through the water removal. The concentrations observed are rather comparable to those found in wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to assess the role of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) in digestate processing in cen-tralised biogas plants receiving dewatered sludge from regional wastewater treatment plants and produc-ing biomethane and fertilisers. Chemically conditioned and mechanically dewatered sludge was used as such (total solids (TS) 25%) or as diluted (15% TS) with reject water in 30 min or 120 min HTC treatments at 210 degrees C, 230 degrees C or 250 degrees C, and the produced slurry was filtered to produce hydrochars and filtrates. The different hydrochars contributed to 20-55% of the original mass, 72-88% of the TS, 74-87% of the energy content, 71-92% of the carbon, above 86% of phosphorous and 38-64% of the nitrogen present in the original digestates. The hydrochars' energy content (higher heating values were 11.3-12.2 MJ/kg-TS) were similar to that of the digestates, while the ash contents increased (from 43% up to 57%). HTC treatments produced filtrates in volumes of 42-76% of the dewatered digestate, having a soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of 28-44 g/L, of which volatile fatty acids (VFAs) contributed 10-34%, and methane potentials of 182-206 mL-CH4/g-SCOD without any major indication of inhibition. All 32 pharmaceuticals detected in the digestates were below the detection limit in hydrochars and filtrates, save for ibuprofen and benzotriazole in filtrate, while heavy metals were concentrated in the hydrochars but below the national limits for fertiliser use, save for mercury. The integration of HTC to a centralised biogas plant was extrapolated to enhance the annual biogas production by 5% and ammonium recovery by 25%, and the hydrochar was estimated to produce 83 GJ upon combustion or to direct 350 t phosphorous to agriculture annually.

AB For all new pharmaceuticals, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed according to guidelines developed by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. An important factor of this procedure is the assessment of the predicted environmental concentration in the aquatic environment, which is significantly influenced by the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants. Established standardized methods for determining biodegradation under laboratory conditions apply to substance concentrations, which are much higher than those expected in reality. Against this background, the laboratory scale sewage treatment plant (LSSTP), as described by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline No. 303A, was modified to construct a lossless system, which allows laboratory testing at realistic concentrations. To verify the experimental setup, the antibiotics benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim were tested at low concentrations (mu g/L) using C-14-labeled compounds. The results show that approximately 25% of benzylpenicillin was mineralized, whereas ceftriaxone and trimethoprim were not mineralized at all. Due to the high total recoveries of added radioactivity (>= 95%) and the fact that the findings comply with available literature data, the lossless operation of the test system could be proved. Consequently, the modified LSSTP is a suitable tool to determine more realistic biodegradation data required for the exposure assessment within the scope of an ERA for pharmaceuticals.

AB In this study, coagulation process was applied to treat the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater using polymeric ferric sulfate as a coagulant. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) was applied to investigate the fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from pharmaceutical wastewater and the reduction of contaminant and fluorescent variations in the coagulation process. It shows that coagulation was effective to remove contaminants in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater, and the optimum coagulate dosage was 0.5 g/L, where the removal efficiency of total organic matter (TOC), UV254, turbidity and NH4+-N were achieved 44.2%, 43.3%, 87.0% and 10.27%, respectively. Five fluorescence components were identified by EEMs-PARAFAC, including one fulviclike component (C1), one xenobiotic-like component (C2), two humic-like components (C3 and C5) and one protein-like component (C4); DOM of pharmaceutical wastewater was dominated by C3, C4 and C2. Under the optimum coagulation condition, the decreasing order of removal efficiencies was C5 (49.92%), C3 (40.95%), C4 (10.58%), C2 (9.68%) and C1 (5.05%). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed C3, C5 had remarkable correlations with TOC and UV254, suggesting that C3 and C5 may be a good indicator for the reduction of TOC and UV254. PCA indicated that the EEM-PARAFAC could be successfully applied to the evaluation of the coagulation efficiency for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The production of industrial waste has increased in the last decades along with world population. Wastes are used in agriculture as fertilizers and soil amendments depending on their composition, dynamics in soil and effects on plant growth. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of industrial saline wastewater from heparin production on soil chemistry and plant yield in a subtropical soil in Brazil. Five rates of industrial saline wastewater (0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) were applied as fertilizer in a corn -soybean rotation on an Oxisol with limited nutrient availability. Five soils sampling were done: before and after the first application of the industrial wastewater (2017, corn), before and after the second application of wastewater (2018, soybean) and two years after the first application (2019). Soil K, Ca, Mg, Na content and CEC increased immediately after the application of wastewater but they returned to former values with time due to plant uptake and lixiviation. Wastewater application significantly increased corn (all rates) and soybean (only with the highest rate) yields around 103-250% and 50%, respectively, in comparison with no wastewater application. However, the highest rate temporally increased soil Na content and electrical conductivity (up to 650 and 800%, respectively). Although nutrient uptake, chlorophyll content and corn and soybean yields were enhanced, the use of high rates of industrial saline wastewater could cause soil salinization (mainly in locations with low rainfall), affecting soil chemistry and physical parameters due to clay dispersion, and pollution or water bodies.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) are two critical sulfonamide antibiotics with enhanced persistency that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. Recently, more scholars have showed interests in how SMX and TMP antibiotics are biodegraded, which is seldom reported previously. Novel artificial composite soil treatment systems were designed to allow biodegradation to effectively remove adsorbed SMX and TMP from the surface of clay ceramsites. A synergy between sorption and biodegradation improves the removal of SMX and TMP. One highly efficient SMX and TMP degrading bacteria strain, Bacillus subtilis, was isolated from column reactors. In the removal process, this bacteria degrade SMX and TMP to NH4+ , and then further convert NH4+ to NO3- in a continuous process. Microbial adaptation time was longer for SMX degradation than for TMP, and SMX was also able to be degraded in aerobic conditions. Importantly, the artificial composite soil treatment system is suitable for application in practical engineering.

AB Upon partial degradation of polar organic micropollutants during activated sludge treatment, transformation products (TPs) may be formed that enter the aquatic environment in the treated effluent. However, TPs are rarely considered in prospective environmental risk assessments of wastewater-relevant compound classes such as pharmaceuticals and biocides. Here, we suggest and evaluate a tiered procedure, which includes a fast initial screening step based on high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) and a subsequent confirmatory quantitative analysis, that should facilitate consideration of TPs formed during activated sludge treatment in the exposure assessment of micropollutants. At the first tier, potential biotransformation product structures of seven pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, metoprolol, ranitidine, valsartan, and venlafaxine) and one biocide (carbendazim) were assembled using computer-based biotransformation pathway prediction and known human metabolites. These target structures were screened for in sludge-seeded batch reactors using HR-MS/MS. The 12 TPs found to form in the batch experiments were then searched for in the effluents of two full-scale, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to confirm the environmental representativeness of this first tier. At the second tier, experiments with the same sludge-seeded batch reactors were carried out to acquire kinetic data for major TPs that were then used as input parameters into a cascaded steady-state completely-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model for predicting TP effluent concentrations. Predicted effluent concentrations of four parent compounds and their three major TPs were corroborated by comparison to 3-day average influent and secondary effluent mass flows from one municipal WWTP. CSTR model-predicted secondary effluent mass flows agreed within a factor of two with measured mass flows and confidence intervals of predicted and measured mass flows overlapped in all cases. The observed agreement suggests that the combination of batch-determined transformation kinetics with a simple WWTP model may be suitable for estimating aquatic exposure to TPs formed during activated sludge treatment. Overall, we recommend the tiered procedure as a realistic and cost-effective approach to include consideration of TPs of wastewater-relevant compounds into exposure assessment in the context of prospective chemical risk assessment.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the whole environment is a growing concern. These compounds might be present in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants and, hence, irrigation with treated sewage may be a source of groundwater pollution. The volcanic aquifer that lies NE of Gran Canaria (Spain) was studied to address the relationship of the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds and a golf course that has been irrigated with regenerated water since 1973. Of the 14 analyzed groundwater samples, five wells were chosen to perform annual monitoring. Irrigation water and soil leachate were also evaluated. The target analytes were atenolol, metamizole, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, nicotine, permethrin, caffeine, and their metabolite paraxanthine. The environmental risk is limited as the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals measured in the sampled wells were always below 60 ng center dot L-1 (lower than the detected caffeine and nicotine concentrations). Wide variations for the same wells were measured among sampling campaigns, and also among the different wells. The study points to the importance of sample conservation during transport and the need to perform analyses immediately, or to follow an in-situ extraction procedure to carry concentrated samples under better conditions.

AB Classical methods of wastewater treatment are often not suitable for the treatment of pharmaceutical waste. The previous studies have shown that the use of the advanced oxidation procedures (AOP) can lead to a more efficient degradation of various biologically active compounds, which are active pharmaceutical ingredients of applied drugs. The aim of this paper is the application of the plasma technology on the degradation of a two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs, diazepam and alprazolam) and the finished products (Bensedin((R)) and Ksalol((R))) using the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor for AOP. We studied the degradation rate of these pharmaceuticals, depending on the number of passes through the reactor. This degradation method was efficient 61 % for diazepam and 95 % alprazolam. We also examined the influence of the pH adjustment between the passes of APIs through the DBD reactor. The degradation rate of APIs and the finished products was monitored by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique, using a photodiode array detector. The concentration of the dissolved ozone was determined using the iodometric procedure.

AB Due to their widespread use and limited human metabolism, beta-blockers were widely detected in sewage effluents and surface waters. beta-blockers are persistent in agricultural soils that have been irrigated with treated wastewater or fertilized with sewage sludge. It is important to study beta-blockers interaction with kaolinite and talc because kaolinite is a major component of soil that formed under warm and humid conditions, and talc is frequently used as an excipient for drug formulation. In this study, the interactions between metoprolol (MT), a beta-blocker, and kaolinite and talc, clay minerals of 1:1 and 2:1 structural types, were investigated under varying physical and chemical conditions. Uptake of MT on both minerals was instantaneous with capacities close to the cation exchange capacity of the substrates. MT sorption was exothermic and the free energy of sorption was small and negative. These parameters pointed out to physical sorption for the uptake of MT on these minerals. Both solution pH and ionic strength had significant effects on MT uptake on kaolinite, but minimal influence on talc, contrasting different mechanisms of MT uptake on these minerals. The FTIR results showed bands blue shifted for both in-plane and out-of-plane bending of NH2. Meanwhile, blue shift was also found for the 1246 and 1011 cm(-1) bands, attributed to aromatic ether, after MT sorption on kaolinite and talc. For talc, blue shift of the band at 965 cm(-1), attributed to aliphatic ether, was also observed. These results suggested that electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding played important roles in MT uptake on kaolinite. In contrast, the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction were likely the main mechanisms of MT uptake on talc. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reusing biosolids is vital for the sustainability of wastewater management. Pyrolysis is an anoxic thermal degradation process that can be used to convert biosolids into energy rich py-gas and py-oil, and a beneficial soil amendment, biochar. Batch biosolids pyrolysis (60 minutes) revealed that triclocarban and triclosan were removed (to below quantification limit) at 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C, respectively. Substantial removal (>90%) of nonylphenol was achieved at 300 degrees C as well, but 600 degrees C was required to remove nonylphenol to below the quantification limit. At 500 degrees C, the pyrolysis reaction time to remove >90% of microconstituents was less than 5 minutes. Fate studies revealed that microconstituents were both volatilized and thermochemically transformed during pyrolysis; microconstituents with higher vapor pressures were more likely to volatilize and leave the pyrolysis reactor before being transformed than compounds with lower vapor pressures. Reductive dehalogenation products of triclocarban and suspected dehalogenation products of triclosan were identified in py-gas. Application of biosolids-derived biochar to soil in place of biosolids has potential to minimize organic microconstituents discharged to the environment provided appropriate management of py-gas and py-oil.

AB Traces of pharmaceuticals have been classified as emerging pollutants due to their persistence in the aquatic ecosystem. There has been indiscriminate disposal of pharmaceutical waste from manufacturing processes, half used, expired antibiotics as a result of which, huge quantities of bacterial resistant antibiotic wastewater have been introduced into natural ecosystems. In addition, drugs that are not fully metabolized in the body may be excreted into the sewer system. Therefore, treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a global concern. A wide range of treatment methodologies have been developed to treat pharmaceutical wastewater viz., chemical oxidation, biodegradation, adsorption, liquid extraction, membrane techniques, etc. However, adsorption is a promising method for the removal of micropollutants because of its simple design, low-cost, high efficiency, etc. Research has shown that graphene materials can be used as photo-catalysts, adsorbents, and as disinfectants in water treatment. They are reported to be efficient agents against a wide variety of water pollutants, including (but not limited to) organic molecules, inorganic heavy metals, and water borne pathogenic micro-organisms. This review discusses the application of graphene materials in treating pharmaceutical wastewater and explains the mechanism of adsorption. A brief perspective on the future scope of work in the area has also been examined.

AB A waste-based alternative activated carbon (AAC) was produced from paper mill sludge under optimized conditions. Aiming its application in tertiary wastewater treatment, AAC was used for the removal of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and paroxetine from biologically treated municipal wastewater. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were run under batch operation conditions. For comparison purposes, they were also performed in ultrapure water and using a high-performance commercial AC (CAC). Adsorption kinetics was fast for the three pharmaceuticals and similar onto AAC and CAC in either wastewater or ultrapure water. However, matrix effects were observed in the equilibrium results, being more remarkable for AAC. These effects were evidenced by Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities (q(m), mgg(-1)): for AAC, the lowest and highest q(m) were 19410 (SMX) and 2879 (PAR), in ultrapure water, and 47 +/- 1 (SMX) and 407 +/- 14 (PAR), in wastewater, while for CAC, the lowest and highest q(m) were 118 +/- 7 (SMX) and 190 +/- 16 (PAR) in ultrapure water and 123 +/- 5 (SMX) and 160 +/- 7 (CBZ) in wastewater. It was found that the matrix pH played a key role in these differences by controlling the surface electrostatic interactions between pharmaceutical and AC. Overall, it was evidenced the need of adsorption results in real matrices and demonstrated that AAC is a promising option to be implemented in tertiary wastewater treatments for pharmaceuticals' removal.

AB Purpose This study conducted to assess the presence of pharmaceuticals in soils and crops irrigated with treated wastewater in Oman. The study was aimed to evaluate the potential of plant uptake of four commonly used pharmaceuticals in Oman: amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ibuprofen by radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativius) in soil culture.
   Methods Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) was selected as a test crop. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) instrument was used to measure concentrations of pharmaceuticals. Groundwater and treated wastewater were used for irrigation. Additionally, there were two spiked treatments; high-spiked concentration (5 mg/l) and low-spiked concentration (1 mg/l).
   Results Results of the study showed that trimethoprim and ibuprofen were not detected in any samples of soil and plant. Sulfamethoxazole accumulated in radish roots for low- and high-spiked treatments. Amoxicillin accumulated in roots with low-spiked- as well as high-spiked treatments. Radish showed the ability to translocate some of the selected pharmaceuticals from soil irrigated with treated wastewater if they are present in sufficient concentrations.
   Conclusions Radish showed positive uptake of some selected pharmaceuticals from soil irrigated with treated wastewater with spiked (both high and low) concentration of pharmaceuticals and has the ability to accumulate them in the roots. Pharmaceutical usage and disposal must be given attention to prevent their occurrences in the environment. Furthermore, treated wastewater must be given attention, as it is an important source of water in Oman, which suffers from water shortages.

AB Aerobic granulation seems to be an a attractive process for COD removal from industrial wastewater, characterised by a high content of soluble organic compounds. In order to evaluate the practical aspects of the process, comparative experimental tests are performed on synthetic and on industrial wastewater, originating from pharmaceutical industry. Two pilot plants are operated as sequencing batch bubble columns. Focus was put on the feasibility of the process for high COD removal and on its operational procedure. For both wastewaters, a rapid formation of aerobic granules is observed along with a high COD removal rate. Granule characteristics are quite similar with respect to the two types of wastewater. It seems that filamentous bacteria are part of the granule structure and that phosphorus precipitation can play an important role in granule formation. For both wastewaters similar removal V performances for dissolved biodegradable COD are observed (> 95%). However, a relatively high concentration of suspended solids in the outlet deteriorates the performance with regard to total COD removal. Biomass detachment seems to play a non-negligible role in the current set-up. After a stable operational phase the variation of the pharmaceutical wastewater caused a destabilisation and loss of the granules, despite the control for balanced nutrient supply. The first results with real industrial wastewater demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative process. However, special attention has to be paid to the critical aspects such as granule stability as well as the economic competitiveness, which both will need further investigation and evaluation.

AB Nineteen biocides were investigated in the Yangtze River to understand their spatiotemporal distribution, mass loads and ecological risks. Fourteen biocides were detected, with the highest concentrations up to 166 ng/L for DEET in surface water, and 54.3 ng/g dry weight (dw) for triclocarban in sediment The dominant biocides were DEET and methylparaben, with their detection frequencies of 100% in both phases. An estimate of 152 t/y of 14 biocides was carried by the Yangtze River to the East China Sea. The distribution of biocides in the aquatic environments was significantly correlated to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN), suggesting dominant input sources from domestic wastewater of the cities along the river. Risk assessment showed high ecological risks posed by carbendazim in both phases and by triclosan in sediment Therefore, proper measures should be taken to reduce the input of biocides into the river systems.

AB The use of chemical markers of undoubted anthropogenic sources for surface freshwater contamination by wastewaters was evaluated employing correlations observed between measured physico-chemical parameters as the electrical conductivity and the concentration of different emerging organic compounds. During the period from April/2011 to April/2012 spatial-temporal variations and contamination patterns of two rivers (Pirai and Jundiai rivers), Sao Paulo state, Brazil were evaluated. Seven physico-chemical parameters and concentrations of different classes of emerging contaminants were determined in samples collected in seven field campaigns. The high linear correlation coefficients obtained for the compounds diclofenac (r = 0.9085), propanolol (r = 0.8994), ibuprofen (r = 0.8720) and atenolol (r = 0.7811) with electrical conductivity, also corroborated by principal component analysis (PCA), point to the potential use of these compounds as markers of investigated surface water contamination by wastewaters. Due to specific inputs, these environmental markers showed very good effectiveness for the identification and differentiation of water body contamination by discharges of treated and untreated urban sewage.

AB Sunlight photodegradation has long been considered a significant process in lowering the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface waters and thus decreasing the ecological risk. For the first time, this study identified the significance of investigating the environmental photodegradation of a pharmaceutical residue mixture (rather than a single compound) and the associated toxicity of transformation byproducts in environmental waters, including rivers, hospital wastewaters, and effluents from wastewater treatment plants and pharmaceutical production facilities. Pharmaceuticals undergo phototransformation rather than mineralization (11-23% in 34 h). Pharmaceutical mixtures could possibly act as dissolved organic matter for each individual compound and subsequently affect the photolysis rates. The increased toxicity of irradiated pharmaceutical mixtures challenges the validity of the current understanding of sunlight photolysis. The implications of this work suggest that current knowledge concerning the occurrence, natural attenuation, ecotoxicity, and human health risks of pharmaceuticals is far from complete; photolysis is not necessarily a purification process.

AB Levels of flame retardants in house dust and a transport pathway from homes to the outdoor environment were investigated in communities near the Columbia River in Washington state (WA). Residential house dust and laundry wastewater were collected from 20 homes in Vancouver and Longview, WA and analyzed for a suite of flame retardants to test the hypothesis that dust collecting on clothing and transferring to laundry water is a source of flame retardants to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and subsequently to waterways. Influent and effluent from two WWTPs servicing these communities were also analyzed for flame retardants. A total of 21 compounds were detected in house dust, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB or EH-TBB), bis(2-ethylhexyl) 3,4,5,6-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), 1,2-bis(2,4,6,-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD or HBCDD), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and three chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (ClOPFRs), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP or TDCIPP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP or TCIPP), and tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP). Levels ranged from 3.6 to 82,700 ng g(-1) (dry weight). Of the 21 compounds detected in dust, 18 were also detected in laundry wastewater. Levels ranged from 47.1 to 561,000 ng Lc. ClOPFRs were present at the highest concentrations in both dust and laundry wastewater, making up 72% of total flame retardant mass in dust and 92% in laundry wastewater. Comparison of flame retardant levels in WWTP influents to estimates based on laundry wastewater levels indicated that laundry wastewater may be the primary source to these WWTPs. Mass loadings to the Columbia River from each treatment plant were by far the highest for the ClOPFRs and ranged up to 114 kg/yr for TCPP.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes such as electrooxidation (EO), electrooxidation witt hydrogen peroxide generation (EO-H2O2) and electro-Fenton process (EF) have been investigated as alternative treatment techniques for complete removal of anionic surfactants and organic matters from real carwash wastewater. The electrochemical processes were performed with acidified real carwash wastewater using boron doped anode and carbon felt cathode. In all cases, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was always increased with rise in applied current and complete organic matter decay was achieved at applied current of 500 mA or above after 6 h of electrolysis. Faster and higher COD decay was observed with EF compared to either EO or EO-H2O2 treatment, at all currents and electrolysis time. Besides, complete degradation of anionic surfactants the major organic content of the wastewater could be achieved at all applied currents studied irrespective of the process used, indicating the efficacy of processes for total remediation of real carwash wastewater. The short-chain carboxylic acids formed as the final organic byproducts were identified and quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography More so, lower energy consumption and higher current efficiency were achieved with EF compared to EO-H2O2. Electrochemical treatment was found to be a powerful technology for the complete abatement of organic matter in carwash wastewater for possible reuse. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Swine wastewater represents an important pollution source of antibiotics in the environment; however, regional data about residual antibiotics in swine wastewater are very limited at present. This study investigated the concentrations of three classes of commonly used veterinary antibiotics, including five sulfonamides (SAs), three tetracyclines (TCs) and one macrolide (tiamulin, TIA), in swine wastewater collected from 21 concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) sites in Shandong Province, China. Both the liquid and solid (i.e., suspended solids) phases of swine wastewater were analyzed to determine the total concentration of each studied antibiotic. Results indicate that sulfamethazine had the highest median concentration (14.56 mu g L-1), followed by oxytetracycline (OTC, 8.05 mu g L-1) and chlortetracycline (CTC, 6.01 mu g L-1). The maximum detected concentration reached up to 2.02 mg L-1 (OTC) and the highest detection frequency was 95.1% (CTC). The median concentrations and detection frequencies of antibiotics in winter samples were generally higher than those in summer samples (except CTC). The log K-d values were in the range of 1.31-1.96 for SAs, 2.05-2.33 for TCs, and 1.54-1.58 for TIA in swine wastewater. More TCs (14-28%) preferred to partition in the solid phase than SAs (2-10%) and TIA (5-10%), indicating that the suspended solids of swine wastewater may not be ignored.

AB Surface water contamination by human faecal wastes is a widespread hazard for human health. Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are the most widely used indicators to assess surface water quality but are less-human-specific and have the potential to survive longer and/or occur naturally in tropical areas. In this study, 13 wastewater chemicals (chloride, boron, orthosphophate, detergents as methylene blue active substances, cholesterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, diethylhexyl phthalate, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sucralose and saccharin) were investigated in order to evaluate tracers for human faecal and sewage contamination in tropical urban catchments. Surface water samples were collected at an hourly interval from sampling locations with distinct major land uses: high-density residential, low-density residential, commercial and industrial. Measured concentrations were analysed to investigate the association among indicators and tracers for each land-use category. Better correlations were found between different indicators and tracers in each land-use dataset than in the dataset for all land uses, which shows that land use is an important determinant of drain water quality. Data were further segregated based on the hourly FIB concentrations. There were better correlations between FIB and chemical tracers when FIB concentrations were higher. Therefore, sampling programs must be designed carefully to take the time of sampling and land use into account in order to effectively assess human faecal and sewage contamination in urban catchments. FIB is recommended as the first tier in assessment of surface water quality impairment and chemical tracers as the second tier. Acetaminophen and coprostanol are recommended as chemical tracers for high-density residential areas, while chloride, coprostanol and caffeine are recommended for low-density residential areas.

AB The effluent from the secondary clarifier of an Urban Sewage Treatment Plant was oxidized by the combined and simultaneous use of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The purpose was to increase the wastewater's reuse potential by improving water quality. The removal of dissolved organic chemicals was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. These conditions led to almost complete mineralization in less than 1 h. Under similar conditions, without the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was no higher than 35%. The evolution of TOC was related to the concentration of hydroxyl radicals using a second-order kinetic model in which the exposure to hydroxyl radical was included by assuming a quasi-steady-state approximation. The concentration of hydroxyl radical was computed using the experimental data from ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The kinetic constants for the hydroxyl-mediated mineralization process were determined for wastewaters collected during a 1-year sampling campaign. The results showed that the mineralization process takes place in two periods whose rate constants were linked to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ratio and to the chloride content of wastewaters. During the first part of the runs, the specific rate of mineralization was high, before subsequently decreasing after a period of 5-15 min by an average factor of 6.4 whose 95% confidence interval was in the 3.4-9.3 range. The moles of TOC removed per mole of ozone consumed were in the range of 9.2-17.7 mg O-3/mg TOC measured at maximum ozone efficiency, which always occurred within the first 10 min.

AB The adsorptive removal possibility of persistent pharmaceuticals with different charges by activated carbon fiber (ACF) was examined. The pharmaceuticals tested included carbamazepine (CBZ), propranolol (PRO), and diclofenac (DCF), in neutral, cationic, and anionic forms, respectively, which were frequently detected in sewage. The adsorption characteristics of ACF were identified according to the kinetics, isotherm, pH, and ionic strength experiments. The results revealed that ACF can effectively remove these pharmaceuticals, and the adsorption capacities of CBZ, PRO, and DCF by ACF were 1.27 +/- 0.06, 1.07 +/- 0.08, and 0.95 +/- 0.08 mmol g(-1), respectively. Moreover, the adsorption of ACF for CBZ was independent of pH and ionic strength, whereas that of anionic diclofenac decreased at alkaline pHs and high concentrations of NaCl. Using a syringe system packed with ACF mat, the scavenging ability of intermittently generated secondary sewage was evaluated. As a result, the residual concentration of PRO and CBZ could not be even detected after consecutive 10 runs in secondary sewage mixture solution. This indicates ACF has the powerful potential for removing pharmaceutical micropollutants in the actual aqueous solutions. FTIR and XPS analyses showed that hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonding contributed to the adsorption process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of operation condition on the fate of 16 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in a single-sludge nitrifying/denitrifying pilot plant was assessed. Volatilisation, sorption and degradation were included in the mass balances to determine the most relevant removal mechanisms during PPCP treatment.
   Sludge retention time (SRT) was an important factor for the removal of compounds that significantly sorb onto sludge, as ethinylestradiol, whose removal increased 11% when working at SRT above 20 d. The internal recirculation ratio was significant for the removal of moderately biodegradable compounds, as citalopram. The positive effect of operating at warmer temperatures was particularly significant for two antibiotics, implying a 30% increase in their transformations. In the case of naproxen, an influence of sludge acclimation and concentration was observed, leading to removal efficiencies from 27% to 99%.
   Concerning removal mechanisms, most compounds were removed due to biotransformation, although for fragrances sorption and volatilisation played a role. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the ozonation of the antineoplastic drugs cyclophosphamide (CP), ifosfamide (IF), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and of the vasodilator pentoxifylline (PEN) in distilled water, in pharmaceutical wastewater, and in hospital effluent at pH 5-11. Under an alkaline pH of 11, all of the target compounds rapidly degraded through the attack of hydroxyl radicals, which resulted in their complete removal within 5 min at an ozone supply rate of 3 g O-3/h. Under acidic pH conditions, such as pH 5.6, CP and IF exhibited slower removal rates; however, compounds with unsaturated C-C bonds, such as 5-FU and PEN, were still removed at rapid rates under acidic conditions. Although the parent compounds were removed within minutes, the resulting ozonation byproducts were resistant to further ozonation and possessed increased Microtox acute toxicity. In distilled water, the resulting ozonation products exhibited minimal mineralization but high acute toxicity, whereas in naturally buffered pharmaceutical and hospital effluents, the byproducts were more amenable to removal and detoxification.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants in the natural environment. Most studies of the environmental fate of these chemicals focus on their behavior in wastewater treatment processes and in sewage sludge. Little is known about their behavior in soils. In this study adsorption and biodegradation of four antidiabetic pharmaceuticals - glimepiride, glibenclamide, gliclazide and metformin - were examined in three natural soils. The sorption of sulfonylurea derivatives was high (higher than sulfonylurea herbicides for example), whereas metformin showed high mobility. Desorption rates were highest for metformin. Sorption isotherms in two of three soils fitted best to the Freundlich model. Despite their high affinity to for soil surfaces, biodegradation studies revealed that transformation of the drugs occurred. Biodegradation results were described by pseudo-first order kinetics with half-life values from 5 to over 120 d (under aerobic conditions) and indicate that none of the tested drugs can be classified as quickly biodegradable. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions was much slower; often degrading by less than 50% during time of the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treated sewage sludge is commonly used in agriculture as fertilizer. It is, therefore, necessary to determine possible detrimental influences of sludge application on soil contamination and accumulation of contaminants in tissues of terrestrial animals, which in the long run could also have undesirable effects on humans. With that aim, the study was performed using earthworm Eisenia fetida as test organism and semi-solid depot sludge from a wastewater treatment plant as exposure media. The concentrations of 26 metals/metalloids were determined in depot sludge, and their bioaccumulation was estimated in whole tissue of E. fetida, and for the first time in the soluble tissue fraction, which represents metal fraction available for metabolic requirements and toxic effects. Obtained results have revealed acceptable levels of several elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) in depot sludge, when compared to currently valid regulations, and only moderate accumulation of some elements (e.g. As, Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Tl, V, and Zn) in earthworms, as a consequence of exposure to depot sludge. However, a concentration increase after exposure to depot sludge was observed in E. fetida for several elements (Cd, Mo, and Zn), which were present in lower concentrations in the exposure mixtures than in soil. Contrary, a concentration decrease was observed for Cs, Mn, and Rb, although they were present in higher concentrations in depot sludge than in soil. It was an indication of disturbance in metal homeostasis in earthworms, possibly caused by exposure to complex mixture of contaminants present in depot sludge. The cumulative effect of exposure to a number of various contaminants (inorganic, organic, microbiological and pharmaceutical), even if each of them was not present in very high concentrations, could have caused distress in earthworms exposed to depot sludge.

AB Disinfection by-products (DBPs) discharged from sewage treatment plants (STPs) could harm downstream receiving waters and drinking water resources. In-stream attenuation of photo- and non-photodegradable DBPs during river transportation is currently not well understood. Here we sought to fill this knowledge gap by meta-data-analysis for modeling in-stream attenuation of DBPs. Data were collected along a treated-wastewater-dominated 1.6-km stretch of a river channel for 3 years and incorporated seasonal and diurnal patterns. Photo-irradiation and water temperature were the main factors responsible for in-stream attenuation of photodegradable N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and water temperature for that of non-photodegradable formaldehyde (FAH). The factors were incorporated into photo-dependent and -independent models to account for temporal variations in NDMA and FAH, respectively. Estimated mass recoveries of NDMA and FAH agreed well with observed values along the stretch. The models developed here offer a novel and useful tool for estimating levels of NDMA and FAH during river transportation.

AB The photodegradation rate of the anti-histamine cetirizine (Zyrtec (R)) was investigated in various water matrices. The average observed first-order photodegradation rate coefficient (k(obs)), obtained by linear regression of the logarithmic-transformed cetirizine concentrations versus irradiation time in simulated sunlight, was 0.024 h(-1) (n=6; standard deviation +/- 0.004) in deionized water corresponding to a half-life of approximately 30h. There was no statistical difference in the k(obs) of cetirizine photodegradation in coastal seawater compared with deionized water or deionized water amended with dissolved chromophoric organic matter. The quantum yield of cetirizine photodegradation decreased dramatically with increasing wavelength and decreasing energy of incoming radiation, with the average value ranging from 5.28x10(-4) to 6.40x10(-3) in the ultraviolet wavelength range (280-366nm). The activation energy of cetirizine photodegradation was 10.3kJmol(-1) with an observed increase in cetirizine photodegradation as temperature increased. This is a significant environmental factor influencing half-life and an important consideration, given that cetirizine has been detected in wastewater and receiving waters from different locations globally.

AB Over time, the consumption of pharmaceutical drugs has highly augmented, directly contributing for an increase of the discharges of these substances into sewage water due to excretion, and their direct release to the environment, with or without adequate treatment. Considering that part of the sewage water is dumped into rivers and seas, this is the major source of contamination of the aquatic environment. Paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid are among the most worldwide consumed pharmaceutical drugs, frequently found in wastewater discharges and consequently in the aquatic environment in considerable amounts, posing ecotoxicity concerns especially towards aquatic non-target species. Thus, it is important to study the ecotoxicological implications that these drugs might pose to organisms from aquatic environments. The objective of this study was to assess the toxic effects of these two compounds on key biochemical features (antioxidant defenses and damage, metabolism, and cholinergic neurotoxicity) of the marine snail species Gibbula umbilicalis after an acute (96 h) exposure, simulating pulses of contamination. In order to understand the effects that those drugs have on this species, the biochemical biomarkers analyzed were the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), cholinesterases (ChEs), and the levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS). After acute exposure to paracetamol, catalase activity decreased significantly in organisms exposed to both highest concentrations; no significant alterations were observed for glutathione-S-transferases activity; TBARS concentration decreased significantly in organisms exposed to the intermediate and both highest concentrations, and cholinesterase activity increased significantly in animals exposed to the lowest concentration. However, after acute exposure to acetylsalicylic acid, catalase activity increased significantly; no significant alterations were observed for glutathione-S-transferases activity, and TBARS concentrations and cholinesterase activity increased. This set of data shows that G. umbilicalis is highly responsive to the presence of the tested drugs, and may thus be a promising species to serve as test organism in future marine ecotoxicological testing. The adoption of this species may broaden the offer of highly ecologically representative test organisms to be included in biomonitoring projects of the coastal and marine environment. Furthermore, it is possible to suggest that both drugs may pose significant deleterious effects of pro-oxidative origin to the physiology of the selected species, with potential adverse ecological consequences, even after short periods of exposure. The absence of neurotoxicity showed that despite being able to trigger antioxidant mechanisms, both drugs did not affect neurotransmission.

AB Parabens (alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid) are widely used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foodstuffs as broad-spectrum antimicrobial preservatives. Laboratory animal studies have shown that parabens possess weak estrogenic activity. Widespread exposure of humans to parabens has raised significant public health concerns. Despite such concern, little is known about the occurrence of parabens in the environment. In this study, six paraben analogues, methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl- (PrP), butyl- (BuP), benzyl- (BP), and heptyl parabens (HepP), were determined in surface sediment and sediment core samples collected from several locations in the United States (U.S.), Japan, and Korea by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Concentrations of parabens also were determined in sewage sludge collected from several wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. MeP was found in all samples, including surface sediment, sediment core, and sludge samples, at concentrations ranging from 0.312 to 540 ng/g dry weight (dw). PrP was detected in the majority of samples (79%), and the concentrations were, in general, 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than MeP concentrations. Significant positive correlations were found among the concentrations of paraben analogues in sediment and sludge, which suggested the existence of similar sources of origin for these compounds. The sum concentrations of six parabens (Sigma PBs) in sludge (geometric mean: 66.3, median: 89.5 ng/g dw) were remarkably higher than those in sediment (5.48, 5.24 ng/g dw). Vertical profiles of parabens in sediment cores from the U.S. showed a gradual increase in concentrations in the past decade, although such a trend was not clear in sediment core from Tokyo Bay, Japan.

AB This study provides the first investigation on the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in the tropical aquatic environment of Malaysia. Water samples were collected at seven different sites along the Langat River and effluents from five sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Langat River Basin. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 18 pharmaceuticals from six therapeutic classes and one metabolite. Fifteen out of these 19 pharmaceuticals were detected in the river water samples. Mefenamic acid, salicylic acid and glibenclamide were detected in all river water samples indicating their ubiquitous nature and resistance to degradation under the warm and humid tropical conditions. The median concentrations of detected pharmaceuticals ranged from less than the method detection limit (<MDL) for furosemide, loratadine, salbutamol, perindopril, metoprolol and nifedipine to 112.7?ng?L-1 for diclofenac. A similar number of pharmaceuticals were detected in the STPs effluents samples. Several of these pharmaceuticals, namely salbutamol, atenolol, metoprolol, mefenamic acid, salicylic acid and furosemide were detected in all the STPs effluents samples. The median concentrations for the detected pollutants ranged between <MDL for lovastatin and amlodipine to 1994?ng?L-1 for metformin. The highest concentration detected in the river water samples was for acetaminophen (346.3?ng?L-1) and in STPs effluents was for metformin (34228?ng?L-1). The concentrations of most analytes found in this study were comparable to those reported in the other parts of the world. However, this is the first time amlodipine is detected in the environmental samples.

AB The pharmaceutical compound carbamazepine (CBZ) is a contaminant of emerging concern. Wastewater irrigation can be a long-term, frequent source of CBZ; therefore, understanding the fate and transport of CBZ as a result of wastewater reuse practices has important environmental implications. The objective of this study was to estimate long-term soil transport of CBZ originating from treated wastewater irrigation on plots under different land uses. Field data from a previous study comparing CBZ concentrations in soil under different land uses were used in numerical modeling with HYDRUS-2D for the estimation of CBZ soil transport during 20 yr of irrigation with treated wastewater. This study showed high CBZ retention in soil under all investigated land uses. Adequate modeling results were obtained by using soil organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient (K-oc) for the CBZ linear sorption coefficient (K-d) estimation, yet an underestimation of CBZ concentration in soil was still noted. Thus, results suggest that, although highly important, organic carbon content is probably not the only soil property governing CBZ sorption at this site, indicating the potential research perspective. Modeling results showed wastewater irrigation containing CBZ for 20 yr increased the CBZ concentration in the soil profile and its vertical movement, with the slowest vertical transport rate occurring on the forested plots. Overall results suggest that a beneficial management practice could be to increase soil organic carbon (e.g., compost addition) when using treated wastewater for irrigation in order to retain CBZ in the surface soil and thus limit its leaching through the soil profile.

AB Consumption of illicit drugs is a new concern for water management that must be considered not only because of the social and public health aspects but also in an environmental context in relation with the contamination of surface waters. Indeed, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents contain drug residues that have not been eliminated since STP treatments are not completely efficient in their removal.
   We developed and validated an HPLC-MS/MS analytical method to assess the concentrations of 17 illicit drugs and metabolites in raw urban wastewaters: cocaine and its metabolites, amphetamine and amphetamine-likes (methamphetamine, MDMA, MDEA, MDA), opiates and opiate substitutes (methadone and buprenorphine), and THC-COOH cannabis metabolite.
   This method has been applied to the analysis of influent and effluent samples from 25 STPs located in France all over the country. The results allowed evaluating the drug consumption in the areas connected to the STPs and the efficiency of the treatment technology implied.
   We selected STPs according to their volume capacity, their treatment technologies (biofilters, activated sludges, MBR) and their geographical location.
   In influents, the concentrations varied between 6 ng/L for EDDP (main metabolite of methadone) and 3050 ng/L for benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite). Consumption maps were drawn for cocaine, MDMA, opiates, cannabis and amphetamine-like compounds. Geographical significant differences were observed and highlighted the fact that drug consumption inside a country is not homogeneous. In parallel, comparisons between STP technology processes showed differences of efficiency. More, some compounds appear very resistant to SW processes leading to the contamination of receiving water.

AB In this work, the distribution and the ecotoxicological risk of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to seven different therapeutic groups (five anti-inflammatory drugs, two antibiotics, an anti-epileptic drug, a beta-blocker, a nervous stimulant, four estrogens and two lipid regulators) have been studied in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. Only three of the sixteen pharmaceutical compounds were never detected in sludge while eleven of the studied pharmaceuticals were still detected in compost. Mean concentration levels of the pharmaceutically active compounds ranged between 24.9 and 4105 mu g/kg dm, 14.5-944 mu g/kg dm, 3.29-636 mu g/kg dm and 9.19-974 mu g/kg dm in primary, secondary, digested sludge and compost, respectively. An increase in the concentration levels of most of the pharmaceuticals was observed from summer to winter (mean values in primary and secondary sludge were 304 and 85.1 mu g/kg dm in summer and 435 and 175 mu g/kg dm in winter, respectively) probably due to an increase of their consumption during the coldest season and a reduction of the microbial activity under colder temperatures. The highest ecotoxicological risk, in digested sludge and compost, was due to the estrogenic compound 17 beta-estradiol. The ecotoxicological risk significantly decreased after the application of digested sludge or compost to the soils (risk quotient values ranged between 0.04 and 252 in digested sludge and 0.002-37.8 in compost and decreased to 8.10(-4)-1.92 in digested sludge-amended soil and 1.10(-4)-0.23 in compost-amended soil).

AB In the present study, a mixture of treated wastewater and surface water was used to rewet a degraded fen peatland site during a three-year rewetting experiment. We studied the behavior and effects of micropollutants by means of hydrological, physico-chemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological monitoring. The highest concentrations of micropollutants in the treated wastewater were found for the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac, some metabolites, the sweetener acesulfame, tolyl- and benzotriazole and diatrizoate. In the underlying, shallow groundwater where treated wastewater application for rewetting had been expected to have the greatest impact due to seeping and evapotranspiration processes, only a sporadic occurrence of micropollutants was found. The influence of dilution by groundwater movements was examined by applying a geohydrological model. The sorption of micropollutants onto the peaty soil also played a role, as found for carbamazepine. Further processes such as photolysis, microbial decay under low redox conditions and plant uptake can be assumed to be relevant for the removal of many substances. Ecotoxicity tests with the soil before and after rewetting did not indicate any negative impact on the soil habitat quality by wastewater application, but clearly pointed at ecotoxicologically relevant geogenic arsenic concentrations at the study site. Although a positive effect on receiving surface water systems is expected if wastewater is applied on land instead of discharged to water bodies, the rewetted soil may turn into a sink for micropollutants in the long term. Hence, the findings of the present field study encourage further investigations in order to identify the governing processes in the elimination of micropollutants in rewetted peatlands flooded with treated wastewater.

AB Antibiotics released into the environment through anthropogenic activities exert selective pressure, driving bacteria towards increasing antimicrobial resistance. The prevalence of antibiotics and the ecological risks posed in the riverine estuarine of Larut River and Sangga Besar River, which included wastewater effluents from hospital, zoo, and poultry slaughterhouse sources were investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS) were used to extract and quantify the antibiotic residues from 22 antibiotics belonging to six major antibiotic classes (sulfonamide, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, phenicol, trimethoprim, and tetracycline). Sixteen antibiotic residues were detected with concentrations ranging from limit of detection (LOD) to 1 262.3 ng/L. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides were the most frequently detected compounds. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin detected in hospital and zoo effluents posed a high risk to algae while tetracycline had low to medium ecological risks toward all the relevant organisms from aquatic environments (algae, invertebrate Daphnia magna, and fish).

AB Diclofenac is an ecotoxic pharmaceutical compound affecting both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems even at low concentrations. In this study, batch adsorption experiments were conducted to remove sodium diclofenac (SD) from aqueous solutions using rice hull biochar (RHB) adsorbents. Higher SD removals were obtained with increasing initial SD concentration, RHB dosage, contact time, and decreasing initial pH. Isotherm studies revealed that Langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data with the highest coefficient of determination for both pH 2 (R-2 = 0.9827) and pH 7 (R-2 = 0.9460). For kinetic studies, the pseudo second-order model gave R-2 = 0.9999 for both pH 2 and pH 7. SD removals reached up to 97% at pH 2 and up to 80% at pH 7. Higher SD removals were achieved at solution pH lower than the adsorbent pH(pzc) since electrostatic repulsion was eliminated. Fourier-transform infrared analysis showed the major involvement of C=O in the adsorption process.

AB Many pharmaceuticals pass the unsaturated zone before reaching an aquifer. Therefore, laboratory sand column transport experiments were conducted to study the transport behavior of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone under unsaturated conditions. The test water was artificial sewage effluent to simulate the infiltration of reused wastewater. The test water was spiked with the pharmaceutically active compounds and the tracer LiCl. Afterwards it was passed through laboratory sand columns, one experiment for each pharmaceutical. The physical and chemical parameters were recorded and general ions measured. Pharmaceuticals were measured using solid phase extraction, derivatization, and detection with GC-MS.
   The column experiments indicate a significant elimination of ibuprofen (54%), propyphenazone (55%), and diclofenac (35%), whereas carbamazepine was not eliminated. Retardation factors varied between 1.84 for carbamazepine, 2.51 for propyphenazone, 3.00 for ibuprofen, and 4.80 for diclofenac. These results show that mobility and elimination of diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone is about in the same range as for experiments under saturated conditions whereas carbamazepine had a significantly lower sorption and elimination under unsaturated conditions.

AB This study had three objectives: 1) determine occurrence of antibiotics in effluent from hospitals, residential facilities, and dairies, and in municipal wastewater 2) determine antibiotic removal at a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Albuquerque, NM, and 3) determine concentrations of antibiotics in the Rio Grande, which receives wastewater from the Albuquerque WWTP.
   Twenty-three samples of wastewater and 3 samples of Rio Grande water were analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotics. Fifty-eight percent of samples had at least one antibiotic present while 25% had three or more. Hospital effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lincomycin, and penicillin G, with 4 of 5 hospital samples having at least one antibiotic detected and 3 having four or more. At the residential sampling sites, ofloxacin was found in effluent from assisted living and retirement facilities, while the student dormitory had no detects. Only lincomycin was detected in dairy effluent (in 2 of 8 samples, at 700 and 6600 ng/L). Municipal wastewater had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, with 4 of 6 samples having at least one antibiotic present and 3 having 3 or more. The relatively high concentrations (up to 35,500 ng/L) of ofloxacin found in hospital and residential effluent may be of concern due to potential genotoxic effects and development of antibiotic resistance.
   At the Albuquerque WWTP, both raw wastewater and treated effluent had detections of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and ofloxacin, at concentrations ranging from 110 to 470 ng/L. However, concentrations in treated effluent were reduced by 20% to 77%. No antibiotics were detected in the Rio Grande upstream of the Albuquerque WWTP discharge, and only one antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, was detected in the Rio Grande (300 ng/L) below the WWTP.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW) has become a prevailing agricultural practice due to the scarcity of fresh water resources, which may have a significant impact on the microbial communities that are critical to many biogeochemical processes in soils. However, it is unclear whether there are links between soil microbial responses to long-term irrigation with different sources of wastewater and soil depth. Here we assess the influence of treated domestic (DTWW), leather industry (LTWW) and pharmaceutical (PTWW) wastewater on microbial communities in vertical soil profiles using high-throughput sequencing based on 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene profiling. We found that microbial alpha-diversity in the vertical profiles of soils was significantly influenced by TWW irrigation. Bacteria and fungi in different soil depths showed distinct responses to TWW; irrigation with TWW markedly increased abundance of bacterial OTUs and inhibited abundance of fungal OTUs. beta-diversity analysis showed that the effect of TWW irrigation on microbial communities was greater than the effect of soil depth, and microbes in subsurface soil were more sensitive to different sources of irrigation water. We also found that, based on beta-diversity analysis, irrigation with treated industrial wastewater, including LTWW and PTWW, had a greater impact on microbial community structures than DTWW. TWW irrigation significantly affected the composition of indigenous soil microbial communities at different depths and might introduce exogenous microbes into the soil environment. Our work explicitly demonstrates the vertical responses of bacterial and fungal communities in soils to irrigation with TWW from different sources, which can provides insights into the microbial-dominated geochemical processes from the perspective of the entire soil profile under the context of wastewater irrigation.

AB An anaerobic/aerobic moving-bed biofilm (A/O-MBBR) reactor system was constructed, and the treatment efficiency of aqueous antibiotics in wastewater was investigated. The effects of antibiotics on the microbial communities in the A/O-MBBR were also investigated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, removal of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) was studied in a series of experiments. When a low concentration of tetracycline (TC) was added to the reactor system, high removal efficiency of conventional pollutants (TC concentration decreased from 10 turn to 2.8 mu g L-1) was achieved. When mixed TCs (50 mu g L-1) were added to the system, the removal efficiencies of chlortetracycline (CTC), TC and oxytetracycline (OTC) reached 52.03, 41.79, and 38.42%, respectively. TC degradation was decreased to 21.16% when the antibiotic concentration was 500 mu g L-1; exposure to this TC concentration destroyed the community structure of the activated sludge bacteria in the reactor. The products of the biodegradation analysis revealed the possible degradation pathways functioning in the experimental A/O-MBBRs.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used by humans as therapeutic agents to treat or prevent illnesses. Once ingested, part of them is excreted and enters the wastewater treatment plants generating biosolids that they may be used as fertilizing complements.
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the mobility of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) in soils and soils amended with biosolid.
   Studies of NSAIDs adsorption on two different soils were carried through batch equilibrium at room temperature. The mobility of NSAIDs in soils was studied through the use of leaching columns incorporating in the top section soil enriched with NSAIDs with and without biosolid.
   Ketoprofen, naproxen and ibuprofen were determined in the leaching columns. Anti-inflammatory mobility in the soil profile depends on the specific characteristics of each system soil-biosolid. In both soils there was little mobility of anti-inflammatory in the soil profile. In Linderos soil were found in greater quantity of Ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac that in Lonquen soil.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is one of the major complex and toxic industrial effluents containing little or no biodegradable organic matters. In this study, H2O2/UV based advanced oxidation process (AOP) was used to remove organic materials from pharmaceutical industry effluent. For the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal radiation of medium pressure mercury vapor UV lamp was used in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2/UV). Results indicated that the efficiency of COD removal depends on the initial concentration of H2O2, oxidation time and pH. The efficiency of COD removal at low H2O2 concentration was very low even coupled with UV light, which can be attributed to the low generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot). At high concentration of H2O2 (500 mg/dm(3)) and optimum pH (pH = 4), 87.6% removal efficiency could be achieved during 70 min oxidation. For high concentration of H2O2 (500 mg/dm(3)) at pH 3 and 7, the maximum COD removal efficiency was 28.5% and 15.2% respectively, indicating significant roles of pH and H2O2 concentration in the process of COD removal.

AB High-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are an alternative to conventional wastewater treatment that could contribute to the circular economy by valorising reclaimed water and algal biomass. This short communication presents the removal of nutrients and contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in a pilot-scale HRAP treating primary municipal wastewater. Average removal of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, NH4-N, total phosphorus and PO4-P, was 67%, 76%, 87%, 41% and 46%, respectively. In addition, 12 CECs were detected in the influent and five in the effluent. Removals were as follows: naproxen 60%, ibuprofen 51%, methylparaben 92%, 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone 76% and oxybenzone 80%, and are comparable with literature data for conventional wastewater treatment and other HRAPs. In conclusion, studies of nature-based solutions such as HRAPs show encouraging results but need further research to understand the risks and requirements of safe wastewater and biomass reuse.

AB Dynamic modelling and simulation of a nanofiltration-forward osmosis integrated complete system was done along with economic evaluation to pave the way for scale up of such a system for treating hazardous pharmaceutical wastes. The system operated in a closed loop not only protects surface water from the onslaught of hazardous industrial wastewater but also saves on cost of fresh water by turning wastewater recyclable at affordable price. The success of dynamic modelling in capturing the relevant transport phenomena is well reflected in high overall correlation coefficient value (R (2) > 0.98), low relative error (< 0.1) and Willmott d-index (< 0.95). The system could remove more than 97.5 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) from real pharmaceutical wastewater having initial COD value as high as 3500 mg/L while ensuring operation of the forward osmosis loop at a reasonably high flux of 56-58 l per square meter per hour.

AB Phenolic compounds are ubiquitous environmental pollutants generated in the manufacture of many industrial products such as papers, metals, resins, plastics, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Because they are frequently discharged into lakes, rivers and oceans in large quantities by industries, these toxic pollutants have adversely affected our environment and ecology. Therefore, removal of these aromatic pollutants from industrial effluents has been a critical issue. A novel, practical and inexpensive method has been used for treatment of phenolic wastewater. In this study, the influence of alkali on the gasification of phenolic wastewater with K2CO3 as catalyst at 530 degrees C, 24 MPa was investigated. The results showed that presence of K2CO3 increased H-2 fraction and decreased CO fraction in the gas product via promoting water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and it also increased the gas yield. The precipitated alkali in the reactor still showed high catalytic effect on the subsequent gasification of phenolic wastewater without further alkali addition. The catalytic activity was slightly reduced because K2CO3 is transformed to KHCO3.

AB The present paper aimed to evaluate the impact of microaeration on both the removal performance of some emerging micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, hormones, and bisphenol A) and the microbial community structure of an anaerobic reactor treating synthetic wastewater. Under anaerobic conditions, the removal efficiencies of the micropollutants were very low (< 10%). However, the microaeration (1.0 mL air.min(-1) at 27 degrees C and 1 atm, equivalent to a Q(AIR)/Q(INF) ratio of 0.1) expressively improved the removal efficiencies of all compounds (> 50%). Therefore, supplementing anaerobic reactors with low amounts of oxygen seems to be an interesting strategy to enhance the removal of the micropollutants tested. However, further studies should be carried out with other compounds in order to evaluate the wide applicability of microaeration to different classes of micropollutants in lab- and full-scale treatment systems. Concerning the microbiota structure, both bacterial and archaeal communities were not compromised by the different operational conditions and preserved their functional organization with high richness during the whole experiment.

AB We analyzed and compared the distributions of 13 target pharmaceuticals in different water samples from the Hangzhou metropolitan area and Linan County, Southeast China.
   Sampling was conducted in five hospitals, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and Qiantang River. Samples were concentrated by solid-phase extraction and PPCP concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS/MS.
   Trimethoprim, erythromycin A dihydrate, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, diclofenac sodium, and atenolol were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in hospital effluents. Most of the pharmaceutical concentrations in hospital effluents were higher than those in the WWTP influents. Although both WWTPs adopt the anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic treatment process, the removal rates for pharmaceuticals, such as trimethoprim and diclofenac sodium, were completely different. Meanwhile, erythromycin A dihydrate, ofloxacin, penicillin-G, cephalexin, cefazolin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac sodium were detected in Qiantang River.
   These results indicate that hospitals are more concentrated sources of pharmaceuticals than WWTPs, and the WWTPs are not the only route of entry of pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments in these two regions.

AB The Tula Valley receives untreated wastewater from Mexico City for agricultural irrigation, half of which infiltrates to aquifers from where drinking water is extracted. Samples of wastewater and infiltrated water from three areas of the valley were analyzed for microorganisms, organic micropollutants, and some basic parameters. Concentrations of microorganisms in the infiltrated water were generally very low but the incidence of fecal coliforms (present in 68% of samples), somatic bacteriophages (36%). Giardia spp. (14%), and helminth eggs (8%) suggested a health risk. Organic micropollutants, often present at high concentrations in the wastewater, were generally absent from the infiltrated water except carbamazepine which was in 55% of samples (up to 193 ng/L). There was no correlation between carbamazepine concentrations and the presence of microorganisms but highest concentrations of carbamazepine and boron coincided. A treatment such as nanofiltration would be necessary for the infiltrated water to be a safe potable supply. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban wastewater effluents bring large amounts of nutrients, organic matter and organic micro contaminants into freshwater ecosystems. The effects of this complex mixture of pollutants on freshwater invertebrates have been studied mainly in temperate rivers and streams with high dilution capacities. In contrast, Mediterranean streams and rivers have lower dilution capacities especially during the seasonal drought, and are therefore exposed to high concentrations of pollutants. Here, we assess the effects of urban wastewater pollution on invertebrate communities from Mediterranean streams under different hydrological conditions. Specifically, we assessed the invertebrates taxonomic composition and functional biological traits in 12 streams, differing in stream and substrate size (sand or cobbles), under low (2 surveys) and baseflow (1 survey) conditions. In each stream, we selected reaches both upstream and downstream of the wastewater discharge point. Our results indicate that urban wastewater pollution favours the most tolerant invertebrate taxa and homogenises functional trait composition over time. Changes in functional traits were more evident during the seasonal drought, when the low flow conditions at the upstream and downstream sites were more severe and, pollutant concentrations downstream were at their highest. However, the effects of urban wastewater pollution were not uniform in the downstream sites; as local invertebrate communities differed in according to the river substrate and stream size (i.e., width and discharge). Overall, urban pollution caused by wastewater enhanced both, taxonomic and functional differences between the invertebrate communities. Such an absence of homogenisation among wastewater pollution impacted sites was probably related to the relevant role of stream substrate-size as well flow conditions in the rivers receiving the impact. These are attributes that need to be considered when setting the pollutant discharge limits in rivers and streams receiving effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia play a major role in global drug trade and abuse. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants has increased in the past decade in Malaysia. This study aimed to apply wastewater-based epidemiology for the first time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to estimate the consumption of common illicit drugs in urban population. Influent wastewater samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Kuala Lumpur in the summer of 2017. Concentrations of twenty-four drug biomarkers were analyzed for estimating drug consumption. Fourteen drug residues were detected with concentrations of up to 1640 ng/L. Among the monitored illicit drugs, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) or ecstasy had the highest estimated per capita consumptions. Consumption and dose of amphetamine-type stimulants (methamphetamine and MDMA) were both an order of magnitude higher than those of opioids (heroin and codeine, methadone and tramadol). Amphetamine-type stimulants were the most prevalent drugs, replacing opioids in the drug market. The prevalence trend measured by wastewater-based epidemiology data reflected the shift to amphetamine-type stimulants as reported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Narcotics Cooperation Center. Most of the undetected drug residues were new psychoactive substances (NPSs), suggesting a low prevalence of NPSs in the drug market.

AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the wastewater effluents has confirmed that conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not sufficiently effective in the pharmaceuticals' removal. The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare the photocatalytic degradation of PhACs using TiO2-P25, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) and a heterojunction of perovskite strodium titanate and graphitic carbon nitride SrTiO3/g-C3N4 (20% g-C3N4, 20CNSTO) photocatalytic materials, in hospital wastewater effluents, by simulated solar irradiation. The experiments were performed by using real wastewater samples collected from the university hospital wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent of Ioannina city (Northwestern Greece) and inherent pharmaceutical concentration levels. The analysis of the samples was accomplished by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the cases of TiO2 and CN, more than 70% of the initial concentration (e.g., venlafaxine) was degraded after 90 min, while 20CNSTO presented lower photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, some compounds were sporadically detected (e.g., fluoxetine) or their concentrations remained stable during the photocatalytic treatment time period (e.g., trimethoprim). In total 11 transformation products (TPs) were formed along the degradation processes and were identified by using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry.

AB This study assesses the degradation by electrochemical oxidation via boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes of the selected pharmaceutical compounds iopromide (IOP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and diclofenac (DCF) in simulated wastewater and real hospital effluent wastewater. The influence of the flow rate in the electrochemical cell, applied current, initial compound concentration and wastewater matrix (simulated (SWW) versus real effluent (RWW) wastewater) was evaluated. A kinetic evaluation confirmed that the degradation can be described via pseudo first-order reaction kinetics for all experimental conditions tested. It was shown that SMX, EE2 and DCF degraded readily in SWW and RWW. The degradation of IOP was significantly slower, which is in agreement with previously reported slow degradation kinetics using typical advanced oxidation processes. Activation energies for the degradation reactions were calculated. The flow rate in the electrochemical cell had only a moderate effect on the degradation rate of EE2 and DCF. The applied current, however, had a major effect. The BDD electrochemical oxidation was shown to be an effective technique for removing pharmaceutical components from the effluent of a biological hospital wastewater treatment plant. However, the slower degradation of transformation products should be taken into account, when a full mineralization of the pharmaceuticals is pursued.

AB This work aims to analyse the performances of a new hybrid process: membrane filtration to concentrate biorefractory wastewater before treatment by a hydrothermal process such as wet air oxidation. The aim is to obtain a complete discharge of the effluent in the environment. The three different synthetic wastewaters under study were pharmaceutical wastewater, grey wastewater and bilge wastewater. The results of the membrane filtration showed high retention rates as it could reach between 75% and 100% of total organic carbon retention, more than 99% of turbidity removal and more than 70% of hydrocarbon retention. Moreover, it was possible to achieve high concentration factors comprised between 17 and 40 times. Membrane fouling was chemically reversible regardless of the type of pollution. Then, the treatment of the membrane retentates by wet air oxidation process (300 degrees C, 15 MPa) could eliminate more than 83% of organic pollution for all the tested effluents. In summary, the hybrid intensified process could finally decrease the volume and the waste load of wastewater before possibly discharging it into the environment.

AB Twenty percent of the water run-off from China's land surface drains into the Yangtze River and carries the sewage of approximately 400 million people out to sea. The lower stretch of the Yangtze therefore offers the opportunity to assess the pollutant discharge of a huge population. To establish a comprehensive assessment of micropollutants, river water samples were collected monthly from May 2009 to June 2010 along a cross-section at the lowermost hydrological station of the Yangtze River not influenced by the tide (Datong Station, Anhui province). Following a prescreening of 268 target compounds, we examined the occurrence, seasonal variation, and annual loads of 117 organic micropollutants, including 51 pesticides, 43 pharmaceuticals, 7 household and industrial chemicals, and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). During the 14-month study, the maximum concentrations of particulate PAHs (1-5 mu g/g), pesticides (11-284 ng/L), pharmaceuticals (5-224 ng/L), and household and industrial chemicals (4-430 ng/L) were generally lower than in other Chinese rivers due to the dilution caused of the Yangtze River's average water discharge of approximately 30,000 m(3)/s. The loads of most pesticides, anti-infectives, and PAHs were higher in the wet season compared to the dry season, which was attributed to the increased agricultural application of chemicals in the summer, an elevated water discharge through the sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as a result of high hydraulic loads and the related lower treatment efficiency, and seasonally increased deposition from the atmosphere and runoff from the catchment. The estimated annual load of PAHs in the river accounted for some 4% of the total emission of PAHs in the whole Yangtze Basin. Furthermore, by using sucralose as a tracer for domestic wastewater, we estimate a daily disposal of approximately 47 million m(3) of sewage into the river, corresponding to 1.8% of its average hydraulic load. In summary, the annual amounts flushed by the Yangtze River into the East China Sea were 2.9 x 10(6) tons of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC), 369 tons of PAHs, 98 tons of pesticides, 152 tons of pharmaceuticals, and 273 tons of household and industrial chemicals. While the concentrations seem comparably moderate, the pollutant loads are considerable and pose an increasing burden to the health of the marine coastal ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB During the current global COVID-19 pandemic and opioid epidemic, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring public health trends by analysis of biomarkers including drugs, chemicals, and pathogens. Wastewater surveillance downstream at wastewater treatment plants provides large-scale population and regional-scale aggregation while upstream surveillance monitors locations at the neighborhood level with more precise geographic analysis. WBE can provide insights into dynamic drug consumption trends as well as environmental and toxicological contaminants. Applications of WBE include monitoring policy changes with cannabinoid legalization, tracking emerging illicit drugs, and early warning systems for potent fentanyl analogues along with the resurging wave of stimulants (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine). Beyond drug consumption, WBE can also be used to monitor pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, including antidepressants and antipsychotics. In this manuscript, we describe the basic tenets and techniques of WBE, review its current application among drugs of abuse, and propose methods to scale and develop both monitoring and early warning systems with respect to measurement of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals. We propose new frontiers in toxicological research with wastewater surveillance including assessment of medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder (e.g., buprenorphine, methadone) in the context of other social burdens like COVID-19 disease.

AB In this study, we investigated the combination of algal treatment and subsequent oxidation to improve the antibiotics removal and refractory organics degradation in livestock wastewater effluent. We also proposed a better combination of oxidation processes for robust treatment of recalcitrant wastewater, mainly focusing on the removal of antibiotics. Stand-alone processes of O-3, O-3/H2O2, ultraviolet C (UVC), and UVC/H2O2 as well as their combined effects were evaluated as a downstream oxidation process. Prior to those oxidation processes, the effluent was treated with microalgae under continuous light illumination, which turned it into alkaline wastewater (pH > 10). The algal treatment was feasible not only to directly remove antibiotics resistant to a specific oxidation method, but also to improve the degradation of antibiotics and effluent organic matter in the alkaline wastewater upon subsequent oxidation. The alkaline wastewater was more favorable for the removal of antibiotics (especially for clopidol) with UVC treatment (UVC and UVC/H2O2). The algal treatment promoted ozonation to some extent for the degradation of florfenicol in the effluent. The removal of antibiotics by ozonation decreased with added H2O2, whereas the UVC performance was improved by adding H2O2. For ozonation followed by UVC treatment, the ozonation dominated the degradation of selected antibiotics.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems serve approximately 25% of the U. S. population. However, little is known regarding the occurrence and fate of organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs), including endocrine disrupting compounds, during onsite treatment. A range of OWCs including surfactant metabolites, steroids, stimulants, metalchelating agents, disinfectants, antimicrobial agents, and pharmaceutical compounds was quantified in wastewater from 30 onsite treatment systems in Summit and Jefferson Counties, CO. The onsite systems represent a range of residential and nonresidential sources. Eighty eight percent of the 24 target compounds were detected in one or more samples, and several compounds were detected in every wastewater sampled. The wastewater matrices were complex and showed unique differences between source types due to differences in water and consumer product use. Nonresidential sources generally had more OWCs at higher concentrations than residential sources. Additional aerobic biofilter- based treatment beyond the traditional anaerobic tank-based treatment enhanced removal for many OWCs. Removal mechanisms included volatilization, biotransformation, and sorption with efficiencies from < 1% to > 99% depending on treatment type and physicochemical properties of the compound. Even with high removal rates during confined unit onsite treatment, OWCs are discharged to soil dispersal units at loadings up to 20 mg/m(2)/d, emphasizing the importance of understanding removal mechanisms and efficiencies in onsite treatment systems that discharge to the soil and water environments.

AB We developed an original analytical method for monitoring five estrogens, nine androgens, nine progestogens, six glucocorticoids, and one mineralocorticoid in one water sample using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and then 45 river, 13 discharging sites, and 4 composite effluent samples were analyzed to reveal their occurrence and sources in urban rivers. Of the 45 river samples, androgens were the dominant steroids detected (total concentrations up to 480 ng/L), followed by glucocorticoids (up to 52 ng/L), progestogens (up to 50 ng/L), and estrogens up to 9.8 ng/L. The summed concentration for each class of detected hormones in 13 discharging site samples was higher than that in river samples, up to 1887 ng/L for androgens, 390 ng/L for glucocorticoids, 75 ng/L for progestogens, and 25 ng/L for estrogens, A principal component analyses with multiple linear regression based on the profiles of all target compounds was applied to identify the source apportionment and to predict the contribution from different sources, It was found that 62.7% of the mean summed hormones were contributed by freshly discharged untreated sewage, 29.4% by treated sewage and/or naturally attenuated untreated sewage, and 7.9% by an unknown source, possibly pharmaceutical manufacturing plants.

AB Most antibiotics are only partially metabolised by patients before being discharged into the municipal sewage system along with patient excreta. Studies have shown that the majority of antibiotics pass through sewage treatment and are then released into the environment. Accordingly, investigations conducted in various countries have detected a number of antibiotics in the low mu g or ng per litre range in different environmental compartments. Studies connecting mass balances of use on a local scale and of input and analysis of the antibiotic concentrations present in municipal sewage treatment plants are scarce. Data on local use of antibiotics and their relation to nationwide consumption are not available. This study investigated the use, input, and fate of antibiotics on a local scale and this data were compared with the German nationwide consumption. 42 antibiotics and 15 antimycotics were used in the mass balance consideration over a period of one year. It was found that the local pattern of usage differed only little from that found nationwide. Seasonal changes were minor and the concentrations actually measured were found to be in the expected range. Differences in both the identified occurrence and the concentrations of the target compounds were observed within and between the three sampling periods.

AB Recently, the occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the aquatic environment was recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry and as a matter of public concern Residues of PhACs have been found as contaminants in sewage, surface, and ground- and drinking water samples
   Since June 2000, a new long-term monitoring program of sewage, surface, ground- and drinking water has been carried out in Berlin, Germany Samples, collected periodically from selected sites in the Berlin area, are investigated for residues of PhACs and related contaminants The purpose of this monitoring is to investigate these compounds over a long time period to get more reliable data on their occurrence and fate in the different aquatic compartments Moreover, the surface water investigations allow the calculation of season-dependent contaminant loads in the Berlin waters In the course of the monitoring program, PhACs and some other polar compounds were detected at concentrations up to the mug/L-level in all compartments of the Berlin water cycle The monitoring is accompanied and supported by several other investigations such as laboratory column experiments and studies on bank filtration and drinking water treatment using conventional or membrane filtration techniques.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals and their excretion in wastewater is a continuous source of pollution for aquatic ecosystems. In certain cases these compounds are found in the environment at concentrations high enough to cause disturbance in aquatic organisms. Aware of this problem hospitals are giving increasing attention to the nature of their effluents and their impact on the environment, by implementing more efficient effluent management policies. This concern is justified in view of the large volumes of toxic products consumed (detergents, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, chemical reagents, radioactive elements, etc.). Moreover, these effluents usually do not undergo any specific treatment before being discharged into urban sewage networks. In this article, we present a method for selecting the pharmaceuticals discharged in hospital effluents that have the worst impact on the aquatic ecosystem, primarily based on their bioaccumulation potential. This study focused on the pharmaceuticals consumed at the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), the second largest hospital structure in France (5200 hospital beds). Of the 960 substances consumed in HCL hospitals, a shortlist of 70 substances considered as being potentially bioaccumulable was established. The use of aggravating factors of risk has then led to the final selection of 14 priority compounds. They include 4 compounds consumed in large quantities in HCL hospitals, 6 endocrine disruptors and 4 potentially ecotoxic compounds. For all these compounds, it is now advisable to verify their bioaccumulation potential experimentally and confirm their presence in the environment. In addition, in order to monitor the risk relating to possible contamination of the food chain, it will be necessary to measure accumulated dose levels in species of different trophic levels. Lastly, chronic ecotoxicity tests will permit evaluating the danger and risk that some of these substances may represent for aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most sulfonamides, widely used around the world, are excreted via feces and urine along with their metabolites in humans and animals. Therefore, understanding the potential removal pathway of sulfonamides and their metabolites in wastewater treatment systems is of importance. The occurrence and fate of four sulfonamides and their acetyl metabolites in wastewater and sludge in a biological aerated filter in Xiamen city were evaluated. Six of the target compounds were detected in wastewater, but only parent compounds were detected in sludge. The highest concentration in wastewater was acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (Ac-SMZ) with a concentration of 75.2 ng/L. Removal efficiency and mass load in wastewater treatment systems were calculated. In terms of the overall removal efficiency, they ranged from 24.4 to 100%. The removal efficiencies of sulfamerazine (SM1), sulfamethazine (SM2), and sulfadiazine (SD) were up to 100% while N-acetyl sulfamerazine (Ac-SM1) showed the lowest removal efficiency. Biodegradation was the dominant remove pathway according to the mass balance analysis while SD and SM2 were sludge adsorption. The results can provide an insight into the fate of target sulfonamides in BAF systems and provide data to assess their potential ecological risks.

AB Currently, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) attempt to achieve the shifting from general pollution parameters control to reduction of organic micropollutants discharge. However, they have not been able to satisfy the increasing ecological safety needs. In this study, the removal of micropollutants was investigated, and the ecological safety was assessed for a local WWTP. Although the total concentration of 31 micropollutants detected was reduced by 83% using the traditional biological treatment processes, the results did not reflect chemicals that had poor removal efficiencies and low concentrations. Of the five categories of micropollutants, herbicides, insecticides, and bactericides were difficult to remove, pharmaceuticals and UV filters were effectively eliminated. The specific photosynthesis inhibition effect and non-specific bioluminescence inhibition effect from wastewater were detected and evaluated using hazardous concentration where 5% of aquatic organisms are affected. The photosynthesis inhibition effect from wastewater in the WWTP was negligible, even the untreated raw wastewater. However, the bioluminescence inhibition effect from wastewater which was defined as the priority biological effect, posed potential ecological risk. To decrease non-specific biological effects, especially of macromolecular dissolved organic matter, overall pollutant reduction strategy is necessary. Meanwhile, the ozonation process was used to further decrease the bioluminescence inhibition effects from the secondary effluent; >= 0.34 g O-3/g DOC of ozone dose was recommended for micropollutants elimination control and ecological safety.

AB Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds employed as medicinal drugs. They have severe physic-chemical properties which make them destructive for non-target species. Consequently, their continuous addition in the environment may pose hazardous effects. Among these, diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is extensively used in Pakistan which may lead to its accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic environment. Present study aims to assess the presence and concentration of pharmaceutically active drug (DCF) in surface water and wastewater of twin cities of Pakistan (Rawalpindi and Islamabad). For this purpose, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was adopted involving solid-phase extraction procedure. Wastewater samples were collected from various sites of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Results of HPLC analysis revealed that DCF was extant with considerably high concentration, not only in wastewater but also in surface water samples. Concentrations as high as 216 mu g L-1 was detected in Rawat industrial area and low as 8 mu g L-1 was detected in dairy farm wastewater samples collected from Taramri. However, maximum DCF levels in residential wastewater and hospital wastewater were detected to be 105 mu g L-1 and 34 mu g L-1, respectively. Moreover, the highest detected level (116 mu g L-1) was found in surface water of Sawan River. Further, results of ecological risk assessment revealed its possible toxic effects of DCF on various aquatic organisms.

AB This manuscript reports a 3-year study on occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and triclosan in surface waters of a central urban region of So Paulo State of Southeast Brazil (the Monjolinho River in So Carlos). Water samples collected once at every 2 months were pre-concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The most frequently detected compounds in higher concentrations were caffeine, paracetamol, and atenolol (maximum concentrations 129,585, 30,421, and 8199 ng L-1, respectively), while hormones estrone and 17-beta-estradiol were the least detected, in levels up to 14.8 ng L-1. There was an increasing trend in concentrations of most of the compounds along the river course, especially downstream of the river where there is discharge of both wastewater treatment plant effluent and raw sewage from a particular region of So Carlos city. Concentrations of contaminants were higher during dry periods as a result of decline in the water levels. Decrease in concentrations near the river mouth occurred to different extents for each compound. It was high for caffeine and atenolol, but was very low for carbamazepine and diclofenac. The present study reports the first data about the occurrence of some major emerging contaminants in the Monjolinho River. Besides its regional significance, this work may assist in composing a dataset for water contamination diagnosis focusing on emerging contaminants, both in the Brazilian as well as in the Global studies related to aquatic ecosystems. Such datasets can be helpful for making future public policies on water quality, since these compounds are not yet legally regulated.

AB Municipal biosolids are in widespread use as additives to agricultural soils in the United States. Although it is well known that digested sewage sludge is laden with organic wastewater contaminants, the fate and behavior of micropollutants in biosolids-amended agricultural soils remain unclear. An outdoor mesocosm study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, to explore the fate of 72 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) over the course of three years in that were placed in plastic containers made from polyvinylchloride and kept exposed to ambient outdoor conditions. Of the 72 PPCPs tested for using EPA Method 1694, 15 were initially detected in the soil/biosolids mixtures at concentrations ranging from low parts-per-billion to parts-per-million levels. The anti-microbials triclocarban and triclosan showed the highest initial concentrations at 2715 and 1265 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Compounds showing no discernable loss over three years of monitoring included diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, thiabendazole and triclocarban. The following half-life estimates were obtained for compounds showing first-order loss rates: azithromycin (408-990 d) carbamazepine (462-533 d), ciprofloxacin (1155-3466 d), doxycycline (533-578 d), 4-epitetracycline (630 d), gemfibrozil (224-231 d), norfloxacin (990-1386 d), tetracycline (578 d), and triclosan (182-193 d). Consistent with other outdoor degradation studies, chemical half-lives determined empirically exceeded those reported from laboratory studies or predicted from fate models. Study results suggest that PPCPs shown in the laboratory to be readily biotransformable can persist in soils for extended periods of time when applied in biosolids. This study provides the first experimental data on the persistence in biosolids-amended soils for ciprofloxacin, diphenhydramine, doxycycline, 4-epitetracycline, gemfibrozil, miconazole, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and thiabendazole.

AB The effectiveness of UV-based processes (UV and UV/H2O2) for the removal of pharmaceuticals in real wastewater using bench-scale experiment setup with a treatment capacity of 10 m(3)/day was investigated. Forty-one kinds of pharmaceuticals including 12 antibiotics and 10 analgesics were detected in secondary effluent used for tested water. For UV process a good removal seems to be expected for just a few pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen, diclofenac and antipyrine. Especially, the removal efficiencies of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin, erythromycin and azithromycin for UV alone process were found to be very low even by the introduction of considerable UV dose of 2768 mJ/cm(2). For UV/H2O2 process, a 90% removal efficiency could be accomplished in 39 pharmaceuticals at UV dose of 923 mJ/cm(2), indicating that it will be possible to reduce UV energy required for the effective pharmaceuticals removal by the combination of H2O2 with UV process.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater has a large number of pollutants, so it is particularly important to study the COD value of total wastewater discharge outlet. Taking a pharmaceutical company as an example, this paper establishes an ARIMA model based on the COD data of total discharge outlet, and then verify the prediction accuracy of this model. The results show that the ARIMA (4,1,2) model could be used to predict the COD data of total discharge outlet in this company.

AB The in-sample stability of selected pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, and their metabolites in wastewater was assessed under six different conditions-untreated, addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium metabisulfite solution, combined with or without sterile filtration, and at four representative temperatures, at 35 degrees C for up to 28 days, 22 degrees C for 56 days, and 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C for 196 days, or freeze/thaw cycles for 24 weeks. Paracetamol, 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, and cocaine were poorly stable in untreated wastewater-e.g., with 50% transformation within 1.2-8.1 days at 22 degrees C, and acidification reduced their in-sample transformations. Acesulfame, carbamazepine, cotinine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine, norfentanyl, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), and norbuprenorphine were highly or moderately stable over the observed period, even in untreated wastewater. Fitting of pseudo-first-order kinetics and the Arrhenius equation was used to develop a multistage transformation estimation model combined with an interactive tool to evaluate possible transformation scenarios of selected biomarkers for the processes from sampling to preanalysis. However, as the wastewater composition can vary between sites and over time, the variability of in-sample stability requires further exploration.

AB Struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) crystallisation is a promising approach for phosphorus recovery from swine wastewater. Currently, intensive pig feeding has made heavy metals (HMs) extensive in swine wastewater; therefore, significant amounts of HMs have been detected in struvite recovery products. In this study, the HM residues in the struvite products recovered from stirred and fluidised bed reactors were investigated. The results showed that Zn, Mn, and Cu were the most abundant elements in swine wastewater (1,175.3 +/- 178.0, 745.4 +/- 51.5, and 209.3 +/- 54.414 mu g L-1, respectively). The HMs, especially Zn (97.0%) and Cu (96.8%), were mainly distributed in the total suspended solids (TSS) of the swine wastewater. Redundancy analysis revealed that the HMs in the struvite products harvested from the fluidised bed reactor were mainly attributable to the aggregation of dissolved matters, because most TSS were elutriated through fluidisation. In contrast, the HMs in the struvite products harvested from the stirred reactor mainly originated from the TSS, which complexed with the HMs, and co-precipitated and settled with the struvite products. Furthermore, chemical fractionation of the HM species confirmed that the presence of HMs in the struvite products was mainly attributable to metal precipitation and organic aggregation.

AB The detection and monitoring of illicit drug concentrations in environmental waters is of increasing interest. This study aimed to determine if illicit and regulated compounds, their potential pre-cursors, and metabolites varied in amount discharged into the environment from treated wastewater at different facilities. Water samples were taken from discharge points of four different tertiary wastewater treatment plants discharging directly into the Hawkesbury-Nepean River (Australia) on two different occasions and analysed to determine the concentrations of compounds including: ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine. Here, we show that detectable levels of illicit drug and metabolites are being emitted on a consistent basis after having persisted through the wastewater treatment process. The concentrations of methamphetamine are in excess of previously reported surface water concentrations. The estimated total load of compounds being discharged on a daily basis is greater than similar sized catchment areas. The results presented here are of concern from both an ecological and human health perspective.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is a kind of high-hazardous waste. To realize non-waste production, experiment and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation were performed to reveal the hydraulic mechanism of mixing modes. Three digesters, numbered 0# (no-port), 1# (one-port), and 4# (four-port), were conducted by dextran pharmaceutical wastewater. Digester 0# is the control group without mixing. Mixing mode of bottom inlet and high-position outlet is employed to 1# and 4#, the outlets of 1# and 4# are centralized outlet with only one port and distributed outlets with four ports, respectively. Experiment result shows the daily biogas production of 1# and 4# are 45% and 58% higher than 0#, and the pollutants removal rate increased 20% and 24%, respectively. CFD simulation shows the second phase (dextran wastewater) of 4# failing to form a complete hydraulic path like the first phase (water), which explain the mixing modes can greatly improve the biogas yield, but the four-port mode has a weaker advantage than the one-port.

AB A growing concern exists over water contamination by veterinary pharmaceuticals from small pig farms in Yucatan, Mexico, where the anaerobic digesters installed as the wastewater treatment system are not operated properly. Therefore, considerable interest exists to develop analytical methods to detect these compounds and characterize their fate in the environment. In this study, the detection of three antibiotics (enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole) and a beta-agonist (ractopamine) was carried out using fluorescence spectrophotometry, with a semi-quantitative approach and a low environmental impact. Wastewater samples from 10 pig farms were analyzed, detecting concentrations of approximately 0.043 mu g mL(-1) for enrofloxacin, 1.427 mu g mL(-1) for oxytetracycline, and 9.748 mu g mL(-1) for sulfamethoxazole. The detection of these pharmaceuticals in the effluents of treated wastewater from the biodigesters of the pig farms suggests the need to optimize the system and prevent the entry of these compounds into the environment.

AB Fungi are known to be more resistant to toxic compounds and more effective in removing recalcitrant organics such as phenols than bacteria. Here we examined the removal of phenols (as a component of Zopliclone drugs), added to non-sterile pharmaceutical wastewater with continuous treatment fungal bioreactor by its augmentation with mono-species of white-rot fungi (WRF) Trametes versicolor. Results showed that WRF in a sterile reactor (a batch mode) were moderately effective for removal of phenols (40% in seven days); however, native wastewater microbes at optimal conditions for fungi (pH 5.5, 25 degrees C) were more effective (90%, both in batch and continuous flow modes). In continuous flow mode, addition of WRF was an effective way to mitigate high loads of phenols (up to 400 mg/L), by both fungal enzymes (growth rate 0.075 h(-1), laccase enzymatic activity 4 nkat/mL) and biosorption. The study confirmed that naturaly occuring fungi in combination with fungus-augmentation is an effective approach for treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Activated sludge treatment of highly foaming pharmaceutical wastewater was carried out with modified bubble columns equipped with a mechanical foam-breaker (MFRD). The geometry of the bubble column was modified based on the foam breaking mechanism of the MRFD in order to improve the foam breaking capacity and hence to enhance the treatment capacity. Four types of modifications were examined. The activated sludge treatment of the wastewater with the modified columns was successfully carried out with COD removal efficiency about 90% at BOD loading of 4 g/Ld. Little effect of the mechanical foam control on the sludge settling characteristics was observed. The column modification significantly reduced the power required for foam control. The maximum power decrement of 75% was attained. Furthermore, oxygen transfer was found to be facilitated in the modified bubble columns. The results are expected to be helpful for economic and effective treatment of highly foaming organic wastewater.

AB Recovering phosphorus from livestock wastewater has gained extensive attention. The residue of veterinary antibiotics in the wastewater may be present in the recovered products, thereby posing pharmacological threats to the agricultural planting and human health. This study investigated antibiotic occurrence in the struvite particles recovered from swine wastewater by using a fluidized bed. Results revealed that tetracyclines possessed significant residues in the struvite granules, with the values ranging from 195.2 mu g.kg(-1) to 1995.0 mu g.kg(-1). As for fluoroquinolones, their concentrations varied from 0.4 mu g.kg(-1) to 1104.0 mu g.kg(-1). Struvite particles were of various sizes and shapes and displayed different antibiotic adsorption capacities. The data also showed that the smaller granules contained much more antibiotics than the larger ones, indicating that the fluidized granulation process of struvite crystals plays an important role on the accumulation of antibiotics. For tetracyclines, organic matters and struvite adsorption exerted significant impacts on tetracyclines migration. The outcomes underscore the need to consider the residues of antibiotics in resource recovery from wastewater because they exert pharmacological impacts on the utilization of recovered products.

AB White rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade. However, several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full-scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates, the partial re-inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times. This work proposes the immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors at bench scale (flowrates of 10 L/d and reactor capacity of 10 L) for the treatment of different urban wastewater. This type of bioreactor achieved remarkable reductions of the total organic carbon loading of the wastewater (70-75%) in a wide range of C:N and C:P ratios with limited addition of supplementary substrates, non-refreshment of the fungal biomass and only 1-day of hydraulic retention. The addition of gallic acid as quinone-like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes increased the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants mediated by the so-called advanced bio-oxidation process. The immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors also showed a remarkable stabilization of the fungi during the continuous treatment of different urban wastewater under non-sterile conditions. Thus, this system is a sound alternative for biological urban wastewater treatment with pharmaceutical removal because overcome all the problems usually associated with the water treatment technologies based on white rot fungi that makes difficult the scaling-up of the process and its implementation in full scale wastewater treatment plants.

AB Seasonal variations in the concentrations and fate of 20 selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated over one year in a wastewater treatment plant in New Zealand, which relies on a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Bardenpho as parallel processes for its secondary treatment. Results showed that all of the monitored PPCPs were detected in the wastewater influent. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and caffeine were predominant in the influent, whereas in the effluent, beta-blockers and benzotriazole were present at significant concentrations. Total PPCPs' concentration in the influent was found to be 130 mu g/L. Average removal efficiency was found to be >= 99% for acetaminophen, caffeine, TCEP, naproxen, and ibuprofen, whereas < 50% of trimethoprim, metoprolol, and benzotriazole were removed. Contrary to the existing literature, no significant differences were found in the removal of PPCPs through MBR and Bardenpho processes, hinting that optimally operated Bardenpho can be equally effective in the removal of emerging contaminants as MBR. The occurrence and removal efficiencies of PPCPs were found to exhibit significant seasonal variations, with the highest influent concentrations of PPCPs reported in autumn and winter. Heavy rainfall had an insignificant impact on PPCPs' removal efficiencies although it resulted in much-diluted concentrations of PPCPs in the influent. Spearman's correlation analysis showed significant correlations between PPCPs' mass loads in the influent, wastewater quality parameters, and environmental factors. It was also found that, except sulfamethoxazole, ecotoxicity risks were minimal for the rest of the monitored PPCPs in wastewater effluent.

AB Ozonation followed by a polishing moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was implemented in pilot and laboratory to remove the residual pharmaceuticals and toxicity from wastewater effluent, which was from a pilot hybrid system of MBBR and activated sludge, receiving municipal wastewater. The delivered ozone dosages achieving 90% pharmaceutical removal were determined both in pilot and laboratory experiments and they were normalised to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), illustrating our findings were comparable with previously published literature. During wastewater ozonation, the intensity of natural fluorescence was found to be greatly associated with the concentrations of the studied pharmaceuticals. In pilot experiments, toxicity, measured by Vibrio fischeri, increased after ozonation at delivered ozone dosages at 0.38-0.47 mg O-3/mg DOC and was completely removed by the subsequent polishing MBBR. Laboratory experiments verified that the polishing MBBR was able to remove the toxicity produced by the ozonation.

AB A multistage countercurrent solvent extraction model was used for recovering N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) from the pharmaceutical wastewater. The theoretical stages were obtained to be five by graphical method in the light of the fitted phase equilibrium data. And then the five-stage countercurrent extraction experiments were performed in the actual and simulant effluent systems, respectively. It was found that the optimum conditions of the experiments were as follow: pH value of 8, phase ratio (O/A) of 1:1, and addition of 0.05 mass fraction of NaCl solid into wastewater at room temperature. The reliability of the theoretical stages was verified on the basis of the relative errors (<0.0641) calculated by the theoretical and experimental data, as well as the high extraction efficiency obtained by the actual and simulant wastewater systems. The results showed that the content of DMAC in the simulant wastewaters decreased to 0.0074, the actual one dropped to 0.0078, and thus the extraction efficiency of DMAC was 97.53% and 97.40%, respectively.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 43 emerging contaminants including 9 endocrine-disrupting chemicals and 34 pharmaceuticals in three sites in Hebei Province, north China. Each site has a wastewater irrigated plot and a separate groundwater irrigated plot for comparison purpose. The results showed that the concentrations of the target compounds in the wastewater irrigated soils were in most cases higher than those in the groundwater irrigated soils. Among the 43 target compounds, nine compounds bisphenol-A, triclocarban, triclosan, 4-nonylphenol, salicylic acid, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, trimethoprim and primidone were detected at least once in the soils. Preliminary environmental risk assessment showed that triclocarban might pose high risks to terrestrial organisms while the other detected compounds posed minimal risks. Irrigation with wastewater could lead to presence or accumulation of some emerging contaminants to some extent in irrigated soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article is focused on optimization of derivatization of acidic drugs from the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID): salicylic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac. Derivatization is a necessary step for analysis of pharmaceuticals by GC. MSTFA (N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) and BSTFA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) were used as a derivatization reagents and tested under different conditions: volume, temperature and time of derivatization. Results of optimization were compared and optimized conditions were successfully applied for analysis of real samples of wastewater. Wastewater samples were collected from influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The whole analytical procedure involved solid phase extraction (SPE), optimized derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF MS. Limits of detection (LOD) ranged between 8.9 - 71.6 ng.L-1 and limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 29.5 - 238.7 ng.L-1 depending on the specific compound. Concentration of selected drugs in real samples of wastewater varied from 0.1 to 30 mu g.L-1 in influent and from 0.05 to 2 mu g.L-1 in effluent, depending on the compound.

AB BACKGROUND The objective of this research was the valorization of an agro-food industry residue, namely codfish salting wastewater, through the recovery of valuable bioactive compounds. Approximately 200 L of salted wastewater are generated for each ton of fresh codfish, carrying protein and free amino acids at a concentration of c. 10 g L-1, and sodium chloride (NaCl) at c. 250 g L-1. RESULTS Protein and free amino acids were selectively recovered by sorption with the Amberlite XAD16 resin. Food-grade acetone was used to elute amino acids while a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) desorbed protein. Recovery of protein and of hydrophobic to neutral amino acids was 100%; NaCl was also partially recovered from the salting wastewater, at a level of 33%. Kinetics and mechanisms of adsorption and desorption were investigated. CONCLUSIONS The process implemented can be considered as a valuable management option for codfish salting wastewater, it can contribute to the fish industry sustainability and can serve as a source of nutrients. Free amino acids and protein extracts can find application in animal and human nutrition through incorporation into functional food and drinks, as well as in cosmetics and in pharmaceutical formulations.

AB BackgroundHospital wastewater is commonly polluted with high loads of pharmaceutically active compounds, which pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and end up in water bodies, posing ecological and health risks. White-rot fungal treatments can cope with the elimination of a wide variety of micropollutants while remaining ecologically and economically attractive. Unfortunately, bacterial contamination has impeded so far a successful implementation of fungal treatment for real applications.ResultsThis work embodied a 91-day long-term robust continuous fungal operation treating real non-sterile hospital wastewater in an air pulsed fluidized bed bioreactor retaining the biomass. The hydraulic retention time was 3days and the ageing of the biomass was avoided through partial periodic biomass renovation resulting in a cellular retention time of 21days. Evolution of microbial community and Trametes abundance were evaluated.ConclusionsThe operation was able to maintain an average pharmaceutical load removal of over 70% while keeping the white-rot fungus active and predominant through the operation.

AB Cruise ship wastewater discharges are pollution sources towards the marine environment that are poorly characterized. In this study, wastewater samples from cruise ships have been obtained during repair works in a shipyard. Different organic pollutants have been analyzed and their concentrations were similar to those in urban wastewaters for pharmaceuticals and fragrances, but higher for UV filters and PAHs. For the first time, cypermethrin, a pesticide highly toxic towards aquatic species, was found at relevant concentrations (> 1 mu g L boolean AND-1). The faecal microorganisms were for all parameters higher than 10 boolean AND 4 CFU 100 mL boolean AND(-)1, which together with the presence of antibiotic compounds in wastewater (e.g., triclosan), could potentially lead to the generation of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). The historical position of cruise ships, determined from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), were used to define the time ships were underway, at port, or in repair. From ship's passenger and crew load, and from estimates of discharges the total volume of wastewater produced by these ships (371,000 m boolean AND 3 year boolean AND-1) and the average flow (0.15 +/- 0.03 m boolean AND 3crew boolean AND-1 day boolean AND-1) were calculated.

AB Advanced treatment techniques, like ozone, activated carbon and TiO2 in combination with UV, are proposed to improve removal efficiency of micropollutants during wastewater treatment. In a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature, we found significantly reduced overall ecotoxicity of municipal wastewaters treated with either ozone (n=667) or activated carbon (=113), while TiO2 and UV was not yet assessed. As comparative investigations regarding the detoxification potential of these advanced treatment techniques in municipal wastewater are scarce, we assessed them in four separate Gammarus-feeding trials with 20 replicates per treatment. These bioassays indicate that ozone concentrations of approximately 0.8 mg ozone/mg DOC may produce toxic transformation products. However, referred effects are removed if higher ozone concentrations are used (1.3 mg ozone/mg DOC). Moreover, the application of 1 g TiO2/I and ambient UV consistently reduced ecotoxicity. Although activated carbon may remove besides micropollutants also nutrients, which seemed to mask its detoxification potential, this treatment technique reduced the ecotoxicity of the wastewater following its amendment with nutrients. Hence, all three advanced treatment techniques are suitable to reduce the ecotoxicity of municipal wastewater mediated by micropollutants and may hence help to meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently occurring in sludge and waters from sewage treatment plants (STPs). Sludge obtained from sewage treatment is often applied as a fertilizer in agriculture and not many studies about the uptake of pharmaceuticals into crops can be found. In this paper, we present a greenhouse experiment to study the presence of four NSAIDs (naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) in two different crops (soybean and wheat) after application of sludge as a fertilizer. Two different amounts of sludge were added to the soil; the recommended amount (with respect to phosphorus content) and the double recommended amount. One treatment without sludge was also included as a blank. The crops were harvested after 60 as well as 110 days. Only diclofenac and ibuprofen were detected in the sludge in concentrations of 22 and 217 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. None of the NSAIDs were detected in the crops from any of the treatments. Compared to the amounts applied to the soil, detection limits correspond to an uptake of less than 2% for diclofenac and 0.8% for ibuprofen. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study of wastewater treatment plants in three Canadian cities, selected illicit drugs, including cocaine and its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE), amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy (i.e. MDMA) were detected in untreated wastewater. Cocaine was the most widely used illicit drug at a median level for the 3 cities of 15.7 doses per day per 1000 people. For the other drugs, the median doses per day per 1000 people were 1.8 for amphetamine, 4.5 for methamphetamine and 0.4 for ecstasy. Methamphetamine use was highest in the largest city and cocaine use was lowest in the smallest city. Removal of the illicit drugs by wastewater treatment was generally >50%, except in a WWTP that uses primary treatment. The community consumption estimate for ecstasy in the present study is far below published estimates of the prevalence of ecstasy use among the Canadian population, which may be due to only occasional use of ecstasy.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the potential of constructed wetlands (CWs) for removal of antibiotics (enrofloxacin and oxytetracycline) and antibiotic resistant bacteria from saline aquaculture wastewaters. Removal of other contaminants (nutrients, organic matter and metals) and toxicity reduction and the influence of antibiotics with these processes were evaluated. Thus, nine CWs microcosms, divided into three treatments, were assembled and used to treat wastewater (doped or not with the selected antibiotics) between October and December of 2015. Each week treated wastewater was removed and new wastewater (doped or not) was introduced in CWs. Results showed >99% of each antibiotic was removed in CWs. After three weeks of adaptation, removal percentages >95% were also obtained for total bacteria and for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Nutrients, organic matter and metal removal percentages in CWs treated wastewater were identical in the absence and in the presence of each antibiotic. Toxicity in treated wastewaters was significantly lower than in initial wastewaters, independently of antibiotics presence. Results showed CWs have a high efficiency for removing enrofloxacin or oxytetracycline as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria from saline aquaculture wastewaters. CWs can also remove other contaminants independently of drug presence, making the aquaculture wastewater possible to be reutilized and/or recirculated.

AB In the present study, the occurrence of 40 pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutic groups was investigated for the first time in hospital effluent, wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent, and seawater in Mahdia, Tunisia. Forty-six samples were collected within a 6-month sampling period. Pharmaceuticals were analyzed using solid-phase extraction followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Thirty-three out of the forty target compounds were detected over a wide concentration of ranges, from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter, depending on the type of sample. Maximum values were detected for caffeine at 902 mu gL(-1) in hospital wastewater. This compound, as well as salicylic acid, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethizole, were detected in all samples. The average concentration of total pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater (340 mu gL(-1)) was higher than those detected in influent and effluent wastewater and seawater (275.11 and 0.2 mu gL(-1), respectively). Risk quotients (RQs) were also estimated to provide a preliminary environmental risk assessment and results revealed that sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine could pose medium/high risk to the tested aquatic organisms for maximum measured concentrations in wastewater (including hospital and WWTP samples). Although the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) detected in seawater samples might not pose a toxic effect to the aquatic organisms (except for salicylic acid, sulfamethoxazole and fluoxetine), further researches are needed due to the continuous release of wastewater in the environment and the limited efficiency of wastewater treatment processes.

AB The present study was carried out to estimate the residual level of preservatives and active whitening agents from personal care products (PCPs) wastewater by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) along with characterization of wastewater. Diverse types of pollutants are being detected in aqueous environment with PCPs and related compounds containing large variety of groups, including parent molecules and their respective metabolites. Intensive research is required on this subject to gain reliable information about their occurrence, fate and adverse effects on health. For this purpose, development of extremely sensitive analytical methods of determination in industrial wastewater samples are not only need of the hour but also a challenge. Liquid chromatography is an advanced analytical method for such pollutants. In this study, samples were collected from industrial sites located at distant points of Lahore and characterization was done through different parameters to illustrate wastewater quality. It has been found that values were within limits of National Environmental Quality Standard (NEQS) except for turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) in some samples. Six preservatives including methylparaben, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, sodium benzoate, propylene glycol and formic acid along with five whitening agents like kojic acid, arbutin, ascorbic acid, nicotinamide and hydroquinone were quantified. It was interpreted that residues are present in almost all collected PCPs wastewater samples. The concentration of selected preservatives and active whitening agents in wastewater was ranged between 0.91-4.17 and 1.13-15.65 mg/L respectively. The most quantified concentrations were of methylparaben and sodium benzoate among preservative residues. In whitening agents, kojic acid and ascorbic acid were quantified in the highest concentrations.

AB The occurrence and fate of antibiotic compounds in the aquatic environment has been recognized as an emerging area of interest in environmental chemistry. An analytical method was developed and validated for determining beta-lactam and polyether ionophore antibiotics in surface water, urban wastewater, and sediment based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The average recovery of beta-lactams and polyether ionophores from all the fortified samples was generally higher than 80% (except for amoxicillin and ampicillin). A total of 400 actual water and sediment samples were analysed using SPE-LC-MS-MS to evaluate the occurrence and fate of these antibiotic compounds in a river and a wastewater treatment plant in northern Colorado. Most samples were found to be negative for beta-lactam compounds. In those samples with positive results, beta-lactam compounds were found at 15-17 ng/L in influent wastewater samples, 9-11 ng/L in surface water samples, and 0.13-0.36 mu g/kg in sediment samples. No beta-lactam compounds were detected in any effluent wastewater samples. The beta-lactams are expected to be easily eliminated in wastewater treatment plants due to the lability of the beta-lactam ring towards chemical and microbial degradation. The average concentration of ionophores ranged 0.03-0.05 mu g/L in surface water samples and 0.5-3.1 mu g/kg in sediment samples. These results confirm that b-lactam and ionophore antibiotics are adsorbed by sediment.

AB Pharmaceuticals have turned in to a major class of contaminants due to their widespread usage and known biological effects. Rifampin is known as an antibiotic with a strong red color. It is used in the treatment of many infectious, especially tuberculosis. If it is used in sub-therapeutic concentrations, it can lead to drug resistance in the microbial population. Thus, it is essential to remove its low concentrations from the wastewater to inhibit resistance in a pathogenic microorganism and save its effectiveness against tuberculosis. In the present research, the "Oxidation process by metallic catalysts" method, which consisted of zinc and copper, was employed for the first time in order to remove Rifampin from pharmaceutical wastewater. Variables including the total amount of zinc and copper catalysts, the ratio of the catalysts, duration of the reaction, rotation rate, temperature, and the pH considered and evaluated. It revealed that 0.154 mL of the total amount of the mixture of zinc and copper at the ratio of 70:30 in 100 ml of 40-ppm Rifampin solution, in the neutral pH and at ambient temperature (around 25 degrees c) and rotation rate, could decrease the concentration of Rifampin to 1 ppm after 120 minutes. The catalysts could be used many times in order to remove the Rifampin from fresh wastewater. It was also shown that 96.4% of Rifampin could be removed from handmade Rifampin solutions and actual wastewater with 70% zinc and 30% copper in 600 rpm, the neutral pH, and the ambient temperature for 120 minutes. The catalysts could be used repeatedly to remove the Rifampin from fresh wastewater.

AB Cyanide-containing organic wastewater is discharged in large quantities by coking, electroplating and pharmaceutical industries, which seriously endangers environmental safety and human health. In this paper, Electrochemical Oxidation-Persulfate (EO-PS) Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) was firstly used to treat high concentration cyanide-containing organic wastewater obtained from a chemical enterprise. The potential application of this process in the treatment of high concentration cyanide-containing organic wastewater was explored for the first time, and the effects of current density, initial pH, temperature and initial concentration on chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) and total cyanide (CN-) removal in wastewater were systematically investigated. The results shown that the EO-PS process had an excellent removal effect on organics and cyanide in high concentration cyanidecontaining organic wastewater which contained 11,290 mg L-1 COD, 4456 mg L-1 TOC and 1280.15 mg L-1 CN-. The COD, TOC and CN- removal at optimized operating parameters for 24 h were 95.8%, 87.8% and 98.4%, respectively. The corresponding electrical energy per order was only 41.6 kWh m(-3) order(-1). In addition, the pollutants removal can be accelerated under conditions of high current density, acidic solution, appropriate temperature and low pollutant concentration, among which low current density, low pH, appropriate temperature and low pollutant concentration can effectively diminish energy consumption. Cyanide, COD and TOC degradation in all reaction conditions followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater has characteristics of high concentration, high toxicity and poor biodegradability, so it is difficult to directly biodegrade. We used acid modified attapulgite (ATP) supported Fe-Mn-Cu polymetallic oxide as catalyst for multi-phase Fenton-like ultraviolet photocatalytic oxidation (photo-Fenton) treatment with actual chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater as the treatment object. The results showed that at the initial pH of 2.0, light distance of 20 cm, and catalyst dosage and hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10.0 g/L and 0.5 mol/L respectively, the COD removal rate of wastewater reached 65% and BOD5/COD increased to 0.387 when the reaction lasted for 180 min. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated that Fenton-like reaction with Fe-Mn-Cu@ATP had good catalytic potential and significant synergistic effect, and could remove almost all heterocycle compounds well. 3D-EEM (3D electron microscope) fluorescence spectra showed that the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly during catalytic degradation, and the UV humus-like and fulvic acid were effectively removed. The degradation efficiency of the nanocomposite only decreased by 5.8% after repeated use for 6 cycles. It seems appropriate to use this process as a pre-treatment for actual pharmaceutical wastewater to facilitate further biological treatment.

AB Disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in tertiary wastewater was examined after ozonation (O-3) and advanced oxidation with O-3 and hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2). O-3 and O-3/H2O2 were applied at multiple dosages to investigate DBP formation during coliform disinfection and trace contaminant oxidation. Results showed O-3 provided superior disinfection of fecal and total coliforms compared to O-3/H2O2. Color, UV absorbance, and SUVA were reduced by O-3 and O-3/H2O2, offering wastewater utilities a few potential surrogates to monitor disinfection or trace contaminant oxidation. At equivalent O-3 dosages, O-3/H2O2 produced greater concentrations of assimilable organic carbon (5-52%), aldehydes (31-47%), and carboxylic acids (12-43%) compared to O-3 alone, indicating that organic DBP formation is largely dependent upon hydroxyl radical exposure. Bromate formation occurred when O-3 dosages exceeded the O-3 demand of the wastewater. Benchscale tests with free chlorine showed O-3 is capable of reducing total organic halide (TOX) formation potential by at least 20%. In summary, O-3 provided superior disinfection compared to O-3/H2O2 while minimizing DBP concentrations. These are important considerations for water reuse, aquifer storage and recovery, and advanced wastewater treatment applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of biologically active pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments raised the potential risks to aquatic species. Among these marketed biological active pharmaceuticals, it has been estimated that 40% of them target G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We have illustrated pharmaceutical activities of GPCR targeted pharmaceuticals in English and Japanese wastewater by the in vitro transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) shedding assay. However, as the most important producer and consumer of pharmaceuticals, the occurrence of GPCR targeted pharmaceuticals in China had remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the pharmaceutical activities of GPCR targeted pharmaceuticals in secondary effluents of Chinese wastewater treatment plants. We discovered antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1) receptor at up to 7.2 x 102 ng-valsartan-equivalent quantity/L in Chinese wastewater for the first time as well as agonistic activities against dopamine (D2) receptor. Furthermore, in parallel with the assay, we determined concentrations of GPCR targeted pharmaceuticals in target wastewater by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Through the comparison of predicted antagonistic activities calculated by concentrations and potency values from the assay, we found that the measured antagonistic activities against AT1 receptor from the assay were higher than the predicted AT1 activities from valsartan, irbesartan, and losartan, indicating the potential existence of other unknown AT1 antagonists in wastewater.

AB Experiments were carried out on clindamycin's separation and recovery from clindamycin fermentation wastewater with nanofiltration (NF) membranes. Four types of flat-sheet NF membranes, DLNF-1, NTR-7250, XCNF-1 and MPF-44, were tested under different dynamic operating conditions. It was found that the operating pressure and solute concentration had great influence on membrane performance while flow rates (or velocities) had little influence on membrane performance. Experiments on SO42- rejection were conducted with such four flat-sheet NF membranes because SO42- had bad influence on microbes in biochemical process following the NF process. The results indicated that DLNF-1 and MPF-44 membranes had higher SO42- rejection among four membranes. Two spiral membranes, MPS-44 (1.4 m(2)) and DLNF2-30 (0.24 m(2)), were adopted in a concentrating process for clindamycin's separation and recovery from clindamycin fermentation wastewater under laboratory conditions. After being operated for 60 h, clindamycin wastewater was concentrated from 266 to 26 L, and the clindamycin was concentrated from 220 to 1940 mg/L, which met the demand of reuse. This research may widen the application of NF membranes in disposal of pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Consumer products such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and pharmaceuticals (PCPPs) enter aquatic ecosystems through inefficient removal during wastewater treatment. Often, the sterilization process of wastewater includes the addition of sodium hypochlorite that can react with PCPPs and other organic matter (i.e., dissolve organic matter) to generate disinfection by-products and can cause the final effluent to be more harmful to aquatic organisms. Here, we exposed Daphnia magna to two stages of wastewater, the pre-chlorinated wastewater (PreCl) and the final effluent. In addition, we exposed D. magna, to the final effluent with a concentration gradient of added PFOS, to investigate if this persistent contaminant altered the toxicity of the final effluent. After 48 h of contaminant exposure, we measured the daphnids metabolic responses to the different stages ofwastewater treatment, and with the addition of PFOS, utilizing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found few significant changes to the metabolic profile of animals exposed to the PreCl wastewater; however, animals exposed to the final effluent displayed increases in many amino acids and decreases in some sugar metabolites. With the addition of PFOS to the final effluent, the metabolic profile shifted from increased amino acids and decreased sugar metabolites and energy molecules especially at the low and high concentrations of PFOS. Overall, our results demonstrate the metabolome is sensitive to changes in the final effluent that are caused by sterilization, and with the addition of a persistent contaminant, the metabolic profile is further altered.

AB The discharge of wastewater effluents to a stream that is subsequently used for drinking water abstraction has been previously referred to as de facto water reuse. Where the abstraction of surface water for drinking water production occurs via induced bank filtration or aquifer recharge, additional site specific factors should be considered to assess the impact of wastewater effluents on bank-filtered water. This study represents the first national reconnaissance to quantify wastewater effluent contributions in streams across Germany and consequences for indirect drinking water abstraction from these streams. An automated assessment using ArcGIS was conducted for river basins considering minimum and mean average discharge conditions of streams as well as discharge from more than 7500 wastewater facilities. In urban areas, where the natural base discharge is low, wastewater effluent contributions greater than 30-50% were determined under mean minimum discharge conditions, which commonly prevail from May to September. A conceptual model was proposed to estimate critical bank filtrate shares resulting in monitoring trigger levels for health-relevant chemicals as a universal qualitative assessment regarding the relevance of de facto reuse conditions in surface waters used for drinking water abstraction. This approach was validated using chemical monitoring data for three case study locations.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging membrane technology for wastewater recycling. However, its performance in removing disinfection byproducts (DBPs), a critical aspect of wastewater recycling, has not been investigated. This study systematically investigated the rejection of sixteen neutral DBP that are relevant to wastewater recycling in two commercial FO membranes (Aquaporin and CTA). Clean Aquaporin membrane displayed higher rejection for all DBPs than clean CTA membrane. For N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and haloacetonitriles (HANs), the most prevalent and toxic DBPs in wastewater recycling, the rejection by Aquaporin was 31% and 48-76%, respectively. The rejection of DBPs in FO positively correlated with their size across different DBP groups but did not correlate with their hydrophobicity. Organic fouling by alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) decreased the rejection and transmembrane fluxes of most DBPs. The DBP transport and the influence of fouling were discussed using a solution-diffusion model incorporating size exclusion, the surface interaction between the membrane and DBPs, and DBP diffusion within the membrane. Lastly, the rejection of NDMA and HANs in FO membranes determined in this study was compared with that in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes reported in the literature.

AB Parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. Generally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. In this study, bacteria in STP effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. The susceptibility was in the order of Staphylococcus aureus > Bacillus sp. > Escherichia coli > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. Interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >= 5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. The increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. This is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of Indian STPs. Paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. Thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.

AB A total of 99 Acinetobacter isolates from sewage, freshwater aquaculture habitats, trout intestinal contents and frozen shrimps was characterized phenotypically and antibiotic susceptibility patterns determined. One group of genomic species, including Ac. johnsonii, Ac. lwoffi and spp. 15TU, was detected in all sample types and represented the majority of the isolates (n = 54). Isolates belonging to the Acb complex (Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii and genomic species 3) were detected in sewage (n = 6) and frozen shrimps (n = 1), Ac. haemolyticus in frozen shrimps (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 2) and genomic species 11 in freshwater aquaculture habitats (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 1). Acinetobacter junii (n = 5), genomic species 10 (n = 2), 14BJ (n = 8) and 16BJ (n = 4) were only isolated from sewage. Acinetobacter isolates from sewage were generally more biochemically reactive and resistant to antimicrobial agents compared with isolates from other sample types. Different strains, often belonging to different genomic species, were isolated from sites situated upstream and downstream of the discharge point of a pharmaceutical plant. This finding supported the hypothesis that the waste effluent from the pharmaceutical plant was likely to cause a change in the distribution of Acinetobacter spp. by selecting and/or introducing antibiotic-resistant strains into the recipient sewers.

AB Polyelectrolytes have proven their advantages as draw solutes in forward osmosis process in terms of high water flux, minimum reverse flux, and ease of recovery. In this work, the concept of a polyelectrolyte-promoted forward osmosis-membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system was demonstrated and applied to recycle the wastewater containing an acid dye. A poly(acrylic acid) sodium (PAA-Na) salt was used as the draw solute of the FO to dehydrate the wastewater, while the MD was employed to reconcentrate the PAA-Na draw solution. With the integration of these two processes, a continuous wastewater treatment process was established. To optimize the FO-MD hybrid process, the effects of PAA-Na concentration, experimental duration, and temperature were investigated. Almost a complete rejection of PAA-Na solute was observed by both FO and MD membranes. Under the conditions of 0.48 g mL(-1) PAA-Na and 66 degrees C, the wastewater was most efficiently dehydrated yet with a stabilized PAA-Na concentration around 0.48 g mL(-1). The practicality of PAA-Na-promoted FO-MD hybrid technology demonstrates not only its suitability in wastewater reclamation, but also its potential in other membrane-based separations, such as protein or pharmaceutical product enrichment. This study may provide the insights of exploring novel draw solutes and their applications in FO related processes.

AB The capacity of the ligninolytic fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade a wide variety of environmentally persistent xenobiotics has been largely reported in the literature. Beside other factors, one barrier to a wider use of this bioremediation fungus is the availability of effective formulations that ensure easy preparation, handling and application In this series of laboratory experiments, we evaluated the efficiency of a granular bloplastic formulation entrapping propagules of P chrysosporium for removal of four selected pharmaceuticals from wastewater samples Addition of inoculated granules to samples of the wastewater treatment plant of Bologna significantly increased the removal of the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and the antibiotics, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazol, and ciprofloxacin. Similar effects were also observed in effluent water. Oseltamivir was the most persistent of the four active substances. After 30d of incubation, approximately two times more oseltamivir was removed in bioremediated wastewater than controls The highest removal efficiency of the bioplastic formulation was observed with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin Microbiological DNA-based analysis showed that the bioplastic matrix supported the growth of P chrysosporium, thus facilitating its adaptation to unusual environment such as wastewater (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A comprehensive monitoring programme of trace organic chemicals (TOrC) was conducted for a German water protection area in karstic ground. The aim of this survey was to detect the potential anthropogenic influences of point sources such as wastewater treatment plants and diffuse pollution such as runoff water from roads on the raw water used for drinking water treatment. The programme comprised seven sampling campaigns within 2 years each with up to 20 sampling sites. In total, the programme included 84 anthropogenic compounds from pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media, sweeteners, industrial chemicals (benzotriazoles, melamines and benzothiazoles) and pesticide metabolites. Cyclamate occurred with the highest median concentration of 44 mu g l(-1) in untreated wastewater and acesulfame occurred with a concentration of 20 mu g l(-1) in treated wastewater. In runoff water from roads, the most relevant compounds were tolyltriazole with 2.3 mu g l(-1) and the desphenyl-chloridazon with 1.2 mu g l(-1). In the stream waters, the highest median concentrations were found for melamine and acesulfame both at 0.61 mu g l(-1). High elimination during conventional wastewater treatment was observed for 5 out of 49 compounds. These are acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, aciclovir, cyclamate, ibuprofen and saccharin. Based on the survey results, we propose a set of nine compounds to be used as indicators for wastewater, untreated wastewater and runoff water from roads for an efficient surveillance. The indicators are intended to detect anthropogenic influences in surface, ground and drinking water.

AB Trace organic compounds from pharmaceutical and personal care products are often not fully removed during wastewater treatment, resulting in discharge of these emerging pollutants to surface and groundwater. Fate and transformation of trace organics has primarily been investigated in larger activated sludge wastewater treatment facilities; almost no research has been done on passively aerated fixed-bed bio-filters that are used in decentralized facilities that serve smaller communities. Four laboratory-scale, packed-bed, recirculating-media filter systems were constructed to evaluate the removal of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan. The media (or packed bed) provided support for the development of the fixed film and the needed porosity for air and water movement. Effluent from a local residential septic tank effluent gravity (STEG) system was used as the wastewater supply. This supply had greater than 100 ppb concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan. Three of the media filters were spiked (nominal 0.1 ppm) with ibuprofen, naproxen, or triclosan to better represent the wastewater from a rural healthcare facility; the fourth media filter received wastewater as produced by the STEG system and served as a non-spiked control. Overall, the mean removal of ibuprofen, naproxen, and triclosan from the wastewater solution was 94%, 84%, and 83%, respectively. At the end of the study, samples of the fixed film were analyzed to discern whether removal was by sorption or biodegradation. It was determined that sorption of the three trace organic compounds into the biofilm accounted for only 0.12% of the ibuprofen, 0.20% of the naproxen, and 1.41% of the triclosan. These results indicate that biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism for these compounds.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology studies use catchment populations to normalise chemical marker mass loads in 24-h composite wastewater samples. However, one of the biggest uncertainties within the field is the accuracy of the population used. A population marker in wastewater may significantly reduce the uncertainty. This study evaluated the catecholamine metabolites - homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) - as potential population biomarkers. Influent wastewater 24-h composite samples were collected from 38 wastewater catchments from around Australia (representing similar to 33% of Australia's population), extracted and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometiy. Measured mass loads were compared to population sizes determined by mapping catchment maps against high-resolution census data. Both biomarkers correlated with coefficient of determinations (r(2)) of 0.908 and 0.922 for HVA and VMA, respectively. From the regression analysis, a slope (i.e. the daily per-capita excretion) of 1.241 and 1.067 mg.day(-1).person(-1) was obtained for HVA and VMA, respectively. The mass load ratio between VMA:HVA were very similar to that reported in literature for urinary analysis among all catchments. Overall, this study provided further evidence that catecholamine metabolites are suitable candidates as population biomarkers for future studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater reuse presents a promising solution to the growing pressure on water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance, technical, economic and hygienic risks and further uncertainties caused by a lack of awareness, accepted standards, uniform guidelines and legislation. So far, there are no supra-national regulations on water reuse in Europe and further development is slowed by lack of widely accepted standards, e.g. in terms of required water quality, treatment technology and distribution system design and operation. Treatment technology encompasses a vast number of options and membrane processes are regarded as key elements of advanced wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes and are included in a number of prominent schemes world-wide, e.g. for artificial groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse as well as for industrial process water production. For dual reticulation purposes in urban areas two types of systems have been built, a centralised type of treatment with dual membrane processes, including e.g. microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO), and small scale systems using membrane bioreactors. This paper will provide an overview of the status of membranes processes in wastewater reclamation and reuse world-wide and will depict their potential role in promoting more sustainable water use patterns.

AB In four countries (France, Greece, Italy, and Sweden) occurrence in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and ecotoxicity of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac were investigated. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, microcrustaceans, and fishes in order to calculate their predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) and to perform a first approach of risk characterization. For this aim, risk has been estimated by the predicted environmental concentration/PNEC ratio and the measured environmental concentration/PNEC ratio. First, regarding the PNEC, carbamazepine appears to be the more hazardous compound. Second, even though it is demonstrated that carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac have been detected in effluents, only carbamazepine have been detected in all sewage treatment plants with the greatest concentrations. Third, risk quotients greater than unity were calculated only for carbamazepine, suggesting that risk for the water compartment is expected. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been frequently detected in aquatic environment and raised concerns because of their environmental persistence and potential ecological risk, especially carbamazepine (CBZ), erythromycin (ERY), atenolol (ATL) and clofibric acid (CA). The UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process was considered as an effective process to remove pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Because of the diverse structure of pharmaceuticals and the various wastewater matrices, this study established two models to predict the degradation of 4 PhACs in wastewater by UV/H2O2. Besides, the degradation pathway and toxicity of 4 PhACs by UV/H2O2 were explored. The degradation of 4 PhACs by UV/H2O2 followed the pseudo first-order kinetics pattern. The degradation rate of pharmaceuticals decreased as CBZ > ATL > CA > ERY. A kinetic model combining the steady state concentrations of HO center dot successfully predicted the degradation process of pharmaceuticals in 14 secondary municipal wastewater effluents. Also, a water matrix prediction model by response surface methodology (RSM) was established to estimate the degradation of pharmaceuticals well. A detailed and systematic comparison of two models in the objectives of models, predicting target contaminants, types of wastewater and parameters of models was made. In addition, the tentative transformation pathways of 4 PhACs by UV/H2O2 were proposed. 4 PhACs after UV/H2O2 treatment enhanced the toxicity, and prolongation of treatment time can reduce the toxicity on the luminescence.

AB Over the centuries, a tremendous increase in human population has placed a demand for industrial growth, which enhanced the disposal of wastewater and resulted in developing a sustainable technology for wastewater treatment. Phenol and its derivatives are the most pondered substantial pollutants generated from pharmaceutical industries, basic organic chemical manufacturing industries, petroleum refineries, petrochemical industries, coal gasification operations, liquefaction process, tannery, pesticide manufacturing industries, and pulp and paper mills, which contain harmful pollutants that are toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Accumulation of phenol even at a lower concentration may be fatal to all living beings in the ecosystem. This chapter includes the overview of phenol pollution, deleterious effects of phenol in the ecosystem, biodegradation of phenols, and significance of engineered microbes for phenol degradation.

AB Semiconductor photocatalysis has been regarded as an environmentally friendly technology in wastewater treatment and energy production. Here, a series of direct Z-scheme MnIn2S4/g-C3N4 (MnISCN) photocatalysts without electron mediators were fabricated by a simple hydrothermal route on the basis of in-situ loading of MnIn2S4 (MnIS) nanoflakes on the surface of g-C3N4 (CN) nanosheets. Photocatalytic performances evaluated under visible light irradiation revealed these Z-scheme heterostructured photocatalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than single-component samples. The effect of weight ratio between MnIn2S4 nanoflakes and mesoporous CN nanosheets on photocatalytic activity towards treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was optimized to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic activities for both degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater and hydrogen generation compared with alone MnIS nanoflakes and isolated mesoporous CN nanosheets. The significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity could be primarily ascribed to the construction of Z-scheme MnISCN architectures, which effectively accelerated the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers via tight interface contacts built among these two components. The recycling experiments for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment revealed the excellent stability of MnISCN nanocomposites. The advantages of highly efficient photocatalytic activity and excellent stability endowed a promising potential for MnISCN nanocomposites to apply in photocatalytic fields.

AB The compositional characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in pharmaceutical wastewater effluent can affect the further improvement and application of the ozone treatment process. The present study investigated the changes of chemical structures, molecular weight (MW) distribution, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity distribution, fluorescence properties and the molecular composition of DOM in pharmaceutical wastewater effluent during ozonation. Besides, the toxicity change of pharmaceutical wastewater effluent during ozonation was estimated. The results show that ozone is prone to attack high MW fractions, which contributes the most to the UV254 value and could improve the biodegradability of refractory DOM in pharmaceutical wastewater effluent. Hydrophobic acid contained the most aromatic and unsaturated bonded organic matter, and was more readily oxidized under ozonation. In fluorescent components, ozonation significantly decreased humic-like acid compounds, and hydrophobic humic-like compounds exhibited the highest removal through parallel factor analysis. At the molecular level, the main organics removed by ozone were compounds with high H/C and low O/C, especially compounds where H/C >1.5. The CHO, CHON and CHOS compounds exhibited high removal under ozonation in formula classes. Lignin compounds, condensed aromatics compounds, and unsaturated hydrocarbons were effectively removed by ozone in compound classes. After ozonation, the number of lipid and sugar compounds increased. In addition, O/Cwa (the intensity-weighted average parameters of O/C) and NOSCwa (nominal oxidation state of carbon) were significantly positively correlated with acute toxicity on the luminescence. With the increase of ozone dose, the acute toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater effluent after ozonation first decreased and then increased. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study used a geographic based water model to predict the environmental concentrations of three pharmaceuticals, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and diclofenac throughout European rivers. The work was prompted by the proposal of the European Community (COM(2011)876) to consider these chemicals as candidates for future control via environmental quality standards (EQS). National drug consumption information, excretion, national water use, and sewage removal rates, were used to derive per capita sewage effluent values for the European countries. For E2, excretion rates of the natural hormone and national demographics were also included. Incorporating this information into the GWAVA model allowed water concentrations throughout Europe's rivers to be predicted. The mean concentration from the expected sewage discharge scenario indicated that 12% by length of Europe's rivers would reach concentrations greater than the proposed 0.035 ng/L EQS for EE2. For several countries, between a quarter and a third of their total river length would fail such an EE2 EQS. For E2, just over 1% by length of rivers would reach concentrations greater than the 0.4 ng/L proposed EQS, while just over 2% by length of rivers would reach concentrations greater than the proposed EQS of 100 ng/L for diclofenac.

AB New analytical methods are needed to efficiently measure the growing list of priority pharmaceuticals in environmental samples. In this regard, a rapid, sensitive, and robust method was developed for quantitation of 168 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction protocol and instrumental efficiency were specifically addressed to increase analytical workload and throughput. The optimized protocols, which are five times more efficient than US EPA Method 1694, enabled analyte recoveries that ranged from 77% to 117% for 162 analytes with method quantitation limits (MQLs) as low as 0.1 ng L-1 . To verify the suitability of the improved analytical method for environmental samples, 24-h composite samples of raw wastewater and wastewater effluent, along with downstream surface water, were analyzed. Overall, 143/168 target compounds were identified in at least one of the samples, and 130/168 analytes were present at concentrations above their MQLs. The total mass concentration of the measured analytes decreased by 93% during wastewater treatment. The analyte concentrations in the wastewater effluent were comparable to those measured in surface water 1 km downstream of the wastewater discharge point. Ultimately, the comprehensive method will serve as an important tool to inform the occurrence, fate, transport, and toxicity of a large suite of priority pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical metabolites in natural and engineered systems.

AB This work investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in raw sewage (from Belo Horizonte city, Minas Gerais state, Brazil) and assessed their behavior in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRT). The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The natural (estradiol) and synthetic (ethinylestradiol) estrogens were hardly detected; when present, however, their concentrations were lower than the method quantification limits. The concentrations of bisphenol A and miconazole in raw sewage were similar to that reported in the literature (around 200 ng L-1 and hardly detected, respectively). The antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (median 13.0 ng L-1) and trimethoprim (median 61.5 ng L-1), and the other pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac and bezafibrate, with median 99.9 and 94.4 ng L-1, respectively) were found in lower concentrations when compared with reports in the literature, which might indicate a lower consumption of such drugs in Brazil. The UASB reactors were inefficient in the removal of bisphenol A, and led to an increased concentration of nonylphenol in the effluent. The anaerobic reactors were also inefficient in the removal of diclofenac, and led to a partial removal of bezafibrate; whereas, for sulfamethoxazole there seemed to be a direct relationship between the HRT and removal efficiencies. For trimethoprim the sludge retention time (SRT) seemed to play an important role, although it was only partially removed in the UASB reactors.

TI Removal of Polyvinylpyrrolidone from Wastewater Using Different Methods

ID POLY(VINYLPYRROLIDONE); ADSORPTION
AB Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a frequently used polymer in the pharmaceutical and foodstuff industries. Because it is not subject to metabolic changes and is virtually nondegradable, trace concentrations of PVP are often found in community wastewaters. The literature finds that the partial removal of PVP in wastewater treatment plants probably occurs through sorption. The primary objective of this study was to find an effective method to remove PVP from wastewaters. In this regard, the literature indicates the theoretical potential to use specific enzymes (e. g., c-lactamases, amidases) to gradually degrade PVP molecules. Polyvinylpyrrolidone biodegradability tests were conducted using suitable heterogeneous cultures (activated sludge) collected from a conventional wastewater treatment plant, treatment plants connected to a pharmaceutical factory, and using select enzymes. Aerobic biodegradation of PVP in a conventional wastewater environment was ineffective, even after adaptation of activated sludge using the nearly identical monomer 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Another potential method for PVP removal involves pretreating the polymer prior to biological degradation. Based on the results (approximately 10 to 15% biodegradation), pretreatment was partially effective, realistically, it could only be applied with difficulty at wastewater treatment plants. Sorption of PVP to an active carbon sorbent (Chezacarb S), which corresponded to the Langmuir isotherm, and sorption to activated sludge, which corresponded to the Freundlich isotherm, were also evaluated. From these sorption tests, it can be concluded that the considerable adsorption of PVP to activated sludge occurred primarily at low PVP concentrations. Based on the test results, the authors recommend the following methods for PVP removal from wastewater: (1) sorption; (2) application of specific microorganisms; and (3) alkaline hydrolysis, which is the least suitable of the three for use in wastewater treatment plants.

AB In this study, photochemical degradation of two emerging pharmaceutical chemicals, mefenamic acid (MF) and triclosan (TCS), was investigated to clarify the role of treated wastewater effluent matrices on their environmental photolysis. Target compounds were individually exposed to simulated sunlight in different media: ultrapure buffered water and synthetic field water with treated municipal wastewater effluent. The results in ultrapure buffered water showed that the direct photolysis processes in aquatic environments are not relevant to the elimination of MF. However, in samples containing treated wastewater effluent, photochemical degradation of MF was clearly enhanced. Our results indicate that MF undergoes indirect photolysis by reactive intermediates produced in an effluent matrix. Further quenching experiments suggested that photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and excited triplet state dissolved organic matter drive the degradation of MF. In contrast to MF, TCS photochemical degradation proceeds through rapid direct photolysis. TCS was quickly degraded in ultrapure buffered water but it is considerably hampered in samples containing wastewater effluent. The declined degradation of TCS in the synthetic field water was discussed in terms of underlying optical filter effects by coexisting chromophoric substances. Results emphasize the importance of taking local water chemistry into consideration when predicting natural attenuation of pharmaceutical chemicals in receiving areas.

AB While emerging pharmaceutical contaminants are monitored in wastewater treatment and the environment, there is little information concerning their microbial metabolites. The transformation of diphenhydramine by microorganisms in anaerobic digester sludge was investigated using anaerobic cultures amended with 1 mM diphenhydramine as the sole carbon source. Complete transformation of the parent compound to a persistent metabolite occurred within 191 days. Using GC/MS analysis, the metabolite was identified as N-desmethyl diphenhydramine. Loss of the parent compound diphenhydramine followed a first order rate constant of 0.013 day(-1). There was no observed decrease in metabolite concentration even after a further 12 months of incubation, suggesting that the metabolite resists further degradation during wastewater treatment. Bacterial community diversity in the diphenhydramine transforming assay cultures showed enrichment in Comamonadaceae, Symbiobacteriaceae, Anaerolineaceae, and Prevotellaceae relative to unamended background controls. An anaerobic toxicity assay demonstrated that diphenhydramine has an inhibitory effect on both fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the wastewater community. In contrast, the metabolite N-desmethyl diphenhydramine partially suppressed methanogens but did not impact the fermenting community. To our knowledge, this is the first report of diphenhydramine metabolism by a bacterial community. The limited transformation of diphenhydramine by wastewater microorganisms indicates that N-desmethyl diphenhydramine will enter the environment along with unmetabolized diphenhydramine.

AB An integrated process of iron/carbon micro-electrolysis (ICME)-expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-microalgae reactor (MR) was developed for treating pharmaceutical wastewater with initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 25000-28500 mg/L. The results show that, under the optimum conditions, the removal ratio of COD, total suspended solids (TSS), color, NH3-N, and total phosphorus were 99.2%, 98.4%, 97.5%, 95.3%, and 78.9%, respectively. The ICME removed a considerable proportion of TSS and color, and improved the biodegradability of the wastewater, while the EGSB played an important role in the removal of residual COD, and finally, post-polish treatment was achieved in the MR.

AB Global society is confronted with various challenges: climate change should be mitigated, and society should adapt to the impacts of climate change, resources will become scarcer and hence resources should be used more efficiently and recovered after use, the growing world population and its growing wealth create unprecedented emissions of pollutants, threatening public health, wildlife and biodiversity. This paper provides an overview of the challenges and risks for sewage systems, next to some opportunities and chances that these developments pose. Some of the challenges are emerging from climate change and resource scarcity, others come from the challenges emerging from stricter regulation of emissions. It also presents risks and threats from within the system, next to external influences which may affect the surroundings of the sewage systems. It finally reflects on barriers to respond to these challenges.

AB In this research, the probability of using the electrocoagulation process as a method of pharmaceutical removal from synthetic and real industry wastewater was demonstrated. Batch experiments were performed using a simple laboratory scale electrochemical reactor with aluminium as anode and stainless steel as cathode, respectively. The effects of main operating parameters such as current density, initial pH, electrolyte concentration and inter-electrode distance have been studied. Kinetic equilibrium stu-dies have shown that the pseudo-first order equation is better suited to the aluminum hydroxide adsorption process with a strong correlation between experimental and theoretical data. The findings showed that maximum removal of total organic carbon (TOC) (66%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (62.5%) was achieved for real industry wastewater.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in water bodies. In this study, its concentrations in the STP effluents in 68 countries/regions are predicted with a model based on the sale volume, the water consumption, the disposal rate, the excretion rate, and the removal efficiency by the sewage system. The prediction results demonstrate a global aquatic contamination of CBZ. However, the contamination is unbalanced: most of developed economics have a concentration above 500 ng L-1. The prediction model also provides some implications on the control strategies of pharmaceutical aquatic contamination, including upgrading STPs, urine separation, waste pharmaceuticals collection, environmentally labeling pharmaceuticals, and green pharmacy. Those strategies are discussed in the context of currently available literature information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB First, the effect of ferrioxalate or iron nitrate on the photo-Fenton degradation efficiency of the pharmaceuticals lincomycin (LCM) and diazepam (DZP) was evaluated. The degradation of both pharmaceuticals was improved in the presence of ferrioxalate in relation to Fe(NO3), either under black-light or solar irradiation. The degradation of the pharmaceuticals was then evaluated when present in an effluent from sewage treatment plant (STP) under black-light irradiation. Pharmaceuticals oxidation was not influenced by the matrix, since very similar results were obtained when compared to the experiments carried out in distilled water. However, DOC removal was slightly affected by the matrix, due probably to the generation of recalcitrant intermediates during effluent photodegradation and to the high content of inorganic carbon of STP effluent. Even so, high DOC removal percentages were achieved, 65% for lincomycin and 80% for diazepam after 60 min irradiation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a Partial Least Squares Projection of Latent Structures (PLS) model has been developed for predicting the rejection of pharmaceutical residuals by nanofiltration (NF) using treated municipal wastewater as feed. The objective was to provide a practical tool for wastewater reuse facilities for estimating the rejection of emerging organic contaminants based on their physiochemical characteristics. The model was developed by identifying the important physiochemical properties of pharmaceutical residuals for rejection by NF. The investigated pharmaceuticals were those present in the effluent from Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), Sweden. The rejection, at volume reduction factors (VRF) ranging from 2 to 20, was examined in a NF pilot plant at two occasions.
   The important variables for rejection by NF were, in descending order: polarizability, globularity, ratio hydrophobic to polar water accessible surface area and compound charge.
   Two studies were performed with a time interval of about a year with different wastewater matrices and age of membranes. For different VRF5, but in the same study, the model produced consistent predicted rejections. For the same VRF, but in the different studies, the regression lines were almost parallel, but with a deviation of about 7% for the predicted values. Most of the compounds were within the 95% prediction interval. The model also proved to be able to predict rejection using data from the literature. This confirms that the predictive PLS model can estimate the rejection albeit, with limitations. Generally the proposed predictive rejection model is most likely valid but the model coefficients need to be determined for each individual WWTP or wastewater reuse facility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB O-3/UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) was employed to degrade antibiotic berberine hydrochloride (BH) in pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of initial solution pH, H2O2 dosage and O-3 dosage on the berberine hydrochloride removal performance were investigated with synthetic wastewater. The optimum conditions of initial pH value of 7.0, H2O2 dosage of 3.0 mM, O-3 dosage of 10.3 mg/min and the reaction time of 45 min were determined and the removal efficiency of berberine hydrochloride (C-0 = 1500 mg/L) reached 94.1 %. A small amount addition of H2O2 to O-3/UV system greatly improved the berberine hydrochloride removal efficiency. The variations of pH value, ammonium nitrogen and conductivity were analyzed to confirm the degradation of BH. Under the optimal experimental conditions, O-3/UV/H2O2 was used to treat the actual berberine hydrochloride wastewater. It demonstrated that the biodegradability of berberine hydrochloride wastewater was obviously promoted and the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to chemical oxygen demand (COD) was improved from 0.02 up to 0.29, 15 times greater than that of original wastewater. The costs of four O-3-based advanced oxidation processes, O-3, O-3/UV, O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV/H2O2, were also calculated and compared, indicating that O-3/UV/H2O2 was the best choice taking into account both the cost and the efficiency. It suggested that the O-3/UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process could not only remove berberine hydrochloride more efficiently but also reduce the costs significantly.

AB The white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor has been studied as a potential agent for the removal of environmental pollutants. For long-time solid-phase bioremediation systems a test is required to monitor the metabolic status of T. versicolor and its degradation capability at different stages. A biodegradation test based on the percentage of degradation of a spiked model pharmaceutical (anti-inflammatory naproxen) in 24h (ND24) is proposed to monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in sewage sludge. ND24 is intended to act as a test complementary to ergosterol quantification as specific fungal biomarker, and laccase activity as extracellular oxidative capacity of T. versicolor. For samples collected over 45 d, ND24 values did not necessarily correlate with ergosterol or laccase amounts but in most cases, they were over 30% degradation, indicating that T. versicolor may be suitable for bioremediation of sewage sludge in the studied period.

AB Effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) contains a complex mixture of contaminants and is a major worldwide source of aquatic pollution. We examined the effects of exposure to treated effluent from a municipal WWTP on the metabolic physiology of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We studied fish that were wildcaught or experimentally caged (28 d) downstream of the WWTP, and compared them to fish that were caught or caged at clean reference sites. Survival was reduced in fish caged at the effluent-contaminated site compared to those caged at the reference site. Resting rates of O-2 consumption (MO2) were higher in fish from the contaminated site, reflecting a metabolic cost of wastewater exposure. The increases in routine MO2 did not reduce aerobic scope (difference or quotient of maximal MO(2 )and resting MO2), suggesting that physiological compensations accompanied the metabolic costs of wastewater exposure. Fish exposed to wastewater also had larger hearts and livers. The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (cytochrome c oxidase, citrate synthase) per liver mass was unaltered across treatments, so the increased mass of this organ increased its cumulative oxidative capacity in the fish. Wastewater exposure also reduced glycogen content per liver mass. The effects of caging itself, based on comparisons between fish that were wild-caught or caged at clean sites, were generally subtle and not statistically significant. We conclude that exposure to wastewater effluent invokes a metabolic cost that leads to compensatory physiological adjustments that partially offset the detrimental metabolic impacts of exposure.

AB In this paper, we evaluated the ecotoxicological potential of the 100 pharmaceuticals expected to occur in highest quantities in the wastewater of a general hospital and a psychiatric center in Switzerland. We related the toxicity data to predicted concentrations in different wastewater streams to assess the overall risk potential for different scenarios, including conventional biological pretreatment in the hospital and urine source separation. The concentrations in wastewater were estimated with pharmaceutical usage information provided by the hospitals and literature data on human excretion into feces and urine. Environmental concentrations in the effluents of the exposure scenarios were predicted by estimating dilution in sewers and with literature data on elimination during wastewater treatment. Effect assessment was performed using quantitative structure-activity relationships because experimental ecotoxicity data were only available for less than 20% of the 100 pharmaceuticals with expected highest loads. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, a correction for the speciation was implemented in the toxicity prediction model.
   The lists of Top-100 pharmaceuticals were distinctly different between the two hospital types with only 37 pharmaceuticals overlapping in both datasets. 31 Pharmaceuticals in the general hospital and 42 pharmaceuticals in the psychiatric center had a risk quotient above 0.01 and thus contributed to the mixture risk quotient. However, together they constituted only 14% (hospital) and 30% (psychiatry) of the load of pharmaceuticals. Hence, medical consumption data alone are insufficient predictors of environmental risk. The risk quotients were dominated by amiodarone, ritonavir, clotrimazole, and diclofenac. Only diclofenac is well researched in ecotoxicology, while amiodarone, ritonavir, and clotrimazole have no or very limited experimental fate or toxicity data available. The presented computational analysis thus helps setting priorities for further testing. Separate treatment of hospital wastewater would reduce the pharmaceutical load of wastewater treatment plants, and the risk from the newly identified priority pharmaceuticals. However, because high-risk pharmaceuticals are excreted mainly with feces, urine source separation is not a viable option for reducing the risk potential from hospital wastewater, while a sorption step could be beneficial.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the potential of CWs to remove bacteria, including antibiotic resistant bacteria, and antibiotics from livestock (swine production) wastewater. Microcosms were assembled with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud and feed with wastewater spiked or not with 100 mu g/L of enrofloxacin or of ceftiofur, alone or as a mixture. Wastewater (spiked or not) was treated during twenty one-week cycles. Treated wastewater was collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20 to evaluate the removal of pollutants, including nutrients, organic matter, metals and added antibiotics, and total cultivable and antibiotic resistant bacteria (enterobacteria and enterococci), which were enumerated in plate culture media. After treatment, a significant reduction in pollutants load (up to 99% depending on the parameter) was observed regardless of the presence of the veterinary antibiotics. Antibiotics were also significantly removed (removal > 90%). High removal rates were achieved for enterobacteria and enterococci bacteria during the experimental period, in the presence or absence of antibiotics (mean removals between 86 and 100%). For antibiotic resistant bacteria initially present in the influent wastewater mean removals > 90% were obtained, and no significant effect of time or of antibiotic presence was observed. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to focus on the removal of enrofloxacin and ceftiofur resistance in faecal bioindicators in CWs fed with livestock wastewater. Results confirm CWs as a green alternative to reduce the risks associated with the release of livestock effluents into the environment.

AB In Latin America and the Caribbean, with a population of approximately 580 million inhabitants, less than 20 % of wastewater is treated. Megacities in this region face common challenges and problems related with water quality and sanitation, which require urgent actions, such as changes in the sustainable use of water resources. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world, with over 20 million inhabitants, and is no exception to the challenges of sustainable water management. For more than 100 years, wastewater from Mexico City has been transported north to the Mezquital Valley, which is ranked as the largest wastewater-irrigated area in the world. In this study, bacteria and pathogenic protozoa were analyzed to determine the association between the presence of such microorganisms and water types (WTs) across sampling sites and seasons in Mexico City and the Mezquital Valley. Our results show a difference in microbiological water quality between sampling sites and WTs. There is no significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons in terms of bacterial concentration, demonstrating that water quality remains constant at each site regardless of whether it is the dry or the rainy season. The results illustrate the quantity of these microorganisms in wastewater, provide a current diagnosis of water quality across the area which could affect the health of residents in both Mexico City and the Mezquital Valley, and demonstrate the need to transition in the short term to treat wastewater from a local to a regional scale.

AB Nowadays, there are many problems related to water pollution, which is a result of intermittent or continuous release of pollutants in the environment. Novelty of this paper is to identify an alternative able to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of the traditional methods in the wastewater field. In this line, a commercial bioactivator, namely, Micropan complex was used for wastewater treatment. The influence of contact time, initial pH and bioactivator amount was studied. The optimal parameters determination was achieved through an experimental model created using MATHCAD 14 programme. The correlation coefficient value indicates the precision with which the set of experimental values was characterized by the determined function. The value obtained was 0.889. When coefficient is the closer to 1 the better description is achived.

AB Drugs of abuse and their metabolites have been recently recognized as environmental emerging organic contaminants. Assessment of their concentration in different environmental compartments is essential to evaluate their potential ecotoxicological effects. It also constitutes an indirect tool to estimate drug abuse by the population at the community level. The present work reports for the first time the occurrence of drugs of abuse and metabolites residues along the Ebro River basin (NE Spain) and also evaluates the contribution of sewage treatment plants (STPs) effluents to the presence of these chemicals in natural surface waters. Concentrations measured in influent sewage waters were used to back calculate drug usage at the community level in the main urban areas of the investigated river basin.
   The most ubiquitous and abundant compounds in the studied aqueous matrices were cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ephedrine and ecstasy. Lysergic compounds, heroin, its metabolite 6-monoacetyl morphine, and Delta(9)-tetradhydrocannabinol were the substances less frequently detected. Overall, total levels of the studied illicit drugs and metabolites observed in surface water (in the low ng/L range) were one and two orders of magnitude lower than those determined in effluent (in the ng/L range) and influent sewage water (mu g/L range), respectively. The investigated STPs showed overall removal efficiencies between 45 and 95%. Some compounds, such as cocaine and amphetamine, were very efficiently eliminated (> 90%) whereas others, such as ecstasy, methamphetamine, nor-LSD, and THC-COOH where occasionally not eliminated at all. Drug consumption estimates pointed out cocaine as the most abused drug, followed by cannabis, amphetamine, heroin, ecstasy and methamphetamine, which slightly differs from national official estimates (cannabis, followed by cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamine and heroin). Extrapolation of the consumption data obtained for the studied area to Spain points out a total annual consumption of drugs of abuse of the order of 36 tonnes, which would translate into 1100 million Euros in the black market.

AB The alcohol distilleries are growing extensively worldwide due to widespread industrial applications of alcohol such as in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, beverages, food and perfumery industry, etc. The industrial production of ethanol by fermentation results in the discharge of large quantities of high-strength liquid wastes. Distillery wastewater is one of the most polluted waste products to dispose because of the low pH, high temperature, dark brown colour, high ash content and high percentage of dissolved organic and inorganic matter with high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values. Its characteristics are depending on the feed stock and various aspects of ethanol production process. Spent wash polluted the water bodies into ways; first, the highly colored nature which can block out sunlight, thus reducing oxygenation of the water by photosynthesis and hence becomes detrimental to aquatic life. Second, it has a high pollution load which would result in eutrophication of contaminated water sources. Distillery wastewater, without any treatment can result in depletion of dissolved oxygen in the receiving water streams and poses serious threat to the aquatic flora and fauna. This review presents an account of the problems associated with distillery wastewater and a detailed study of existing biological treatment approaches. The role of various microorganisms and their enzymes in the wastewater treatment has been discussed to develop a better understanding of the phenomenon.

AB Thimerosal (an organic mercury compound) is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and hospitals. This study examines the removal of mercury (thimerosal and Hg(II)) from a pharmaceutical wastewater using F-400 granular activated carbon (GAC) at bench and pilot scales. Bench scale dynamic column tests are conducted with 30, 60, 90 and 120 min empty bed contact times (EBCTs). The pilot scale study is conducted using two GAC columns-in-series each of 30 min EBCT. The capital and operational cost analysis for the treatment system is performed. Simultaneous removal of copper, turbidity, phenol, and color from the wastewater by the pilot scale system is also reported. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of six anticancer drugs was evaluated in wastewater effluents. Several grab samples from wastewater effluent were collected throughout a year. Capecitabine, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide were detected at concentrations ranging from 8 to 46 ng . L-1. Capecitabine was detected in all the sampling events whereas cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide were detected less frequently.
   Additionally, the suitability of using pharmaceutical-polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) to monitor the target drugs in wastewater effluents was assessed. Capecitabine, ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide were detected with POCIS and showed a linear uptake over 15 days. The sampling rates, determined in situ, were used to estimate time-weighted average concentrations. A good correlation was found between the concentration of capecitabine detected with POCIS deployed during five days (32 +/- 1 ng . L-1) and the average concentrations obtained in grab samples. The use of passive samplers has advantages over grab samples: easier analysis, less time and costs associated with the analytical method. Passive samplers also provide a time-weighted information about the concentration of pollutants in the aquatic environment. However, information may be lost when the concentration of the target compounds in wastewater effluents is low and the passive samplers are deployed for a short time. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been found in surface waters throughout the United States, and are known to enter waterways via discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Studies addressing EDCs in wastewater do not examine their specific sources upstream of WWTPs. Presented here are results of a pilot study of potential sources of selected EDCs within an urban wastewater service area. Twenty-one wastewater samples were collected from a range of sites, including 16 residential, commercial, or industrial samples, and five samples from influent and effluent streams at the WWTP. Samples were analyzed for the following known and suspected EDCs: five phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, 4-nonylphenol (NP), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), using well-established methods (EPA 625 and USGS O-1433-01). Twenty of 21 samples contained at least one EDC. Phthalates were widely detected; one or more phthalate compound was identified in 19 of 21 samples. Measurement of two phthalates in a field blank sample suggests that the accuracy of sample detections for these two compounds may be compromised by background contamination. Triclosan was detected in nine samples, BPA in five samples, and TCEP in four samples; NP was not detected. The results of this and future source-specific studies may be used to develop targeted pollution prevention strategies to reduce levels of EDCs in wastewater. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB An existing GIs hydrology water quality model, LF2000-WQX, was applied to predict the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and propranalol in catchments. As a practical exercise the predominantly rural Tamar (UK) catchment was chosen. Consumption, excretion, and fate data were used to estimate the pharmaceutical input load for the model. The predicted concentrations throughout most of the catchment were 1 ng/L or less under low flow (90th percentile) conditions. However, at a few locations, downstream of small sewage treatment plants, concentrations above 25 ng/L were predicted. This exercise shows that it is relatively straightforward to predict the concentrations of new and emerging organic microcontaminants in real catchments using existing GIs hydrology water quality models. Further testing will be required to establish their accuracy (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Laccase from Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 was cross-linked to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by electron beam irradiation. Immobilised laccase displayed a higher stability than the non-immobilised enzyme with respect to typical wastewater temperatures, and pH at a range of 5 to 9. Batch tests addressed the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs; applied as a mixture of acetaminophen, bezafibrate, indometacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, and naproxen) by both immobilised and non-immobilised laccase in municipal wastewater. High removal rates (>85%) of the most efficiently oxidised PhACs (acetaminophen and mefenamic add) indicated a high efficiency of the immobilised laccase in wastewater. Continuous elimination of the aforementioned PhACs by the immobilised enzyme in a continuously operated diffusion basket reactor yielded a PhAC removal pattern qualitatively similar to those observed in batch tests. Clearly higher apparent V-max values and catalytic efficiencies (in terms of both V-max/S-0.5 as well as V-max/K-m values obtained from data fitting according to the Hill and the Michaelis-Menten model, respectively) observed for acetaminophen oxidation by the immobilised compared to the non-immobilised enzyme are in support of a considerably higher functional stability of the immobilised laccase especially in wastewater. The potential influence of acetaminophen on the removal of comparatively less laccase-oxidisable water pollutants such as the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) was investigated. TCS was increasingly removed upon increasing the initial acetaminophen concentration in immobilised as well as non-immobilised laccase reaction systems until saturation became evident. Acetaminophen was consumed and not recycled during laccase reactions, which was accompanied by the formation of various acetaminophen-TCS cross-coupling products. Nevertheless, the simultaneous presence of acetaminophen (and potentially even more pollutant removal-enhancing laccase substrates) and more recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater represents an interesting option for the efficiency enhancement of enzyme-based wastewater treatment approaches.

AB The Sumida river estuary of Tokyo bay is often affected by fecal contamination from combined sewer overflows (CSOs). This study monitored the surface water quality from the upstream of the Sumida river to the estuary in October 2017, June 2018, and July 2018 after three long-duration rainfall events. Several types of sewage markers, including fecal bacteria and two types of bacteriophages as microbial markers, and five pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as chemical markers were used to evaluate fecal contamination. CSO discharge was estimated separately from pumping stations and overflow chambers. The dominant contribution from overflow chambers was estimated to be as high as 86 - 91% of total discharge volume indicating their significance in controlling CSO pollution. High concentrations of sewage marker were observed in a wide area due to CSO discharge of more than 30 h in all 3 events.Escherichia coliwas found to be as high as 4.00 - 4.57 log(10)(CFU/100 mL). Meanwhile, caffeine showed the highest concentration of 2105 ng/L among PPCPs. It was found to be a useful indicator of recent contamination that captured a unique spatial distribution tendency. On the other hand, crotamiton, a conservative PPCP, was found to be highly diluted and might not be appropriate for tracking pollutants under heavy rainfall events. The effect of CSO discharge pattern and tidal change on the distribution of sewage markers, including dispersion degree and pollutants travel time, was described. CSO pollutants were found to accumulate in the river mouth areas during high tide before being discharged into the estuary.

AB Secondary urban wastewater samples were spiked with azithromycin (AZT), trimethoprim (TMP), ofloxacin (OFL) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) at 100 mu g L-1 to investigate the efficiency of a TiO2-photocatalytic treatment using UVA-LEDs. Different operating parameters were studied, such as the irradiation conditions, catalyst load and the use of methanol as carrier solvent and radical scavenger. The most efficient conditions to treat spiked urban wastewater (4 LEDs symmetrically distributed and 1.00 g L-1 of catalyst) were also assessed on the removal of the antibiotics at real concentrations, as well as on the inactivation and regrowth of bacteria after 3-day storage (total and resistant heterotrophs, Escherichia coli and enterococci). Clindamycin (CLI) was targeted when SMX was not detected. One-hour treatment was enough to reduce the analysed antibiotics to values below the detection limits and to decrease the bacterial load by 2 log-units. Bacterial regrowth was observed for total heterotrophs, after the storage of photocatalytic treated wastewater, to values close to pre-treatment. However, the antibiotic resistance percentage of such stored wastewater was always similar or lower than that of secondary urban wastewater. Thus, the potential of this process as part of the tertiary treatment is demonstrated, but conditions must be adjusted to minimize microbial regrowth.

DE Ozone; Ozonation; Wastewater; Disinfection; Micro-constituents; Emerging
   Contaminants; Water Reuse; Indirect Potable Reuse
AB Ozone is a strong oxidant used to treat a variety of constituents in potable water, wastewater, water reuse, and industrial water treatment applications. Ozone is effective at oxidizing a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds and disinfection. Well-known in potable water treatment, with about 400 US installations and 3,000 worldwide, ozone has limited application at wastewater treatments, with less than 10 operating facilities in the US. The ability of ozone to significantly reduce low level concentrations of trace organic compounds, including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other emerging contaminants have increased interest in applying ozone in potable water and wastewater treatment. Treating at the point source discharge rather than the water supply intake may be more effective. A recent American Water Works Research Foundation (AwwaRF) report indicated high removals of many EDCs and PPCPs at typical disinfection doses. Several wastewater utilities have installed or are in the process of installing ozone to treat secondary effluent. These utilities are using ozone in a variety of ways: as a primary disinfectant, for treatment of microconstituents, and in combination with other processes (e.g. membranes and UV) to produce high-quality water for indirect potable reuse (IPR). The different applications, treatment goals and basis of process selection are compared and contrasted. Secondary benefits of ozone treatment of secondary effluent, including the use of off-gas in biological treatment is also discussed.

AB In this study, anti-inflammatory drugs including diclofenac (DICLO), ibuprofen (IBUP), naproxen (NAPROX), ketoprofen (KETOP), mefenamic acid (MEFEN. ACID) were determined in wastewaters and environmental risk level was evaluated using obtained results. Analytical method for determination of anti-inflammatory in wastewater was optimized. The detection of anti-inflammatory was carried out by HPLC/MS-MS. Wastewater samples were taken from Konya Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant input and output. DICLO, IBUP, NAPROX, KETOP, and MEFEN ACID were determined between 35.8-533, <dl-4597, 25.5-6476, 11.6-579, 13.9-50.2 ng/L in influent samples and <dl-574, <dl-108, 20.8-114, 8.5-180, 20.6-54.3 ng/L in effluent samples, respectively. DICLO compound demonstrated moderate risk for fish (PEC/PNEC: 1-10) while IBUP compound demonstrated low risk for fish (PEC/PNEC: 0.1-1). The HQ values of NAPROX, KETOP, MEFEN ACID were determined as <0.1 for fish, Daphnia magna and algae which means insignificant environmental risk to aquatic organisms.

AB An analysis of wastewater from Krakow (Poland) for the presence of controlled and uncontrolled stimulant drugs of abuse was performed. Samples were collected from the Plaszow wastewater treatment plant, Krakow, Poland, and prepared by solid phase extraction. The LC-QTOFMS method was applied for identification and quantification of popular stimulants: MDMA, mephedrone, 4-MEC, MDPV and mCPP. Environmental loads of illicit drugs were calculated; the WWTP discharged loads ranging from 3.6 to 6.7 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of MDMA, 3.6 to 7.1 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of mephedrone and 4.8 to 5.8 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of 4-MEC. The results confirmed the growing popularity of new psychoactive substances in Poland.

AB In this study, laboratory-scale experiments were conducted applying a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) activated sludge process to a wastewater stream from a pharmaceutical factory. Nitrogen removal can be achieved via partial nitrification and denitrification and the efficiency was above 99% at 23degreesC +/- 1. The experimental results indicated that the nitrite oxidizers were more sensitive than ammonia oxidizers to the free ammonia in the wastewater. The average accumulation rate of nitrite was much higher than that of nitrate. During nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway, the end of nitrification and denitrification can be exactly decided by monitoring the variation of pH. Consequently, on-line control for nitrogen removal from the pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater can be achieved and the cost of operation can be reduced.

AB Polycyclic and nitro musk (PNM) fragrances in personal care products persist and bioaccumulate in the environment following wastewater discharges and land application of biosolids. Influent and effluent concentrations, seasonal variations, and process removal efficiencies of 11 PNMs were investigated at six wastewater treatment plants representing four typical Canadian treatment processes: lagoon, oxidation ditch, extended aeration, and conventional activated sludge. Influent concentrations were as high as 40 000 ng/L for polycyclic musks and 400 ng/L for nitro musks, and showed some seasonal fluctuation. Effluent concentrations were as high as 4000 ng/L and 150 ng/L for polycyclic and nitro musks, respectively. Lagoon treatment produced the highest percent removal (> 95%) and the lowest effluent concentrations of PNMs, with process temperature exerting some influence on removal. Results indicate that simple hydraulic or solids retention time are not strong predictors of PNM removals from wastewater. Effluent PNM concentrations were extrapolated to all treatment plants in the watershed to estimate concentrations along the Grand River and its tributaries.

AB The degradation of mefenamic acid (MFA) in synthetic wastewater was studied utilizing homemade Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles in a solar-irradiated falling film reactor. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses were applied to identify the homemade Cu-doped TiO2 nanocatalyst. Adsorption experiments revealed that the Langmuir isotherm model well-described the experimental data. Various operating parameters, such as loadings of MFA (10-75 mg L-1), doped catalyst (300-800 mg L-1), H2O2 (300-800 mg L-1), synthetic wastewater flow rate (1-3 L min(-1)), and wastewater pH (3-10), have been investigated for their effects on MFA degradation. A degradation of MFA of 97.5% was achieved within 90 min of the operation period by operating at pH = 10, CCU-TiO2 = 400 mg L-1, C-H2O2 = 400 mg L-1, and Q(sw) = 1.0 L min(-1). The experimental results revealed that an enhancement of 50.09% for degradation of MFA was attained by the 2wt.% Cu-doped TiO2 higher than pure TiO2.

AB Biocatalyst behavior was comparatively evaluated under diverse microenvironments viz., self-induced electrogenic (bioelectrochemical treatment, BET) and anaerobic treatment (AnT) microenvironments, with real-field pharmaceutical wastewater. Relatively higher treatment efficiency was observed with BET (COD removal, 78.70%) over AnT (32%) along with the power output. Voltammetric profiles of AnT showed persistent reduction behavior, while BET depicted simultaneous redox behavior. BET operation documented significantly higher bio-electrocatalytic activity (k(app), 245.22 s(-1)) than AnT (k(app) 7.35 s(-1)). The electron accepting conditions due to the presence of electrode in the BET might contributed to higher electrogenesis leading to enhanced substrate degradation along with the removal of multiple pollutants accounting for the effective reduction of toxicity levels of wastewater. Even at higher organic loads, BET operation showed good treatment efficiency without process inhibition. Introduction of electrode-membrane assembly in anaerobic microenvironment showed significant change in the electrocatalytic behavior of biocatalyst resulting in enhanced treatment of complex wastewater.

AB A screening of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other organic contaminants in sludge from seven Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) was performed in this study. This extensive screening provides information on mass flows of 282 compounds used in the Swedish society to sewage sludge. It reveals constant relative contaminant concentrations (ng mg kg(-1) d.w.), except for some pesticides and perfluorinated compounds, indicating that these originate from broad usage and diffuse dispersion rather than (industrial) point sources. There was a five order of magnitude difference in the sum concentrations of the most and least abundant species (metals and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans, respectively). Lower total concentrations were found in sludge from STPs processing primarily food industry or household sewage. Proportions of the amounts used (in Sweden) found in sludge were lower for compounds that are present in consumer goods or are diffusely dispersed into the environment (0.01-1% recovered in sludge) than for compounds used as detergents or PPCPs (17-63%). In some cases, the recovery seemed to be affected by evaporation (e.g. octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) or biotransformation (e.g. adipates) losses, while polychlorinated alkanes and brominated diphenyl ethers were recovered to disproportionately high degree (ca. 4%); likely due to incomplete statistics for imported goods.

AB Fourteen antibiotics, including five quinolones (QNs), five sulfonamides (SAs), and four tetracyclines (TCs), were selected to investigate their occurrence and elimination in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) by employing different treatment technologies in Urumqi (two STPs) and Shihezi (one STP), China. The STP in Shihezi was chosen as representative to investigate the distribution of antibiotics in a sludge-sewage system. Results showed that the concentrations of most detected antibiotics ranged from tens to hundreds of nanograms per liter in influent samples and under 100 ng L-1 in effluent samples. QNs and TCs were dominant species with concentrations of 2.33 mg kg (-1) to 3.34 mg kg (-1) and 0.36 mg kg (-1) to 0.47 mg kg (-1) in sludge samples, respectively. The elimination rates of target antibiotics by various STPs ranged from 17% to 100%. The STP with anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic and membrane bio-reactor technology removed antibiotics more efficiently than those with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditch technology. The elimination capacities of treatment units from the three STPs were also investigated. SAs were mainly degraded in biological treatment units; conversely, QNs and TCs were significantly eliminated in sedimentary treatment units. Ozonation effectively removed remaining antibiotics but not UV and chlorination disinfection in this study.

AB The discharge of emerging contaminants (ECs) from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment is a matter of great importance due to the potential adverse effects that they can exert on aquatic biota. This study assesses the capacity of 12 full-scale horizontal-flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) (18,000 m(2) in total) used as tertiary treatment to remove 16 ECs from secondary treated wastewater( 423,500 PE). Benzotriazole, 5-methylbenzotriazole, ketoprofen, and diclofenac were the most abundant(>2000 ng L-1 on average) in the secondary treated wastewater effluent. EC removal levels ranged from no removal to 92%, with an average removal of 43%. A significant relationship was observed between the removal of ECs in the HFCWs and their log Kow and molecular weight. The HFCWs were able to attenuate the predicted ecotoxicological effects of ECs on aquatic biota (Daphnia magna) by 66%. This study indicates that HFCWs are suitable for removing ECs from WWTP effluents and, therefore, reduce the ecotoxicological effects associated with pollutant discharges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The analysis of sewage for urinary biomarkers of illicit drugs is a promising and complementary approach for estimating the use of these substances in the general population. For the first time, this approach was simultaneously applied in 19 European cities, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a 1-week period. An inter-laboratory comparison study was performed to evaluate the analytical performance of the participating laboratories. Raw 24-hour composite sewage samples were collected from 19 European cities during a single week in March 2011 and analyzed for the urinary biomarkers of cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and cannabis using in-house optimized and validated analytical methods. The load of each substance used in each city was back-calculated from the measured concentrations. The data show distinct temporal and spatial patterns in drug use across Europe. Cocaine use was higher in Western and Central Europe and lower in Northern and Eastern Europe. The extrapolated total daily use of cocaine in Europe during the study period was equivalent to 356 kg/day. High per capita ecstasy loads were observed in Dutch cities, as well as in Antwerp and London. In general, cocaine and ecstasy loads were significantly elevated during the weekend compared to weekdays. Per-capita loads of methamphetamine were highest in Helsinki and Turku, Oslo and Budweis, while the per capita loads of cannabis were similar throughout Europe. This study shows that a standardized analysis for illicit drug urinary biomarkers in sewage can be applied to estimate and compare the use of these substances at local and international scales. This approach has the potential to deliver important information on drug markets (supply indicator). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, there has been an increase in studies regarding nanofiltration-based processes for removing antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds from water and wastewater. In this work, a 2(k)factorial design with five control factors (antibiotic molecular weight and concentration, nanofiltration (NF) membrane, feed flow rate, and transmembrane pressure) was employed to optimize the NF performance on the treatment of antibiotic-containing wastewater. The resulting multiple linear regression model was used to predict the antibiotic rejections and permeate fluxes. Additional experiments, using the same membranes and the same antibiotics, but under different conditions of transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and antibiotic concentration regarding the 2(k)factorial design were carried out to validate the model developed. The model was also evaluated as a tertiary treatment of urban wastewater for removing sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin. Considering all the conditions investigated, the tightest membrane (NF97) showed higher antibiotics rejection (>97%) and lower permeate fluxes. On the contrary, the loose NF270 membrane presented lower rejections to sulfamethoxazole, the smallest antibiotic, varying from 65% to 97%, and permeate fluxes that were about three-fold higher than the NF97 membrane. The good agreement between predicted and experimental values (R-2> 0.97) makes the model developed in the present work a tool to predict the NF performance when treating antibiotic-containing wastewater.

AB Praseodymium was selected as a promoter for SnO2/Ti electrode to improve the electrocatalytic performance by electrodeposition in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment; the micrograph and the structure were characterized by SEM and XRD. Mixture uniform design was used in the optimization of the electrolytic conditions mathematical model was established according to the rate of wiping COD off, which revealed the relationship between the current intensity, time of electrolysis, the amount of doped P-T, and the ratio of area (SnO2/Ti:Al). On the basis of the analysis of the empirical model, the optimized parameters had been obtained; the rate of wiping COD off was up to 94.9%, it decreased from 392 to 20 mg/L. Experimental results showed that the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode doped with Pr was superior for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB A screening campaign of drugs of abuse (DOA) and their relevant metabolites in the aqueous environment was performed in the Netherlands. The presence of DOA, together with the potential risks for the environment and the possible human exposure to these compounds through consumption of drinking water was investigated. Sewage water (influent and effluent), surface water of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, and drinking water (raw and finished) were analysed by four different laboratories using fully in-house validated methods for a total number of 34 DOA and metabolites. In this way, data reported for several compounds could also be confirmed by other laboratories, giving extra confidence to the results obtained in this study. In total 17 and 22 DOA were detected and quantified in influent and effluent sewage samples, respectively. The tranquilizers oxazepam and temazepam, and cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were found in high concentrations in sewage water. Nine compounds were possibly not efficiently removed during treatment and were detected in surface waters. The results indicated that substantial fractions of the total load of DOA and metabolites in the rivers Rhine and Meuse enter the Netherlands from abroad. For some compounds, loads appear to increase going downstream, which is caused by a contribution from Dutch sewage water effluents. As far as data are available, no environmental effects are expected of the measured DOA in surface waters.
   In raw water, three DOA were detected, whereas in only one finished drinking water out of the 17 tested, benzoylecgonine was identified, albeit at a concentration below the limit of quantification (<1 ng/L). Concentrations were well below the general signal value of 1 mu g/L, which is specified for organic compounds of anthropogenic origin in the Dutch Drinking Water Act. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Alternative approaches to wastewater management including urine source separation have the potential to simultaneously improve multiple aspects of wastewater treatment, including reduced use of potable water for waste conveyance and improved contaminant removal, especially nutrients. In order to pursue such radical changes, system-level evaluations of urine source separation in community contexts are required. The focus of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is managing nutrients from urine produced in a residential setting with urine source separation and struvite precipitation, as compared with a centralized wastewater treatment approach. The life cycle impacts evaluated in this study pertain to construction of the urine source separation system and operation of drinking water treatment, decentralized urine treatment, and centralized wastewater treatment. System boundaries include fertilizer offsets resulting from the production of urine based struvite fertilizer. As calculated by the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), urine source separation with MgO addition for subsequent struvite precipitation with high P recovery (Scenario B) has the smallest environmental cost relative to existing centralized wastewater treatment (Scenario A) and urine source separation with MgO and Na3PO4 addition for subsequent struvite precipitation with concurrent high P and N recovery (Scenario C). Preliminary economic evaluations show that the three urine management scenarios are relatively equal on a monetary basis (<13% difference). The impacts of each urine management scenario are most sensitive to the assumed urine composition, the selected urine storage time, and the assumed electricity required to treat influent urine and toilet water used to convey urine at the centralized wastewater treatment plant. The importance of full nutrient recovery from urine in combination with the substantial chemical inputs required for N recovery via struvite precipitation indicate the need for alternative methods of N recovery.

AB Due to the inability of biochemical processes to remove refractory organic compounds from wastewater in pharmaceutical industrial parks, this research tried to find a new way to meet the requirement of the Discharge Standard in China. A combined process involving micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation, and coagulation was studied. Considering the removal efficiencies and operation costs, the reaction conditions were optimized. The COD concentration in the effluent after the combined treatment was less than the standard limit of 50mg/L. Molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in wastewater was analyzed by sequential filtration and ultrafiltration. When treated by the combined process, the particulate fraction (particle size>1,000nm) decreased, and the soluble portion (particle size<1nm) increased significantly. Composition of the refractory organics was investigated using GC-MS. A total of 34 types of low-molecular-weight organics were identified in the effluent, among which phthalates, amides, heterocyclic compounds, and PAHs were the main organic pollutants. All these results show that the proposed method is promising for refractory wastewater because it is efficient and easy to operate.

AB Microalgae systems have been found to be efficient for removing microcontaminants from wastewater effluents, but the effectiveness of immobilized microalgae for removing endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) has not yet been addressed. This paper assesses the effect of free and immobilized microalgae on removal efficiency for 6 EDCs by mixing them in 2.5 L reactors with treated wastewater. The experimental design also included control reactors without microalgae. After 10 days of incubation, 64 and 89% of the NH4-N and 90 and 96% of total phosphorous (TP) had been eliminated in the free microalgae and immobilized microalgae reactors, respectively, while the control reactors eliminated only 40% and 70% of the NH4-N and TP, respectively. Both the free and immobilized microalgae reactors were able to remove up to 80% of most of the studied EDCs within 10 days of incubation. Free microalgae were found to increase the kinetic removal rate for bisphenol A, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and 4-octylphenol (25%, 159%, and 41%, respectively). Immobilizing the microalgae in alginate beads additionally enhanced the kinetic removal rate for bisphenol AF, bisphenol F, and 2,4-dichlorophenol. This study shows that the use of co-immobilized microalgae-based wastewater treatment systems increases the removal efficiency for nutrients and some EDCs from wastewater effluents.

AB The main goal of this work was to produce an easily recoverable waste-based magnetic activated carbon (MAC) for an efficient removal of the antiepileptic pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater. For this purpose, the synthesis procedure was optimized and a material (MAC4) providing immediate recuperation from solution, remarkable adsorptive performance and relevant properties (specific surface area of 551 m(2) g(-1) and saturation magnetization of 39.84 emu g(-1)) was selected for further CBZ kinetic and equilibrium adsorption studies. MAC4 presented fast CBZ adsorption rates and short equilibrium times (< 30-45 min) in both ultrapure water and wastewater. Equilibrium studies showed that MAC4 attained maximum adsorption capacities (q(m)) of 68 +/- 4 mg g(-1) in ultrapure water and 60 +/- 3 mg g(-1) in wastewater, suggesting no significant interference of the aqueous matrix in the adsorption process. Overall, this work provides evidence of potential application of a waste-based MAC in the tertiary treatment of wastewaters.

AB Healthcare facilities are an under-characterized source of pharmaceuticals to municipal wastewaters. In this study, the composition and magnitude of sixteen cardiovascular active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and two cardiovascular API metabolites in wastewater effluents from a hospital, nursing care, assisted living, and independent living facility are presented. Each cardiovascular API was detected in at least one facility's wastewater. The hospital's wastewater had the most detected cardiovascular APIs with thirteen of the eighteen measured compounds positively confirmed and quantified. Maximum mean analyte concentrations within each healthcare facility's wastewater were: 11.3 mu g L-1 atenolol for the independent living facility; 8.7 mu g L-1 valsartan for the assisted living facility; 2.7 mu g L-1 diltiazem for the nursing home facility; and 14.6 mu g L-1 valsartan for hospital facility. Daily wastewater flow was combined with individual concentrations to estimate the cardiovascular API mass loadings leaving each facility through wastewater discharges to the municipal sewer system. The estimated daily mass loading of all measured cardiovascular APIs ranged from 0.87 g per day at the assisted living facility to 12.5 g per day at the hospital. The combined loading for all four facilities was 16.2 g per day. This presented research informs the risk management process by providing source characterization data for healthcare facility wastewaters containing commonly prescribed cardiovascular APIs.

AB Two separate pilot-scale studies were performed at two wastewater treatment plants comparing conventional ozonation and catalytic ozonation with an alumina-based catalyst supplied by BASF. The results of the first pilot study showed that catalytic ozonation achieved the same degree of disinfection as conventional ozonation with 30% lower applied ozone dose and enhanced the removal of several contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The second pilot study conducted over 6 months of operation with the same batch of catalyst showed sustained enhanced removal of CECs relative to ozonation alone. The removals of CECs by catalytic ozonation was particularly effective for compounds with low reaction rates with ozone, indicating reactions with hydroxyl radicals formed in the presence of the catalyst. Analysis of plasma vitellogenin and total glutathione in liver tissues of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) injected with wastewater extracts indicated that catalytic ozonation removed the estrogenic activity and modulated oxidative stress caused by exposure to the organic compounds in wastewater extracts. Analysis of other biomarker responses indicated that no transformation products were formed that can cause lipid damage in the liver or affect levels of a brain neurotransmitter (i.e. serotonin). Catalytic ozonation is a promising technology to increase the efficiency of ozone treatment of municipal wastewater and to meet increasingly more stringent regulations for effluent quality.

AB The cosmetics industry has been growing steadily for the past several years in China, yet very few researches exist on cosmetic wastewater treatment system. This study gave new insight to develop a combined anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) and upflow biological aerated filter (UBAF) system for the treatment of cosmetic wastewater. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency in the cosmetic wastewater was mainly investigated in the front two compartments of ABR reactor, while it was treated by the same reactor with six compartments. When the influent COD load was set at 1.5 g COD/L.d, the COD removal efficiency reached a maximum in the No. 1 compartment. The highest COD removal efficiency achieved 2.0 g COD/L.d for the complete ABR reactor. The optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the ABR was 48 h. A UBAF reactor was applied to advanced treatment for ABR effluent. The coke powder with the diameter of 0.5-1.0mm and the gas-water ratio of 7:1 were chosen the optimal experimental conditions. Under the above-optimal experimental conditions, the COD removal efficiency of UBAF was 69.5-82.6%. After the combined treatment by ABR and UBAF, the cosmetic wastewater effluent can effectively supply the discharge standard in China.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are an integral part of societal health yet their presence in various environmental compartments, including treated wastewaters, has sparked concerns towards possible human and ecological health effects. The current study aims to characterize human health risks posed by ten pharmaceuticals quantified in wastewater treatment plant effluents where water is reused mainly for landscape irrigation. Receptors were identified as children playing in green areas, adult landscape workers, and adult users of athletic and golf courses irrigated by treated wastewater. The human health risk assessment model exhibited safe exposure (RQ < 1) to all pharmaceuticals for all receptors through both dermal and ingestion exposure pathways. RQs were highest for the landscape worker followed by children playing in green areas and then adult using the athletic fields. RQs were highest to lowest in the following order of pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, metoprolol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, risperidone, and sulfamethazine. Such risk assessment findings aid in supporting decisions to optimize wastewater treatment and reuse strategies, as well as safeguard public and environmental health.

AB The Lake Simcoe watershed in Ontario, Canada is an important recreational area and a recharge zone for groundwater resources. Lake Simcoe is a relatively shallow lotic system that has been impacted by urban development, recreation, industry and agriculture. As part of a watershed management plan, six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in this catchment basin were selected to measure the inputs of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) of wastewater origin. These WWTPs were recently upgraded to tertiary treatment for phosphorus removal. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were used to monitor for hydrophilic and hydrophobic CECs, respectively, in treated and untreated wastewater. The passive samplers were calibrated with performance reference compounds (PRCs) by measuring the loss of deuterated beta blocker drugs spiked into POCIS and the loss of PCB congeners spiked into SPMDs over the course of 14-day deployment periods. From the PRC data, field sampling rates of CECs were determined and applied to estimate time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations and mass loadings in mg/day/1000 members of the population serviced. In treated wastewater, TWA concentrations of an antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, the prescription drugs, carbamazepine, naproxen and gemfibrozil, and the non-prescription drug, ibuprofen, were estimated to be in the low (<18 ng/L) range. The artificial sweeteners, sucralose and acesulfame, were particularly useful chemical tracers, with estimated TWA concentrations in treated wastewater ranging from 128 to 213 ng/L and 4 to 33 ng/L, respectively. The steroid hormones were detected only rarely in treated wastewater. Triclosan, triclocarban and the synthetic musks, HHCB and AHTN, were removed efficiently (>77 %), possibly because of the tertiary treatment technologies. Therefore, the mass loadings for these personal care products were all <5 mg/day/1000 people. Overall, this study indicates that tertiary treatment technologies designed for phosphorus removal do not entirely remove the target CECs.

AB Illicit drug use is a global phenomenon involving millions of individuals, which results in serious health and social costs. The chemical analysis of urban wastewater for the excretion products of illicit drugs is a potent approach for monitoring patterns and trends of illicit drug use in a community. The first international and multidisciplinary conference on this topic was recently organized to present the epidemiological knowledge of patterns in drug use and the information obtained from wastewater analysis. This paper gives an overview of the main issues that emerged during the conference, focusing on the identified research gaps and requirements and on the future challenges and opportunities from bringing together wastewater analysis and drug epidemiology. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) uses an established multi-indicator system to monitor illicit drug use and to identity the emergence of new psychoactive substances. The methodological challenges of monitoring a hidden and stigmatized behavior like drug use include the limitations of self-report data and reporting delays. An increasing evidence base suggests that wastewater analysis can address some of these problems. Specifically this technique can: monitor temporal and spatial trends in drug use at different scales, provide updated estimates of drug use, and identify changing habits and the use of new substances. A best practice protocol developed by a Europe-wide network of experts is available to produce homogeneous and comparable data at different sites. The systematic evaluation of uncertainties related to wastewater analysis has highlighted which areas require careful control and those that need further investigation to generally improve the approach. Wastewater analysis has considerable potential to complement existing approaches for monitoring drug use due to its ability to produce objective, real-time estimates of drug use and to give timely information of any change in the patterns of use.

AB Hospital effluents contribute to the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the environment due to their high load of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) and some endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs). Nowadays, hospital wastewaters are co-treated with urban wastewater; however, the dilution factor and the inefficiency of wastewater treatment plants in the removal of PhACs and EDCs make inappropriate the co-treatment of both effluents. In this paper, a new alternative to pre-treat hospital wastewater concerning the removal of PhACs and EDCs is presented. The treatment was carried out in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor under sterile and non-sterile conditions with Trametes versicolor pellets. Results on non-sterile experiments pointed out that 46 out of the 51 detected PhACs and EDCs were partially to completely removed. The total initial PhAC amount into the bioreactor was 8185 mu g in sterile treatment and 8426 mu g in non-sterile treatment, and the overall load elimination was 83.2% and 533% in their respective treatments. In addition, the Microtox test showed reduction of wastewater toxicity after the treatment. Hence, the good efficiency of the fungal treatment regarding removal of the wide diversity of PhACs and EDCs detected in hospital effluents is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of temperature was studied on the efficiency of soluble COD removal and bacterial community development during the aerobic biological treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater. Using wastewater and bacterial inoculum obtained from the full-scale facility treating this wastewater, batch laboratory cultures were operated at 5 degreesC intervals from 30 degreesC to 70 degreesC. Following four culture transfers to allow for bacterial acclimation, residual soluble COD levels were measured and bacterial community fingerprints were obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Soluble COD removal efficiency declined as temperature increased from 30 degreesC (62%) to 60 degreesC (38%). Biological treatment of this wastewater failed to occur at temperatures higher than 60 degreesC. Gradual shifts in bacterial community structure were detected as temperature increased, including a concomitant reduction in the number of different bacterial populations. The impact of temperature on a two-stage biological treatment process was also compared. Better soluble COD removal was achieved when both reactors were operated at 30 degreesC compared to a system where the two stages were consecutively operated at 55 degreesC and 30 degreesC. These results indicate that operation of aerobic biological wastewater treatment reactors at elevated temperatures can have adverse effects on process performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The behavior of antibacterial triclosan, insect-repellent diethyltoluamide (DEET), anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and antipruritic crotamiton was investigated at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) to clarify their complete mass balance. Twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite samples were collected from the influent and effluent of primary and final sedimentation tanks, a biofiltration tank and disinfection tanks. Sludge samples (i.e., activated and excess sludge) and samples of the return flow from the sludge treatment process were collected in the same manner. The analytes in both the dissolved and particulate phases were individually determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with mass spectrometer. Triclosan was dominantly detected in the particulate phase especially in the early stage of treatment (up to 83%) and was efficiently removed (over 90%) in STPs, mainly by sorption to sewage sludge. Limited removal was observed for DEET (55 +/- 24%), while no significant removal was demonstrated for crotamiton or carbamazepine. The solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d, n = 4) for triclosan (log K-d: 3.7-5.1), DEET (1.3-1.9) and crotamiton (1.1-1.6) in the sludge samples are also determined in this study. These findings indicate the limitations of current sewage treatment techniques for the removal of these water-soluble drugs (i.e. DEET, carbamazepine, and crotamiton).

AB Biological nitrogen removal from industrial wastewater (pharmaceutical synthetic wastewater) was studied. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) were utilized to treat ammonium-rich wastewater. No external carbon source was added to the reactors. At nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 2.5 kg N/(m(3).day), the efficiency of ammonium removal from synthetic wastewater in SBR was 86.9%. SBBR ammonium removal efficiency under fixed dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 0.3 mg O-2/dm(3) was 98.4%. Specific nitrification rate (SNR) and specific denitrification rate (SDNR) in SBR were 9.24 mg NH4+-N/(g MLVSS.h) and 18.56 mg NO3--N/(g MLVSS.h), respectively. Nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) showed high correlation with DO decrement (R-2 = 0.983), NAR and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) had high correlation, too (R-2 = 0.976). SND efficiency in SBBR reached 94.1% while ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were dominant and NAR in SBBR process at the DO level of 0.3 mg O-2/dm(3) was 90.3%.

AB Treated wastewater from small communities is discharged into rivers or streams with a high biodiversity value. This is particularly important in Mediterranean countries, where most of the streams are dry almost all year round. This preliminary study assessed the occurrence and attenuation of 23 emerging contaminants (ECs) in 4 wastewater-dominated streams in which treated wastewater accounted for the entire stream flow. The concentration of ECs was monitored in the warm and cold seasons in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and at 6 downstream locations. The concentration of ECs in the WWTP effluents ranged from undetected to 12 mu g L-1. The attenuation of ECs 1 km downstream ranged from no removal to up to 80% (48% on average). The half-lives of ECs in the 4 streams ranged from 0.4 to 20 h (3.9 +/- 3.5 h on average). Compounds such as benzodiazepine drugs and flame retardants were the most recalcitrant (half-lives >5 h). The highest attenuation of ECs and ammonia was observed in the stream completely covered by vegetation. The cumulative hazardous quotient 1 km downstream was reduced on average by more than 60%. Therefore, the results suggest that both seasonality and vegetation play an important role in in-stream attenuation of ECs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vancomycin (VCM) is an antibiotic, known medically as the deadline for defending against bacteria. In this study, the removal and fate of VCM were investigated in each treatment unit at two pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) in eastern China. VCM was present in all wastewater and sludge samples of both PWWTPs. After the treatment procedure (the moving bed biofilm reactor technology for PWWTP1 and the modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic technology for PWWTP2), total removal efficiencies were up to 99 %, corresponding to a reduction of two orders of magnitude of the influent concentrations in both PWWTPs. The aerobic tank dominated VCM removal. Mass balance flow analyses indicated that biodegradation (99.15 % for PWWTP1 and 99.51 % for PWWTP2) was the principle mechanism for removing VCM, while the contribution of sorption by sludge for both PWWTPs was negligible. However, the results of the environmental risk assessment of VCM in the effluents showed that the maximum trigger quotient values were much higher than 1 in both PWWTPs, indicating the non-negligible environmental and health risks. This is the first report of the fate and risks of VCM in pharmaceutical wastewater, and underscores the importance of PWWTPs as antibiotic pollution sources, even though wastewater management appeared efficient.

AB The direct discharge of effluent wastewater into Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva) results in the formation of an effluent plume with locally high concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants. The micropollutant hotspots above the wastewater outfall present a potential ecotoxicological risk, yet the spatial extent of the plume and the associated ecotoxicological risk zone remain unclear. This work combines the two main processes affecting the spreading of the plume, namely dilution of micropollutants due to mixing and degradation by photolysis, into a coupled hydrodynamic-photolysis model, with which we estimated the spatial extent of the risk zone in Vidy Bay. The concentration of micropollutants around the wastewater outfall was simulated for typical wind scenarios and seasons relevant to Vidy Bay, and the resulting ecotoxicological risk was evaluated. Specifically, we determined the direct and indirect photolysis rate constants for 24 wastewater-derived micropollutants and implemented these in a hydrodynamic particle tracking model, which tracked the movement of water parcels from the wastewater outfall. Simulations showed that owing to thermal stratification, the zone of ecotoxicological risk is largest in summer and extends horizontally over 300 m from the outfall. Photolysis processes contribute to reducing the plume extent mainly under unstratified conditions when the plume surfaces. Moreover, it was shown that only a few compounds, mainly antibiotics, dominate the total ecotoxicological risk.

AB Direct potable reuse of wastewater is attractive as the demand for potable water increases. However, the presence of organic micropollutants in industrial and domestic wastewater is a major health and environmental concern. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are not designed to remove these compounds. Further many of these emerging pollutants are not regulated. Membrane bioreactor based biological wastewater treatment has recently become a preferred method for treating municipal and other industrial wastewaters. Here the removal of five selected micropollutants representing different classes of emerging micropollutants has been investigated using a membrane bioreactor. Acetaminophen, amoxicillin, atrazine, estrone, and triclosan were spiked into wastewaters obtained from a local wastewater treatment facility prior to introduction to the membrane bioreactor containing both anoxic and aerobic tanks. Removal of these compounds by adsorption and biological degradation was determined for both the anoxic and aerobic processes. The removal as a function of operating time was investigated. The results obtained here suggest that removal may be related to the chemical structure of the micropollutants.

AB This paper describes the wastewater characterization and aerobic/anaerobic treatability (oxygen uptake rate and biogas production measurement) of chemical-synthesis based pharmaceutical industry effluents in a nearby baker's yeast industry treatment plant. Preliminary experiments by the industry had indicated strong anaerobic toxicity. On the other hand, aerobic treatability was also uncertain due to complexity and unknown composition of the wastewater. The work in this study has indicated that the effluents of the pharmaceutical industry can be treated without toxicity in the aerobic stage of the treatment plant. Methanogenic activity tests with anaerobic sludge from the anaerobic treatment stage of the wastewater treatment plant and acetate as substrate have confirmed the strong toxicity, while showing that 30 min aeration or coagulation with an alum dose of 300 mg/l is sufficient for reducing the toxicity almost completely. Powdered activated carbon, lime and ferric chloride (100-1,000 mg/l) had no effect on reduction of the toxicity. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry was recommended to treat its effluents in the anaerobic stage of the nearby baker's yeast industry wastewater treatment plan at which there will be no VOC emission and toxicity problem, provided that pretreatment is done.

AB Background, Aims, and Scope. One of the first occurrences of pharmaceutically active compounds in groundwater was reported from the sewage irrigation farms south of Berlin. At these sewage irrigation farms treated sewage effluent passed the soil and unsaturated zone before reaching the aquifer. Clofibric acid was detected in pore water from soils of those sewage irrigation farms in concentrations between 65 ng/L and 1430 ng/L. The aim of this study was to investigate the transport behavior of regularly detected clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and propyphenazone under conditions comparable to those at the sewage irrigation farms in a multiple compound sand column laboratory experiment.
   Materials and Methods. Sediment column experiments were conducted to study the transport of pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone. The migration was measured in fine to medium grained sand and leaching solution containing 1 mg/L of pharmaceutically active compounds and 61 mg/L of the tracer lithium chloride (LiCl). For the analysis of the pharmaceutical compounds the water samples were adjusted to a pH value of 2 and then extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Before extraction, the samples were spiked with a surrogate standard for analytical quality control. The sample extracts were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with selected ion monitoring (SIM). Depending on the sample volume (100 to 200 mL) and the matrix, the limits of detection were between 1 and 10 ng/L, and the limits of quantitation were between 5 and 25 ng/L. Analysis for calcium, magnesium and lithium were carried out using a 'Trace Scan' ICP-AES from Thermo Jarrel Ash. Sodium, potassium, iron and manganese were analyzed using a Philips PU 9400 flame AAS. Analysis of anions was performed on a Dionex ion chromatograph DX 120.
   Results. At the sewage irrigation farms the average concentrations of clofibric acid in the unsaturated zone declined from higher values near ground surface (480 ng/L) to lower values near the groundwater table (65 ng/L). From the pharmaceuticals analyzed only clofibric acid, primidone and propyphenazone could be analyzed in the first (upper) aquifer at the sewage irrigation farms. All other pharmaceuticals could neither be detected in the first aquifer nor in the deeper aquifers. Breakthrough curves from soil column experiments revealed no transformation and no retardation for clofibric acid, whereas transformation of diclofenac was so high (79%) that no retardation factor could be calculated. Ibuprofen was significantly transformed (37%), transformation of propyphenazone (17%) was quite low and retardation (R-f = 2.05) was in the range of previously conducted column experiments.
   Discussion. The results confirm previously conducted experiments with clofibric acid where this compound was identified as highly mobile and persistent. The results that diclofenac and ibuprofen are significantly transformed where unexpected as other studies exhibited much lower transformation under saturated conditions at least for diclofenac. However, lower pH values and higher oxygen contents in the unsaturated zone compared to the aquifer may explain this observed high transformation of these compounds at the column experiments.
   Conclusions. We conclude that irrigation with sewage effluent containing the compounds used in our experiments will lead to an input into groundwater of clofibric acid, whereas diclofenac and ibuprofen will most likely be transformed during the passage. Propyphenazone will be retarded but will most likely occur in groundwater. These results from the column experiments coincide very well with the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, primidone, and propyphenazone in the first aquifer.

AB The growth of the world's population increases the demand for fresh water, food, energy, and technology, which in turn leads to increasing amount of wastewater, produced both by domestic and industrial sources. These different wastewaters contain a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds which can cause tremendous environmental problems if released untreated. Traditional treatment systems are usually expensive, energy demanding and are often still incapable of solving all challenges presented by the produced wastewaters. Microalgae are promising candidates for wastewater reclamation as they are capable of reducing the amount of nitrogen and phosphate as well as other toxic compounds including heavy metals or pharmaceuticals. Compared to the traditional systems, photosynthetic microalgae require less energy input since they use sunlight as their energy source, and at the same time lower the carbon footprint of the overall reclamation process. This mini-review focuses on recent advances in wastewater reclamation using microalgae. The most common microalgal strains used for this purpose are described as well as the challenges of using wastewater from different origins. We also describe the impact of climate with a particular focus on a Nordic climate.

AB The demands established in the rules and regulations by the administration in Catalonia seem to exclude small communities from wastewater reclamation and reuse, due to the comparatively high costs associated with the practice at small scale. In the framework of the DRAC project (Demonstration on Wastewater Reclamation and Reuse in Catalonia) two different pre-treatment systems, one extensive (infiltration -percolation) and another intensive (ring filter), each one followed by chlorine dioxide disinfection, were tested in order to be applied for small communities wastewater reclamation and reuse. The results of this study show that infiltration-percolation systems remove very efficiently physico-chemical contaminants and microorganisms. The ring filter system does not show a significant removal rate of contaminants. The use of infiltration-percolation as a pre-treatment for advanced chemical disinfection allows reducing the dose of disinfectant and the contact time needed to achieve a specific water quality, and diminishes disinfection by-products (DBPs) generation. Therefore, this reclamation line is suitable for small communities due to its efficiency and low cost. However, further studies are needed in relation to the removal mechanisms of microorganisms, organic compounds in IP systems and the possible DBPs formation using chlorine dioxide.

AB A wide-scope screening of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their transformation products (TPs) in wastewater can yield valuable insights and pinpoint emerging contaminants that have not been previously reported. Such information is relevant to investigate their occurrence and fate in various environmental compartments. In this study, we explored the applicability of direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) for comprehensive and rapid detection of APIs and their TPs in wastewater samples. The method was developed using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) system and incorporated both wide-scope suspect screening and semi-quantitative determination of selected analytes. The identification strategy was based on the following criteria: narrow accurate mass window (+/- 1.25 ppm) for two most abundant full-MS signals, isotopic pattern fit and additional confirmation on the basis of MS2 spectra at three fragmentation levels. The tentative identification of suspects and target compounds relied on an in-house database containing more than 500 different APIs and TPs. The measured fragment spectra were matched against experimental MS2 patterns obtained from a publicly available spectral library (MassBank of North America) and in-silico generated fragmentation features (from the CFM-ID algorithm). In total, 79 suspects were identified and 24 target compounds were semi-quantified in 72 wastewater samples. The highest detection frequencies in treated wastewater effluents were observed for diclofenac, metoprolol and telmisartan, while hydroxydiclofenac, dextrorphan, and carbamazepine metabolites were the most frequently detected TPs. The obtained API profiles were in accordance with the national consumption statistics and the origin of wastewater samples. The developed method is suitable for rapid screening of APIs in wastewater and can be used as a complementary tool to characterize API emissions from wastewater treatment facilities and to identify problematic compounds that require more rigorous monitoring.

AB This article describes a proof-of-concept study designed for the reuse of wastewater using microbial electrochemical cells (MECs) combined with complementary post-treatment technologies. This study mainly focused on how the integrated approach works effectively for wastewater reuse. In this study, microalgae and ultraviolet C (UVC) light were used for advanced wastewater treatment to achieve site-specific treatment goals such as agricultural reuse and aquifer recharge. The bio-electrosynthesis of H2O2 in MECs was carried out based on a novel concept to integrate with UVC, especially for robust removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) resistant to biodegradation, and the algal treatment was configured for nutrient removal from MEC effluent. UVC irradiation has also proven to be an effective disinfectant for bacteria, protozoa, and viruses in water. The average energy consumption rate for MECs fed acetate-based synthetic wastewater was 0.28 +/- 0.01 kWh per kg of H2O2, which was significantly more efficient than are conventional electrochemical processes. MECs achieved 89 +/- 2% removal of carbonaceous organic matter (measured as chemical oxygen demand) in the wastewater (anolyte) and concurrent production of H2O2 up to 222 +/- 11 mg L-1 in the tapwater (catholyte). The nutrients (N and P) remaining after MECs were successfully removed by subsequent phycoremediation with microalgae when aerated (5% CO2, v/v) in the light. This complied with discharge permits that limit N to 20 mg L-1 and P to 0.5 mg L-1 in the effluent. H2O2 produced on site was used to mediate photolytic oxidation with UVC light for degradation of recalcitrant TOrCs in the algal-treated wastewater. Carbamazepine was used as a model compound and was almost completely removed with an added 10 mg L-1 H2O2 at a UVC dose of 1000 mJ cm(-2). These results should not be generalized, but critically discussed, because of the limitations of using synthetic wastewater.

AB Industrial wastewater is characterised by a complex composition of trace organic compounds (TrOC) in a difficult matrix. The identification of unknown pollutants is of high interest. On the one hand to ensure protection of the environment by elucidating contaminations and on the other hand to protect the biological treatment step in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Due to the high variability of the matrix, the identification of compounds of interest is very time consuming and often unsuccessful. To overcome this limitation, a prioritisation method was developed to identify so called 'known unknowns', i.e. compounds frequently detected but not identified, as prioritised compounds in industrial wastewater. The method based on an offline two-dimensional (offline 2D) liquid chromatography (LC) approach with ultra violet (UV) detection in the first and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in the second dimension. As a proof of concept, an identification process of one 'known unknown' is described. The compound was identified as a dichlorodinitrophenol isomer by retention time in two dimensions, UV spectrum, exact mass, mass fragmentation and H-1-NMR. As prioritisation method, the offline 2D LC in combination with non-target analysis provides a powerful workflow to determine tentative structures of unknown organic compounds in industrial wastewater.

AB Removal of nine pharmaceutical compoundsacetaminophen (AAF), antipyrine (ANT), caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CRB), diclofenac (DCF), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), ketorolac (KET), metoprolol (MET) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)spiked in a primary sedimentation effluent of a municipal wastewater has been studied with sequential aerobic biological and ozone advanced oxidation systems. Combinations of ozone, UVA black light and Fe(III) or Fe3O4 constituted the chemical systems. During the biological treatment (hydraulic residence time, HRT = 24h), only AAF and CAF were completely eliminated, MET, SMX and HCT reached partial removal rates and the rest of compounds were completely refractory. With any ozone advanced oxidation process applied, the remaining pharmaceuticals disappear in less than 10min. Fe3O4 or Fe(III) photocatalytic ozonation leads to 35% mineralization compared to 13% reached during ozonation alone after about 30-min reaction. Also, biodegradability of the treated wastewater increased 50% in the biological process plus another 150% after the ozonation processes. Both untreated and treated wastewater was non-toxic for Daphnia magna (D. magna) except when Fe(III) was used in photocatalytic ozonation. In this case, toxicity was likely due to the ferryoxalate formed in the process. Kinetic information on ozone processes reveals that pharmaceuticals at concentrations they have in urban wastewater are mainly removed through free radical oxidation.

TI Transport of sewage molecular markers through saturated soil column and

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and artificial sweeteners (ASs) are emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in the aquatic environment. The presence of PPCPs and ASs in water bodies has an ecologic potential risk and health concern. Therefore, it is needed to detect the pollution sources by understanding the transport behavior of sewage molecular markers in a subsurface area. The aim of this study was to evaluate transport of nine selected molecular markers through saturated soil column experiments. The selected sewage molecular markers in this study were six PPCPs including acetaminophen (ACT), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CF), crotamiton (CTMT), diethyltoluamide (DEET), salicylic acid (SA) and three ASs including acesulfame (ACF), cyclamate (CYC), and saccharine (SAC). Results confirmed that ACF, CBZ, CTMT, CYC and SAC were suitable to be used as sewage molecular markers since they were almost stable against sorption and biodegradation process during soil column experiments. In contrast, transport of ACT, CF and DEET were limited by both sorption and biodegradation processes and 100% removal efficiency was achieved in the biotic column.
   Moreover, in this study the effect of different acetate concentration (0-100 mg/L) as an easily biodegradable primary substrate on a removal of PPCPs and ASs was also studied. Results showed a negative correlation (r(2) > 0.75) between the removal of some selected sewage chemical markers including ACF, CF, ACT, CYC, SAC and acetate concentration. CTMT also decreased with the addition of acetate, but increasing acetate concentration did not affect on its removal. CBZ and DEET removal were not dependent on the presence of acetate.
